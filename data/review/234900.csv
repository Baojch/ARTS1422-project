На самом деле, я сначала хотел написать, что считаю несправедливым что метроидваний так много, а зельд мало.

我相当喜欢这个游戏，所以我想挣扎一下…只是多少有些不甘心如此用心且气质独特的作品被埋没。

2013年的游戏，在十周年之际推出了重制版（我在几年前打开玩过一段但好像是碰上了成就bug，重制版把mac的成就问题修了这真的很好！），目前从steam开启游戏的话，选项会默认选择游玩重制版。

显而易见，这不会是一个适合大多数人的游戏——相当有年代感的画面，较弱的引导，意识流的叙事风格，足以排除太多受众了。
但如果愿意用心窥探一下这个光怪陆离的世界，或许就能有一瞬仿若与制作者的心灵碰撞，或许…会深深为之着迷。


[h2]在我看来，《Anodyne》给玩家带来的体验一共能划分为明显的三段： [/h2]

[h3]第一段，游戏的最初部分。[/h3]
正如游戏描述所写，这是一个zelda-lite游戏，虽然模仿的好像是我没玩过的早期zelda作品（）总之，整个游戏的前半部分就是那种很正常的解谜+战斗+探索地牢的奇幻世界观冒险游戏。
[spoiler]lite也是真的lite，一周目慢慢摸索至全探索我只花了5h左右。为了尝试摸一下三小时内100％通关的成就，我开新档再跑了一遍，很多很多失误的情况下也仅用了2h左右，可能不利用bug正常通关的极限时间能压缩到一个半小时甚至一小时之内（）确实是很轻量了。jpg[strike]（用穿墙bug的话我见过最离谱的是十分钟…不过当然是any％ [/strike][/spoiler]

[h3]第二段，开启风车之后。[/h3]
此时也恰好是一周目的一半进度。在此之后解锁的地图，其主题与整体印象，可以说是急转直下。
杀戮，恶意，孤独，堆叠成山的尸体，质疑，悲剧，还有极其精污的8-bit迷宫…但与此同时，也有一些仿若游离在外的部分，有诗，有爱，有共情，有鼓舞，有对生命的讴歌。都是相当支离破碎的思维碎片，就像是在一个人的意识里四处游荡的感觉。相当独特的体验。
硬要用什么来比喻的话，大概就是在玩添加了一些解谜元素和碎片化台词的《梦日记》的感觉。

[h3]第三段，一周目结束之后。[/h3]
此时会解锁交换地图块的能力，可以随心所欲地走到正常的地图之外，探索隐藏区域，收集一些彩蛋道具与剩余的卡片。
——也就是，我最爱的，meta部分！（好耶！）
一般来说披露存在meta内容就已经算是剧透了，但我觉得我必须写出来！因为本作的meta内容作为通关后才解锁的玩法，[b]实在是太容易被错过了。[/b]
我对meta的好像不太确切的理解大致是：显然是在游戏之外的内容，但却也切切实实属于游戏的一部分。也就是说，如果要完整体验游戏的话，这也必定也是不容错过的部分！
嗯…这部分就不做过多剧透了，只能说推荐每个来玩《Anodyne》的朋友们都请一定要亲自尝试一下！这应当才是使其如此经典的原因。[b]如果说第二段的精神旅行似的体验是从心理上模糊了玩家与制作者的界限；那么这一段体验则是将玩家直接拉到了制作者的身边，一边共同胡闹似地“破坏”着游戏，一边像老友一样地饮茶谈心。[/b]


至于游戏的难度或者说门槛我感觉是偏低的。
由于是小体量的游戏，地图不大也不算太复杂，所以将能跑的地方都跑一遍就能轻松全收集（一周目）
解谜的引导其实做得不错，虽然都是较常见的机制但整体的设计与难度曲线的把控都相当的不错。不算有多突出但绝对不是短板。
战斗应该算是偏简单，保存点很密集，主角的血量也给的很富足，基本上除了最终boss由于带点解谜所以初见会比较茫然以外，别的boss都是追着瞎捅就能轻松初见过。但由于部分小怪和boss的奇妙走位，要追求无伤会比较难，但游戏也没做这部分的要求，甚至重制版还提供了使角色无敌的辅助模式可供选择 [spoiler]（我做速通成就时开启了无敌模式，能节省一些时间，也不会影响成就获取。不过事实证明不开启此模式的话，时间也能相当宽裕xd） [/spoiler]
总之，如果对能否获得良好体验有所顾虑的话，至少我的感受是游戏设计相当优秀，游玩体验自然流畅，虽然部分地图有些复杂但苯路痴也没怎么迷路（）只是较弱的引导可能会导致卡关，但四处多跑跑总能找到方向。

最终乱七八糟地写了这些。

The plot is hard to follow, and if it's a parody or send-up of something, I'm not sure what. You're a little dude and you wander around and do some small dungeons in a semi-open world,collecting cards of monsters and characters, 

It wants to be a Zelda clone, but lacks what makes Zelda interesting: polish, fun combat, and design. A slog. Not recommended.

Pros:
- Some interesting puzzles that require real thought to solve.
- Black and White Town is an unnerving reference of the famous Pokemon Lavender Town. I really liked this section.
- Every dungeon has its own unique mechanic, keeps it fresh.

Cons:
- I have no idea what the plot of this game is. What am I missing here?
- Awful combat. You can easily get stun-locked and hurt by wonky hitboxes. Enemy design is bare bones and bosses are either a joke or a headache.
- Very minimal map. You do a lot of backtracking, can get lost easily. Needs to indicate more clearly what that screen contains (such as a blocked path) and where exits are. At least fast travel is here.
- Way too easy to get completely stuck and have no clue where to go. Not fun.
- Navigation in dungeons can be a chore. Lots of one way paths, dead ends, and with a lackluster map you tend to wander far more than you should.
- Levels are thematically chaotic with no clear sense of progression. There's a circus next to a zombie maze. Okay?
- Music is very repetitive and since you'll be wandering a lot, you get to hear it constantly repeat.",1707883898,1707883898,False,0,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False,True,,,

As a gamer with the reflexes of fossilised arthropod when it comes to platforming, I did struggles in some of these sections. However, I think most players would actually enjoy these parts.

Despite its minimalism, the game has a lot of character, with different worlds offering novel environment challenges.

Gameplay wise this is essentially a Zelda game with an exploration-centric postgame. You will like the game if you liked Zelda games, though maybe the postgame isn't as appealing to you fi you're not big into exploration.

Most of the time, I was searching the dungeons and thinking, ""Why am I here again?"" ""Why do I care about the plot?"" ""Wait, what was the plot again?"" ""What even is this?""
Those probably aren't questions you want to ask when you're playing a Zelda clone, but they come up pretty often. 

Enemy design was...quirky. Things would jump into my sprite/hitbox, lock me in place and just kill me out of nowhere. i-frames are non-existent. Luckily, there is no real drawback from dying, so it becomes a massive inconvenience and not a rage-inducing design flaw.

Some of the interstices before the second round of dungeons seemed 100% pointless. Why am I running around slaughtering kids? Why am I running from giant zombies? Why do I care? All good questions without a good answer. 
If there is a deeper meaning to the game, it was never clearly defined. As it stands, it feels more like a joke on the player: we've been tricked into playing a lackluster Zelda clone. A better shaped narrative/story really could have made up for the flaws and lack of depth in the game.

The graphics and sound and a few small bits of dialogue are trying to be dark and artsy and mysterious, but then there's a ton of lame jokes (or attempts at jokes, e.g. 'I bet you're reading a rock because you have no friends') strewn throughout the dialogue, and the plot (if you can call it that) is minimalist to the point of being ridiculous.

The player character is supposed to save 'The Land' (Yes, that's the name of the game world) from 'The Darkness' (What is 'The Darkness'? No clue!), and must protect something called 'The Briar' (No, I have no clue what it's supposed to be either). Later on the player encounters more genius placenames like 'Beach', 'Forest', 'Chasm', and 'Rainy Area'.

It's like the developers took a bunch of stuff from multiple different games and other media and mashed them together in the hopes that it would produce a good game. Specifically: 2D Zeldas like Link's Awakening, the Mother/Earthbound series, Yume Nikki, a little bit of Chrono Trigger (in the form of the hub world, which resembles The End of Time), and what I presume is supposed to be a nod to Ramona Flowers from Scott Pilgrim in the form of a girl randomly showing up on a Bicycle from time to time. Some of you are probably thinking those sound like good things, and they may well be in their original context, but when mixed together without logic or cohesion they're just messy - like putting salt on your cereal.

On the surface it's mechanically similar to a 2D Zelda game - it's tile-based; it has monsters, NPCs, and bosses; it has a sword in the form of a broom - but it completely lacks the charm and structure of a Zelda game. For most of the game the player only has one or two tools, as opposed to usual half-a-dozen different dungeon items one would expect from a Zelda game, which drastically affects how the game plays. (Basically, imagine a 2D Zelda where you spend half the game with only a sword. It isn't very fun.)

Then there's the bigger issue of the player being given just the [i]bare minimum[/i] of direction.

After the first NPC gives the barest of outlines of a plot 'The Darkness is threatening The Briar, go and stop it', the player just wanders out into the world, eventually picks up their weapon (a broom of all things), and goes through the motions of some very basic 2D Zelda obstacles (killing slime monsters to get a key from a chest and opening a road block). After the player eventually stumbles their way to the first temple with only one NPC interraction inbetween (the random girl on a bicycle), they are told to enter the temple but not [i]why[/i] they need to enter the temple, let alone what they're supposed to be looking for.

Along the way the player will pick up some cards, but they won't be told what the cards are for until [i]after[/i] completing the temple, and even then it's just ""the cards are vital to your quest"" without any kind of explanation as to why. (Eventually the player will (the developers hope) figure out of their own accord that the cards can be used to open numbered gates.)

The boss of the temple makes some remark about having been watching the player and telling the player to be careful who they trust, which I presume is supposed to be deep or mysterious, or an attempt at trying to recreate the atmosphere of Link's Awakening (which the game seems to take as its main inspiration - even using one of its lame jokes to paraphrase the ""Windfish in name only, for it is neither"" with ""Village Elder in name only, for he is neither""), but if that's the goal it fails miserably. Sure, it seems mysterious, but at this point the player has little reason to care, let alone worry about who they should be trusting.

The game continues with its lack of direction and increasingly weird and eerie places, but after a while I just couldn't take it anymore and threw in the towel. Without any kind of direction or reason to explore and with so few NPCs to talk to along the way, the world just felt empty and boring, and I couldn't find the will to continue.",1695584242,1695584242,False,1,0,0.403159052133560181,0,True,False,False,True,,,

First of all, they absolutely nailed it with the Link's Awakening style, which is clearly what they were going for here. Exceeded my expectations for a top down Zelda-like. The dungeons were awesome. The story was bizarre but charming, and pretty dark at times. I liked it. Non-generic, and it had those strong indie vibes. And btw, just 2 devs made this, in about a year, and I must say, they did one hell of a job. The pixel art is lovely, and the dialog was done so well that I ended up talking to every NPC multiple times, just to see what all they had to say lol. Of course, that's totally optional, it's not text-heavy by any means, as far as gameplay and progression goes. This is one Zelda-like game that truly stuck to that formula, unlike so many others I've played. There's no life-sim elements, or procedurally-generated dungeons, or any other BS I often see in games that look very Zelda-like, but that's about it. This game looks AND feels extremely Zelda-like, through-and-through, but without being a shameless clone of it. The only reason I didn't rate it 10/10 is bc controller compatibility ain't exactly seamless. It's a bit of a process. Just make sure you enable Steam input before playing, then you have to remap the inputs in options, which will all be assigned to keyboard by default. But there's very few inputs, so it's not a big deal. My Xbox controller felt like overkill tbh. In fact, you could play this game with a basic NES-style controller if you have one. I wish I could play it on an actual GB Color. And I'm definitely gonna buy Anodyne 2 right now. GG",1693106545,1693106545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'd really recommend it to anyone who likes strange games.

This is a pretty major spoiler, so don't read this next part if you don't want to be spoiled on why this game has stuck with me so much.

[spoiler] I had a pretty bland experience through the game. At the end, however, you gain an ability to completely deconstruct the game and everything it stands for. In the post-game, you enter test maps, break out of bounds, and some of the content is only accessible with glitches. I always liked playing with glitches, and breaking out of bounds in games, so having a game that allows you to go even further with that felt surreal. I'm confident it's an intentional effect, and I'm sure the developers had the same fun breaking games that I did, and wanted to encourage that here. It's a very bold and reckless thing to encourage in a game, and I think that bizarre embrace of the fun of deconstructing games like this turns this from an unassuming game into one that captivates me. [/spoiler]

Putting it harshly, I think... a lot of this game I found very bland, sometimes annoying, and even unenjoyable... but I'd still recommend it if you're willing to play through some rough bits for something unique and bold. It's what I like to see in games and I really feel good looking back at this game, I'm really glad I finished it.

游戏的关卡设计和难度设计其实比较差劲，大地图和迷宫中有太多的死路或是回头路又或是大量的无用地图；小怪重复度高且攻击不易躲避；游戏指引性较差，很容易迷路；boss设计算是有趣，可因主角血量太厚导致毫无难度可言。

A little lost at times, with some clever puzzles. Some big dungeons are cool and really play near like a Link’s awakening. In general it’s more based on the atmosphere than on lots of bonuses/objects, and the pace is somewhat contemplative which is exactly what I was looking for.
That said, the game has a few aspects that might or might not feel like shortcomings to you. It is a bit short (no surprise here), The complexity is of course a lot below Zelda: there are only 2 or 3 objects, and the boss fights are easy. The story is a bit sad but more unsettling, even horror-like at times; it might be a bit triggering for some. I liked the spooky atmosphere, but it is not really justified by any context, which make the intent of the authors pretty unclear. For example you can have a boat ride in a merry swamp where you have to hit grumpy frogs, exactly like you could have in any Zelda, and then spooky-horror settings with close to none explanation for why they are here. I preferred the general engagement in Wait - extended, although they are quite different game the kind of atmosphere is comparable, with a lot more content in Wait. Wait felt a LOOOT longer and dense, even though it is probably a bit shorter (well cheking now, I played 5 hr Anodyne and 8 hr Wait, but several of the hours on Wait were probably on pause). Wait is actual horror though, so beware. Wait made me felt uneasy because it’s so engaging, story-rich and you have nothing else to do but think and be scared; and if you play at night your mind starts questioning what reality is. Anodyne is more confusing because the world seems very empty, unfinished and kind of abandoned by its creators. It’s also why it reminds me of Link’s awakening: it can only be a dream in my opinion, though it could be something more sinister.
For me, the story though refreshing compared to most games felt a bit just sketched, unfinished. There are lots of open questions, but I wouldn’t even call them ""mysteries"" since we know so little of anything that nothing really has enough flesh to captivate and ask real questions.
Anyways. Special thumbs up for the ending, which has some impressive moments I wasn’t expecting.
However, I was annoyed with the post-ending. The exploration of the world with the new power doesn’t keep its promises. There is close to nothing to find. I would close the game right after the ending and not try to explore more, you most of the time only end up in emply and buggy screens of developing zones, it’s not worth it. I feel that this feature is superfluous and they yould have removed it.",1682373770,1682373770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

У грі головним завданням гравця є дослідження цього світу, який наповнений різними перешкодами, загадками і монстрами. Гра має чудову графіку в стилі піксельного мистецтва, яка створює особливу атмосферу. Головний герой має набір зброї, що дозволяє йому вбивати монстрів і розгадувати загадки.

Одним з головних плюсів гри є її унікальна атмосфера, яку створює музика та графіка. Також, Anodyne має цікаві локації, загадки і багато діалогів, що додають грі глибину і цікавість. Однак, деякі гравці можуть знайти гру трохи надто легкою та короткою.

У загальному, Anodyne - це чудова гра, яка підходить для тих, хто любить фентезі і пригоди з невеликими елементами головоломок.

その退屈なマップをひたすら歩いて様々なキャラクター等に出会いますが、哲学的などうでも良い自分語りをするだけで、ストーリーらしいものはありません。不思議な世界観をプレイヤーの想像力で楽しんでくださいというスタイルです。全然面白くも何ともありませんでした。

そして、こういう退屈な散策も至る所に出て来る宝箱から胸が躍るアイテムでも出れば多少は楽しめたかもしれませんが、基本的に出てくるのは鍵かキャラクターの絵が描いたカードです。武器はホウキのみです。

何の魅力もないカードをひたすら退屈なマップを収集するだけのゲームです。

The first thing that immediately grabs you about this game is its pixel art style, which is by turns beautiful, surreal, and unnerving. There are multiple levels in this game where it's a joy just to take in all the imagery, the cute and cuddly sprites, and of course, the soundtrack (which matches the art style perfectly). 

The gameplay here is probably the biggest weak point, and ranges from mindless fun to genuinely tedium. I may just be a whiny bitch who doesn't know how to play video games, but passing multiple levels hinges on guessing how to use a new mechanic you've never encountered before (without any hints or instructions). The payoff is huge when you actually get it without any help, but it also yields a [b]lot [/b] of frustration. That being said, I think there's actually intent behind the game's repetitive tendencies, and it revolves around the narrative themes of depression, purposelessness, and self-doubt. 

The writing in this game is interesting, and likely plays off the gameplay's tendency to bore. It's definitely surrealist, which occasionally seems like an excuse for vague, noncommittal writing. More often than not, though, [i]Anodyne[/i] has an knack for disturbing or even existential atmospheres. These moments of dread, sadness, or reflection often come out of nowhere, but the game's slower or more repetitive levels are what makes this kind of reflection possible, making space in your mind for thoughts that would be blocked out by adrenaline in a faster-paced game. Much of the writing in [i]Anodyne[/i] is almost aphoristic, and some of the one-liners stick are genuinely provocative and now live rent-free in my subconscious. Examples include, ""Peripheral vision is the hive of demons"" and ""We are born into the decay of our mothers body."" 

Ultimately, I think [i]Anodyne[/i]'s storytelling succeeds because it allows you to impose your own life experiences onto the symbolism of Young's subconscious. Not every ""scene"" or level lands perfectly, but the beauty lies in little, unanticipated moments. The nightmarish nihilism of the Red Dungeon, or the themes of self-harm hidden in Youngtown. The self-aware loneliness of ""Space,"" and the reflective despair of ""BLUE.""

I love the world, the characters, and the unnerving atmosphere. I love the soundtrack too. As far as presentation, its fantastic, and it singehandedly saved the game for me. I played the entire 6 hour experience in a single day. It takes a lot for a game to hold my attention like this.

The game manages to do a TON with it's simple combat system, and implements a lot of cool puzzles that build upon themselves and get progressively more difficult without ever feeling too unfair. I enjoyed the boss fights as well.

This game was made in less than a year by a 2 person team, and the results are about as good as they possibly could be.

However, I definitely have some grievances. Combat is just sloppy and annoying in a lot of situations. There were a lot of moments where the enemies and hazards are nearly impossible to avoid with any consistency leading to you getting knocked around all over the place.

The problem isn't that the game is difficult, in fact, your health bar is so huge that it takes effort or complete incompetency to die in most situations. Even the most annoying enemies in the game can just be brute forced because of how frequently enemies drop health refills.

The puzzles are fun, but often not thought out well enough. You can cheese your way past a lot of puzzles by abusing the jump button. I was never quite sure if you were SUPPOSED to be able to jump across 2 block gaps, but you can if you time it just right and in a few situations it led to me sequence-breaking and occasionally getting softlocked.

I love the narrative design, lots of genuinely novel ideas and surprising moments. Love the music. Art's serviceable if not charming at best.

But I really don't like the core loop very much.

Dungeon hazards are super annoying and the jump doesn't make it much easier to deal with them. Enemies are no reward and hence never worth dealing with. Broom mechanics fun-ish but never developed very far. There's tons of tedious movement on the overworld that even slightly more thought to shortcut building (you gave me a jump ffs, use it) would've greatly reduced. I like the cards but not enough of an overall reward to carry me either. The map is often downright unhelpful.

有些游戏企图给予我们精神上的自由。制作人们树立规则和边界，把生活的严肃性消解，于是“万物皆允”；却谨慎地盖上薄纱，防止玩家们掀起图像和文本叩问界限。玩家与制作者的双向奔赴是迷人的诅咒，如果制作者最终选择了保留，我们就会得到《梦日记》；如果制作者展现过多，我们会得到《新手指南》，又或者三岛由纪夫的《假面告白》，玩家变成急躁的解读者，把主人公和作者视作同一人。
所以《镇痛》使我想到《C†C》，世界与主人公无限遥远却无比亲切。无比宁静、孤独。

我也许能告诉你，主人公叫杨（Young），名字谐音荣格（Jung）。杨不是一个精神病患者。
我也许能告诉你，《镇痛》的世界就是杨的世界。那是来之不易的东西：游戏里一切从最自然简约的方式出发，包括那套“塞尔达”的玩法。你是富有意识的玩家。
也许孤独不是阶梯，而是延绵不断的平行路，你在《镇痛》的世界里茫无头绪地一直走，直到杨的道路变成你的道路，杨的思考变成你的思考。陌生的事物会近在咫尺，你把它们做成卡片，插入回忆的卡槽；你与它们有一搭没一搭地聊天，因为最深刻的对话是与自己的对话。语言是最好的镇痛剂。

除此之外，我就没有什么可说的了。《镇痛》是薄薄的一层，只剩下轻轻响起的OST，比如Anodyne、Fields、Cliffs、Understanding（BV1jg41137SD），就像《C†C》的结尾只有久久的蝉鸣。这里没有某种“意义”，因为意义必然在世界之外。这里只有音无彩名了。

英文评测区有点把我惹急了。他们宣称是进来找“游戏”的。我越往下翻看越感到奇怪，他们除了“塞尔达”以外还找到了更多“塞尔达”，就像鲁迅家门前除了枣树还有一颗枣树。现在我们把《镇痛》开除游戏籍吧。

This game is 10 years old now from the beginning of its development, and will officially be 10 years old from release next year, and it was one of the first major wave of indies, alongside Shovel Knight and Super Meatboy, from back when Steam did its own curation. By tje standards of today's indies, it comes of as rather quaint when we have games like Hyper Light Drifter, Unsighted, and Blossom Tales just to name a few, however it is still worth playing , especially if you're interested in the library of these particular developers.

Anodyne is a top down action adventure game much like one of the 2D Zelda games, however this game is significantly simpler in terms of mechanics. Your only weapon and tool for the entire game is a broom with which you can use to attack enemies and relocate piles of dust to solve environmental puzzles and use as makeshift rafts to traverse bodies of water. Apart from that the only other upgrade you get are jumping shoes that allow you to platform, which is pretty wonky given the perspective and the obstacles thrown at you at times. The only way in which you are gated is by collecting trading cards of the sprites in the game, each of which contains a small blurb about... something. Collecting enough of these will allow you to pass through gates requiring certain numbers of them and access deeper parts of the world, and collecting all of them will allow you to see the game's true ending.

It doesn't sound like much, but because this game has so few mechanics, the pacing is really quick and the runtime of the game is really brief being 5-10 hours depending on if you're going for 100% or not. Plus, the lack of complex mechanics allowed for more focus on environments and mining the simple mechanics for what they're worth. Not all of it works, and there are definitely areas which feel awkward and antiquated. Most of the game however is perfectly playable and still engaging even after all this time.

The story is nothing much to speak of. Instead of going for a straightforward storyline, like all of Analgesic's future titles, this game goes for abstraction and meta allusions and humor. It's probably for the best with one's first game as it fuels further thought and analysis, keeping people thinking about it, however it doesn't give the most satisfying conclusion. It feels more like a cloudy look into the thoughts of the developer rather than a legit game world with a story to it, which I'm just not a fan of. Having a solid throughline to carry the spacy ideas and tie everything together with central themes is something I much prefer and something the sequel, Anodyne 2 excels at in addition to various gameplay improvements.

As I said in the beginning, Anodyne is the first game of the developers, and that's something I don't necessarily hold against it, but it's hard not to be biased when each game they've made has been an improvement over the last one. I appreciate this game as an early venture from them and I appreciate that they used it as a jumping off and a learning experience from which to make even better games. It is still perfectly fine in its own right and for those that enjoy this particular genre of game, it's an interesting and simplified diversion from other games like this.",1651166402,1651166402,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Beat it and got 4/6 achievements (100%'d outside of getting all the cards and speedrunning) in 5 hours and 45 minutes using a keyboard.  Difficulty is Medium.  

Controls - It tells me in the beginning that I can use my controller, but fooling around with getting the controller set up didn't seem to work for me.  I decided hitting space and using the keyboard was the easiest route with controls.  The buttons are easy enough to figure out.  There's additionally a window pre-game saying 'click arrows to resize screen', but I skipped that with space and it auto-resized to fill the screen anyway. 

Movement - Had no problem getting around the map, attacking baddies, dodging things, and talking to people.  

Story - Buhhh.............  I guess?  What happened?  

Music - retro rpg. I really liked most of the ost.  Some was creepy.  Some was earwormy.  Some made it surreal.

Gameplay - You'll spend most of the game wandering around exploring in an acid-tripping retro world that reminded me of one part original Zelda and one part Earthbound.  Between the map and portals, it's easy to stay on track with where you have and haven't been with a few exceptions (a certain circus maze comes to mind).  

Variety - Tons of different enemies and bosses, though many of the bosses were too easy to beat. 

Achievements - There are 6 achievements total.  Two are harder to get. 



I played Anodyne in three 2Hr sessions.  The first time I couldn't get into it and didn't know wtf was going on or why I should keep playing.  The second time I got a general sense of the map and played for the sake of exploring, finding bosses, and seeing where the game was going to take me.  The third time I gave up trying to understand things and played for the fun of the dungeons, 100%ing things, and finding at least 36 of the cards - and by then I was really enjoying myself.    This game isn't going to knock your socks off.  There's no great over-arching story with warring nations or any grand powerups that turn the game on its head (outside of maybe jumping).  There is a surreal experience to be had, amusing levels, and wayward blurbs of contemplative ideas smudged into a blob of what might be a story that I can't for the life of me sort out.  Is it a bad game?  I didn't like it in the beginning because I couldn't get immersed in what was going on or comprehend Young's motives, but it's not a bad game.  After chewing on it for an evening or two, I ended up growing to enjoy the experience.  So it's an OK game.

The bad: The controls are counterintuitive but can be remapped, I recommend enter->attack shift->jump WASD move. Collision boxes are vague and not pixel-perfect, and this is the source of most of my damage. You're often backtracking without a clear goal, and the labyrinthine levels make this tedious. New mechanics just suddenly appear without introduction, and feel like dead ends to unlock later. Many obstacles require insanely fast reflexes, and unclear visual cues had me walking into many enemies thinking they were friendly. Several hits are not ""fair,"" including a checkpoint in a room full of enemies and more than one cutscene moment.

The good: The boss fights are quite fun, and are very well done. Once you realize you're dealing with a puzzle and not a dead end, they're fun challenges. I really appreciated not being led by the hand, and treated like I have never used a computer before. NPCs have witty dialogue, and the world building was amazing. Nothing really felt 'forced,' and the area theming looked great. The nether gate area is laid out in the same orientation as the maps they represent, so finding those were easy.

What I would change: Enemies need more clear visual cues, and more crisp hitboxes and clearer dangerous/not states. Better use of coloration would make enemies more clear to make it more clear who's friendly. New game mechanics need more prominent introductions, and a more sequential or clearer set of directions to follow would make the mazes more entertaining.",1643490924,1643490924,False,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Let's face it, RPGs with Zelda-type gameplay are a dime a dozen;  however, as with any RPG, tedious gameplay can be forgiven if the story is worth the playthrough. Anodyne, despite not looking like much, is one of the better indie RPGs...ever.

In many ways, the game is similar in spirit to undertale, however where undertale is direct, Anodyne is subtle and understated. There are countless indie RPGs with nothing really to say, where a threadbare plot is often hidden behind cryptic delivery, but here there is actual meaning. Anodyne is in some ways a meta-game, but wheras Doki Doki Literature Club was just a gussied-up creepypasta, Anodyne is legitimately thoughtful, and in some ways, rather heartbreaking.

Old-school graphics and chiptunes were as omnipresent as the mature themes and alienating experiences that accompanied them; a young Toby Fox taught us to love again; and Steam was, as ever, raking in the moolah. But while the likes of [i]Undertale[/i], [i]Hotline Miami[/i], and [i]Papers, Please[/i] went on to critical acclaim, [i]Anodyne[/i] did not. And perhaps that's what I found so nostalgic about this game, the sense that it remains a time capsule of a brief era, stubbornly perambulating in circles while its peers have long since moved on.

It's very clearly an early effort by a small development team, but that lends it a certain charm. The story and writing is strange and obtuse, but not really intriguing enough that I felt I had to learn more, and at worst coming off as pretentious. Theming dungeons around hotels, apartments and circuses is interesting, though possibly the constant change in scenery is too eclectic for the game's own good. Many of the jokes fell flat, though there were a couple that made me chuckle. The gameplay is simple but quite fun, though for many it might seem too repetitive. The post-game content is based around a very interesting concept, but comes with a frustrating flaw. It's a game of near misses, and there's something oddly compelling about that.

If I was to recommend this game, I'd say get it during a sale, and play at least until you reach the windmill. The music and visuals of that scene alone sold me on the experience and the time I invested in it.",1640908957,1660209466,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The exploration is nice! there are a lot of daungeons and they are all themed in a very different way.
The story may be consufing but it's not super hard to understand (it's pretty much a trip inside the protagonist mind)
The cons is that it does not offer a lot of playtime. I finished it in around 5h and i collected everything i could before end game.
Endgame contect has an intresting idea but at the end it just collecting the last few cards remaining and some other little thing nothing to intresting.

Have you ever lost a friendship? Worried about the distance between you and another person? Wondered what someone really meant to you, and what you were supposed to do about it? And along the way, started to wonder what your place was in the world, and how the things you see around you got that way? 

I do not relate to the reviews stating they felt there was no point to the game or that it was confusing. The game is about a 20something delving into his subconscious to process an event or relationship he has experienced. Along the way we are treated to snippets of his worldview, memories, neuroses and fixations. 

There is no overarching moral to the story (thank god) - there are speeches here and there, and some obvious metaphors, but at the end of the day it is about Young's long think. In Zelda fashion there is no postgame, but the significance of that is inverted: instead of our Link's existence starting and ending with his mission, it's more about the world of Anodyne itself, with Young's subconscious only relevant so far as he needs something from it.  Very meta, since Young is controlled by the player who spends 7 or 8 hours in the world of the game then emerges to the rest of their life. 

Indeed there is something fitting (and deeply sad) about the entire world being inside Young's head. Unlike Yume Nikki, which feels tinged by the alien and paranormal, it's pretty clear who is an introjection of what (e.g. a scolding boss who condescends to Young is probably a schoolteacher mixed with a parent, some adult authority figure) and that none of this is *supernatural* per se, it's just vividly psychological. The dungeons, mazes, puzzles, and enemies Young faces are all manifestations of his ruminations or anxieties, and likewise, Sage, the Briar, and Mitra, are manifestations of inner voices or people important to him. 

With this in mind, the tonal whiplashes reflect a stream of consciousness, flitting back and forth between memories, musings, and paranoias. The broad range of environments, topics covered, and moods, similarly reflects a person's full range of interiority - after all, our lives are everything we experience, plus how we think and feel about that. As someone who spends a lot of time inside their head, to the point of preferring imaginary conversations over real relating, Anodyne being one long game of ""Young talks to himself"" is resonantly and painfully lonely. 

The ""fakeness"" of Anodyne is what makes it feel refreshingly real. That everything is set in a layer of existence removed from the base layer of Young's waking life mirrors the way the player experiences the game as a step removed from the base layer of their own personal reality, allowing Young's worries to bleed past the scope of the game itself. Exposed to, say, characters jumping to their deaths, it feels less like ""Well these people are dying in front of me to set the tone of this videogame"", and more, ""Wow, our world is a pretty messed up place where this kind of thing happens."" 

Young's ruminations are our ruminations. In terms of graphics and gameplay, the refusal of immersion engages the strongest reality-maker: our metaphorical understanding. Young's world really exists - in the mind of some troubled zillenial out there.

The graphics are tight, the paletting carries the art direction and ensures that no level, prop, or character feels out of place. The music is extraordinarily effective. The writing, mostly in the form of flavor text on items, signposts, etc, is charming and wistful and sometimes so mundane and kitchen-sink that it smacked me in the face. Overall despite some wonkiness with controls, the game has the image of a polished, professional production, and it's really impressive to me that Anodyne's creators were still university students at the time. 

While lacking specified commentary or concrete suggestion for the real world, Anodyne offers companionship - ""I worry about this stuff too."" Something I've always struggled with when it comes to playing or making games is *escapism*. Every game, no matter how high-minded, practical, or moralizing, is ultimately a diversion from everyday life. Anodyne makes that its strength. Here is an escape from reality about escape from reality. The painful, melancholy world of the inner mind is made beautiful, nostalgic, somewhere you can even take refuge. It's okay to stay here, solving puzzles in your subconscious. You can stay until you're done figuring them out.

Два года назад. В общем, пора уже закрыть этот бэклог, пока плесень на нём не потребовала независимости!

Anodyne — очень странный предмет. Одной ногой игра плотно увязла в сюрреализме, построенном на чередовании никак не связанных между собой локаций и общей абсурдности творящегося действа, а другой — прочно держится за своё видеоигровое нутро и не превращается в очередной интерактивный перфоманс, вышедший из барбершопа. Но насколько этот геймплей стоит того, чтобы тратить на него время?

Сами разработчики идентифицируют свою игру как «The Legend of Zelda на минималках», это же им вторят и рецензенты, — однако, как мне кажется, такое описание ей не очень подходит. В целом, Anodyne создаёт впечатление эдакого сборника головоломок в открытом мире, где вы в первую очередь расколупываете логику построения местных комнат, а сражения с монстрами получаете как бы на сдачу.

У вас по сути кроме верной метёлки, выступающей в роли оружия, нет никаких дополнительных методов взаимодействия с миром; даже прыжки и те открываются где-то в середине пути, напоминая таким образом, что пора бы пройтись по старым локациям и поискать новые пути для продвижения. Ну, и куда без боссов, которые хоть и бывают довольно интересными, но всё же страдают от общей топорности здешней боёвки. Финальный злодей, впрочем, заставил меня откатиться к чекпоинту раз двадцать...

А вот смысловую подноготную творящегося сюра я не понял. Совсем.

アクション部分には文句なし。

謎解き要素を控えめに、アクションの難易度をぐっと上げたゼルダの伝説。アクションゲームとしての完成度を見た場合、インディーゲームとしてはかなり出来が良い。出来ることは箒による攻撃動作と（少し進めてからできるようになる）ジャンプのみ、謎解き用のアイテムも金の概念さえもないシンプルな構成ではあるが、先に進むにつれて激しくなるボス戦はシンプル操作が故にプレイヤースキルを問う形になっており、確かな成長を実感できるものだ。ラスボスは他より難易度が高めで、多少の慣れが必要になるか。
物足りなく感じたのはストーリー部分。
無意識が生み出した夢を思わせる抽象的世界を冒険するゲームだと銘打たれている以上、曖昧で断片的な情報から詳細を想像するしかないことは最初から想像できていた。それは確かな事実であり、また作中を彩るBGMは安心と不安の狭間を行き来するような曲調で「そういう世界観作り」は非常に上手くできていたと思う。
ただし、台詞とカード、石から読み取れる情報ではあまりに不足が過ぎており、ストーリーの全容がまったく把握できなかった。結局主人公であるヤングとボスたちが敵対する理由はなんなのか、目的はなんなのか、無意識の世界で何をどうしているのかが理解できないまま、なんとなく良い終わりを迎えられたのだろうという予感だけでゲームが終わってしまった。

全体としては良いのだが、手放しで褒めるほど最高かというとそうではない感じ。

The last dungeon could use some refinements imo. I haven't played the other game this one is heavily inspired by along with Zelda A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, so my closest frame of reference (along with the Zeldas) was EarthBound, actually, because of some themes, the general creepiness and the gorgeous soundtrack. The soundtrack, btw, while awesome, could hook us a little bit more. It's not bad by any stretch, but it could be catchier - being catchy is not bad and I'm sure the composer would be able to deliver. As for what the soundtrack actually delivers, I can't truly complain. The whole mood of the game is very well accompanied by its music. The pixel art is also very beautiful. Great game overall.

On a separate note, I wish indie developers would hire professionals to translate their games. In games such as this one, it's either a perfect translation or none at all. The Brazilian Portuguese translation is far from the worst I've seen (for many games it would qualify as good enough), but there are many errors - some big, some small - that end up detracting the experience. I know it's not a cheap nor an easy job, but non-professional translations hurt these games more than they help them.

Sabe aquela sensação de que parece que o jogo está escondendo algo de ti? Como se existisse uma barreira tênue entre a realidade do jogo em que o personagem vivencia, porém com uma cortina de fumaça que esconde uma verdade maior por trás?

Então, Anodyne é isso! Assim como outras análises apontaram, ele lembra muito aqueles games do Legend of Zelda antigos, principalmente Link's Awakening (tem até um personagem que usa roupas parecidas com o Link, e ele corta arbustos para ganhar dinheiro, o diferencial é que ele tem uma barba, provavelmente pra fugir de um possível c&d da grande Nintendo), mas misturado com alguns elementos de estranheza apresentado em JRPGs como Yume Nikki, OFF e afins.

O jogo conta a história de Young, um ser humaninho que tem que ir desvendando os mistérios por trás do mundo dos sonhos do seu próprio subconsciente, sendo guiado pelo Sábio da Vila (que curiosamente não é tão sábio e nem faz parte de nenhuma vila), e de Mitra, uma garota aventureira acompanhada de sua fiel bicicleta, Wares.

Como já comentei, é um jogo incomum que provoca estranheza, porém conta com alguns momentos bem legais de humor, como a da arma do protagonista ser apenas uma vassoura.

Outro ponto interessante é que o jogo apresenta cartas que você pode adquirir (36 são necessárias para chegar na área final do jogo), e cada uma consta uma mensagem que pode revelar um ponto da personalidade de Young (tal como uma que pergunta se ele gosta dos seus [b] nentendos[/b]) ou, em outros casos, tem uma mensagem críptica (tal como um chefão falando que [b] sempre que Young estiver sozinho, ele estará lá com ele[/b]. 

[i] Fazendo um breve side-track, eu curto muito esse estilo de narrativa, pois pense bem, se alguém te faz uma ameaça como ""Toma cuidado, hein"", ""Olha por cima dos ombros"" e afins, tudo bem, você pode ficar preocupado, talvez achar zoado e tudo mais... porém, se alguém chega para ti e fala [b]""Os mortos choram sobre o brilho da Lua pálida""[/b], você com certeza vai ficar MUITO mais tenso! Um belo exemplo disso se encontra [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60YqA8LWBQs] neste vídeo[/url], onde o cara chama um número e começa falando de boa com uma garota até assustar ela com a palavra ""REQUIEM"" e desligando na cara! [/i]

O final do jogo não explica muito, porém dá a entender de que O Briar possui uma grande importância para Young, e o jogo conta nada de forma explícita. As vezes isso pode ser caracterizado como design preguiçoso porém, para este jogo, somado com a forma com que o todo é apresentado, deixa a experiencia muito melhor, aberta à interpretação. Em suma, é uma experiência única que deve ser aproveitada por pessoas que curtem aqueles belos joguinhos surrealistas de RPG Maker.

I start the game and am greeted with a message saying I need to resize the window using the arrow keys so that no excess black pixels were present. I thought this was a bit unusual to say the least.. alas, i had not yet realized that this would set the tone for every other aspect of the game.

After resizing, it told me it detected a controller and would I wish to use it, I would have to configure it first. So i try to configure but to no avail. It would detect none of my button presses (this is an official xbox one controller btw). Puzzled, i try a second controller, which also does not register anything whatsoever.

Getting frustrated, I decide to skip the configuration and just play on keyboard instead. There, we immediately discover the highly impractical layout of arrow keys for moving, c for attack, x for ""?????"" which is also used as a cancel button for the map/menu, and ENTER to access your menu which displays the map and some other info. Since the enter key is so far away from x & c, i decided to map it to a key that my left hand could comfortably use.

Going into the controls menu, I accidentally press the left arrow key, which is actually the button used to start remapping all of the keys. Unaware that i'm already mapping keys, i try to press the down and up arrow keys to try and highlight the correct key. Obviously this totally fucked up my controls and i decided to alt F4 before it could save my control scheme. Restarting the game and going back to the controls menu, I read ""Press left to change controls. space to cancel"" Both very odd keys to press for the actions they do, but fine, i remap them and am FINALLY ready to play this shitty game.

Getting to the creme de la creme, i quickly find out that the gameplay is boring, the graphics are ugly, the soundtrack is... well, it's a freaking joke. The dialogue tries to be funny but it really isn't. And truthfully, the dialogue is probably the best thing this game's got going for it. Which REALLY isn't a good thing.

I reached the first dungeon and decided to off myself. It gave me the choice of continuing or not. I promptly said no thanks and it booted me to.. not to the main menu, but to a room with some awkwardly placed furniture and a chest. Confused as to why i'm still controlling my character, I move to the next room. However my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to know what was in that chest, so I go back to the previous room I was in. However upon going through the door. The game fades to black and NOW i'm in the main menu.

Seriously, wtf?? What did I just play?

TLDR:
- Gameplay is boring.
- Graphics are ugly.
- Sound design is a joke.
- Control scheme is confusing, impractical, and inconsistent.
- Controller support does not seem to work whatsoever.
- Dialogue scrolls very slow and very annoyingly.

It's a strange game, and words really fail to describe it.

This game has a native Linux build! Sorta...
To run it, you'll need Adobe AIR, a long-since discontinued Adobe application runtime. The Windows build is bundled with AIR, and honestly, it might be easier to run it in WINE/Proton these days.

The obstacles I was faced with did not seem to grow particularly more interesting, neither did the kit I was tasked with conquering these obstacles using.
In a Zelda-styled game you would generally receive items that would allow you to interact with the world in a new way so that a commonly retreaded overworld can be slowly opened up to the player. Even in the first Zelda game the main objective was fairly clear, and the entire game world outside of dungeons was actually a manageable size so you could learn it after a few hours. This game instead features a ton of areas where each room is mostly without any features of interest, instead of upgrading the player's abilities the game locks areas behind gates that either require specific keys or for the player to have gathered a set number of collectibles. Beating a boss and receiving a card with a picture of the boss on it is not satisfying to me.

I went in with blank expectations and was genuinely surprised. The gameplay is notably simple, but it deceptively takes on complexity as the game progresses. Each area is relatively similar from a mechanical standpoint, but the music, visuals, enemies, and level designs all come together to give each one a unique atmosphere. Collecting cards based on NPCs and enemies throughout isn't terribly rewarding, but knowing that retrieving more cards will inevitably net you access to max health upgrades, new abilities, and new areas gives them meaning. You also get charming little card descriptions with each one, and although they don't add anything to the gameplay, they do teach you a bit about the story and the world you're in.

The only arguable downside to this game is the story, as it depends what you're looking for going into this game. If you want a very direct game where your mission, your intentions, and the intentions of all of the characters are understandable and laid out for you, this is NOT the game for you. That being said, if you're looking for an abstract, ambiguous, and thought-provoking experience that you'll have to piece together and figure out yourself, you'll LOVE the story.

Exploring the various places is fun, but sometimes you can get lost, confused, and the map isn't the most helpful. That's a negative.
Meanwhile the fighting is solid, yet challenging.

Ein Mann, ein Besen und jede Menge Staub!

[b]Gameplay[/b]
„Anodyne“ gibt sich sehr viel Mühe, den Charme der alten „Legend of Zelda“-Spiele einzufangen. Klappt das? Ja, sehr gut! In 16Bit Manier erkunden wir die abwechslungsreiche Spielwelt, bekämpfen mit einem simplen Kampfsystem Monster und lösen Rätsel in den Dungeons. „Anodyne“ lebt mitunter wohl auch davon, dass man ständig die Augen aufhalten muss und neue Spielmechaniken ohne große Erklärungen, aber doch sinnvoll ins Spiel eingefügt werden. Ziel des Spiels ist das Sammeln von genügend Spielkarten, die sich überall in der Welt befinden und sich in beliebiger Reihenfolge einsammeln lassen. Die Spielzeit für einen Durchlauf ist mit 8 Stunden dabei vielleicht übermäßig lang, dafür bleibt das Spiel durch ständige Veränderung allerdings sehr frisch und zieht sich nicht.

[b]Story[/b]
Die Geschichte ist schwer zu fassen. Als Auserwählter kriegen wir den Auftrag eines Magiers, die Karten zu sammeln und so zum „Briar“ vorgelassen werden zu können. Unterwegs treffen wir allerdings noch verschiedene Charaktere, die ganz nett auftreten. Besonders gut hat mir allerdings das Leveldesign nicht nur aufgrund des Gameplays gefallen, sondern auch wegen den einzigartigen Thematiken. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2362998432

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Lasst euch von der „simplen“ 16Bit Grafik nicht täuschen: „Anodyne“ ist nicht einfach hingeklatscht, sondern liebevoll strukturiert. Aber natürlich muss man den Retro-Stil mögen. Wirklich wundervoll ist zu der 16Bit Grafik die 16Bit Musik, die einfach wundervoll ist. Ich habe mir den Soundtrack sogar extra nochmal besorgt.

[b]Fazit[/b]
„Anodyne“ ist ein wundervolles Zelda-like Spiel, dass jedoch nicht nur kopiert. Stattdessen wirken die beiden Entwickler hier sehr inspiriert und machen ihr eigenes Ding, dass auch mit dem Original mithalten kann. „Anodyne“ ist wohl der Inbegriff eines Indietitels und ich kann es wirklich jedem ans Herz legen, der einfach mal einen schlauen Titel spielen möchte. Mittlerweile gibt es übrigens auch [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/877810/Anodyne_2_Return_to_Dust/]Anodyne 2[/url], dass allerdings eine andere Richtung einschlägt.

It straddles the line between Zelda-style action and exploration and a surreal existentialist haze. The problem I have with it, though, is that it's boring.

I see plenty of people praising this because it's like the classic Zelda. Except the original Zelda had a ton of different items. It had money that you could use to buy new equipment and supplies. It had a robust roster of enemies. It had catchy music. It had fast-paced, challenging game play that was augmented by its items and equipment. Anodyne has none of that. Was the original Zelda directionless? Yes. Was it horribly vague at times, especially when it came to finding walls to bomb? Yes. But there were so many resources back in the day to help you out: Nintendo Power, unofficial strategy guides, tip lines: it was vague but you could still beat it. And people tend to forget the reason so many of those games from that era were so vague was due to the hardware limitations. 

Anodyne, after two hours of playing, left me feeling like I was still waiting for a game to begin. Screen after screen with nothing in it. Maze-like paths that led to the same place. Bland environments. Enemies and puzzles that offered no challenge. And man are the tonal shifts bad. Sometimes I could tell it wanted to be like Earthbound with its bizarre humor. Then I travel through a whirlpool formed by a man I killed into a bloodsoaked nightmare realm and perform...an abortion? It was all over the place and it didnt create an engaging experience.

If you want a Zelda-style action game, go play Hyper Light Drifter. Go play 3D Dot Game Heroes. If you want an Earthbound or Undertale clone, find something other than Anodyne.

As for pros & cons, I really liked how the game managed to replicate the Zelda feel of unique dungeons while letting the player use only two items- where the uniqueness in the dungeon is how the player's broom can interact with the environment, creating rafts of dust, clogging airways so you can walk past them, angering maids and so on.
That being said, the game's weakpoint lies in its level layouts. Levels are far too open, leaving the player with tons of downtime walking between rooms or backtracking- and despite this, there's plenty of areas where I got myself stuck by going past a one way door only to find a locked door on the other side before I had found a key. Creating an environment that allowed the player to circle through it naturally without having to use the ""return to entrance"" button in the pause menu would've created a much more fluid experience.

And, unlike similar surreal experiences like Off or Space Funeral, that atmosphere is backed up by its competent exploration gameplay. It doesn't do anything particular unique, but I find this blend of dungeon crawling and creepy vibes to be weirdly cozy, relaxing, even.

Anodyne somehow manages to feel mysterious and distant and deeply personal at the same time. It presents itself like some sort of obscure, unknowable game buried within your memories, yet it is also clearly a labor of love between two hard-working game developers.

First off: If you have a weird story, sure, that's fine, some of us love that stuff. But when it's just RANDOM stuff you type out that has no meaning to anyone but yourselves, nobody is going to get it. And after a while, the player isn't going to care either. Allergies or not. 

Secondly: If your game relies on backtracking, make it more obvious where the player is set to go next. A small text indicating ""I better make it to the big mountains"" is enough. Seriously, without that, your player will do a bit of your exploration and then tire because there's no semblance of connection to anything in the game. It's hard to enjoy a game when it starts feeling like a job you know?

Third and final: IF your game contains jumping, for the love of all things holy, get your jumping mechanics on point. The reason I quit this game was that there's an area in this game that's just one pit fall room after another. And at that point, I asked myself ""Am I really having fun here?"" .. and then I started thinking back on the other points I mentioned and realized that no, I'm not having fun.

うーん...。
前評判が良くて期待しすぎたせいなのか、自分にはあまり合わなかったです。

クリアはしたし、製品は良いものだとは思うし、
面白くなかったわけではないけれど、人にはおすすめしないかも。
だからサムズダウン。


・良かった点
マップデザインが素晴らしい。探査しがいがあって色んな箇所に行きたくなる。
（私のモチベーションは、ほとんどがこれでした。）

プレイヤースキルを求められているようだけれど、セーブポイントが多くてストレス無く進むこと。


・おすすめする人
ibや青鬼などRPGツクールで遊んでいた人たち。
子どもではないけれどオトナでもない、中高生に合うのかもしれない。

インディー感。学生(大学生)2人が作ったゲーム、というところに反応する人。
白昼夢。ぼーっとした心地。に興味ある人におすすめなのかも。


・良くなかった点
全般を通して雰囲気ゲーム、陰鬱な印象（比較的、明るめのステージも有る）。

支離滅裂な前後の繋がり。ストーリーは、有って無いような印象を受ける。
気になっていたことも、思わせぶりな謎として置いてあるだけで解決するわけではないです。

一部、ほこり設置の移動操作性が悪い（自分の環境だけなのかも）。


・特徴や思ったこと
BGMは先を知りたい不穏な雰囲気に合ってるとも思うけれど、
未完成という印象の方が残ってしまいました。

序盤は退屈な感じ。出来ることが増えて楽しくなってきたけれども、少々苦痛。
ストーリーは曖昧過ぎてモチベーションは色あせていった。
ゆめにっきが比較に出されていて自分も似ていると思ったけれど、
（語弊があるけれど）ゆめにっきの、いつプレイヤーを裏切り刺しに（脅かしに）くるかもしれないというのとは方向性が別物と感じた。ただただ不穏で若干、不気味なだけ。
だから退屈に感じたのかも。

登場人物の特徴的なセリフ回しは好みが分かれるのかな。
優しいセリフ回しは鎮痛剤のようで、その意味でmotherっぽかった。その点は好みでした。
しかし、誰も謎めいていながら何も無い感覚は白昼夢っぽいというか、ストレス虚無というか。

ゲーム概要の""Mash Those Buttons""の説明文に
「本作からは「ゲーム・オブ・ジ・イヤー」の強烈なオーラが見える」とあるけれども、
それに対しては、私は酷く、とても、疑問符が浮かびます。

でもエンディングを見たら、ひとまず満足できました。

Трэш — знакомиться с игрой рекомендуется исключительно тем, кто в диком восторге от описания, скриншотов и продолжительности. Остальным, из контакта с этой игрой, только тыкать палкой, как какашку на дороге.
 
Так себе — в основном, эта игра предлагает меньше, чем вы увидите из описания и скриншотов. Рекомендуется только тем, кому вышеперечисленные критерии окажутся «зашибись».

Нормальная — неплохая игра своего жанра. Сами судите по описанию, скриншотам и продолжительность. Игра, примерно, соответствует своему наполнению. 
 
Хорошая — весьма неплохой представитель своего жанра. Многие могут найти тут «свой шедевр». Зачастую, игра приятно соответствует своему описанию и скриншотам.

Отличная — эти игры, зачастую, превосходят свои первые впечатления, основанные на описании и скриншотах (в расчёт не берём репутацию, ибо «тот кто знает, тот поймёт»). Хорошие представители своего жанра.",1597265959,1597871147,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Recommended for fans of old school Zelda games, Alundra and other top-down puzzle/adventure games. After nearly 20 hours played, I've finished the main story, but have barely scratched the surface of the secrets/additional post-game content, which is currently consuming my time.

What sets Anodyne apart is the sheer challenge (mostly from puzzles and exploration), dark, creepy and surreal tones/themes/humour, and of course feels. The game's soundtrack is also sublime and sets the mood for this bizarre adventure perfectly.

Anodyne is a very well-made love-letter to the genre, with many of its own innovative twists. You won't be running around with a sword, instead your weapon is a broom, which you will mostly use to solve puzzles and batter enemies to death. This may sound silly, but it is implemented in quite a smart way as you use the broom to manipulate and use dust piles for various purposes. The puzzles are quite fiendish at times (although nowhere near as hardcore as Alundra was, thankfully!), and there is challenge in simply exploring the world and progressing the story.

The story itself is very surreal, and the entire game seems to be very metaphorical. Rather than being set in a literal fantasy world, it seems the game is showing the mental struggle taking place in the mind of an adolescent coming of age and the alienation involved. This leaves a lot of the story up for discussion and debate, which I'd say is much better than being fed exposition. You will still have many questions after you finish the game.

Anodyne is also highly replayable, featuring a New Game Plus which adds quite a significant amount of new content, including many new secrets to discover. After beating the final boss, you will unlock the ability to switch tiles around in the game, allowing you to travel outside of the map, or to pass through previously-impassable barriers to find new secret areas and so on. This is a very neat touch and it's a lot of fun just looking for ways to break the game using the Swap Tool. There are a whole bunch of secret areas and easter eggs to discover using this. I've never seen a dev implement something so strange, but it works exceptionally well.

To conclude, I'd rate this game very highly, and it's up there with other classics of the top-down action RPG genre. I am very much looking forward to playing Anodyne 2 now.",1596636119,1596707543,True,0,0,0.465686261653900146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne is a game that I will tell you is best played without this being said so if you are interested in a game like this or love some meta crazy stuff then dont listen to this and just by the game.




NOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE GONE or you arent sure yet:

Anodyne in a lot of its base game is a very average game, like if you do want something like this just play zelda because is crazy better, but the thing that makes this game special is its post game quest and overall late game ideas and settings.

The game tells a deep narrative that I wont spoil but goes into some crazy areas that feel out of place in the game, a lot of the game after beating the majority of it gives you this tool to move parts of the entire map around decunstructing maps to go out of bounds to find secrets. It makes the game very unaccesible for some people who wont go or try to 100% this game. I ultimately did not finish this game or complete it. It usually takes people about 4 hours to complete or 100% it and there is an achievement to do it in 3 hours hardly anyone has. The game in this way is amazing and special in its own way but ultimately for the most part was an average game that brought you back to areas you already were in to hunt down this one place you couldnt access before or to do completely something else and it became a little boring or annoying trying to remember where or back track which lost me about I would say 60% in through the game but I still most definitly reccommned it to others.

7/10 - Its very cool and special in those areas which definitely deserves a 7 AND EVEN HAS YOU GLITCHING INTO THE DEBUG ROOM TO 100% THE GAME but at least 50% of the game is a very average zelda-like game. Those areas truelly make it something else though its alot to get through however and became a little tedious. OH AND DONT EXPECT A HUGE REWARD FOR 100% THE GAME. You actually will get NOTHING which PISSED MANNNY PLAYERS OFF.",1596600730,1596600730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

About half of this game is an interesting take on the classic style of gameplay and story. However, it won't be long before you notice the game takes a wild turn. It's a sudden shift that I didn't see coming. It made the story so unpredictable that you won't know who's what, or where's why.

Gameplay wise it feels like your typical zelda-game, wich is great for those that like it. Was first playing it with a keyboard, but I suggest to play it with a controller. Makes it easier with boss-battles.

Also really loved the soundtrack. Gives you the feeling/emotion every environment needs.

It still tells a sorta personal story and has some kinda ""god bad/human free will good"" theme generally. But whatever it does, it does with care. Care with its dialogs, care with its gameplay, care with its nostalgic PSX feels and with its world design too. 

The best thing about Anodyne 2 is the game constantly breaks gameplay expectations with different areas, changing gaming history eras, connections with other games, tropes or cliches. The fun writing helps this too.

I recommend getting the two games together and hopefully you will reach and find the sort of secret connection between them. It would have been no offense even if there were none. But there is, it's a cool bonus and it made me glad I bought the first one too.

Anodyne è un pò simile, solo che gli manca il punto di partenza semplice che sembra avere senso. Anodyne è solo una valanga di assurdità pazzesche, confusionarie e fuori di testa che incontrate una dopo l'altra senza possibilità di capirci niente. In realtà spesso è abbastanza chiaro di quali argomenti volessero parlare gli sviluppatori (c'è parecchia depressione, disagio, temi controversi e scabrosi, cose così), ma è come avere degli improvvisi flash di lucidità in cui si afferra un concetto generale in mezzo ad un casino allucinante di cui si continua a non capire il senso. E gli sviluppatori spesso mi hanno dato l'impressione di essere nella fase ""adolescente edgy"", se non fosse chiaro abbastanza lo dico esplicitamente. Se quanto ho detto finora non vi spaventa (tenete anche conto che Anodyne è più calmo e rilasssato di No more heroes, molto meno sopra le righe, e per questo motivo questi contenuti risultano un pò più pesanti) posso consigliare Anodyne perché il gameplay e la struttura dei livelli sono molto intriganti e piacevoli. In pratica è un grosso labirinto suddiviso in varie zone tematiche in cui lo scopo è riuscire a raggiungere tutte le aree esistenti quindi fondamentalmente è un gioco di esplorazione, e il gameplay è semplice e immediato al punto giusto da risultare molto divertente e appassionante. Dal punto di vista tematico e narrativo non l'ho apprezzato molto perché trovo che essendo così criptico da più che altro l'impressione di essere fuori luogo e inopportuno. Non è l'unico gioco che mi ha lasciato qualche dubbio riguardo al significato, ma tra i giochi di questo tipo è l'unico in cui questa cosa mi ha infastidito. Come gioco è bello, e posso apprezzare il tentativo di creare qualcosa di strano e bizzarro fuori dagli schemi, ma Anodyne non fa nulla per venire incontro al giocatore.

Best OST I've heard in years. I dig the general aesthetic and I did find a lot of similarities between components of both Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Anodyne. Gameplay is pretty slow, and combat seemed quite trivial in terms of difficulty. 

I only found the atmosphere, design, and puzzles to be of appropriate depth. Combat, story, and variety of gameplay were all very shallow. The combat changes very little throughout the game, and introduces very few new enemies. It felt like the game mostly just berates you with puzzle after puzzle. All require the player to  determine what mix of things/actions need to happen in order to make an area or chest accessible. Rinse, repeat. It all became a bit tedious leaving me mostly interested in what the next zone's theme and music will be.

My recommendation is to skip the game, check out the soundtrack, and see if maybe Anodyne 2 is any better (I haven't checked yet). I don't find this game compelling enough to recommend as of April 2020.

The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Anodyne overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay adventure game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

I'm normally a big fan of Zelda-like games, but I passed this one over multiple times because the screenshots made it look boring and generic. But what the screenshots fail to capture is the incredible atmosphere. The game juxtaposes the ordinary with the strange and unexplained to create a surreal feeling, with an excellent soundtrack to add to the surrealness. It's also much more than just a Zelda clone. It adds many unique ideas of its own to the formula, like a broom that you can use to pick up and move dust to solve puzzles and fight enemies, as well as serving as your ""sword"". There's also water, which you can only wade through for a certain number of blocks before sinking, but can travel over using a piece of dust as a raft. 

Top-down platforming is a central focus of the game, with a dedicated jump button. The mechanics are surprisingly good, and it doesn't become frustrating because if you fall in a hole, it's just a slap on the wrist as you respawn at the entrance to the current room. I've heard a bunch of reviews complaining about the jumping mechanics, which makes me think the people writing them made it through the entire game without figuring out how to coyote jump. If you don't know what I'm talking about, look up ""coyote time"". It's a feature in most platformers that allows you to jump for a few frames AFTER you walk off a ledge. It's very powerful and easy to use in Anodyne. Once you get the hang of it, you should be able to jump over two block wide holes fairly easily. And the majority of the game is designed with the assumption that you can only jump over one block so coyote jumping actually allows you to skip over some sections of dungeons. I wouldn't consider it an exploit, because there are some areas in the game that can only be accessed by coyote jumping, so the devs must have put it in on purpose, but it's not explained in-game so a lot of people probably missed it. 

If you have ever had even a passing interest in top down Zelda or Zelda-like games, I would highly recommend Anodyne. It has a lot more to offer than its screenshots and description let on.",1582345159,1582345159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne appears as a game that possibly has the best post game quest developed by a classic duo. The world of Anodyne presents itself in melancholy atmosphere and music. Overall, it’s a retro collectathon, platformer and puzzle game. 

☆ Longer review :
In the beginning, Young gets tasked to save Briar from the darkness. The Sage gives him advice on what he’ll have to do in order to be strong enough to defeat him. As Young, you get to explore a wide vast of areas with interesting characters, settings and much more. 

☀ The gameplay :
Each item you get proves important for your journey. Combat is simple and quick. There’s a few bosses that need a bit of puzzle and platform in order to defeat them. Normally when finishing a boss, there’s a heart fairy that gives you an extra heart container and some fairies are just in new maps you visit. Because it’s a collectathon, the more cards you collect, the more areas you unlock.

☁ Maps and OST : 
They compliment each other. Without a good OST, the maps would be lacking and vise versa. Anodyne does a great job at displaying this. There were songs when visited would give such an eerie and uncomfortable vibe, example “Blank” and Woods” gave me mega chills. But songs are vibrant, relaxing and colorful like “Fields” and “Windmill.” The aesthetics of the maps are very pretty. It feels like some areas I’d like to visit for hours others appear as creepy and grim. It’s a nice variety.

☂ Conclusion :
This game’s often compared to old Zelda games. I agree with it, but there’s so much more to Anodyne than meets the eye. This game’s perfect for if you love puzzle solving and pixel graphics. I love what this game provides and I hope you do too.",1580513924,1580519072,True,6,3,0.587339162826538086,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne's gameplay is most accurately described as a meh Link's Awakening clone. It never evolves past that stab, dodge, and repeat with the combat. Environments are another personal complaint of mine. They ranged from being genuinely interesting to extremely generic. The black-and-white town and flesh dungeon were dark and visually unique, but then some areas are just normal lakes,  generic forests, and straight-line mazes. It's hard to say why I had issues with the soundtrack, but it just wasn't engaging. Story-wise, I liked it a tiny bit, but it's all shoved into the very end of the game. The only thing I enjoyed about it was the post-game, as the title would suggest. Having collectibles hidden out of bounds and having some even require the use of glitches was pretty interesting. But to get to that, you have to go through a slog of the main game. If you have any interest in Anodyne, I suggest skipping straight to the sequel. The gameplay and graphics seem much more varied, which is a major plus. And they even keep the map-breaking element, but in a 3D environment, which makes that mechanic much more interesting.",1579482799,1579482799,False,12,1,0.503451704978942871,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is pretty solid, however requires a bit of backtracking and while the early dungeons are fun to explore some of the later worlds, such as the hotel, which is too long compared to the other dungeons, and the maze which is 90% dead ends with only one item to collect, don't feel as fun to explore. The music is pretty good and fits the game and places in which they are used, probably the best is the Windmill theme. The puzzles are pretty easy to solve, especially early on, to the point they felt useless to the overall game. While the game is for the most part not hard, the parts where it does offer a challenge don't even feel fair or interesting. The only 2 hard enemies is the dog, who can be beat by the boring method of running away from him and attacking when he stops, and the lion, who you beat by just attacking his fire breath. This is probably due to the fact you only have one weapon in the entire game, making combat severely restricted. Some of the jumps in the game have to be very precise to achieve, until you realize you can jump halfway into the sprite of the hole and still not fall. The graphics go for a pixel aesthetic, but don't do anything special artistically to set it apart.

While the plot is I'm guessing supposed to have some sort of symbolism, it feels somewhat tacked on. The themes don't fully come across and some parts, such as the[spoiler]town where you stab people with a knife, the backstory of said town, and the blood sea world[/spoiler]feel like they're supposed to have some follow-through, but since they don't feel like the game trying to hard to be ""deep"". I feel the creator made the game to explore themes of loneliness & living in fantasy worlds in your imagination, however there is way too much fluff that has nothing to do with said theme.

While I feel the game is quite fun for the most part, the fact your combat options are severely limited, some of the boring dungeons, and short length, the game feels more like a flash game you'd find on newgrounds or armor games. Not a bad game, but probably not worth $9.99.

Overall an alright game with good music, decent 2D zelda style gameplay, half good half boring worlds, and pretty forgettable ""deep"" plot.

Anodyne comes the closest I've ever seen to satisfying that desire. 

A lot of you probably don't know what Yume Nikki is, so I'll try to explain what I mean without that context. In Anodyne, you are set free to explore the world, a world clearly representative of the main character's subconscious. The game doesn't hold you hand or apply much in the way of interpretation; all of that is left up to you. Because of the lack of hand holding, the puzzles and exploration feel real, like you are discovering a lost country. 

A lot of people are saying that this is a lot like early Zelda games. I can't make much comment there because I've never played a Legend of Zelda game (yes, I've played Yume Nikki and not Zelda; don't ask). However, the game has some very basic combat based on learning patterns and dodging attacks. It's well-done. I'm a fan of slower, ""learn the pattern and chip away at the enemies health when the opportunity arises"" kind of combat. It's also very easy--most bosses I only died to once or twice if at all--until you get to the final boss. That spike in difficulty shocked me a bit, but it also drove home the theme. Plus, it was one of those bosses where you know exactly what you're supposed to do, but your fingers turn into french fries after playing for so long, so...it might not have been as hard as it seemed in the middle of the night. 

If you love exploring and atmosphere (and if you have a thing for surrealism) I highly recommend this one.

Nun, wenn ich Anodyne mit einem Wort beschreiben müsste, dann würde ich das Wort „Meh“ wählen. Dieses Indie-Top-Down Action-Adventure mag zwar gut spielbar sein, ein paar nette Rätsel bieten und mit einer interessanten Game+ Idee locken, aber unterm Strich erwartet einem ein eher langweiliges Machwerk, dass sich hinter dem Deckmantel der Indie-Kunst so einige grobe Schnitzer leistet. Die Handlung ist kryptischer Müll – muss man einfach mal so deutlich ausdrücken. Die Grafik ist dermaßen grobpixelig, dass keine nostalgischen Gefühle entstehen möchten. Und ich verstehe beim besten Willen nicht, warum man den Bildausschnitt auf Danmaku-Breite quetschen musste. Macht null Sinn. Und da im Gameplay-Bereich eigentlich auch keine wirklich nennenswerten Highlights ins Gedächtnis springen wollen, kann man nur noch den OST als großes Pro-Argument aufführen. Dieser erzeugt eine schöne surreal-melancholische Stimmung, welche Anodyne einiges an Persönlichkeit mit auf dem Weg gibt.
Versteht mich nicht falsch, Anodyne ist schon ganz launig, aber wenn man so ein improvisiertes Indie-Spielchen kurze Zeit nach einem Vollblüter wie Minish Cap zockt, dann merkt man recht schnell, dass hier nicht allzu viel dahintersteckt.


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- schöner Soundtrack, der seinen eigenen Flair erzeugt
- sehr gute Steuerung und Spielbarkeit
- spätere Dungeons sind ganz gut aufgebaut und bieten auch einige nette Rätsel

Neutral:
- 8,99 € für ca. 5+ Stunden Spielzeit
- eine durchaus interessante Game+ Idee, die leider unkomfortabel umgesetzt wurde

Kontra:
- die Handlung ist nicht viel mehr als ein kryptisches Interpretations-Gebräu
- etwas zu grobpixelige Grafik, die obendrein in einem zusammengestauchten Bildformat dargestellt wird
- öde Bossgegner (der finale Bosskampf ist aber gut gelungen)
- die Spielabschnitte zwischen den Dungeons wirken eher zäh und nervig

Everything in Anodyne is so jarring and juxtaposing that it really goes against my expectations, both positively and negatively. There will be spoilers, but I will censor them out. 

Let's start off by mentioning the gameplay, considering that it's the easiest thing to talk about. The game plays as an excruciatingly off heart Link's Awakening clone. You have your ""sword"" and your ""Roc's Feather"". I mean, sure, they are obviously changed to be other items... that are more random than Link's Awakening, but it plays like Link's Awakening, feels like Link's Awakening, and I could not stop thinking about how this compares to Link's Awakening whenever I had to do a tough jump or when I was in combat. However, the combat feels slightly more stiff due to the animation while attacking, and the fact that there are upgrades for your weapon to extend its reach. However, the feedback you receive when hitting an enemy is oddly satisfying. 

To be honest, I'm not exactly bothered by the fact that it's fairly inspired by Link's Awakening, but the part about the gameplay that really ticks me off is how exploitable and buggy Anodyne is as a game. The movement feels extremely finicky due to the way that Young's sprite bugs around a lot whenever you change directions extremely quickly. The jump, while well explored with other mechanics in the game, I felt was a nuisance and wasn't necessary, and could be replaced by something else. Especially considering that the jump is simply ridiculous. The map design just doesn't complement the jump feature very well, you can skip into an extremely late section of the game using the jump, hitboxes are hit or miss with the jump, and when I felt like I actually needed the jump for a mechanic, I didn't really feel much satisfaction from solving a puzzle, more from the fact that I'd expect to land on a platform, only to fall through. I simply don't like the jump feature, and I feel like the game could have been better without it if the developers worked around other puzzle solving mechanics instead.

When I mentioned the game was buggy, I didn't just mean Young's sprite. There were a lot of instances where I felt like some parts weren't refined. I encountered:
[list]
    [*] Buggy interactions with enemies and gates, sometimes enemies would spontaneously explode for no reason, and the rules for opening an enemy gate often varied, confusing me significantly. ""Why is the gate open when I haven't killed all the enemies? Why does one gate open but not the other?"" To make matters worse, some gates would often reappear even though I cleared out the room and some gates were unsure of whether they were open or not (I literally just cleared the room, why is it playing the gate animation and sound effect when I re-enter?). Buttons for gates don't disappear when they are used as well, so it just makes gates more frustrating for me to deal with. 
    [*] A glitch which softlocked my game, jumping into a portal and returning to the Nexus at the same time results in a black screen that isn't interactable.
    [*] The ""return to Entrance"" button returns you to the actual entrance of each dungeon, rather than where you last entered the dungeon, which can break the flow of exploration.
    [*] The glitch that I feel ruined the game most, to the extent where I will censor it simply because it's that exploitable, [spoiler] the ""Wiggle Glitch"". If you keep going in between vertical boundaries while holding a vertical direction, Young will continuously be able to push himself further vertically with each transfer, until you can quite literally walk through a wall or over a pit. I despise this one because it was left in the game [b] on purpose as a puzzle post game.[/b] [/spoiler]
[/list]

That was a bit of a tangent on the gameplay, so I'll move on to music and sound effects (because I can transition). I can't really say that I'm into the soundtrack, the soundtrack is just a bit too melancholy for me, which makes sense for the game, but at the same time I just didn't feel like the tunes held any complexity or significance to me. I felt like the music never really coexisted with the area I was in. I did notice some leitmotif of the main theme, but otherwise, the music tended to juxtapose and change mood way too quickly for me. I do notice some people saying that they like the soundtrack though, and I can respect that. The sound effects are mostly crisp and nice, but some are penetrating or have a bit too much noise in them. 

So the real elephant in the room I have to deal with are the themes of the game, I have no idea as to how I'd describe Anodyne as a game thematically. The game just 0-100's it with the graphics, on one end of the spectrum, you have beautiful, lush, ambient landscapes akin to games in the SNES era such as Chrono Trigger, however, while you're enjoying that area, the game quickly pulls the rug underneath you throws you in the face areas that are grotesque, blunt and rather dull, almost describing the title of the game... The themes too, change with this drastic extent, the dialogue and characters are most of the time extremely cryptic, philosophical or existential with their dialogue, but then you never feel that the game ever takes itself seriously in regards to that. The game can literally go from cute to murder in the snap of a finger. It feels semi-surreal, but themes are never explored to full detail, which I found disappointing due to the potential and psychological impact some of the events and areas have over you. Speaking of these areas, they're tough to navigate due to how little the map gives you in terms of information. The map only marks whenever there is an entrance to another room, or an entrance to a dungeon. And there can be multiple entrances in the same direction, which is further omitted by this basic map. I found a lot of frustration in trying to navigate Anodyne due to how little information the map gave me.

It's a shame that I have mostly negative things to say about the main game, because I feel that the game gets significantly better once you finish the main part. Going into spoiler territory, [spoiler] near the end of the game, you are given the ability to swap any tile in a room, including walls, allowing you to go out of bounds in specific areas. This concept by itself is so humbling and intuitive, as the idea of the developers hiding hidden easter eggs, areas and collectibles just out of sight is intriguing, and it shows their appreciation for their project and how open they are to interpretation. It also acts as a semi fix to the jump and is a lot more fun as a mechanic to explore due to its originality and power over the game than the jump. I hate the jump. [/spoiler] 

To conclude, I still feel like the game is feasible. The surreal and jarring nature of the game grabbed my attention for most of the time, and I appreciated the efforts from the developers (who are a two person team by the way), but there are a significant amount of flaws that detract from this experience. I'd say get the game, but maybe on a sale or something, or only if you're confident you'll really like it.

作为一个穷学生，我并没有真的玩过塞尔达，也没玩过类塞尔达的游戏。但是一种类似模式的游戏我却玩过很多——类银河战士恶魔城。诚然两种模式还是非常不同的，但我们还是可以发现这两种模式有很多相同的地方，而且两种模式给玩家带来乐趣的主要原因是相同的，就是允许玩家在一个互通的世界中自由探索，而不是用某种“选关画面”让玩家脱戏。

那么这款游戏做到了什么样的程度呢？

......其实就像我说的，我以前没玩过这样类型的游戏，所以对我来说，新鲜感应该会更多一些。

这款游戏的主角Young，使用扫帚作为武器，在一个迷幻的世界中进行冒险。有多迷幻呢？说老实话，我通关了这款游戏，但仍然想不明白这个游戏想表达什么，包括剧情本身。地图的风格会在明亮和阴暗之间反复横跳，而且我说的阴暗，是真的很阴暗，包括[spoiler]自杀，杀人，血[/spoiler]等内容，会引起一定的心理不适。诚然这些内容在像素画面下的“表现力”肯定不如专门的恐怖游戏，但是还是挺膈应的。

正如上面所说，这款游戏主题十分怪异，有时就像是正常的明亮RPG风格，有时血刺呼啦不可名状就像是恐怖游戏。基于这一点，游戏中的一些细节（一些明显不应该在某个地方的某种东西，或者说出了明显不符合这个世界的“现实”的话语），以及“镇痛剂”这个名字，我只能差不多理解到，游戏的主题和[spoiler]精神疾病/妄想[/spoiler]应该是有点关系。

虽然游戏很怪异，但是jumpscare还是没有的，如果你的心理承受能力不错，可以接受一定程度的阴暗要素，那就可以说到游戏性的方面了。

本作如同塞尔达一样，拥有探索、战斗、解谜这些要素。而且其实还做得非常不错，至少我玩得非常开心。地形、谜题、敌人和BOSS的设计都非常不错，很有意思。

不过有一个位置稍显不足，那就是游戏的通关需要收集37个收集物中的至少36个，而我认为游戏内部没有任何对于这方面的提示，也就是说，如果你错过了什么东西，那找起来可就不是一件好玩的事情了。所幸收集物之间是有分别的，可以查社区指南来找到某个特定的收集物的位置。不过如果你有精神洁癖，不想查攻略，那我还是建议你，第一次到某个地方的时候，尽量直接把所有的支路全部探完。基本上，只要你能进去一个区域，所有这个区域中的收集物都可以收集到。否则，游戏体验会有点差。

这个游戏据说有post-game（也就是通关后专属）的内容，然而我不太想打了，貌似也就是一些收集，和一个额外的关卡之类的？

这样就评价完了这个游戏。至于我是怎么找到这个游戏的，那真的是阴错阳差。Twitter上面的一则推送让我看到了在今年8月发售的《Anodyne 2》的宣传片（顺带一提，续作貌似多出了一个2D/3D切换的机制，看上去很NB），于是我就先买了一代玩玩。目前看来，续作除了3D建模好像有一点......复古，还是值得期待的，希望续作能够继续抓住塞尔达式的乐趣，并利用2D/3D切换来达到更加高的成就（只要关卡设计不崩坏就好......）。

Gameplay is a lot like Zelda (people say its especially like Link's Awakening, a portable Zelda game I haven't played) but with a different atmosphere. You explore a wide variety of environments, many of which are surreal, bizarre and sometime eerie (inspired in part by Yume Nikki). 
There are some tricky puzzles and combat sections that took me little while to get through. One gameplay element I liked was the map you're provided with that helped me figure out places I hadn't gone to yet.
The graphics are retro/NES quality and the music is really good--I would listen to some of these pieces on their own. 
Some reviews I've read complain about the story: at first we're presented with a generic RPG excuse plot (save the world from encroaching darkness). But its presented with a bit of humor. Later dialogue and text suggests there's something else (more psychological) going on--its kept vague. Maybe there's an element of mystery which is never explained. I didn't have any expectations story wise (consider the games that inspired it) so this didn't bother me.  
It's a short game--maybe this is good as it doesn't ""overstay its welcome""--but after you defeat the final boss you're given a tool that allows you to access more of the map and discover new secrets meaning you can have more fun exploring.

This is done with the promise of further exploration and an entire (hidden) second half of the game. The thing is; you're meant to use this tool to exploit glitches that occur when moving outside of the maps, to get you to secret glitchy areas. This requires abusing your controls, and works about 1% of the time, essentially making the whole experience extremely frustrating.

What is equally as frustrating is the fact that so much work seemingly has gone to making these glitchy areas, with 99 doors you have to try and pass by jumping into holes that kill you at different spots of different levels, but bringing up the menu, teleport to the waypoint area, and hope you hit one of the spots that has floor tiles to land on, and is on the right side of the doors.

If this was truly meant to be optional, it would have been hidden away as secrets, not be your reward for completing the game, and it would definitely not have about as much content as the main game.",1561844441,1561844441,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]神奇的扫帚[/h1]
游戏中主角在一开始会得到一把扫帚，也就是主角的武器了，可别小看了这把扫帚，用处可大了，除了击打敌人，我们还可以用它铲土，你说铲土有啥用，可以挡攻击，没错这个算是推箱子的变种吧，设计的很巧妙，有的场景需要交替反复铲起和放下两堆土，来开辟道路。后期可以剪刀一些加强扫帚的配件。

[h1]需要反复尝试的BOSS战[/h1]
游戏攻击机制的问题，给玩家无形中增加了不少难度，平时的小怪还好，但是攻击样式多样、血量又厚的BOSS们，就显得十分手残了，有些BOSS战设计的还挺有意思，不过无形中也增加了难度，比如红色大陆那个BOSS，就需要玩家利用尘土作为漂浮物载体，然后还要克服水流的影响，和一个想大章鱼一样的BOSS战斗。
不过游戏的BOSS战一开始难度大，多试几次一般都能过，只是浪费了时间，会影响一个3小时内通关的成就，我看那个成就达成率也不高，获得的也都是高玩吧。

[h1]充满恶意的陷阱[/h1]
游戏中的一些场景设置了各种而已满满的机关，地上的洞就不说了，注意一下就好，可是覆盖了松动土壤的洞那不是害人嘛！这种区域站久了就会掉洞里。还有没有护栏的窄道，一不留神就掉下悬崖。主角在河水里也不能久待，不然会下沉。还好这些陷阱及时不幸踩中也无太大影响，玩家也就是在本区域重生，耽误点时间罢了。不过游戏成就里有一个3小时内通关的成就，奔着这个成就取得玩家就要多加留意了。

游戏中还有一种不会攻击你但是会被你吸引跟随你并且推你的小生物，好吧，你很可爱，但是别把我往沟里推啊。。。

[h1]卡片收集[/h1]
游戏中玩家需要收集各种带有生物信息的卡片，这些卡片是推进游戏的重要道具，有些门需要收集的卡片数达到一定数量才能打开，有些BOSS需要收集卡片数量达到一定值后才会遇到。

[h1]零散的剧情叙述[/h1]
游戏中的剧情获取主要通过npc 的对话，npc可以反复对话，不过都太过零散，感觉剧情似有似无的，很是散乱，有些npc说的话也天马行空、不知所云的。有一个转红色法师袍的npc总是在关键时刻出现指引玩家，应该算是主要的npc了。

[h1]总结[/h1]
游戏还是挺不错，但是由于玩法和叙事方式，显得非常小众，而且不为人所知，游戏现在推出了2代作品，不知道销量会如何，届时也不知道会不会有更多人来了解这部作品。

First off I love the characters, I love the pixelated style (and no, not all pixel styles are created equal) and I love the mood this game sets. The mechanics are simple; you fight with one weapon and you can jump. The strange characters you meet are interesting. As far as the story goes, it's kind of vague and doesn't make a ton of sense. From what I gathered from other reviews, it was intended to be that way. Kind of like it is what you make it out to be sort of thing. Personally I really enjoyed the game and the odd story.

+Charming art style
The art is of varying quality but is generally very pleasing to the eye, with a lot of texture differences between zones.
++Atmospheric Music
A good musical score that can flip flop between happy forest romps and foreboding horror.
+Intuitive, fun puzzle design
Much of the puzzles are inspired by Zelda, but that doesn't make them any less fun to solve.
+Intriguing post-game content.
There is about two hours of extra optional content after the final boss for people who like exploring and finding secrets.
+++Environmental Storytelling!
This game does a very good job at giving you a lot of pieces to work out what's going on in the Land by yourself, and doesn't insult your intelligence by spelling it all out in the end. I strongly disagree with the other reviews saying the story falls flat, and recommend players to look at things from an allegorical perspective.

Cons:
-Price compared to length
If you don't care for finding the extra secrets, the game is only about six hours long. It can be beaten in three hours if you know what you're doing. I would say get this half off as I did, there are a lot of ten dollar games that last longer.
-Enemy design
As has been said, the enemy attack patterns are very standard fair with nothing much special.
-Rough edges
There can be problems with hit detection for both being struck by enemies and landing on platforms, more noticeable in the later platforming areas.",1551143374,1551143374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[How i found the game]:Saw nitro rad's video on this game... 
halfway through the video i stopped before the spoilers started rollin out
Said to myself ""Hey i wonder if this game is on steam?"" it was And was on sale for 50% off

i picked it up for 5$ and it was a great experience for me
There were a few lines of dialogue here and there that really spoke to my personally in ways that actually brought tears to my eyes in one circumstance ( and its not really a dialogue heavy game )

[Gameplay]: was Fantastic its basically what if a classic zelda game was stripped of all dungeon items
(Which in alot of games become completely irrelivant after the dungeon they are required for is over)
Turns out the concept is Really Solid and you go into every puzzle KNOWING you have the tools for the job on hand always

[Design]: was pretty great through most the game... some mechanics were a tiny bit clunky but nothing i couldn't handle 
Also the game has that expertly crafted Super metroid eqsue Megaman like tutorial where  They show you the elements
How they interact and why its important... All without any dialogue , Text , Hard stops in gameplay Giving you a natural learning experience and keeping you immersed

[Etc... ]: Atmospheric Music and Simple pixel art with some Visual effect overlays give this game quite an appealing look.
Excellent soundtrack to boot there wasn't a singe track i didn't like. All of the music fits the theme of the area perfectly

Combined with all the elements done so well in this game i pretty much couldn't do anything on my free time other than play it until it was done it captivated me and my mind. it gave me a distraction, another world to sink into a trance
And Thats really quiet fitting given the theme's in the game and the name of it.. its as if we are represented in the story
The player of the game the person taking a break from reality

Also it has some semi unsettling aspects too but they are subtle.
Like the game doesn't seem entirely ""Right"" its got this eerie sense about just the tittle screen...
the way it makes you scale the window on Boot up. Stones sitting about all over the game with extremely strange cryptic messages that don't seem to have anything to do with the place you are in

in closing: Good game unique experience  Very amusing concept.      ( i wrote this review after being up all night )",1551010838,1551010838,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Calling it a 'cash grab' is rude. I am not in this business to scam people. We worked very hard on this game, so people could enjoy it!

Anyways, as demonstrated by the many positive reviews and videos, the game clearly works. I encourage you to keep playing despite the problems from the partial controller support! I think you will enjoy it.

 [h1]Gameplay[/h1]
In Anodyne ist das vorrangige Ziel meist das [b]sammeln von Karten[/b], die überall in der Umgebung verstreut sind. Manchmal bekommt man sie von NPCs, durch das besiegen von Bossen oder man findet sie in Truhen, die nicht selten in den teils kniffeligen Dungeons zu finden sind. Die Karten werden benötigt, um in der Welt von Anodyne bestimmte Tore zu öffnen, die hierfür eine bestimmte Anzahl an Karten vorraussetzen. Es ist also nicht nötig, bestimmte Karten zu besitzen.

Um verpasste Karten einzusammeln muss man nicht umständlich backtracken. Es gibt eine zentrale Anlaufstelle, von der aus man die gesamte Spielwelt erreichen kann.

[b]Kämpfen[/b] muss man in Anodyne auch, nur dass die Waffe des Helden nicht etwa ein Schwert ist, sondern ein Besen.
Mit diesem kann man Monster vermöbeln und Staub aufkehren, der für viele Mechaniken im Spiel verwendet wird. Unteranderem kann man auf einem Staubfloß Gewässer überqueren. Ebenfalls in Anodyne vorhanden sind zahlreiche Rätsel und Geschicklichkeitspassagen.

[h1]Grafik, Soundtrack[/h1]
Die Grafik von Anodyne besteht ausschließlich aus Pixelgrafik, die aus der Zeit des ersten Gameboys erinnert.

Later on you gain the ability of jumping, which opens up the platforming part of the game. The platforming sessions are great, resulting in a bit of challenge on some parts, but never to the point where you feel like it cheated you off of a death.

I've seen the phrasing Zelda-lite being tossed around to describe this game, and I can appreciate the concept, though you certainly don't acquire the number of items such a description would suggest.  You get a few basic boosts to your abilities, some optional equips to your primary weapon, and extensions on your health bar.  The other main component are the various cards, which does seem reminiscent of the trading cards on Steam; especially since they represent in-game sprites, many of which have random or cryptic descriptions.  Otherwise though, as you take on this top-down style adventure game with platforming and combat elements interspersed throughout, it does come off like a basic Zelda game.


[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
•	Even after you beat the game and get everything you'd normally expect to find, there's more to keep exploring for.  In the trademark style of this game, these wind up being in off-the-wall areas because you unlock an item that lets you swap tiles and go behind otherwise dead-ends and impenetrable walls.  One downside is that these sections weren't clearly defined, as many of them are extra areas you challenge for another card, but I found one or two randomly without doing the area as intended because I was blindly stumbling around to find them.
•	This is somewhat of a spoiler, but it happens fairly early on.  While exploring a pier, I came across a guy fishing, and wanting to interact with him wound up pushing him off the pier.  It developed into a whirlpool of his blood.  I didn't see myself in a mirror, but I knew I had a shocked expression on my face.  He was a random person and your character didn't say or do anything beforehand suggesting he had a beef with him, but it happens regardless.  Such a powerful moment due to its randomness and simplicity.
•	The game develops an interesting setting and world that has the character traveling across various terrains and even a few different themes.  For instance, a more pixilated area that seems to be like a torture-chamber or dungeon/maze, and a place that's completely black and white.   
•	There are a good assortment of baddies and bosses to contend with.  You also come across stuff that may or may not be an obstacle or just something unusual you have to deal with.
•	It's kind of silly, but I like that your weapon is a broom.  Even those who have theories for the game don't really give a great reason for why that'd be the case.


[h1] Cons: [/h1] 
•	This isn't a huge complaint, but I did get stuck a few times trying to figure out where to go next and what to do.  The reason it's not a huge complaint is because it's an adventure game, and without any prior experience, you would expect some uncertainty and confusion.  Especially as this isn't the type of game to hold your hand or explain things in-depth.  
•	Some areas are a bit frustrating due to how the game is designed, as you don't have many options on how you address situations.  You either platform around something or you kill an enemy in the way.  Nothing is too difficult, unless you go for secret areas, but dying is fairly common nonetheless.
•	The game is pretty short, clocking in at only a few hours.  I'd say seven or eight hours max, depending on if you refuse to resort to a guide and try to get all the achievements.  Probably not worth the full asking price, but it is a trip.


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
If you go into this game expecting to find Zelda, you're going to be very caught off-guard.  The game's setting and atmosphere are far too surreal and unsettling to feel like the normally light-hearted adventure of the Nintendo classic.  Throughout most of the game, I really felt creeped out and on-edge.  It isn't the sort of game to be oozing horror, cheap jump scares, or even anything scary.  However, as I played, I never really felt comfortable, like everything was alright.  Helping to fuel that is nothing ever gets explained properly about what is going on or why things would be so fast and loose with the rules of reality.  Based on what others have said, including the developers, it seems that this is supposed to represent some form of abstraction, but what it all really means is up for the player to decide.  Personally, since so much doesn't seem to directly relate to each other amongst the different areas and NPCs you come across, I don't try to put a box around the experience.  It's random and weird, giving a great example of how to make a game that's unsettling and creepy without having to resort to tired tropes and themes.  If this game had thrown in jump scares or horror elements, I'd have bailed immediately, because it would have been far too effective with what it already manages to do without shouting boo.  I certainly recommend this game for those who like an eerie experience and don't mind ambiguity about what's really going on, because I certainly don't have a clue.  Plus, a sequel is in the works.",1535407952,1607222407,True,35,0,0.716798603534698486,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's got a strong Gameboy Zelda vibe to it, yet it really does its own thing. Atmosphere is good. Music is good. Surreal tone is good (if you like that sort of thing).

Where the game really starts to struggle tho is at the mid-game where the enemies and puzzles start to get very repetitive. Repetition really bogs down the gameplay. A greater variety of powerups might have gone a long way here. There are also several situations and puzzle types that rely on a level of jumping precision that this game really doesn't lend itself to. Finally, while most collectables are reasonable to find, there are quite a few ""Guide Dang It!"" moments in the late game if you are a completionist.

For all its clever ideas and great atmosphere, Anodyne's greatest failing is its inability to keep it all interesting and engaging after about the first 3-5 hours. If you push through, however, you'll find a very thought-provoking and well-constructed game. I'm definitely looking forward to Anodyne 2. Overall Score: 8.5/10

If this game, as an old-school top-down 2D action-adventure game, looks like something you’ll enjoy, it’s worth picking up even at all full price.

There are a lot of secrets to find.  Some of them are not too hard to find, but others, I have to ask myself how anyone found them.  I used a guide.

I played it on windows, but I also tested the Linux version.  It doesn't run right out of the box, but I ran the install.sh file in the game folder and it ran fine after that.

I played it with a controller.  On an xbox controller, confirm would be X, cancel would be A, and menu would be Y.  In-game confirm is called C and cancel is called X, because those are the keyboard controls.  The cancel button is used for jumping and confirm is used for attack.  The controller dialog that pops up every single time the game starts is a little annoying, but the game works out of the box with my direct input controller, so I can't complain.

The hours steam reports are wrong.  I didn't spend that much time playing the game.  My in-game time says about 8 hours, but I think that's wrong too; it may have been more like 6.  I did go for, almost, full completion including most of the secrets, though.   The main campaign would certainly have taken much less time.

The game was pretty straight forward for the most part. It claims to be a Zelda-Lite and it pulls that off. There are some additions like jumping and card collecting.

I did like that jumping was adding in this type of game. I think when a certain game becomes a “genre” like Zelda has then people don’t take chances because they are trying to stick to what works. There were some chances taken there. It could be that the game was aimed at a more casual and/or younger demographic. If in fact it was aimed at those demographics then it makes sense to be ""liter"" on puzzles and challenges and to make everything be more time consuming than punishing. Looking at it this way I can see Zelda-Lite completely. A revelation I'm having as I write the review. Anyhow...

Play it if you are really into the playstyle of NES/SNES Zelda’s, but don’t go in expecting those games. This is truely a Zelda-Lite.

The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's interesting at least and the characters are entertaining enough for the most part. The graphics and sound are charming and gorgeous in their simplicity and really help build a mysterious, surreal and sometimes creepy atmosphere. 

What really stood out for me in this game though was the gameplay. It's so addicting. Sure, it's Zelda inspired but it still works very well. One thing I really liked was how there's so much to discover and explore. The combat and puzzle mechanics were creative and slick, albeit a tad simple, but it all worked great mixed in with the exploration that made me keep coming back for more. In many ways the game reminded me more of Yume Nikki than Zelda. 

There's a bit of a difficulty curve at times, but I didn't think it was too steep. There are some parts that felt frustrating, but I don't think it's a big deal in the larger scheme of things. The humor was a little... odd? at times but it wasn't too off-putting for the most part. (The writing and story really aren't anything to write home about overall)

It's a weird, dark, and bizarre game for sure, and it's probably not for everyone. It's a bit difficult to for me review; I'm sure other reviewers made excellent points that I don't really know how to articulate. The game is far from perfect, but I sure had fun playing it.

Quelques achievements, mais sans guide pour la collecte des cartes par exemple, bonne chance... Il y a aussi des zones accessibles avec des glitchs, pour ceux que ça intéresse.

[h1]En bref[/h1]

Principalement axé sur son ambiance, Anodyne est un jeu d'aventure tout à fait correct. Je ne le recommande pas car il est basé sur Adobe AIR qui est une plaie sur Linux. Mais sur une autre plateforme, oui, recommandé.

[h1]GNU/Linux[/h1]

La version Linux est très bien si vous arrivez à installer Adobe AIR, qui n'est plus supporté sur Linux depuis 2011. Sur les distributions basées sur Ubuntu, c'est possible au moment où j'écris ce test (Mai 2018). J'ai terminé le jeu il y a longtemps, mais j'ai refait le test. Il existe un script bash pour des Ubuntu/Mint récentes ( https://www.noobslab.com/2015/05/adobeair-is-now-available-for-ubuntu.html ), il y a les packages de devolo ( http://update.devolo.com/linux/apt/pool/main/a/adobeair/ ), et aussi des PPA (par ex: https://launchpad.net/~andykimpe/+archive/ubuntu/adobeair )

J'ai testé les trois solutions ci-dessus car au démarrage l'écran était noir... mais après avoir testé un peu toute les touches du clavier, j'ai réalisé qu'il suffit d'appuyer sur 'c' au démarrage pour que ça continue. Après avoir réalisé ça, quelques tests plus tard, j'ai eu un écran rouge qui m'indiquait de redimensionner l'écran avec les flèches puis d'appuyer sur 'c'. Ca a l'air d'être aléatoire, la majorité du temps il n'apparait pas. Donc appuyez sur 'c', et le jeu se lancera de toutes façons.

Pour les achievements, vu que je les ai déjà, je n'ai pas pu refaire le test, mais je les avais eus sur Linux à l'époque, donc il est fort probable qu'ils fonctionnent toujours.

Une petite note, le dev semble suivre les forums, et il a fourni un SWF standalone du jeu, si vous n'arrivez pas à installer AIR. Je ne sais pas si les achivements fonctionnent avec.

Well this game is… interesting.
I already played a bit of this game a couple of years ago but have never finished it until today and I am glad I did because Anodyne really hit the spot. 

[h1] A game that looks like The Legend of Zelda [/h1]

Right from the start Anodyne looks like one of the early Legend of Zelda games. It’s a 2D game, you have bird’s eye perspective, when you go to the edge of the screen it moves to the next zone and you progress by fighting enemies. You also go through dungeons, you sometimes get power ups, there is an over-world that is fun to explore and you always have a boss fight at the end of each dungeon. It’s clear what this game was based on and the game is fully aware of this and doesn’t even try to hide it.

[h1] You are a boy called Young and you must find the Brair [/h1]

So what is the game about exactly? Well… I’m not sure myself. The game clearly has a story hidden somewhere deep within it but the game wants you to work for it a figure it out. 

You play as a boy called Young. You don’t know where you are and how you got there. You aren’t scared nor confused, you are just … there. Also, you don’t speak but the NPCs have no problem talking to you. You meet a sage who tells you that you are supposed to find the Brair, and that’s the plot… basically. 

From there, you get your weapon and you set foot into this Zelda-like world to find this “Brair”.

[h1] It's dangerous to go alone. Take this... broom![/h1]

So what is young Young’s weapon? Well, here is where the game quirky humor comes to shine. See, like I said before, the game is based on Legend of Zelda games and it knows it and it also knows you know it (hopefully). Seeing how Zelda is a popular series that has been going strong for years, players expect certain things to happen in the world when playing Zelda. You have these same expectations in Anodyne and the game just loves toying with you because of them. So, instead of getting a sword, you get … a broom.

Not a magic broom, not a Nimbus 2000, a regular sweeping broom. Despite this, it works just like a sword and it even has some other uses too. During the game you can find dust balls which you can pick up with your broom and use them to progress further into the game. You can use them as a platform as an obstacle for blocking enemies and, my personal favorite, as a raft. It sounds silly, but it’s really cool and it gives the game its own unique mechanic. The game is also much easier than any Zelda game I have played. You will probably die a few times but not once did I get frustrated because each death is your own fault. Not even the bosses were that much tougher.

[h1] The game is fully aware where it takes inspiration from and enjoy toying with your expectations [/h1]

Toying with your expectations doesn’t stop there either. There are bushes that are begging to be cut down which you just can’t cut. There’s a Rock in your way and there is a clear path behind the rock? Too bad, there are no bombs in this game. Want to buy a power up or an upgrade in the game? Lucky for you the game has a merchant that sells things. The only problem is that the game doesn’t even have any currencies. You see 9 rocks where one is clearly misplaced and needs to be pushed? Too bad you can’t push things. It’s little things like that that make me smile. 
So all of this might seem bad, but the game stands on its own with its dust mechanics and it’s simple but functional combat.

[h1] Unique levels and weird locale [/h1]

What really drew me into the game is the levels, or rather the zones. Instead of having Death Mountain or Zora’s domain, this game has a haunted circus, a rundown hotel, a cave in the swamps and other bizarre locals. Being a fan of bizarre and weird worlds, I was immediately hooked.

As you go through the game and as the story “unfolds” you start to realize and question the motive of the main character Young. Where exactly is he? Why is he doing all this? Is he even a good person? It doesn’t help that the rest of the game seems to know Young better than he knows himself. About half-way through the game, the locals start getting really dark, twisted and almost morbid. 

[h1] A short experience [/h1]

The game is very short (it even has an achievement for beating it in less than 3 hours, which seems very possible) but it’s very conveniently packaged. After you clear the first area, you are free to go where you want and exploration is highly recommended. In fact, exploration is necessary since you really need to find (I think) all collectables in order to beat the game. Luckily, none of them are cryptically hidden so it wasn’t such a hassle to track them all down. Once you beat the game, you can continue exploring the world with the new power ups you have and unlock a few more collectables. 

[h1] I've had fun with this game [/h1]

So, that’s Anodyne. I know my description may not have made much sense but that’s the beauty of it. While being a very solid game, it’s fun to just wonder and create your own story about why Young is on this adventure and what do all of his adventures mean. It’s fun to find a Zelda themed area and get frustrated when you remember that you aren’t really playing a Zelda game. It’s fun to explore all the strange zones and locals. 

And that’s the final verdict. Anodyne is strange, bizarre, knows that it looks like Zelda, but most importantly, it’s a lot of fun. It may be short and you can beat it only a few hours, but it’s definitely worth your time.

Your weapon is a broom. You need to collect playing cards to progress.

It sounds familiary yet quirky - and it is - which I totally expected to enjoy.

Anodyne is not my thing.

Based on all the over reviews it must work for a lot of other people. So maybe I'm the outlier, but I was not entertained by this formula. It felt like a pointless slog most of the time.

Like most Zelda-esque games, fighting enemies in Anodyne doesn't actually matter. Sometimes you have to clear a room to progress. Sometimes there's a boss. But the vast majority you can simply ignore. There's no experience. There's not even money, whereas at least in Zelda there's usually some currency you can apply to upgrades. Instead the only possible drop is health, which you won't need if you don't fight. So the game is basically motivating you to run past all the enemies you can. When you do fight, there's literally only one move: stab with your broom. So chalk up a big negative for the combat system.

The rest of the gameplay is focused on progressing through dungeons, most of which involve collecting keys by exploring (which was ok) or navigating jumping puzzles. The puzzles were bad because they would often require precision to complete, while the controls are so far from precise as to be on another planet entirely. I can't explain why a game designer would do that. It's simply a bad decision.

The one saving grace is the bosses. They are generally well designed and tough, but in a fun way. They're pattern based, so you just need to learn their moves and then nail a good attempt. However, my enjoyment of the bosses was marred by glitches. After completing them my character got stuck on a tile in the boss room not once, not twice, but three times during my play through. It really takes the fun out of the experience and the fulfillment at beating a boss when you have to immediately do it all over again because of bad programming.

Finally, the story is incredibly weak. If it had been better it might've overcome all the other issues, but it's simply non-existent for the most part. There are [i]hints[/i] at something deeper at the very beginning and the very end, but most of the game is devoid of any larger meaning than ""move from point A to point B.""

I went in wanting to like Anodyne, but it was not fulfilling in any of the ways I hoped it would be. Maybe other people can enjoy this sort of thing, but it's not for me.",1516750475,1516750681,False,20,0,0.704235494136810303,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Anodyne is an action game where you explore dungeons and defeat bosses. There are 6+ dungeons in the game. The ""plus"" referring to those dungeon-like areas without bosses.

[h1]Music[/h1]
Most (if not all) of the musics in this game give off the relaxing vibe. I really like the musics and they blend with the environments perfectly

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses 2D pixelated graphics. The areas look beautiful and the mappings are decent. The level designs are also good, except for some dungeon areas that are not ""square shaped"" which makes the map looks confusing with the area being connected to each other or not.

[h1]Story[/h1]
To be honest, i don't really get the story. At first, you're told to protect the Briar, and all you end up doing is going to dungeons for ""training"". There isn't much interactions for the story to clear it up (and i think the main story is only in the near beginning of the game and the near end of the game), although there are some facts written in the stones (which is scattered in the world) which holds some info of the game's setting.

[h1]The Game[/h1]
The game will start by teaching you the controls. After you finish the tutorial, you'll be moved into an area called nexus, which is a gateway that lets you to teleport to all areas easily, provided that you have opened the portal. After you finish the first dungeon with a boss, you'll be able to finish the other major dungeons in any order that you want. However, i'm having some trouble in accessing these dungeons because i don't know how to reach to some places [spoiler](i don't know that you can step on dust to travel in water)[/spoiler] until i move around between the areas a lot of times.

There isn't that many areas in the game, although i like how you can finish the dungeons in any order that you want. The bosses in the game isn't very hard either; i usually just keep on attacking the boss until it dies, without caring much about my HP (the bosses will usually die faster than me). The only exception for this is the last boss where you need to think a little to beat it. There is also one boss that's super easy that i don't really need to move in order to kill it [spoiler](the second boss in the apartment / hotel dungeon)[/spoiler].

There are also some reaction based puzzles in the game. Some of them are quite easy, but some, especially in the [spoiler]debug[/spoiler] area is quite hard that you have to retry the puzzle several times if you're not that good. This makes it worse since you have to go through a long walk to the puzzle area again if you fail. There is also a ridiculous area where you have to wait for like 2h in order to get a secret (one of the collectables in the game). Luckily it's not required to beat the game.

If you play this game thinking because you want to play some Zelda-like games, then you have to stop. This game isn't really on the same genre. Sure, you have a weapon, a few health bars, and some dungeons to explore, but that's all there is to it. There isn't any puzzle in this game that requires you to think (most of them are reaction based), and you can only utilize your main weapon to kill enemies (there isn't any additional equips for you to use, except for some weapon upgrades that can help you kill enemies easily). Most bosses can be beaten in the same way; you don't even need to remember their attack pattern. But even without that, the game itself is enjoyable-

Except for the post game content. After the game introduces the last weapon upgrade, you basically can move everywhere, including to ""glitched"" areas that's not supposed to exist. This poses a problem when you end up having non walkable tiles on the other side of the screen and the screen where you came from, since you'll have no other choice except by teleporting to nexus and start over from scratch. Plus, you also need to spend a very long time by going through the glitched areas to find the secret items without using a guide. Just for a measurement, it too me ~4h to finish the game for the first time and it took around 2-4h to collect the other collectables. This is not including some secret collectables that can only be obtained with a glitch since i read somewhere that you'll lose all of your collectables if you collect it.

Speaking of collectables, there are some cards and secret items that you can collect in the area. The cards are usually easy to get since they are in the treasure chests. The secret items, on the other hand, might be hard to find since you'll have to explore to all possible glitched areas with your weapon upgrade in order to find the secret areas which has the secret items in it.

Pros:
- 6+ dungeons
- Collectables
- You can finish most dungeons in any order that you want

Cons:
- Most of the bosses are too easy to kill
- Annoying ""puzzle"" where you have to wait for hours just to get a secret item
- ""Glitched"" areas can be annoying if you want to explore the map

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This is an action game where you explore dungeon and kill bosses. The game's main content is quite short, around 4 hours, which can be shortened if you're doing a speed run.

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]

The Short of it: Here, take this broom. It's dangerous to go alone. Imagine Legend of Zelda, but hella' creepy. Like Zelda inside a nightmare of a clinically depressed person lost in space. Very organic, and artsy, and unnerving to be honest. I oddly liked it.

Pros +

- Old School pixil graphics, that actually ADD to the strange mood set by this game.

- Not expensive for what you get, and well worth the price tag in my opinion.

整个游戏充满了meta元素，在一周目你可能不会感到很惊讶，但在游戏通关之后你才发现新的未知世界的大门向你打开了，你能去之前不能去的地方，拿到之前拿不到的东西，还有很多有趣的彩蛋。整个游戏充满着恶搞、调侃和创意，游戏的氛围也给我一种很特别的感觉。听说这个游戏当年在参加某场独立游戏比赛时只拿到了三等奖，现在我倒是很好奇前面两个游戏是什么了。PS：这个游戏的bgm也做得很不错[strike] 这年头果然做个独立游戏都得要全才 [/strike]
当然作为独立游戏，这个游戏也是有不足的，一个是游戏的难度可能对于某些手残玩家不够亲切，另外就是整个游戏的剧情部分感觉交代的不是很清楚，没有一种代入感。
总体来说我还是挺喜欢这个游戏的，就如奶牛关的一片评测说的那样，对这个游戏最恰当的一个描述词可能就是[b] 沧海遗珠 [/b]了

I'm a programmer by trade and have been planning an indie game of my own for several years now but wanted to find some titles  of a similar style to play through for inspiration and as a way to critique my own ideas. At first glance Anodyne seems overly simplistic and I wasn't sure if I'd like it but after giving it a few hours there is far more depth here than I expected and I'm truly enjoying it.

The devs for this game are huge fans of the original 8-bit and 16-bit Nintendo (and Super Nintendo) Entertainment Systems. The clues are everywhere in subtle and no so subtle ways, like the inclusion of a certain NPC who is heavily inspired by one of Nintendo's most memorable characters (no spoilers here).

Anodyne is heavily influenced by the original 8-bit and 16-bit Zelda games. From exploring dungeons and collecting power ups, to solving puzzles and revisiting areas to explore them further once your new items have unlocked new capabilities - Anodyne plays in a very familiar fashion. But while Anodyne may have been heavily influenced by Zelda the devs have definitely crafted a unique adventure of their own here.

I've not yet finished the game but I'm curious where the story is going. The dimensional gateways and certain story elements, such as the depth of dialogue between Young and some of the eccentric characters he meets along the way, as well as certain areas I've explored with unexpectedly dark subject matter suggests an ending with a bigger punch than I could have anticipated when I first purchased the game.

Summary: Anodyne is a surprising gem of a game with great music, classic retro-styled graphics, familiar (simple) gameplay mechanics, lots of beautiful and unique regions to explore, puzzles to solve and what appears to be some deep existential subject matter.",1509073378,1509073378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But I can't promise that that time will be good.

The game is unpolished. Every jump I made had me sweating because I could never tell if the distance would be enough, and enemy encounters left some rooms feeling starved for space to dodge.

But the story may be the worst of it. At best, it feels confused. At worst, what major themes the story can be recognized to have make the narrative as a whole into a poorly executed attempt at self-reflection and escapism; leading to the story reward at the end of a frustrating dungeon being a critique the act of playing video games.

Pros: very simple, bewildering exploration into these surreal worlds.  the characters themselves can act unpredictably, like walking by a bunch of normal npcs, but suddenly one looks over and runs after me to attack.  the world, dungeons, and puzzles are all very very connected and have shortcuts if you ever wish to backtrak.  its quite a unique experience and im glad i actually bought it.

>>> Gamplay:  the biggest draw of this gmae to me is the exploring, the dungeons, puzzles and brutal enemies wihtin are all very well doen and get hard in their own right with puzzles and mazes makign you have to think outside the box to see how the areas you are in are connected.  but aside form all that the experience of thes eplaces as a whole was the most fun for me.  if youre not exploring a dungeon, youre explring the otuside world or some area without enemies.  but all areas have plenty of paths and variety in music and play to amke them feel unique, it really helps for not getting lost as well.  the music and the off tone of the game and the text youll get from people really gives you this unsettling feel, you're made out to be a protagonist as you go off into this world and commit horrible acts, some good some not, but the game doesnt tell you if what youre doing is right or wrong.  you end up pondering it yourself and makes it a much more rmemeberable expeirence imo than say ""heres the bad ending, bad things happen"" or such or even consequneces.  yeah there are consequences for some certain actions but it comes off as geniune from the characters themselves. 

The asthetics pull you in well enough if you enjoy 8bit, the music is unsettling with each new unsettling place you wander through, enemies are dangerous and clever, you will end up having to use your wits a good bit to get through unscathed without being lucky.  as i've said before the game is well done in all its areas, its quite fun as well and a great experience.  however as ive also said, its not for everyone.  people in the review section hate how the puzzles require you to figure shit out rahter than be meaningless wastes of time, people argue that the events inside mean nothing, its all nonsense and that may be true but the experience of it all is still worth playing through.  people are complaining about the lack of upgrades when you can get 4x your starting health and a few upgrades to help you out and decide your mode of combat, normal broom, narrower but longer 2 sqaure reach broom, or the defensive 3 sqaures in front of you broom.  its all basic yes but its all you really need.  the game wouldnt improve by throwing in more and more gimmicks or useless upgrades.

EDIT:  there is a series on youtube that compiled the remarks and happenings of the plot and analyzed them.  it was also quite cohesive after all, the issue is simply that you would get these messages and snippets of the plot and what your character percieves and is going through every few long hours of gameplay.  not a bad choice imo but much like final fantasy tactics, when the story is so split up among hours or even days of gameplay and offtime, people will forget what is said and happening and will have a faulty recollection of the plot (example of ffta is that Marche the main character is seen as a douche for wanting his friends to come back and restore reality, he knows they cant live in this fantasy world forever, its unhealthy to hide from life's troubles inside a fantasy world, aside from that but never brought up, every other friend or family member outside the small group of frineds that was there for the opening of the book have been transformed or may have even vanished, the bullies at school became zombies for instance,  its quite unsettling to think what may have happened to your own famliy in this fnatasy world if they can even turn into monsters of all things.   but yeah most people that played the game forget the dangers of leaving your actual life behind and wnat to jump into the fantasy world.  partly the games fautl but it gave you the freedom to ignore the plot missions indefinitely, and partly the players for forgetting the plot.)",1506637685,1512548379,True,5,1,0.584929764270782471,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Repetitive soundtrack

After playing through a few metroidvanias and other games with endless upgrades, Anodyne's simple gameplay was a breath of fresh air. You [i]can[/i] find a handful of improvements for your weapon, but they're entirely optional. What's important is learning how to read enemies' attack patterns. Monsters in general are used sparingly, often as part of the carefully-crafted puzzles. They're part of the environment, rather than mere obstacles. There's never the sense the developer is throwing enemies at you to arbitratily raise the difficulty.

Speaking of difficulty, the puzzles are exactly as hard as they should be. I only had to go looking for hints online twice in the entire game, yet I never felt like I wasn't being challenged. I can't compliment the level design enough.

While the gameplay is remniscent of classic Zelda, the writing and atmosphere reminded me of the bizarre dream exploration in Yume Nikki. Anodyne is an unusual story about relationships, and how far we're willing to go to hold on to people even when we know we can't always make them happy. At least, that's what I got out of it. It's cryptic at the best of times, but thankfully it's not just garbled nonsense. There are recurring themes and motifs that tie everything together, and what we see of the characters and their relationships is enough to stay invested over the course of the plot. Your mileage may vary, of course. Personally, I felt quite fulfilled by the ending.

TL;DR: Anyone who's willing to play along with the surrealism, or who's just in it for the puzzles, should pick up a copy of this game ASAP.",1500536583,1516342886,True,3,0,0.538213133811950684,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[url=https://cowlevel.net/article/1897447]人们常常不知道，这，也是metagame —— 镇痛 | Anodyne : 千字简评[/url]

[h1]前言[/h1]

若要用一个词描述《镇痛》，大概应该就是——
[b]沧海遗珠[/b]
这个词的意思是，有些东西极具价值，却又机缘巧合地被普遍忽略了、错过了。

[h1]整体观感[/h1]

“pixel画风”、“rogue-lite”，这些关于游戏形式的标签在独立游戏之中越发泛滥的现在，《镇痛》这一强个性、高质量，又不热衷于给自己贴标签的作品，可算是难得一见又惊艳动人。

有一类独立游戏常常会被自己或人们贴上“meta”这一标签，严格地讲，它们中的大部分其实是名不副实的。人们更像是混用了[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Fourth_Wall]“破第四墙”[/url]、[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecation]“自我反讽”[/url]、[url=https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%99%E8%BF%B0%E6%80%A7%E8%AF%A1%E8%AE%A1]“叙述性诡计”[/url]、[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming]“metagame”[/url]这几个标签。从标签的字面含义上看，其实，我的Steam游戏库里只有《镇痛》与《[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/]Oneshot[/url]》这两部可以算入“metagame”标签之下。
这个意义上，《镇痛》可以算是属于一种[b]珍稀[/b]的游戏门类。写下这篇文章，也算是为了纪念《镇痛》的那别具一格的个性，也纪念我那 [strike]半途而废的[/strike] 奔着100%完成度所付出过的努力。

顺便一提，《镇痛》制作人的另一款游戏《[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265470/Even_the_Ocean/]Even the Ocean[/url]》也很有个性。我没有玩过，但主角的人设（与《镇痛》的人设风格一脉相承）给我的印象不得不说是过目不忘……

故事方面，《镇痛》的剧情很是隐晦，甚至有些意识流的味道。好在，玩家不必须弄清楚故事在讲什么也能好好玩下去。因此，剧情方面，我就不讨论也不评价了。

[h1]如何玩（表·Anodyne）[/h1]

玩法上，一看就知道《镇痛》显然属Zelda系。流程推进机制与2D的Zelda几乎一样：到达新区域 → 探索 → 攻略地下城 → 得到新道具 → 走向下一区域。同时，《镇痛》对2D Zelda系的游戏机制与游戏要素做了一些精简化，只保留了2D Zelda系游戏的精髓。例如，实际上[b]可使用道具[/b]只有一种：退魔圣剑 扫帚（可解锁两种进化形态），各区域中NPC只有一、两个。总的说，在玩法上在内容上《镇痛》与初代Zelda会比较接近，甚至似乎比初代Zelda更简洁（Steam评测区有人说是“简陋”）。另外，关于流程与故事的信息在游戏中并不很显著，玩家可能会常常陷入“莫名其妙来到了新区域不知道怎么的就过了一关接着还没准备好就通关了”这样的状态。嘛，这个过程其实并不折磨人，倒是常会让人感到迷惘。
这个到处乱碰的过程中，玩家很快会察觉游戏流程的主线索：[b]收集卡片[/b]。

所谓卡片，它们的存在是为了被收集，与剧情道具作用类似，当收集数满足一定的标准后，可以解锁一些剧情锁或地图锁（如：要见最终boss，要求主流程36张卡片全收集）。
实际游戏中卡片总数是49（见上图；全卡片图鉴：[url=http://anodyne.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Cards]Anodyne Fandom Wiki[/url]）。然而，在主流程中能通过正常手段获得的卡片，总数只有37=36+1；剩余的12张卡片要到通关以后解锁新道具Swap手环，才能通过“特殊手段”进入隐藏区域获得。

“特殊手段”指什么？
总的说，都是些meta gaming的玩法。

[h1]玩什么（里·Anodyne）[/h1]

与一周目（Zelda系冒险）时不同，post-game流程（为免与new game+混淆，我就不叫“二周目”了）中，主角解锁了神器Swap手环（作用是[b]交换地图网格块[/b]），于是，他几乎是一夜间化身成了游戏管理员，从此踏上破地图、造glitch、玩bug、撕NPC等大胆而奇妙的冒险。游戏目标变成在各个隐藏“里关卡”穿梭，集齐49张卡片。其中有些环节还必须借meta玩法才能完成，例如，有张卡片要求玩家激发[b]“场景切换glitch”[/b]才能获取。

光是文字描述也许还是有点抽象。举个有剧透的、直观一点的例子吧。
区域Woods（树林）的地图隐藏了一个post-game卡片的获取方法的提示。若不借用meta玩法，基本上不可能发现这个提示。若不介意剧透，可以点击下方链接瞄一眼地图全景。当然，被剧透了的话，惊奇感也自然会被[b]破坏[/b]；未通关请慎点。

[url=http://anodyne.wikia.com/wiki/Woods?file=Woods_map.png]Woods - Area Map - Anodyne Fandom Wiki[/url]

将bug、glitch、wiki、PC文件夹等“机制外”元素视为游戏内容的一环——而且本身不是kuso游戏——这类游戏并不多见，做得恰到好处而不矫揉造作的更是罕有。
我认为，我的游戏库中只有《镇痛》与《Oneshot》这两部够资格被称为metagame——在metagame中，玩家把玩的[b]对象[/b]不再是[b]内容[/b]（故事、任务、谜题、战役，etc.），而是[b]形式[/b]（规则、玩法、机制、贴图，etc.）。如果说通常情况下玩家是在[b]玩游戏[/b]，那meta gaming就是在[b]玩如何玩游戏[/b]。认识层次的错位与跳升，往往可以使得多数metagame给人感觉“不平凡”。虽然《镇痛》的精华多在post-game的meta部分，但是商店页面却没有标示这方面的信息。对公众忍住不提自家精华，这种做法与《[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/]Undertale[/url]》《[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/536890/Glittermitten_Grove/]Glittermitten Grove[/url]》很像，遗憾的是《镇痛》的名气远远不如此二者，因而无法借助名气在不剧透的前提下推广自己。

[h1]结语[/h1]

游戏的精华大多在post-game环节，这使得一周目的体验有些平平无奇，甚至枯燥、无聊。很多玩家（包括我 =_=）也许会因而一不留神错过了这部佳作。
试一试本作吧（记得要通关哦~），若你在追求有趣体验的话，也许会是一份意外惊喜。",1499684676,1500457544,True,43,2,0.773761153221130371,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Collecting cards makes the game feel like a scavenger hunt across the varied worlds.

Some dialogue and texts make me wonder if there is some sort of meta story going on, but if there is, I haven't quite discovered it.

I'd say this plays like YUMI NIKKI, but it's not as ""out there"" and there are also jumping puzzles and light combat that I'm finding enjoyable; nothing strenuous. You can't zone out, but this isn't Super Meat Boy, either! I enjoy the way the character moves through the screen, important for these 2D games! 

But! I have a warning for parents or the sensitive: on the first day, I spent about 2 hours on the game and encountered no cursing. On my second day of playing, I was surprised to discover some R-rated language in the dialogue of some NPCs. Since the game so far had appeared extremely family-friendly (I mean, you're not even given a sword to fight with!), I was really thrown by that. It felt very out of place to me. 

But so far that's my main complaint. Overall, this game scratches the right itch for me. Need to escape for a while but still be engaged and challenged? ANODYNE's a great place to visit!

There is a story to be had here, one that you'll have to both look for and make assumptions to grasp. There are rooms filled with muttering duplicates without reason, and there is a circus deep inside a cave. Your weapon of choice? A broom. 

It's engaging and exciting to see what oddities come your way throughout the game, and the aesthetics are sublime. Sound design is great, and while I'm not a huge fan of the vertical slice the game is framed in (nor some of the initial keybindings, but you can change that in the options), it creates a unique little space for one to explore and plenty of interesting perspective tricks that might not've been as effective were it presented differently. 

The gameplay can be a bit stodgy, but the dungeon design never fails to stay interesting, and the odd urban aesthetics in the later stages craft a near eldritch experience in their odd familiarity, filled with abstract shadows that chase you and bizarre conversations. It borders on dadaism, honestly. The earlier dungeons fit more standard tropes, albeit with increasingly fascinating design. The puzzles are generally simple, and never made me pause for more than a few moments until the very last few on the main path. The collectables and their puzzles tend to be far more interesting, and the farther off the beaten path you go, the more complex they become. All for what amounts to cute car!

At first play, it's a quaint little Zelda clone where you use a broom instead of a sword.
Once you go a bit deeper, it's a depressing manifesto of the dev's psyche.
Once you beat it though, it's pretty disappointing. You'd think that with the story setup and the way that the dialogue progresses from the mid- to late portions of the game, the narrative would evolve and culminate into something worthwhile at the end.

It doesn't.

Pros:
+Decent writing (mostly)
+Good pixel art
+Good music
+Solid Gameboy-era Zelda gameplay

This game falls short in 2/3 categories.

Art: 6/10. The vistas in the cliffs were lovely, but many of the outdoor maps left something to be desired. You can design a pixellated tree and call it a tree, or you can design a pixellated tree and it will be freaking-beautiful-how-can-one-squeeze-that-much-detail-into-a-pixellated-tree sort of pixellated tree. So while I wasn't blown away, or even mildly wowed by the art, I love bit-style games, period. But they're difficult to bring to life unless paired with a solid, captivating story.

Story: 2/10. Anodyne drops you into the game without any back story, any context of the worlds you visit or creatures you speak to, any idea of what to do, any inkling of a purpose, not matter how you might search. ""That's alright,"" I thought, ""I like open world exploratory games. This'll be fun."" The difference between an exploration game and Anodyne is that if you decide not to participate in the main quest line, it's assumed there are other quests around to pique your interest. Anodyne is not only devoid of a main quest line; it is devoid of any quests at all. The closest thing I found to a quest was a talking bear that asked me if I had any berries. The game is generally light on text, and those creatures that do speak to you have no information, useless or otherwise. (Edit: Okay, I lied. There is a main quest line in which a creepy mage person (can't tell if it's male or female) tells you that you must do something to save something, a quest which your characte blindly and wordlessly accepts. It happens so quickly and so casually that I can't even remember the specifics of it all.)

Music: 8/10. The music has been the saving grace of Anodyne. They did a fantastic job creating atmosphere and differentiating one map from another. Only one song was catchy enough to get stuck in my head, but I found all the music to be very enjoyable. (Applause!)

I've seen reviews that the controls were a bit clonky. I found them to be decent at best, tolerable at worst. My only complaint is that it's extremely tough to judge where a jump will land when one jumps north or south. The amount of times I died attempting to get a feel for it over some chasms in a cave is embarassing.

Overall, this game had a lot of potential for me but ended up being a disappointment. The lack of direction left me wandering in circles across several maps trying to figure out how to progress in the game, resulting in loss of interest. Kudos to the developers for creating a cool game, but their abstract method of storytelling (giving them the benefit of the doubt here) isn't going to be for everybody.",1487359613,1487359931,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Otherwise, WAIT UNTIL IT'S ON SALE!!

So only get this if you're feeling nostalgic and want to feel like playing a Zelda-like game.

I played Anodyne from start to finish, and overall was disappointed because I was expecting a lot more out of the story, when it turned out that there really wasn't much of one. You have no idea about the the world around you, your character's motive, the main villain, or any friendly NPC. Anodyne isn't even bolstered with loveable characters, since there are very few major ones and you rarely interact with them. Almost every piece of dialogue is a dumb pun or a lame ironic joke, which was endearing and cute in the beginning in small doses, but was VERY overused throughout the entirety of the game and ended up being obnoxious and empty quips.

The game tries and fails to form a backstory by inserting weird item/descriptions and strange character dialogue in an attempt to be cool and mysterious (much like the Dark Souls games do, except Dark Souls actually succeeds at doing so), but these numerous parts don't actually amount to anything except a pile of vague foreshadowing that alludes to nothing. One glaring example of this is the title of the game, which a quick Google search resulted in the definitions ""not likely to provoke dissent or offense; inoffensive, often deliberately so"" or ""a painkilling drug or medicine."" Neither of these definitions has any apparent significance to the story, characters, or setting of the game.

The game seemed cool because I like adventure games, especially those in the Zelda series, but the game seemed to lose direction the more I played it, concerning the story and the world that the creators were trying to build. This resulted in a mediocre game that I finished only because of cool monster designs, Zelda-like gameplay, and my unhealthy love of puzzles.",1482988724,1482988724,False,4,0,0.525699615478515625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay is rather boring and controls are often a nuisance. The story is hard to understand and it makes it uninteresting. Levels' design varies nicely and it is the most pleasant aspect of the game and its strongest point.[/b]

[b]STORY[/b]
Story is either too hard to understand or poor. Whatever the reason is it makes it hard to keep track of what's going on. It could might as well have had no sense at all as the game is made in a dream-like style. It means it could have been just as abstract as the dream itself (which would make an interesting concept if it's true). The humor was nice, there were a few places where I had a good laugh.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Basically the game is about exploring, looking for collectibles, solving puzzles and fighting.
EXPLORING. The world is build of many different areas, areas are build of levels. Levels are screen-wide squares, you can see one level at the time and you move from level to level. The biggest problem here is lack of a proper map. Sure you have a symbolic map but it's just gray squares. It shows only how levels in the area you're actually in are connected, nothing more. It means you have to wander through the levels until you memorize what's where. It's important because it's an open world and you will have to come back to the same places a few times. Too much walking could make you feel a little bored.
COLLECTIBLES. In order to progress you have to find cards which will open the gates to the next areas or locked levels.
PUZZLES. Most of the puzzles are easy. However the game won't hold your hand and you'll have to learn everything yourself. Puzzles varies in different areas which is nice.
FIGHTING. There are different kinds of enemies and you have to adapt to their style of fighting. It's rather simple though. Also every boss has it's own style but they're not that difficult either. Your biggest enemy will be the controls. I've died so many times becuase my character didn't do what I wanted or because I've jumped into the hole.

[b]VISUALS[/b]
It's very retro pixel art style so you have to be a fan of it to appreciate it. For sure diverse design of the areas is simply the greatest point of this game. Black and white town will always remain in my mind for its creepy and unique atmosphere.

[b]SOUND[/b]

The main goal is find all of the cards located in treasure chests throughout the world and dungeons.

The overworld is mainly for exploring and has very little in the way of enemies. There are a few scattered environment puzzles. The dungeons have more enemies and puzzles.

The game is fairly non-linear, usually having quite a few different areas available to explore. Once you find enough cards you can open doors to new areas, giving you more options to explore.

There isn't much in the way of tools in the game, you mainly just look for cards and a few secret Easter eggs. There are a few upgrades for the weapon that can be found but that's about it. 

At the very end of the game you're given a tool that lets you swap any two tiles, allowing you to actually remove walls and go through to screens you would never normally be able to get to. There are actually quite a few hidden areas with cards in them that are only accessible with this tool. This has a very ""hacky"" feel to it which I really thought added a new dimensionto the game after it's already been completed.

-Playtime-
The game is fairly short. Expect only 4-7 hours on a first play through, depending on how much backtracking you do. With the correct route the game can actually be completed in only about 2 hours.

-Achievements-
The big one here was to find 100% of the cards which requires you to go back through a lot of the areas with the tile swap tool. I enjoyed the treasure hunt of tracking down all the cards and having to use the swapper really added a different feel to it at the end. The other notable achievement is the speedrun, completing the game under 3 hours was actually fairly easy with the correct route.

It started off fantastic, with a heaping amount of fantastic pixel art, music, and generous dose of Zelda like gameplay, with a few funny little quips, and a slight smattering of (What I've heard of) Undertale, where not everything is quite as it seems, and not every ""enemy"" is actually an enemy. It falls apart beyond that however.

Essentially it goes as follows, Music, Pixel Art, Atmosphere get a 10/10. It's fantastic.
Gameplay... starts off strong, but a later mix of poor platforming and frankly irritating enemy types bring it down. 6.5/10
Story... there is none. It vaguely hints at some ideas and that's about it.
Buy it on sale, play until it irritates you/lose interest, and leave it. And only if you REALLY like Zelda-likes.

It starts off mysterious, and genuinely grips your curiousity, but through playing the game to completion... the best I can figure is that it's a sort of story (If you're willing to call it a story) about the human condition and certain feelings that people display. It's ridiculously bare bones, with only a VERY slight amount of text that actually makes you understand anything, and only about that specific topic. There's boss fights that don't actually seem to have any symbolism in their design (But I'm also awful at spotting symbolism) and when they die they say gibberish like ""I'll always be with you."" What the hell is that supposed to mean? Nothing is ever explained, shown or even hinting at something allowing you to make your own conclusion. In the beginning I was completely hooked, by the end I knew it couldn't really go anywhere, and at the end... I was left making that Jackie Chan ""Huh? What?"" face.

Speaking of bosses... these are some of the most... confusing bosses I've ever fought. A fair few I'm not even sure what I actually did/was supposed to do, and I beat the game. A lot of them are just plain annoying, some are underwhelming (In a game that really doesn't have any build up) and some are actually decent.
The final boss was the most confusing, with you trying to frantically figure out how in the hell to damage the damn thing while it's attacking you.

They also get to a point in level design where they have you start doing platforming... which goes horribly wrong about 90% of the time. Sometimes you jump, catch the edge, think your fine, then the game decides you catually didn't and tosses you down the hole.

良い点
・穏やかなグラフィック
全体的にダークな雰囲気を醸しており、色が暗めです。
その所為か、比較的落ち着いた色彩となっています。
例えていうなら、ノスタルジックというか、なんとなく懐かしいような気分に浸れます。

・不思議な雰囲気
グラフィックとBGMにマップごとの登場人物が上手くマッチしていて、

・好きなところから攻略できる
ストーリーの進行上、ある程度は決まっていますが、
それなりにマップが広く、好きなように探索できます。
ゆめにっきのようにうろつくのが好きな人には嬉しい仕様です。

悪い点
・詳細に語られないストーリー
ゲーム中に散りばめられた情報を拾って、ストーリーを推察する、
といったゲーム作りがされています。
雰囲気ゲームにはありがちですが、ゲームとしては不親切かもしれません。

・斬新さに欠ける
言ってしまえば2Dゼルダの伝説のオマージュなので、
その点については新しいところはほぼありません。グラフィックが違うだけで。
雰囲気ゲームをゼルダのシステムを借りて作った。という感じです。

・やり込みが虱潰し過ぎる

よほどこのゲームが好きでなければ出来ないでしょう。
また、割く時間もそれなりの長さになるかと思います。

When I was growing up, one of my favorite games was Link's Awakening. I liked it more than the other Zeldas because of the unique dreamlike atmosphere it had. Anodyne copies the gameplay, and doubles down on the atmosphere to an astonishing degree. It's a truly unique specimen.

The gameplay is about what you'd expect. Walk around, solve puzzles, hit things with a melee weapon (In this case a broom, not a sword). It will feel particularly Zelda-y at first, but it begins to gain its own identity as time goes on. At first I considered the game's lack of items to be its biggest flaw, but on further consideration I think this is part of what gives it its identity. The limited number of options give the combat and puzzles a certain ""purity"" to them. There are no ways to ""cheat,"" no easy way to win, just you and the challenge presented by the game. It's extra impressive since the difficulty curve is very smooth, and provides some genuine challenge by the end. Kudos to the level designers.

The game takes several notes from Links Awakening, but it is not the only card that Anodyne has to play. As you progress further into the game, more and more levels appear that are influenced by other games. There are levels that remind me of Earthbound, Last Survivor, LIMBO, and a lot of Yume Nikki. In fact, Anodyne's hopping between mysterious dream worlds with different art styles is eerily similar to Yume Nikki. A couple of level themes are even shared between the two. I found Yume Nikki's lack of gameplay very disappointing the first time I played it (I have since gained a greater appreciation), and Anodyne fixes essentially all the issues that I had with it. Calling it ""Yume Nikki with story and gameplay"" isn't quite correct, but it should give you a good idea of if this game would appeal to you.

Full Version:
Anodyne plays a lot like the older Zelda games like Link to the Past and Links Awakening. You travel around entering dungeons, finding keys to open more doors until you ultimately end up facing the dungeons boss. This game differs from Zelda in that the areas are all really different to each other with their own weird themes like a circus and a hotel for example. And they are all connected by a nexus that you can return to at any time. The nexus is useful as it saves you from having to backtrack through previously cleared areas to reach the one you want. Also instead of a sword your character fights with a broom for some reason. 

It doesnt manage to recreate the greatness of the classic Zelda games but it's still a good enough game in its own right. There isnt really much of a story to tie things together and what you're doing and why is a bit vague. But the dungeons are quite well designed, particularly the ones later in the game.

Good points:
- nice looking retro graphics and a pretty good soundtrack to go with it
- some interesting themed dungeons that are also well designed
-after killing the final boss the game has post-game content where you have a device that lets you glitch the levels to find some extra items

Bad points:
- controls felt pretty awkward on the keyboard. The game lets you configure a controller but it doesnt do a great job of that either with the controls being a bit buggy
- some of the jumping sections are infuriating, with the poor controls making it even more frustrating",1480024380,1480024380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Too many games and movies and books use dreams as a cheap shock or an easy way to spill characterization, ignoring the unique sensations and aesthetic of the subconscious. The developers behind Anodyne didn't take the easy way out here, because they've crafted an expansive dreamscape to explore that actually feels like the product of an unquiet mind. And not only that, they built a fun and engaging game on top of that hook.

Anodyne is the story of Young, a... youthful, platinum-haired fellow plumbing the depths of his own subconscious. I won't go into anymore detail than that, but the diverse cast of characters you'll come across in your surreal trip will happily fill in the gaps for you, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time. You'll control Young in a manner very similar to classic Legend of Zelda, from a top-down and pixellated perspective. While most of the game is exploring the strange and meaningful world, there is some combat to be had with your trusty broom and some puzzling, including some occasionally challenging platforming.

The world of Young's mind is the big draw here, because it does a magnificent job of approximating a series of dreamscapes. I mean, it's going to be different for everyone of course but Anodyne nails the universal logic of dreams, the seemingly inexplicable connections and non-sequiturs that do indeed represent events in the waking world. You'll start in pleasant, wind-swept meadows and mossy ruins but soon find yourself in impossibly-sprawling apartment complexes, twisting dungeons, ghostly towns, and stranger places still. They exist as real places would in a dream but connect and change in unexpected ways, lending them that key sensation of mystery and unfamiliarity.

It's not a horror game but the way that every location and creature is a little bit off gives a feeling of foreboding to the adventure. And there are definitely some horrifying things that happen, so that feeling is not at all unjustified. The low-key soundtrack helps a lot here too, setting the tone just right for your imagination to run wild. As you progress the environments get stranger and the creatures spout more nonsense, but it really does come together in the end to give you an idea of what it's all speaking to.

I've gone on a bit much about the atmosphere, but the gameplay is plenty solid enough to keep it entertaining. Young is spry and controls well, allowing you to weave around tricky foes and pummel them with your broom. You'll find upgrades to your weapon and mobility as well, along with collectible cards that provide additional insight on the world's denizens. Save points are plentiful and there's an expansive fast-travel system for the expansive world, so don't worry about missing key items or dying at inopportune times.

There's hardly anything to criticize here if you're down for a journey into the surreal. The story is good, the gameplay is tight, and the environments are crafted with expert care. It'll last you a few hours even if you don't go hunting for every little secret, too. I love great atmosphere and I love great gameplay, so I can barely contain my excitement for any title that combines the two. Anodyne is an excellent adventure game from top to bottom, and one of the few to really do dreamscapes justice.

It's already been three years since this game was launched, but when I beat it, I felt like I owed the developers this review.

You play the game in the shoes of a character called Young, who is in a mysterious quest to reach something called a ""Briar"" with the help of a sage called Sage. In your way stands an amazing world full of secrets, puzzles, enemies and landscapes to explore, and treacherous guardians to fight your way through. When you go deep into the game's world, you'll notice that it is... a brilliant metaphor, which I won't spoil (not that there's much to spoil three years after the game's launch, but still, I'd rather let uninformed players figure it out by themselves).

The game's world feels like a mix between Legend of Zelda and Yume Nikki, if that makes any sense. On one hand, it contains vast explorable maps with foes to fight aplenty, puzzles to solve, and items to collect, hence the Zelda comparison. On the other hand some of its maps are surreal, eerie and psychological, as though you were walking around a person's very fears and afflictions, hence the Yume Nikki comparison. The music always helps set the mood perfectly, sometimes being a simple eerie horror-like sound effect, and sometimes being beautifully composed tunes that go well with beautiful sections.

During the adventure, our hero Young counts on a single weapon: his trusty broom, and a few extensions to it, that modify its range. There is also a jumping skill to get across treacherous holes in the ground, and another awesome skill that I'd rather not spoil. The fighting mechanics are not the most innovative I've ever seen, but they're pretty fun regardless. Most boss fights are rather easy and formulaic, but thankfully never boring.

As for the dungeons, they're designed pretty well, making you solve simple puzzles, pick up keys to open up doors, backtrack to change the state of a switch or get a card you forgot, and ultimately reach the guardian of each area and beat it to a pulp. The dungeons occasionally get a bit redundant when, say, you see a button in a room that can only be reached by taking a long path through other rooms, and then going back to the same path to get to the door you opened, but that happens way less than necessary to make me frustrated.

When the game ended, I simply didn't want to go. I wanted to stay... a little bit longer, it's hard to explain.Thankfully, though, I was delightfully surprised to know this game had even more content in the post-game, which is rife with awesome secrets to find and a near open world-like freedom.

One thing I feel this game lacks, however, is the whole Zelda-like ""key and keyhole"" aspect. What I mean by that is in Zelda, upon getting a new tool, skill or weapon, you'll usually be pleased to realize that the item you just got can be used to get accross an obstacle you encountered previously, possibly to uncover a secret or to follow on to the next section of the game. In this game, however, the only situations where this happens (in a meaningful way) involve the jumping skill, which needs to be used in order to access an area in the Lake that leads to a card (said area, however, can also be reached by different means), and to reach the path that leads to the Briar. Sure, you also get to use trash from the ground as a raft, but that only comes up long after you already have the broom. This in particular bugs me a little, as I feel the game could be slightly better with a progressive ""unfolding"" of its world. 

I mean, sure, the lack of said ""key and keyhole"" obstacles meant that the game was more ""open"", meaning that one could go through the dungeons in many different orders according to their peference, but still, I feel like the developers could, perhaps, have included some optional sections with said unlockable obstacles, which you'd find on your way to each mandatory part of the game, so you can get back to them later, eager to see what they contain.

In spite of that minor complaint, I'm still very glad I got this game, as it is enjoyable, interesting, deep and simply awesome. Even though it's not as Zelda-like as I expected, it's still worth any action-adventure enthusiast's time, and I couldn't recommend it enough.",1477118435,1477118985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The windmill in the rainy area is one of the prettiest locations in the game, just for the lovely rain and reflection effects going on nearby; my favorite track plays in the hotel dungeon and has a very Stewart Copeland, Spyro the Dragon feel. I wish more of the game had made use of that style of music, just because.

The characters were charming, funny, and memorable. It's going to take me a long time to forget the wolf on top of the mountain who says he won't hurt you because he isn't like the others, the fisherman [spoiler]I accidentally murdered[/spoiler], and the man on top of the hotel who finds the lit windows of the city beyond to be one of the more beautiful things he's ever seen.

The puzzles are variations of kill-everything-in-the-room and press-the-switches, often forcing you to path into certain rooms from a different direction in order to step on an out-of-reach button. They're nothing fancy, but they get the job done and they keep you thinking about how to proceed.

I had fun in my playthrough of Anodyne and if you grew up with the Game Boy-era Legend of Zelda titles the way I did, you'll probably enjoy Anodyne, too. Anodyne is cute. Not $10 cute, in my opinion, but still cute. If you happen to catch it on sale, definitely pick up a copy.

That said...

There's something about the jumping and damage knockback mechanics that make rooms like the following pure agony to play through your first time. That this room occurs almost immediately after the jumping mechanic is introduced only makes it harder on the player.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=782804851
There often isn't enough of a perspective in Anodyne to really judge where you are in relation to the rest of the world, there are minimal invincibility frames at best when you're actually in the air, and there isn't any forgiveness when you go to touch back down. If your landing is not nearly pixel-perfect, be prepared to take damage, knockback, and/or fall and find yourself obliged to try again. It's a stark contrast from the Roc's Feather in the games that inspired Anodyne, which was the best item in those games precisely because it felt amazing to use. Jumping in Anodyne is anything but.

There is a room prior to [spoiler]Card #48[/spoiler] in the debug world that makes every other platforming challenge in Anodyne look like fun by comparison. The footholds are smaller and there is a [i]third[/i] roller, and if you screw up, you might accidentally leave the room when you respawn because the player's hitbox occasionally intersects with the view's boundaries when you fall into a pit and reappear. When that happens in the room leading to [spoiler]Card #48[/spoiler], it prevents you from finishing the series of platforming puzzles to acquire your reward and renders you incapable of either going forward or going back. You must commit suicide in order to try again from the beginning.

The precision platforming in Anodyne isn't well-implemented and it isn't fun to play. While it's passable in the main game because it's not a major focus, neither quality makes for a fun achievement ([spoiler]""Lots of Cards""[/spoiler]) for completionists to hunt. The extras in Anodyne are not worth the effort it takes to gather them. I collected all of them; I know.",1476827764,1476827960,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A great exploration game for people with autistic tendencies. Spent 30+ hours in post-game because I was so bent on unearthing all the secrets on my own, yet failed to do so and ultimately had to consult a walkthrough due to some uncalled-for post-game content design. ([spoiler]Go AFK for 2 hours to unlock a secret chest? Kudos to whoever figured this shit out...[/spoiler])

For those normal minds who don't suffer from this kind of obsession, or simply are not genuinely interested in the post-game, the main quest still offers a decent Zelda-like experience that one can expect to enjoy to a great extent.

[h1]Commentary[/h1]

Ostensibly, [i]Anodyne[/i] reminded me of [u][url=http://kotaku.com/5926951/this-might-be-the-best-way-to-play-zelda-at-work]Seedling[/url][/u] and a bunch of other low-budget, low-profile indie Zelda-likes whose names I could no longer recall; however, it didn't take long for me to realize my mistake, for the game was something far from dull and possessed the magic to completely draw me in. While the adventure would lead us to various beguiling places throughout the protagonist's oneiric world, it's the intricate maze design on par with top commercial titles in the genre that ultimately captivated my heart. The existence of several deliberately included [u][url=http://anodyne.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Glitches]tricks and ""glitches""[/url][/u] ([spoiler]and - I don't see this one being mentioned very often, but you can actually jump over two tiles at once with the right timing, which helps in quite a few situations[/spoiler]) that are crucial to uncovering wilder and ever wilder secrets in the post-game quest also hits right in the sweet spot for those of us adventurous and obsessive souls.

That being said, the game is not without its flaws. The lack of an immersive backstory, or even, a coherent narrative, is perhaps the single greatest shame of the title, barring it from becoming something truly memorable. It has also occurred to me that the post-game adventure didn't really actually belong to the game world any more; it didn't involve extra stories or supplemental lore or anything that could help explaining or expanding on the title, but rather felt like something totally out of context, hashed together simply for the sake of being put there. Such a pity, considering the game's potential.

Still, there's no denying that this is gonna be a fun game for most people. Also, as I was able to complete the speedrun challenge in 2 hours and 1 minute (with world maps open in my browser), difficulty-wise the game is suitable for gamers from every skill level.

I purchased Anodyne in a bundle back in 2013, played it for 10-15 minutes and then decided I wasn't enjoying the game enough to continue. I had barely even entered the first dungeon: the slow pace and Zelda overtones to the gameplay weren't terribly interesting to me.

About a week ago I decided to give the game another shot- and honestly, my opinion didn't really change too much for a while! Exploration was mildly annoying with the room structure showing *most* passages between rooms. There are a few places where the map doesn't include a connection, and a few places where a connection is shown but can't be accessed for quite some time. There's even at least one place accessible early on that has a room that can't be reached until after you've beaten the game.

The slow pace doesn't really pick up either, though the many uses for the dustballs placed throughout the world (puzzles, action, etc.) were cleverly put together. The level design overall isn't bad by any stretch, but it mostly felt... bland for the first half of the game. Perfectly servicable, but nothing too special.

What kept me playing despite the overall averageness of the game at this point was a combination of two things: achievements, and wanting to see what other surreal areas there were. The red sea/hellscape area in particular is what I stumbled upon early, and kept me playing the game. That's no small feat, to keep someone playing just off of what *might* be encountered next, so kudos to the devs for that. The cliffs dungeon and end of the acrobat/circus dungeon, as well as the entirety of the town area were quite unsettling: notably, the circus area was the last dungeon I completed, so to have something still unnerving even after the rest of the game is again quite impressive. A+ for atmosphere.

The final area was fairly underwhelming in comparison. First the easiest boss in the game, then an obtuse puzzle that's actually pretty cool, then a bunch of annoying platforming sections (the speed boosters and gas spewers in particular were frustrating to work around), then a bunch of combat sections, and then the final boss. The soundtrack here is very unfitting, and the fight comes down to safespot for 15 or so seconds, then either misdirect fire into dust or play tennis with an iceball. Meh. The ending itself... well, it's clearly meant to be symbolic of something, and maybe I don't get it, but it was pretty underwhelming. I would have preferred if the game ended after Sage, or even the Swap puzzle.

Combat is very simple. Attack with broom, avoid contact with enemies, avoid projectiles. Except when lions breathe fire in a way that can't be dodged or the lack of knockback makes some enemies trade hits. Probably the most questionably designed aspect of Anodyne.

Now, I mentioned the Swap. This one mechanic is what really shines here.

You're able to grab any two tiles (that you can reach) and swap their locations.

You can literally remake the world. (though it resets when changing screens)

You can get out of bounds basically anywhere (and there are secrets scattered throughout the world that can only be reached with this, or glitches)

The true ending of the game, even past the final boss, is an impassable gate that requires 49 cards. (There are only 48 total, including 11 only accessible after the swap. One of these is in a debug area where you can talk to avatars of the devs, one of which alludes to beating the game in 20 minutes...)

Now, this area doesn't allow swap usage and has a small platform off to the right. It's completely unattainable...except there are 2 different glitchy methods that can be used to reach it. Doing so awards card 49. You can then pass through the 49 card gate... and promptly get a garbled message and see a truly impassable 50 card gate.

That's the true ending, at least to me. Like the post-final boss ending, it's very open to interpretation, and maybe this one just resonated with me more. That even after everything, even after gaining every ability possible and using every known trick, there's still going to be something unattainable. The careful placement definitely demonstrates the porperty of diminishing returns: that putting in a lot more effort will sometimes only yield a marginal increase in output.

The achievement design ties into that as well: there's only 6, which is very few for this sort of game. Most games would award an achievement for each dungeon in turn, and it's refreshing to see it done differently. The first is obtained within 5 minutes of starting the game. The second is obtained halfway through the game- halfway! The third is obtained on beating the game, and another follows if everything was collected. The fifth is awarded for finding all 48 cards by thoroughly searching the out of bounds areas- this was the high point of the game for me.

The final achievement is awarded for meeting the first 100% requirement within 3 hours, and this is where everything ties together beautifully. Now, I'm a speedrunner at heart. I like playing through games over and over for faster times. I could definitely see myself doing that with Anodyne, both for 100% and any% glitchless.

And all because of one simple reason.
The swap is essentially unlocked by beating the game.
Finding card 49 requires working out the 'wiggle glitch'.
The wiggle glitch can be used virtually anywhere.
It can be used to skip the broom.
You can skip the jump boots
You can also skip getting the swap.
You can even skip the final boss and go straight to the ending screen.

Doing this after picking up the broom and the swap will allow you to play the entire game with the swap- and this makes the 100% speedrun target much easier. Took me a little over an hour and it was by no means perfect- remaking the world as I went was a lot of fun, and I even found a few bits of fascinating lore that I had missed on my first playthrough.

tl;dr
Anodyne is merely decent from a gameplay perspective. However, where it shines is the surreal and unsettling sections, the entire postgame, and potentially philosophical endings. Anodyne is one of those experiences that's proportionally enjoyable to what you're willing to put into it. The best part by far is the postgame, but it can take a lot of effort to get to that point and even then, exploration and experimentation are key.

Quite a strange game. Provides insight into the mentality of the person who whittles away their youth playing video games rather than engaging with the outside world, to the detriment of personal development or even mental health. It does this only halfway, however, as it effectively backs out of this angle around the end, with the final exchange of the game basically being ""okay, let's go get tacos lol"". 

And, really, aside from this element of the game, it is insanely forgettable. Have you playing Zelda? Okay, it will seamlessly blend into your memories of this game. The name Anodyne, then, is quite interesting, as it means ""Serving to alleviate pain"" as well as ""not likely to offend anyone"". The insights provided in the storyline are much what any gamer will have internally going on regardless, but...the gameplay is fairly inoffensive. Irritating with how difficult it is to pull off certain manuevers, but I have difficulty even remembering this game's existence until I see it in my Library.

It has the look of the original Zelda, but instead of a plucky young hero you play an aloof janitor name Young.  The game is played from an overhead perspective as you control Young through the various areas of the game.  You quickly become armed with a broom, and you better like it because that is the one weapon you will have throughout the game.  Unlike Zelda, rather than the player getting powered up, the areas you explore do.  The most you can hope for as far as power ups go is learning to jump and minor augmentations to your broom.  You must discover the proper route, the sequence of switches, or simply timing your jumps to fully explore each stage and defeat the enemies within them.  You'll receive little guidance on where to travel next, or what your objective might be.  Along the way, you'll find treasure chests containing cards, and magical gates that open when you are carrying enough cards.  The story, if you can call it that, makes very little sense.  You get the idea this might just be bizarre dream.  Throughout you will find homages to other NES classics subtly hidden throughout the scenery and dialogue.

Is it fun?  Yeah, it's fun.  One thing I appreciate is rather than requiring twitch reflexes the game often rewards a more methodical approach.  Once you find the pattern for an enemy or boss you can easily sidestep their attacks and take them out with little risk of injury, but if you try to rush you will probably take damage, or worse, be forced to retry the room.

Anodyne was... an interesting experience. Other reviews (even positive ones) seem to describe it as a bit bland and, despite enjoying it myself, I can agree.

From the outset, Anodyne felt rather low-energy; there wasn't enough variety in the mechanics to make it feel engaging. The often empty environment and soundtrack gave the world an eerie, ethereal tone, which bored me a little at first instead of intriguing me. After the first time I played, I took around a week to get back to continuing it.

That being said, why am I giving Anodyne a positive review?

As I continued playing, the world grew on me. I wasn't aware of a clear, linear plot, although perhaps the game didn't need that, for what it was. The absurd settings I encountered led me to want to interpret what I was seeing, to figure out what was going on for myself even when I wasn't playing. I'll exclude any interpretations I came up with so you can form them on your own. When I beat the game, Anodyne left me with some indescribable feeling... Though I remember being bored at first, I can only look back on playing it fondly.

In short: Anodyne is fairly simplistic in terms of gameplay. If you're expecting a Legend of Zelda clone, you're not really going to get it. It's the strange emotions resulting from the experience that sell Anodyne, for me; nothing you'd get an idea of from the store page.",1466299242,1466299242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Everything about it is very dream-like, from the environment to the soundtrack. Some of it made me feel a bit nostalgic and sad while sometimes it was just eerie.

It's difficult to make sense of the story but you do kind of get the idea. Do keep in mind that this is supposed to be your character's subconscious. It will make allusions to real life and how your character, Young, is just trying to stay out of it.

Even though it's left to interpretation quite a bit, it doesn't feel like one of these very artsy games that makes no sense no matter how you look at it and that any vague interpretation could somewhat match. It's dreamy but still fairly obvious.

The game never feels exceptional but it's fun to go through. It shows multiple good example of game design where the game will [i]show[/i] you that something is possible rather than tell you. You learn from doing and looking rather than reading.

Puzzles were never overly elaborate or complicated but required enough thinking that it felt satisfying to solve them most of the time. Some enemies were difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating.

The only thing I liked less of the game is the lack of ""tracking"". The lack of direction it has is perfectly fine as it just reinforces the exploration and adventure part. But there are some stuff that you will need to go back to later on in the game and the only thing the game tracks is where you've been. It would have been cool to see how many chests/cards you've obtained in each area. I found myself 2 or 3 cards short from being able to access the last area and just looked them up since I didn't feel like exploring every area I've been to another time.

Otherwise, it was a really mysterious and cool experience. Although it borrows a lot from Zelda, don't expect this game to be one, just similar in some regards.

Takes about 6 hours or so to finish, without skipping anything before the end of the game (there are some extra stuff once you're done). Considering this, 11$ might be a tad expensive but definitely get it if it's on sales.

[b]Update[/b]:
Followed a friend's advice and went back to get the remaining cards. I have to say, this further improve my opinion on this game.

I initially thought it would be a chore, the sort of collectible you see in every AAA that serve no purpose other than extend the play time.

I'll avoid spoiling anything but after completing Anodyne, you are given a tool which allows you to... Reach places you couldn't reach before. ...Including places you [i]shouldn't[/i] reach.

It's surprisingly cool to go back and try to find anything you could have missed, especially the way that you're able to. There's something hard to describe about it... It's kind of like spying, seeing things you're not sure you should see. It's the same feeling as whenever you use debug functions or any sort of ""wall hack"" in a game and start seeing stuff that are no visible in the main game.

It made me remember all the time I spent exploring in Ocarina of Time with glitches. Or lookin at all the unused content. Except in Anodyne, it's actually part of the game. There are a bunch of areas that are not accessible in the ""normal"" game, and a lot of hidden goodies in them!

The atmosphere is what stands out most to me--the overworld is serene and mesmerizing to explore, the dungeons vary in tone, and the game in general has sort of paradigm shifts that caught me off-guard in a way I very much appreciated.  The gameplay is very reminiscent of Link's Awakening, while subverting many of its key elements, and virtually eliminating item management by having the puzzles revolve less around items and more around how Young's broom interacts with the environment.  As a result, the puzzles tend to be simpler and easier than those in Zelda dungeons, but they are also quite imaginative and manage to stay fresh.

If I had anything negative to say about this game, it's that the hitboxes are a bit too big, which gets frustrating on any screen with holes or big rolling spike columns.  I also think that while it isn't necessary, it would have been nice if there were indicators on the map of where things like unopened treasure chests and boss rooms are, and more guidance for where to find the post-game items.

As a first attempt at a full on big project like this it makes me optimistic for Sean and Jon's other projects. Now, with that there are some pros and cons.

Pros
-Good soundtrack. I particularly love the Fields and Windmill themes as well as the final boss theme, ""Understanding"". I personally enjoy listening to OSTs outside of the context of the game and while you can do that easily with this OST and enjoy it in it's own right, the environments blend very, very well with the score here.
-Interesting area layouts. During the post-game exploration there are a lot of new places to go to add some challange and lore to the game world.
-Good dialogue. There are a few nice EarthBound-esque  moments in the dialogue.
-Interesting boss ideas. Yes, all of them come down to hit it 4-12 (respectively) until die, the ideas behind the bosses were at least neat.
-If you're like me and like non-standard, more surreal elements in level design then this has it in terms of the level concepts. This does, admittedly, take some inspiration from Link's Awakening (I also, litterally, see some Binding of Isaac in there as well) but never so much that I get ""rip off"" vibes ever.

Cons
-While the dialogue is good at points the story loses focus, especially when it comes to the post-game exploration. Once you've gone everywhere in search of every item and new area it leaves you with a sense of ""was that it?"", sadly. There's definitely some good ideas here, but with the somewhat oblique storyline - that addmittedly does add to the surreal aspects of the game - coupled with the overarching goal of the game being vauge even to the credits I can't help but feel there could be more done with it.
-This is a slightly personal thing but I really wish there were more achivements in the game to further reward replays. Not a big deal, but it's a minor nitpick. For a game where there's so many easter eggs and weird things to see (Elk) there could've been more unique achivements.

I will give one neutral remark: like I said I speedran this game for nearly 2 years and while I do know of more than a dozen huge glitches in this game, rest assured that you'll never run into them in this game. They're the type of glitches that you have to be purposfully trying to achive.

Overall I'd give this a recommend. Despite its flaws for a first go it's certainly more functional and interesting (not to mention fun) than a lot of first attempts at a full game.

Alcuni pro e contro:

Pro:
-Tendenzialmente facile quindi rilassante, non sempre però.
-Apprezzabile l'humor, in cui c'è perfino un Link di Zelda e un drogato
-Appunto, le citazioni: Zelda in primis.
-Stile di gioco alla Zelda
-Soundtrack FAVOLOSA: 11/10
-Stile grafico unico
-Post fine gioco ancora più divertente e, oserei dire, innovativo.
-Beh usi una scopa per uccidere nemici, e la polvere come ""zattera"" sull'acqua, c'è qualcosa di più bello?
-Gameplay non ripetitivo ed interessante.

Contro:
-Per l'appunto, la facilità, ma questo dovrebbe aiutare nella conlusione in poco tempo per l'archievment da speedrunner.
-Le poche ""scope"", non dico il numero ma veramente poche, si poteva fare di più, seppur non ce ne sia bisogno in questo contesto.

You play as a kid named Young, who has to explore The Land in order to save The Briar from the Darkness... yeah, Anodyne's pretty tongue-in-cheek about its Chosen One schtick.

You spend the game exploring strange, eerie environments, fighting monsters, and solving puzzles. These range from a highway, to a classic Zelda-style temple, to an apartment complex, to an 8-bit maze full of zombies. The devs definitely didn't skimp on the environmental diversity.

Like Yume Nikki, Anodyne's heavy on symbolism and light on explanations. (Why is the boss of the caves talking to you about video games? What's the deal with the Red Sea, and what are the things living in it?) The ending, as you'd expect, answers none of these questions and leaves the player even more confused. Maybe the postgame sheds some more light on things, but I doubt it.

There are a couple things I disliked, though. You can't get to the final dungeon unless you collect all 36 cards hidden around the world- there are markers telling you which area's you haven't cleared out, but it's still a pain going through the whole game trying to find the things you missed. The combat is pretty bleh- unlike Zelda, there aren't any special weapons, so bosses boil down to ""dodge their attacks and hit them until they die"", except the final boss, which is more of a puzzle than anything. There are some pretty brutal jumping puzzles toward the end of the game. And it's short: I beat it in about 5 hours.

Despite these flaws, Anodyne is still worth checking out- I had fun with most of the puzzles, and enjoyed exploring all the weird locales (the game's oppressive ambient soundtrack helped).

[h1]TL;DR, Verdict[/h1]
Recommend, however the resets make it frustrating, as puzzles and monsters will respawn/revert upon leaving and re-entering a room.

 [b]Pros[/b]

Humour/Dialogue
Good old school style adventure if you loved those types back on platforms like the game boy
Good music 
Good graphics for a game in this gerne 

[b]Cons[/b]

The resets
(the resets themself are really annoying and killed me multiple times so be aware of that) 
Sometimes feels a bit to much like a copy

 [h1]Gameplay[/h1] 

an RPG sprite side scroller game, your character travels the world(s) by jumping through portals, interacting with characters (with nice one liners and rocks that don't talk or passive aggressive rocks that have writing on them saying you have no friends). It's a game that seems savvy to itself and feels like a parody of story games. After all your legendary weapon is a broom, and the characters around you are either sarcastic or silly. Or wimps.

You need to save the world. Somehow. By smacking enemies with a broom. And solving puzzles also with your broom. It also reminds me a bit of the old Zelda games. Puzzles reset if you leave the room which is both a blessing and a curse, since it seems puzzles and monsters will reset even if you've solved/killed them as well. This is annoying if you want to explore everything. I like the game, but there are aspects I dislike, such as the resets. Personally it bothers me enough to not want to play for stretches of time since I have to keep repeating things each time I go to a room.

Graphics wise this game reminds me of old school Pokémon on the game boy, way back in those days before the dinosaurs were wiped out.

Multiplayer: No
Completion: 6 hrs
Cards: Yes
Cloud: Yes

The first thing you'll notice about Anodyne is how it is inspired from Zelda... in a strange surreal sort of way. You play as the silent protagonist Young in a real-time top-down action RPG. Armed with his trusty broom, Young sets out to battle the forces of... his mind? The game is curiously unclear about this. Going by in-game text only, it's anyone's guess where you are - Limbo? Someone's dream? Tartarus? A video game?

The first thing you are told is that you must reach something known as the Briar before darkness does. Young thus sets out on his journey to collect keys and cards in order to unlock gates in order to enter the next area. While keys make sense, it's peculiar that many gates require a certain number of cards to access. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the last gate requires obtaining nearly all the cards, and so you must do a lot of backtracking to find what you were missing. 

The game plays out in a number of different, often disjointed areas, notably modern ones. They range from streets, to caves, to suburbs, to hotels. It's cool, and it's well-drawn, but there's seemingly no coherence. Even if it's a dream world, there's no rhyme or reason ever given for why you may suddenly find yourself in an 8-bit dungeon. There's a town where you can go around stabbing npcs with a sword. It's creepy and unsettling, much like the music in the game, but you just accept it and move on. I feel there were some missed opportunities to expand upon these mysterious worlds. 

If there's one thing I want in the game, it's more items. Early on you are given your trusty broom, which is a fair enough starter weapon. But throughout the entire game you never get anything different. You can obtain alternative attack patterns, but in the end it's still a broom. The only other power you obtain is jumping (and eventually another late-game power). You don't even learn to dash. I would have liked ranged attacks, learn to set fire to things, communicate with the strange walkers, etc.

Anodyne boasts a remarkable large world map and a half a dozen moderately sized dungeons. While it can get a little confusing where to go sometimes, merely heading for parts of the map you haven't explored often sets you on the right path. The maps are fairly well constructed and have a nice open feel to them. I like that switches to open doors will often keep the door open so you don't have to repeat most difficult rooms you come across. There's some good enemy variety too, with unique AI patterns for each type of enemy you face. The boss battles are appropriately intense and often involved some gimmick. They have many varied attack patterns and genuinely feel like bosses, so good marks on that.

The game runs pretty well overall. I did occasionally clip into terrain, but other than that, there were no major bugs I found. I give Anodyine a 7/10. It doesn't quite live up to the legacy of Zelda, but it does manage to hold its own. Anodyone is a very commendable game to be accomplished with such a small team. I would have liked a more fleshed out story but I understand that's not what they were going for.",1448751427,1448751427,True,4,1,0.567313134670257568,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Verdict: I got Anodyne as a gift and it's been a game I've always been curious about. For my surprise, it took me on a trip back down memory lane to times when all I had game-wise was a GBC (my beloved and so missed crystal clear Japanese edition, so rare in the Americas) with Pokémon Crystal and TLoZ: Oracle of Ages. I had that GBC throughout my teen years and I finished both Pokémon and TLoZ: OoA way too many times to count. Later when I was 18-19 I had the opportunity (after all those years) to play TLoZ: Orace of Seasons, a game I've always wanted to try out (and actually the one I wanted instead of OoA). I'm quite certain that Anodyne pays tribute to the GB-GBC TLoZ era, including Link's Awakening. Walking around some areas, I even felt like I was back at Labrynna due to how similar that particular spot was to another one in OoA. It's actually the first tribute game to make me nostalgic and if I used scores on my reviews, it would get a 10/10 just because of that.",1448608757,1448612752,True,3,0,0.483107984066009521,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A great game to play during a slow weekend. I guess I should mention that I love exploration games, and prefer short atmospheric games, generally. If you're the same, then grab Anodyne.

Anodyne focuses primarily on atmosphere and exploration. You must scour The Land for clues and passages to advance through twisted memories and Freudian nightmares of Young (heh... Jung). The music and artwork contribute to this aesthetic, and while its gameplay is simplistic, I would say it's well executed. 

This is a short game. I finished the game with all achievements (not all ""secrets"" but all cards) except for the 100% three-hour run with an in-game time of just about six and a half hours.

Celou hru mě doprovázel neodbytný pocit, že se mi autoři vysmívají. 
""Hele, postavíme sem žebřík. On po něm poleze.""
(Ano, lezu po žebříku.)
""No a až vyleze nahoru, tak tam dáme šutr.""
(Narážím na kámen.)
""A uděláme ten šutr tak, aby vypadal, že půjde někdy potom odstranit. Jako že ještě v inventáři nemá něco, co mu pak dovolí ten šutr rozmlátit, nebo tak něco. Jo, to bude dobrý.""
(Vypadá to slibně. Kámen má úplně jinou texturu než kameny všude kolem. Určitě je jenom dočasný. Třeba najdu něco v té jeskyni tam dole, co jsem předtím vynechal.)
""A pak tam schválně nic nedáme! Jo! A ta jeskyně bude mít dva vchody. A v každým vchodu bude nějaká potvora. A když je zabije, tak bude moct prolýzt tu jeskyni, ale zas jenom k druhýmu vchodu. Jo! Masakr! To budou děcka žrát!""

The game derives both its graphical style and its gameplay from the earlier Legend of Zelda games (Link's Awakening, and A Link to the Past), but does not do its source of inspiration any justice. Upon starting the game you are thrown in the deep end of the proverbial pool knowing nothing about the world, yourself, or what you are supposed to be doing. A brief few sentences cryptically inform you of your quest, and off you go. The apparent veil of mystery, however, never seems to be lifted. As you advance through the game you're not told what you are doing, why you are doing it, and why you should keep doing it. Instead you get some quasi-philosophical sentences randomly thrown in your direction, giving the game an air of pretentiousness.

The visual style of Anodyne is not necessarily bad, but it is severely limited by simplistic and repetitive tylesets without any unique or impressive structures to look forward to. It is nothing special, and it does not contribute much to the theme of the world, unless the theme is supposed to be bland and uninspiring.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Much like its visual style, the gameplay is very repetitive. Borrowing its base gameplay from the aforementioned Legend of Zelda titles, Anodyne does nothing new or spectacular with it. In fact, it does not even borrow the parts that make its source of inspiration such great games mechanically. In the Legend of Zelda you are constantly advancing by obtaining new items, requiring you to master these respective items and use them (often in combination with other items) to solve puzzles and advance through the game. Anodyne does nothing of the sort. It does not seem to grant you new accessories to work with, leaving the gameplay as bland and one-dimensional as it is from the very start. Transitioning between areas in the game is equally repetitive. Many screens just seem to be there as filler content to make the game world seem larger, but contribute nothing to the experience. You'll be walking around a lot, which coincidentally gives you a lot of time to ponder the meaning of it all.

The game controls well, although it lacks some polish here and there, particularly noticable while fighting bosses or certain enemies, or trying to circumvent certain obstacles.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Unpolished, pretentious, bland, repetitive, and boring are the defining keywords of this game. While the game is not necessarily bad, it just doesn't do enough to be worth playing. If you are new to the genre, I can recommend trying the Legend of Zelda instead. If you are looking for a game similar to the Legend of Zelda, then this game will be a disappointment.

It does nothing new, and what it does is worse than its predecessors in the genre. Therefore it's safe to say this game can be skipped entirely.",1441821941,1441821941,False,1,0,0.472222238779067993,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]Preamble[/b]
As time passes by, I've grown increasingly intolerant of games like Anodyne. I’m tired of games with the mechanical depth of kiddie pools that sell themselves as hugely deep experiences. These titles that think they’re saying something profound when most of the time I’m just bored by the subtext. It’s nonsense. It’s tiresome nonsense that Anodyne finds itself in. That does color my review a bit but I do think that I point out the troubles this game has well enough to talk about it. So, let’s talk. 

[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]
Anodyne is billed as action adventure title tied with surreal and horror elements. With its 2D top-down view, the comparisons to a certain other franchise are easy to make. But look past the surface and you’ll find anything but. Anodyne is a game that’s hard to have fun with. The combat system is abrasively simple, if you can get the finicky controls to work with you. Besides moving around and a short jump, all you've got is a single weapon. Said weapon is a broom that acts like a sword and can only be ""swept"" in the direction you’re facing. You have no AOE attacks or ranged capabilities which makes your broom’s incredibly short reach aggravating. This creates some really problematic situations with both regular enemies (who take a heart a hit and will knock you back) and and boss battles. I should mention that boss fights are very basic. Just find the one place they won't be able to hit you with their highly predictable attacks and bash them over the head until they die. Rinse and repeat as often as necessary. Do, however, expect to restart often just to get past a couple of fights. I don't know what else I can say about this system other than it's awful and basic. There's no enjoyment to be found in it. Just as there's little joy to be found in the dungeon crawling. 

The majority of the game is puzzle solving which involves a ton of walking around and hoping you stumble upon the right switch or key to get through a door you couldn't get past. Then walk back to that door and continue rinsing and repeating this process till you've gotten through the entire game. While collecting the 48 photographs of enemies you need to finish the game. Exploration is lacking because there’s no monetary system nor can you acquire new items to enhance your character. All you can do is look at the pixelart and survive long enough to make it to the next save point. A lot of the time its just slogging it through normal enemies in long battles of attrition through fights or dungeons.

[b]Story Thoughts[/b]
The story is this: [i]Young, you must save >insert vague mention of land/mythical object here< from an >insert ominous vague evil here<! Now go through this door and just do it![/i] That’s basically the best that the game ever explains itself. You're main goal is to find 48 photographs of enemies either by defeating them or finding them in treasure chests. Then, you win the game. That’s it. Of course, getting to those photographs requires getting through a whole lot of dungeons but you’re not even given the basic reasons to do this other than to do it. No princess in another castle or interesting characters to get attached to. Truly, the characters are the worst part about Anodyne. There’s only a couple of recurring characters who don’t have any personality and very limited agency in the game. They simply show up, say a few lines at you and then leave. None of the dialogue really cements that you should care. Just do it and get your achievements already. 

[b]Legend of Zelda Comparisons[/b]
Having played all of the Gameboy Legend of Zelda titles multiple times over, I can say this with absolute certainty: the comparison of Anodyne being like Legend of Zelda is a terrible one. Andoyne’s combat system is extremely stripped down, there’s no interesting story or colorful characters. Probably the only comparison that works is the dungeon crawling/puzzles. Those at least feel very similar to each other, even if they don't feel particularly good in Anodyne. Do not go into Anodyne with the expectation that this is a Legend of Zelda clone. It’s not. Consider this, at best, an experimental 2D indie “horror” game with some inspirations from previous action/adventure titles of times gone by.  

[b]Abysmal PC Support[/b]
Andoyne’s PC support is abysmally bad. There’s only one resolution that the game is set to and it’s some smartphone portrait resolution. There’s no way to change it either, outside of making it run in stretched, windowed or fullscreen mode with scaling up to 5X. Controller support doesn’t work or is incredibly finicky to get running. I couldn’t get it to run and neither could quite a few people on the Steam community forums. That’s inexcusable considering the genre of game we’re talking about here. Keyrebinding is possible but it makes you set all of the keys at once so if you screw up a key, you have to do it all over again. The game’s menu isn’t mouse driven, so, have fun with that. The framerate is locked to 30FPS and it will quite often fall below 30FPS. No idea why. Oh and you can only have one save game at a time. Why? Who knows, I guess save games take up too much space. There’re a multitude of bugs and problems mentioned on [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Anodyne]PCGamingWiki[/url] that haven’t been fixed either. The poor PC support, the framerate problems and other issues are enough on their own to not recommend this game. 

Graphics are pixelated art pieces that use very reddish/dreary colors. While it gives Anodyne a distinct look, I found it to be overly samey and dreary to look at, so I don’t particularly like the style. Audio is a very moody and calm electronic soundtrack but I found it to be unmemorable at best. Overly repetitive at worst. There’s a single audio slider for the volume. The UI is….ok but the lack of mouse control can be confusing/annoying to deal with at times. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
I don’t have the time or patience for this nonsense anymore. Anodyne is certainly a different twist on the usual RPG affair with its moody atmosphere and unusual visuals. But the gameplay is puddle-deep and extremely repetitive. Controls feel far too loose/unresponsive for how much precision the game sometimes demands. Additionally, don’t be fooled by the comparisons to Legend of Zelda either, Anodyne isn’t even in the same ballpark. The most that it picks up from Zelda is dungeon crawling/puzzle solving but even that’s fairly samey/dull to get through. The bosses are poorly designed, the combat is dull at best and there’s no story or interesting characters to speak of. The world itself is just a dreary place of misery and poorly written angst. None of this is fun to play or experience. Pass on this.

Anodyne is a definite Zelda clone, but that's not a bad thing. 

Like Zelda, it has a (kinda) open world for you to explore, with a number of dungeons to keep you busy inbetween. While I wouldn't say that the music is iconic, the soundtrack does create an excelent atmosphere throughout the entire game. (I found myself humming along to one of the overworld themes.)

The game looks great and controls very smoothly. And it is certainly not without its challenges. I can't say it's the hardest game of its type that I've played, not by a long shot, but it's certainly far from being easy. 

The game isn't ALL upsides though. More than once when playing, I felt that some of the difficulty seemed... artificial. what I mean by that is, I felt on quite a few occasions that a part of the game was hard because it was annoying or repeditive, instead of actually challenging my skill at the game. that said, this wasn't a thing that happened OFTEN, but just barely enough for me to notice.

Another possible issue is the length. I haven't beaten the game yet, but after just 2 hours of gameplay, I'm at the halfway point of the game. So, if short games bother you, you may want to overlook this one.

The world is rich with secrets, collectables, unique characters, and absurdity.  There's entire areas you can't even reach until after you've completed the main game, so you completionist will have plenty to work for.

Anodyne is not completly perfect though.  While the world it presents is a blast to get lost in, some of the gameplay mechanics are a bit wonky.  The jumping is a pain, and can cause some frustration as the game later tries to introduce some platforming mechanics.  Some of the ememies can also be a huge pain to get in on and attack, but for the most part your huge health bar keeps it balanced.  Also using an Xbox one controller I had to reprogram the controls every time I turned on the game.  The D-pad also never worked, which is a huge shame as it could have gone a long way to over come some of the problems I faced with the jumping mechanics.

Okay, now that you've raged and rated my review as unhelpful, let's examine why I don't enjoy Anodyne.

I am one of the few people on this planet (seemingly) who does not enjoy the Legend of Zelda games. Despite this, I heard from numerous people, and watched numerous clips, that the gameplay is only similar in spirit. Rather, Anodyne is a sombre action-adventure game. I agree with this, and found myself engrossed in the story and narrative. The wonderful soundtrack helps, too.

I love puzzles in RPGs and standalone puzzle games (that's pretty straightforward), and -- going back to my anomalous status as a gamer -- also even classic adventure games. Seriously. Most people want adventure game puzzles to go away forever (thanks, Oba-- I mean, Sierra). In other words, I don't believe the puzzles to be the problem.

In fact, I really think my opinion comes down to this: Anodyne is a slower (almost plodding) version of the early Legend of Zelda releases, with uninteresting battles, and less... exploration. No, that's not entirely correct. Less... wonder.

Tying things up, I think I didn't like Anodyne because it isn't my kind of game, and that's okay. I recommend it because in all likelihood, it might be your kind of game.",1432192145,1432192145,True,0,0,0.497322112321853638,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There is a lack of polish--simply too many flaws for me to consider this game ""complete"" and worth the price:

--The jump mechanics are among the worst I have ever encountered. This might not seem like a major issue, but jumping becomes an essential aspect of the gameplay, and it is incredibly frustrating to repeatedly die at certain points due to vague collision detection and poor controls. It didn't feel difficult because it required skill, but instead because it felt clunky and unpolished. I never found myself thinking, ""I did it! Cool! That was hard but rewarding!"" but rather, ""Thank god that's over--hopefully I don't encounter that sort of thing ever again!""

--There were bugs noticeable enough to hamper gameplay. On several occasions, I fell into a pit, respawned, and then randomly found my character teleported back into the pit (thus taking double damage for a fall). In one instance, I somehow respawned from one room into another and found myself irreversibly stuck in a pit until I died. There were also a few times where the game went unresponsive, but I suspect that this is a mac compatibility issue. (These weren't the only bugs--there were troubles with water, for instance, and collision detection in general--but the ones mentioned were the most salient and annoying.)

--The story seems like fragments from a crappy pseudo-philosophical dream. There is no real development,* the dialogue does not make a great deal of sense (though ""dream""-like and ambiguous enough to lend it an illusion of depth and wisdom); in short, the game didn't really take off or make me ""feel"" anything. It was entertaining at times: there were glimpses of interesting story ideas and a coherent ""style""; there were characters I tried/began to like; there were some exciting discoveries; there were interesting/unique areas that I wanted to somehow develop a nostalgic fondness for...but it all just fell sort of flat. In the end credits, the enemies are named in a ""cast"", but they are given extremely boring or otherwise obvious names (""The Wall""; ""Frog""; etc.); I think this epitomized my experience: there were things, and things sort of happened, but ultimately it felt unmemorable and like something(s) was missing. I won't look back on this game with any feeling of warmth but instead with an attitude of ""Yes, I played that. It had some good ideas, but meh. It was okay.""

If you like exploration enough to disregard some bugs, frustrating mechanics, and lack of compelling narrative, go for it! Otherwise, I'd recommend maybe picking this up on sale and seeing what you think.


*Even if lack of development is part of the ""point""--e.g. existential uncertainty, absurdism, etc.--it doesn't ""feel"" right in this sort of game. Character development, surprising turns of narrative and anagnorises (""HE was the bad guy all along??"" or ""So THAT'S what that thing was!""), moments where the story ""coils back"" upon itself and redefines what has come before...this is all missing. There might be a place for bold Zelda-esque dream-like existentialism (where, perhaps, the clues unravel nothing and the journey leads to nowhere in particular), but it was not well executed here: the game is too ""conventional"" (it has a general sense of progress/story) and non-experimental enough for me to justify the lack of some sort of satisfying, interconnected, overarching narrative.",1432184006,1432184006,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Young, the character you play as, wields a trusty broom instead of a sword. Sometimes the broom must be used to push around piles of dust in order to solve simple puzzles.

You discover a few add-ons for your broom throughout the game, but that's the limit of the items you can use.

You travel through varied environments and have many odd encounters. Throughout the game, the mood shifts between being slightly ""off"" to very wrong. It's hard to explain, but here's an example: in one dungeon, there are inexplicably a bunch of identical-looking men that just wander the screen. You can't speak to them or attack them, but they stop your movement and you can push them out of the way. Whenever these men are on screen, there is a creepy sound effect. At another point in the game, [spoiler]you walk down a dock to a fisherman. When you press the button to try to talk to him, Young instead pushes him into the lake and he drowns in a bloody whirlpool.[/spoiler] Even later, [spoiler]you must kill a bunch of townspeople so a guy will let you into his house.[/spoiler] It's some very odd stuff, and much of it is accompanied by a somewhat creepy atmospheric soundtrack without much of a melody.

夢の中のような奇妙な世界を主人公ヤングがクラヤミからブライアを守るために冒険するのが目的だ。一見すると昔のゲームのようだが、陽気さや物悲しさの中に少し不気味さを感じる独特の雰囲気がある。メタ発言など全体的におかしなセリフが多い。ゲーム本編の抽象的なストーリーはよく理解できなかったが、エンドクレジットでは、開発者の協力者への感謝のメッセージが延々と流れ、そっちの方に感動してしまった。

ゲーム内容は至ってシンプル。広いマップを探索して、ダンジョンでパズルを解きボスを倒すというのが主な流れだ。パズルは頭を使うタイプでは無くアクションで解いていくパズルが主だ。アクションとしては、移動と攻撃、アクティベート、途中から使えるようになるジャンプくらいしか無いが、繊細で快適な操作性を持っている。武器がホウキというのがユニークだ。ホウキで埃を集めて、水の上を移動できたりビームの発射口を塞ぐことが可能だ。

各地の宝箱に入っているカードを集めると言う目的もあり、カードを集めないと開かないドアがある。また、ライフアップのアイテム(生物?)がありライフの上限を上げることができる。アクション性の高いゲームであるが、アイテムを取った後に死んでもアイテムは所持している状態なので、アクションの苦手な人にもやさしい。

クリア後のさらなるカード集めは、テストマップや没マップをタイルチップを置き換えながら進めていくような理不尽を通り越しているものなので、Steamガイドを活用するのを推奨する。他のゲームのパロディや某インディーゲームをパクったようなマップもあり興味があれば、プレイするのもいいだろう。

Anodyne is a 2D adventure game developed by only two people. It plays homage to classic 2D Legend of Zelda games in both it's presentation and gameplay. You play as a young boy who has to traverse various parts of the world defeating bosses and collecting cards which will allow you to unlock gates leading to new areas.

The Good
- Plenty of dungeons to explore, each with their own secrets and bosses
- Nice midi music which is reminiscent of games of old
- Colourful sprites
- You don't take damage falling into pits, which will leesen the pain of jumping across pits
- Upgrades to weapon available.


The Bad
- You may need a walkthrough to find all the cards which are needed to complete the game.
- No hit lag meaning that you will take damge each time you are hit with no pause in between hits, which is painful when reaching bosses in dungeons
- Plot is a bit confusing as it doesn't clearly state what is going on and the dialogue from characters you meet are cryptic
- Only one weapon available for the entire game",1418436533,1504668597,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For me, I think this game by its own merits is a very interesting game at the very least, with a unique feel to the artwork, and some of the most luscious, entrancing melodies I have ever heard in a videogame. They seem to shimmer with celestial mystery, and at other times, shift into quaint, innocent tunes which fits perfectly with the idylic, art inspired world. The fact that this game, was done by literally only two people is beyond incredible, and the complexity of the project and beauty of the music when looking at the budget and manpower attests to the ingenuity and imagination of the developers.

 However, there are some flaws which certainly makes me think this game often betrays good gameplay or even an entertaining story for overly abstract and 'out there' symbolism. The use of the broom, although an amusing play on the sound of Link's sword, makes for an especially boring weapon and means of interacting with the world. Never mind the grating sound as the broom emerges before you, the lack of any other notable weapons and tools (unlike Zelda which had a whole set of tools to diversify gameplay) makes being stuck with this weapon feel limiting and maddening at times. This same lack of variety also plagues the enemies, who don't necessarily feel special or unique enough to employ any more meaningful strategy than 'attack with your broom and hope for the best'. Having said this, whilst the combat gameplay feels beyond mundane, some of the puzzles are much more convincing, and reminded me of the good days of more challenging Zelda puzzles. 

In the end, definitely get this game and try it out, it is, in my opinion, one of the most innovative and atmospheric RPGs I've seen in a long time, but it is plagued by a few narrative decisions that seriously hinder the gameplay and a story that often seems to run away from concrete themes and ideas into the black abyss of abstract meaning. I seriously hope for the next game by these two talented developers, and hope they continue to pour resources to channel their amazing ideas into a more solid gameplay experience to match the incredible sophistication of the atmosphere and beauty their games attain.

Los escenarios son variados, laberínticos y entretenidos. Tendrás que explorar, y te morirás de rabia cuando veas un baúl en una zona rodeada de árboles en una esquina de tu monitor y no tengas ni pajolera idea de cómo llegar allí. No desesperes, tendrás que avanzar y explorar, y al final, si has sido un buen pequeño saltamontes, lo conseguirás.

概要：
ゲームボーイ時代のゼルダの伝説のような
ボタンの少ない単純な操作性と戦闘システム
それに伴うサウンドとグラフィックはちょっぴり懐かしいような
少し悪く言えば前時代的かつ古臭いとも取れるような
不思議な気持ちにさせられる作品
シナリオやフィールドを覆うようなゲーム全体の雰囲気そのものは鬱蒼としていて
まるでグリム童話に出てくる深い森の中に迷い込んだかように錯覚してしまうような
ほの暗い不安を掻き立てる作風となっています

具体的な内容：
前述で操作性やアクション要素があったりでゼルダ風とは言いましたが
ゆめにっきのように一見すると必要か不必要か分からないようなアイテムを収集してから
それがキーアイテムだったりしてゲームを進めていく事ができるタイプの作品でもあるので
その部分においては、人によってはパッケージ詐欺になりえるかも
実際このゲームをプレイし通して感じた部分を三つほど抽象的にあげるとすれば
愛・友情・儚いほどの不安定さ…みたいなものが目立ちました
このゲームのストーリーそのものは確かに友情や人間関係の儚さに主軸をおいて描いており
それは不安定で鬱蒼としていて、不安な気持ちを感じさせられずには居られませんでしたが
この作品は通してプレイしていると、妙な温もりが散発的に感じとれる作品にもなっていて
例に挙げたゆめにっきの雰囲気に近いものが感じられるものの
厳密には全く違うような、不思議な気持ちにさせられる作風なのが良くも悪くももどかしい
クリア後のエンドロールクレジットなどでも分かりますが
単純にプロのスタッフをかき集めてからゲーム作りを始めたって訳じゃなくって
実際には友人や家族と一緒にゲームを作ったという温かい背景があったりなんかして
その事も相混ざってかこの作品には、製作者たちの家族愛や友情がちりばめられているように感じられました
大袈裟かもしれませんけどね…
その上で作られたこの喪失感や郷愁を思い起こさせる脚本というかゲーム全体の雰囲気作りは
ただ単に不安にさせられるだけでなく
クリア後には仄かな温かさが心に残るような感覚がありました

プレイ後の感想：
エンディングロールのプレイヤーへの温かい言葉は
クリア後のプレイヤーの事もしっかりと考えているような作り方だったので
素晴らしい余韻を残し続けてくれること請け合いです

If there is one thing you can expect of Anodyne, it's a superb sense of atmosphere. Every zone you explore oozes feeling, whether that feeling may be lonliness, wide-eyed exploration, or even general strangeness. This is thanks to quality atmospheric music and some above-average artwork. Each zone has their own feeling, and that helped greatly with the enjoyment of exploring them and finding new zones.

Gameplay wise, the game is alright. You have a broom weapon you hit dudes with, and you can pick up dust from the ground. You can use said dust to do things like wade across water (you cannot swim) and activate switches. Although simple, it makes the broom feel like an actual broom instead of a sword-that-isn't-a-sword. Combat wise, if you've ever played a top-down Zelda game (Link to the Past, Zelda 1), you will probably feel right at home with the combat. It lacks depth beyond dodging projectiles and hitting things, but it's definitely not unenjoyable.

On a combat note, the enemies of the game felt quite varied, and the bosses moreso. Each enemy has unique behavior and tactics on how to damage you, and always feel suited to the zone you find them in. The bosses of each zone test one's skills in a way that really impressed me, and they did kill me a few times in my playthrough.

I do have a few gripes with the game that hampered my enjoyment, which I will list in order of lowest-to-highest severity:

1) Although the music definitely builds atmosphere, this strangly also applied to boss battle music. I didn't expect the game to jump straight for atmospheric to Japanese shred metal when a boss fight occured, but the low-key tunes of the boss battles clashed with the threatening feeling of the bosses. The bosses definitely were challenging, and unfortunately the music does not reflect that.

2) I got lost many times, and felt that some ""ease-of-life"" features would be nice. I am not someone who needs handholding in a game, and I can respect a game that requires some do-it-yourself thinking to progress. However, I could have saved a lot of time hunting down collectables and figuring out where to go if, for example, the map included icons for locked doors I've run into, or chests I hadn't opened yet. Furthermore, many times I found tiles where one part of the screen I could pass through, but another I did not. It was very difficult to realize (without going back to said tile) that I hadn't fully explored that part of the zone yet.

3) The story, even after seeing all the plot pieces and zones, felt utterly incomprehensible. I understand that the game is supposed to (or at least implied to) take place in a dream-like world. While the dream theme really helped make the game feel varied and enjoyable to explore, the interactions with NPCs and how the plot turns out didn't feel cohesive to me. Again, I get that dreams don't usually feel cohesive, and that the game is not supposed to feed you the story on a silver spoon, but many games with a non-direct story typically leave many bits and pieces that fit together after inspection. After thinking about the story for a while, I still can't understand what it's about or what the journey was meant to symbolize. If someone can clue me in, I would greatly appreciate it.

Don't let my negativity get to you though. Overall, Anodyne is a fine game and probably one of the better indie games I've played. I would definitely give it a look.",1407320636,1407320636,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The main character can move in 8 directions and attack in 4 directions, as well as jump over 1-tile sized pits and patches of spikes. The game controls are simple and responsive and best played with a gamepad or joystick.

Like most of these types of games, Anodyne can get boring at times especially if you get lost or stuck at a point where you don't know what to do next. There's no leveling up or even an economy in this game so if you don't know what to do next or where to go, then you are pretty much going to be stuck wandering around aimlessly with nothing to show for your time until you get back on track. Fortunately the game has a central ""hub"" world with lots of warp points which makes it relatively painless to navigate from place to place. Additionally there is a good auto-map feature to reduce backtracking, and each of the warp points has a red gem above it which lights up when you have gathered all of the quest items within a given area, so you won't spend time needlessly re-exploing a region if there's nothing else to find.

The core experience consists of exploring puzzle-filled dungeons in search of treasure chests containing ""cards"" which are used to open up numbered gates which block off different areas of the overworld. Each gate requires you to have a certain number of cards in your collection before it will open. You explore dungeons to get cards, and you use cards to access new parts of the overworld so you can access more dungeons and hence more cards, etc. A few of the dungeons have boss fights as well.

Combat is not as frequent or as intense as in a zelda game - the enemies are mostly slow moving, fairly passive, and come in small numbers. Later in the game there are a few challenging sections, but for the most part enemies are essentially ""obstacles you can kill"". They do however factor into many of the dungeon puzzles in interesting ways.

Within the dungeons, progress from room to room usually requires some combination of defeating all the enemies in a room to lower a gate, using a key to open a door, or solving a puzzle to remove some obstacle.
Unlike a Zelda game, Anodyne has very few treasures or special items to expand your abilities. Instead, puzzles are solved with the standard ability set and whatever is in the envirionment. Most puzzles involve devising ingenious ways to trigger multiple pressure plates at the same time, while other puzzles require precision jumping and are essentially top-down platforming. I have to give the designer a lot of credit here as the level layouts and puzzles are really very well done and better than most of what you see in the zelda series. One puzzle involves chasing giant silverfish creatures, which retreat from you when you cross their line of sight, onto pressure plates. The silverfish change their facing by 90 degrees at regular intervals, and you have to make sure to chase them in the right direction lest they be driven into spikes or full down a pit. I was reminded of sneaking past groups of guards in the Metal Gear games, except in this case instead of trying to sneak through an area undetected, you are sneaking around to ensure that you will be detected at the exact right place and time. Another creature-based puzzle reminded me of the Dreamcast game Chu Chu Rocket, and involves toggling a switch to raise and lower obstacles within a maze-like area so that a giant rat will pass over a pressure plate. Upon bumping into an obstacle, the rat will turn 90 degrees and keep moving forward. The trick is to time the raising and lowering of obstacles so that the rat turns in the direction you want it to go and doesn't run off to its own destruction. Other types of puzzles involve leaping from moving platforms, riding rafts made out of dust, or luring armored creatures into the path of turret fire so that you can use them as shields. Conspicuously (thankfully) absent are puzzles where you have to push blocks around, pull a series of levers in a specific order, or toggle a timed switch and then run through an obstacle course before the timer runs out.

Visually, the game is 8-bit style pixel art but with a considerably expanded color palette. The scenery is varied from area to area and very well done. Music is minimal and perfect in that it adds to the atmosphere but does not intrude. Sound effects are very zelda-ish, with plenty of audio cues when you discover something or solve a puzzle or anything along those lines.

The overall theme and story was incomprehensible to me. None of the characters or settings fit together in a way that I could understand, and the overall feeling of the game is less like the exploration of another world and more like wandering through a dream. Whether the creator was attempting at some kind of post-modern symbolism with all of the elements in the game or was going for literal surrealism, I don't know. It all went over my head but I will say that the mood created by the various locations and characters was interesting in its own right even if it didn't end up amounting to much of anything (at least to me).

Upon completion of the main quest you are given a special ability which makes it possible to explore previously inaccessible areas of the map and collect additional cards. I didn't bother with this but for completionists it's nice that there's some additional content there.

Overall a positive experience and a good contemplative sort of game to play when you don't have the energy for a faster paced game, nor the attention span for an RPG. It's the rare sort of comfort-food game that you can settle into and play in a relaxed state of mind.",1405135382,1405136602,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne is a below average game, and I do not recommend it. Authors are probably much more creative artists than game designers. The atmosphere of the game is nice, but it is technically too below the threshold of niceness, and the gameplay is not innovative nor addictive. If you find it for a very convenient price may be worth the money, but for sure I would never ever spend $9.99 to buy it at full price on Steam.

It is heavily derivative of top-down Zelda games like A Link to the Past, so fans of Zelda and Zelda-like games will enjoy Anodyne.


[b]Gameplay[/b]

Anodyne's controls are very well-designed. The fact that the game is controlled by a grand total of seven buttons (arrows, select/attack, back/jump, and menu) is an excellent design choice: far too often have I played games with separate buttons for every tool or weapon or action, or so many items that additional controls are needed to cycle through them. The menu very rarely has to be used to play the game, only needed to equip the occasional broom upgrade.

The card system is cute and unique, with each card having a funny little quote about the featured character. NPC and enemy design is well done; the sprites are simple and fit the aesthetic of the game, and the AI, while sometimes frustrating, works very well.

Level design, while not exceptionally innovative, is well-thought-out and well-executed, although a compass item for dungeons would be helpful for keeping track of what went where in previous rooms. The overworld is expansive and elaborate, with intricate, winding pathways in some areas and wide, open expanses in others. Again, the menu map could use some improvements, such as region labels, but it may just be a design choice.


[b]Aesthetics[/b]

Anodyne's 16-bit style is the perfect fit for what it is, and the idea of a Zelda-like game with modern and surrealist twists is certainly charming. The sprites and tileset are all well-drawn and aesthetically fitting, and the selective use of lighting and effects in some areas of the game is a small yet powerful touch.

One of the best parts of Anodyne is its music. The music is calm and distant, yet drives the gameplay in incredible ways. The player cannot help but nod along to the groovy, eccentric beats and melodies of the Hotel, the somber, melodic sways of the Temple, or the hesitant, ominous notes of the Cavern as they roam the halls and corridors and solve the grand puzzles contained within each unique dungeon.


[b]Cons[/b]

While overall a fantastic game, it could use a bit more in the side quest department, as the game, while nonlinear in layout, is fairly linear in terms of objective.

The bosses, while generally a bit tricky on the first or second try, are overall fairly easy and simple, without much variety in fight style (dodge its attacks, strike strike strike, wait for its anger phase to pass, rinse and repeat until dead).

There is not much incentive to stay alive in the game. Death means being sent back to the last checkpoint, which in a dungeon can be fairly common. Checkpoints are easy to find and easy to use, and saving at a different checkpoint from the previous one fully heals the player, which seems a bit cheap. There is no currency to be lost, and dying does not reset progress, just position: any items collected will stay collected after death, and saving is only really needed when quitting, as there is no volatile progress in need of saving.


[b]In Conclusion[/b]

If you are a fan of Zelda-like games and have 10 bucks to spare, give the game a go. As with any Steam game, however, waiting for a discount is probably the best course of action, as the $5 I bought the game for was the perfect price for the game in my opinion (but then again, I don't like paying for things, so there's that).

My only gripes are that there is little direction, but the early Zelda games were like that as well, and I feel that there were too many screens with nothing to do.  Yes, Link's Awakening had you trudging along, but I feel Anodyne could have had less treking between places, and because of the hollow nature, I felt my time was being wasted for no reason.

I don't know if this was to add to the mystery, or to kind of feel empty on purpose, but without a decent waypoint marker, I felt lost and I was worried I was missing something the entire time I was playing.

Have not completed it yet, but I plan to keep playing.  Might help to have a map or something on your tablet or phone, so you can have a bit of ""security"" while you go.

Is it worth 10 bucks? I dunno, that is on you.  I think I got it in a bundle, and I am not disatisfied at all.  I have very little to complain about, and I appreciate the throwback feel to it.

Again, if you liked Link's Awakening, you will probably enjoy this game.",1400268773,1400268773,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne est un jeu dont le gameplay et le style n'est certe pas nouveau mais qui as le mèrite d'être très bien travaillé et agréable à découvrir au fil de votre aventure pixélisé.
En effet ce petit Zelda-like possède un univers intéressant et riche de surcroit. Vous aurez autant l'occasion de vous promenez dans une bucolique forêt, que d'explorer de sombre cavernes, tout en faisant un détour par un labyrinthe original, un grand gratte-ciel et pourquoi pas une balade sur la rivière. Les créatures rencontrés au cours de votre périple sont également très variés et de nombreux boss bien différents vous donnerons peut-être du fil à retordre.
Un élement original dans ce jeu : votre arme. En effet celle-ci est loin d'être une banale épée sacré des Dieux que l'on retrouve dans tout bon jeu du genre. Non dans ce jeu vous serez armé d'un balais. Pourquoi un balais me direz-vous ? Eh bien pourquoi pas! Vous devrez donc partir explorer ce monde dangereux armé de cette seule arme qui, bien évidement, pourra être améliorer avec le temps. Ce balais vous permettra également d'utiliser la poussière comme principal élement de gameplay.
Un autre élement intéressant et celui de devoir collecter et débloquer des cartes indispensable pour accéder à la zone finale du jeu. Et des cartes supplèmentaires (bonus) peuvent être obtenus pour les joueurs souhaitant finir le jeu à 100%.
Enfin pour terminer un petit mot sur le style graphique et sonore du jeu. Graphiquement le jeu est très bien fait (à partir du moment ou l'on apprécie ce style pixélisée) et la bande son sans très grande prétention s'intégre parfaitement aux environnements et se laissera écouter sans problèmes.

Je pense donc que la diversité des environnements proposés, le bestiaire bien étoffé ainsi que le gameplay utilisant l'action du balai sur la poussière rendent ce jeu fort sympathique à jouer pour toute personne désireuse de faire son acquisition. 
Donc à toi qui regarde la page de ce jeu et qui se renseigne parmis les commentaires, avec l'hésitation de l'acheter. J'éspère que mon évaluation t'aura été utile et te permettras de faire ton choix plus simplement ^^",1398877229,1398877657,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I stopped evaluating it with respect to other games.  I considered it by itself.  

The art style is beautiful, and it's not fair to say that just because other games have succeeded using a pixel art aesthetic that Anodyne is just riding their coattails.  Is it true?  Maybe.  Is is a fair criticism?  No.  It's really not.  Look at the game again and tell me it isn't beautiful.  I spent so much time in the world of Anodyne not because I miss my old Link's Awaknening game, but because it was a world in which I truly enjoyed to be.  

So, the moral of the story is this:  you can tell me that the game lacked meaning, or didn't appeal to you, or that you didn't like the art style or humor or direction or pacing or any other legitimate complaint.  Just at least give it the credit to evaluate it by its OWN merits.

I wasn't expecting much going in, but it ended up being enjoyable by the end of it. (Now if only we could open that 50-card door...)

Anodyne has some strong points and good moments that I won't spoil here. It's worth the asking price if you're a fan of the 2D Zeldas, but it needs some polish to be truly *great*.

For example, when first running the game it asked me to adjust the window's size with the arrow keys (what game does this?), which couldn't even be held down to change the size and then proved to be completely useless when I could just change the settings to presets in the menu later. I understand this was originally made in Flash but the PC port should be more standardized with the resolution and other options.

There's quite a few dead-ends that *look* meaningful, but are really nothing of use and that makes the world feel more empty than it should be. Also the overworld could have been much more interesting but instead is just a bunch of mostly arbitrarily-placed portals to the different levels, of which have no labels to identify them aside from the small screenshot of the area (heck, even the signs in the levels are worn away and as such don't tell you where you're going).

My other critique would be that the pacing/story should be stronger. Finding the protagonist's signature broom is simply a plain chest in a plain room. The item itself is hilarious because there's nothing special about it and yet it's the weapon for the whole game, but the moment of getting it shouldn't have been so plain.

Overall, Anodyne is fairly imprssive considering it was made in 10 months by 2 developers, but it could have used more polish to really stand out as something greater than a Zelda-inspired dungeon-crawler.",1397667531,1566445327,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The zones or levels have no relation between them. It's as if they were a bunch of levels from different games put together. Young (the main character) just appears in this word for some unknown reason. It seems that he might be dreaming but you have nothing to expand this theory.
In most parts of the game the NPCs present you with filosophical issues, but all of the dialogs are void and empty and provide nothing that your mind can ""munch"" into, failing to give any ""deepness"" to game.

The screen doesn't scroll. When you get to the edge, you go into a new screen, just like Zelda. Its very simple, with an attack button, movement buttons and a menu button. 

It has simple combat with a good variety of enemies, but there are also good puzzles that feel unique to this game. Things like using a broom to collect dust to place that dust to block things. Again, its very simple and easy. There is no hand holding with this game and you are free to figure things out yourself, BUT when new things are introduced they will bluntly tell you yes you can do this. Such as when you attack dust, it tells you, you've collected dust, attack again to place the dust. It will spoon feed you new things as most good games do, but it doesn't force you to do several tutorials. Once to test a new skill and that's it. The game lets you loose. It doesn't feel like you'll get lost, areas are pretty confined and you have a Zelda 1 like map, there are portals that let you quick travel.

Like all Zelda games, there are keys that you'll need. Not just normal keys that open most locked doors, but specific keys to enter new areas. If that wasn't enough, you'll be collecting enemy cards. Enough of these cards will unlock specific gates with numbers on them. Along the way, you'll also find fairies or red insects that will not only fill your health, but also increase your health overall.

The atmosphere of the game is very surreal or creepy, which is awesome, its a different flavor to Zelda that makes it feel unique. You're a janitor in a dark, surreal world. In fact, I think the game is trying to subtly hypnotize you with its music and sound effects like clicking, tick tocking and chimes. Nothing is really explained, it just is and I'm okay with that. I don't need a story, even if there are NPCs every so often to talk with.

One drawback to the game on PC is that the screen is tall and narrow like an old school arcade cabinet. This tall resolution is because Anodyne is also an Android OS game. A fun Android game, but it doesn't help it on PC.

In all, this game feels good and enjoyable. If you're into simple puzzles, action adventure and a SIMPLE old school Zelda that lets you explore a lot; this is for you.

The game seems to be inspired by the old Zelda games in terms of gameplay and features a nostalgic pixel art. The game is all about exploring the dream world of the protagonist, who goes by the name of Young. The player uses a broom for combat and very few other items to proceed through the story. The goal of Anodyne is to collect a certain amount of cards, which are spread all over the world and often require solving puzzles and fighting enemies to progress to the end area of the game.

My first playthrough through this game went fairly fast, there were only a few stages that required some grinding. Considering that, I was happily surprised by the final boss fight, which in my opinion had an adequate level of difficulty. Also there were a few cards that required to solve rather challenging puzzles, but you don't need to collect all cards to finish the game, so that only comes into consideration if you intend to complete the game 100%. If so, the secret ""???"" items are also very difficult to find and obtain, even if you use a guide.

I really liked the story of Anodyne, even though the dialogues sometimes screwed that up for me, but that's just a small downside to the otherwise so mystic atmosphere and the dream-like feeling which this game provides. All that is underlined by the enchanting pixel art and incredibly suitable and admirable music. This game possibly has one of my favourite gaming music pieces of all time.

All of this matches up to the foggy surreality that makes this game so fascinating for me and which is why I would recommend this game to you.

Unfortunately, the best I can say about the sum of its parts is that it's merely an ""average"" game -- perhaps worth a playthrough if you're desperate for a Zelda-like gameplay experience, but better off left on the proverbial shelf otherwise.

At its best, the gameplay is enjoyable and reasonably challenging. While not nearly as polished as its inspiration, it's not too difficult to look past things such as the lack of hitbox refinement, flighty controls, and strange overworld design. Other flaws are a little harder to dismiss.

Perhaps Anodyne's most glaring flaw is its story and character dialogue, which are all but incoherent. Yes, the dreamlike setting and premise of the game explain this design decision, but there are two kinds of dreams in life: First, there are the strange or eventful dreams that we relate to family or friends for a good laugh or an interesting tale. Second, the kind that are so bizarre that we wouldn't bother retelling them, because all we'd get in return are blank stares. Anodyne is more the latter than the former. The game would have been more enjoyable with no story at all.

Lastly, I'll note that the game is not particularly family friendly as the themes get darker (and the profanity stronger) further into the game. Obviously that's more applicable to some audiences than others.

In closing, while I can say I enjoyed the game enough to go for all the achievements, it's not something I'd want to play again in the future. Buy it on a sale if you must buy it.

It uses tried-and-true mechanics (with a bit of a spin) as part of its storytelling, but in a very subtle way.

The story itself is difficult to follow. The main theme certainly seems to be about some self-centered individual who is in a constant cycle of breaking and mending a friendship with someone else. The story begins with us in the middle of one of the ""breaks"" in the friendship. Young, the player character, expects it to be easy to fix the friendship, but the friend, Briar, is savvy to the cycle and won't be so quick to forgive. Young's journey is a humbling one, as he has to come to terms with his imperfections in order to show Briar he has changed. However, we can assume the cycle will continue. At least... that's what I got out of the story.

It's always tough with these sorts of surreal games to tell if it's just being weird for weird's sake or if everything has a specific meaning. However, this game at least stays consistent in its presentation, and for that much it's commendable.

The writing is excellent, the visuals are gorgeous for pixel art, the soundtrack is great (and surprisingly deep), and though the game only has one real mechanic for puzzles, it continually finds ways to keep it fresh. Unfortunately, the game is VERY formulaic. It doesn't take long to figure out exactly how each area will play out: enter a region, explore every cell on the map, enter a dungeon, explore every cell on the map, collect cards, fight a boss, repeat.

The dungeons themselves are designed impeccably and the overall pace is good enough that the predictability isn't too problematic. But occasionally I did roll my eyes upon entering a new area, thinking ""Well here we go again.""

The strength of the game comes from it's gameplay and the simplistic puzzles you are to solve, given a limited, but solid arsenal of powers. From the start you get a broom with which you can hit monsters and collect dust. It might sound funny, but dust actually has several uses like floating on water and blocking monster projectiles. Another power is the ability to jump, which will allow you to cross gaps and jump over monsters.
But, for me the strongest part of the game was the endgame. Yes, you actually have new content after finishing the game. You will be able to visit zones you been through already and new zones which are unreachable otherwise.

This entire trend of shitty games sold as ""Indie"", ""Retro"" or ""Old-School"" is really starting to get on my nerves! I don't mind the lack of voice acting, I don't need long and gorgeous cut-scenes, I can live with the shallow storylines, I can also deal with the shitty graphics in general. But what really drive me nuts are the small things, such as, for example, me being able to hit an enemy from 100 miles away.... with a melee weapon! Nevermind the fact that all I really hit was air, the monster on the other corner of the screen just dies and disappears.

For me, this is a game breaker. It's like the game devs are telling me, ""Hey, it's a fantasy game, right? You only imagine you're an adventurer, you only imagine you're fighting monsters, so what's wrong with imagining you really hit the bat right before it died?""  Well, at this point I put on my Grumpy Cat mask and shout, ""NO! I won't friggin' imagine that! It's your job as game devs to illustrate at least the most basic stuff!"".

Needless to say, that if in the past I generously shelled out money for indie games without digging too deep, thinking to myself that even if I won't be enjoying the game, at least I'd be supporting the games industry, that is not the case anymore. I'm tired of lazy game devs selling me crap as ""Indie"". I'm willing to pay for good games, but I work hard to earn that money, and so should everyone else, including game developers.

クリアは5時間程度。
16bit時代のアクションゲームを想起させる作り。世界観はある人物の無意識下ということもあって、おどろおどろしい雰囲気を漂わせていいる。
SFC時代の""ゼルダの伝説""よろしく、ジャンプと攻撃のみのアクションで、様々な仕掛けの施されたダンジョンをクリアしていく。
一定のタイミングで火を噴き出す床、ポールの周りをぐるぐる回る火の玉、乗ったら一定の方向に動く床、時間制限で落ちる床等々、ダンジョンごとに独特の対応を要求されるのでプレイヤーを飽きさせない工夫が施してある。

……しかしながら、フィールド及びダンジョンのマップがなんとも見にくい。
同じ大きさの部屋が碁盤の目のように隣接している構成になっているので、小マップではなく都度全体マップを開く必要があり、それによって自分が全体のどの位置いるかを把握する事が必須事項となる。
加えて問題はもう一つあって、部屋が隣接しているからといって、そこを通り抜けられるというのは全く別問題であるということだ。
未探索の部屋が隣だと思ったら、反対側からぐるりと外周を回らされたなんてことがあったりするので、プレイ時には注意が必要だ。
とはいえ、一度目的を果たしたギミックを何度も繰り返させないようにマップをショートカットさせる配慮が見られるのと、いつでも自由にダンジョンの出口に戻れる機能は非常に助かった。
もしかしたら、製作者もマップの複雑性を感じていて、その救済策として用意しているのかもしれない。

また、本作にはカードという収集要素も有り、カードの集めた数によって開放される扉があったり、後々物語に関わる大変重要な要素となっている。マップやダンジョンのあちこちに宝箱という形で落ちているので、マップやダンジョンの隅々まで、くまなく探しておくことを強いられる。これが結構煩わしく、過去にクリアしたダンジョンで取りこぼしてしまうと、カードの枚数を数えながら、あちこちを東奔西走する羽目になる。
余談だが、間抜けな筆者はその取りこぼしで面倒な思いをした。

その様子はまるで宮沢賢治著""雨ニモマケズ""の如くで、

""東の森にカードの取りこぼしあれば、行って茨に体を裂かれ""
""西の浜辺にカードの取りこぼしあれば、行って砂に足を取られ""
""南の池にカードの取りこぼしあれば、行って泥にまみれ""
""北の高山にカードの取りこぼしあれば、行ってはしごを登り""
""取得済みだった時は、ここでもないと涙を流し""

そんな感じでsteamフォーラムガイドには何度も世話になった。

本作は敵のバリエーションも豊富である。
出会った当初は苦戦もするだろうが、動きにパターンがあるのでそれさえ見きってしまえばどうとでもなる。通常の敵はマップを移動するごとに復活するので、雑魚敵を倒し続けることで落とすライフを取得し続ければ、常に体力満タンの状態を維持することも可能。
敵も自分も攻撃を受けた直後は無敵時間が存在するので、ヒットアンドアウェイ先方が基本戦法となる。
そして、マップの終わりには個性的なボスも存在する。初見では厳しいこともあるが、体力次第ではごり押しでどうにかなってしまうこともあるので、積極的に攻めてみるのもいいだろう。

操作キーはデフォルトでは微妙なところに配置されているので、ゲーム開始直後に以下を例とした割り振りをした方がやりやすい。
もちろん、プレイされる方のお好みで設定してしまって全くかまわない。
(ちなみに筆者はFPS操作に慣れ親しんでいるので、すべて左手でプレイできるようにキーバインドした)

* Up = W
* Down = S
* Left = A
* Right = D
* Jump = Space 
* Attack Command = Enter
* Menu = Tab

セーブポイントはマップのそこかしこに点在しており、ボタン一つで簡易セーブが可能なところは非常に便利。
セーブポイントは、どれも「ここまで来て死んだらあの面倒くさいアクションをやり直しか……」と思うところに用意されているので至れり尽くせりであった。ちなみに初回時に限りセーブポイントは体力を全回復させてくれる。

最後に、これは世界観に合わせて""あえて""なのだろうが、音楽がとてつもなく退屈、かつ単調なものの繰り返しとなっている。
はっきり言って聞けたものではない。
いいゲームには花を添えるようにいい音楽が存在するものだが、この単調さははっきり言って苦痛の類い。クリア後に何一つ頭に残らなかった。

ストーリーについても特筆すべきものはない。無意識下という状況の中なので、夢と現実が混在した違和感を感じさせようとする努力はうかがえるが、残念ながら脚本が追いついていないように感じる。例えるならば致死性のない毒。一部のマップなどにはセンスを感じるだけに残念。

長くなってしまったので総じるが、温故知新なアクションゲームとして巧みに作られており好印象。ストーリー、マップに不満も残るが、破綻するほどではない。

This game is obviously inspired by the Legend of Zelda, and it takes this inspiration well. It's an overhead adventure, in which you explore the world and dungeons as well as you can. To progress throughout the game, you generally must find cards that will help you unlock gates throughout the game that require different amounts of cards. In order to get to the end of the normal, story-section part of the game, you have to investigate places well to find every last card, giving plenty of playability and exploration that doesn't grow too stale or ambigious as new challenges arise to getting each card. You may have to pay attention and give patience, but if you're trying, nothing during the normal gameplay is impossible to find out. In what is technically post-game, you gain no real rewards for what you do except unlocking a few interesting levels. A lot of the post-game items almost guarentee that you use a guide, as they are very hidden and cryptic. However, you don't have to do any of this post-game, and most of these items are pointless anyway unless you're a completionist freak. All of the post-game cards (not hidden items in general) must be found to unlock a special last area, which again doesn't serve too much of a point, but it's a sweet area and gives a sense of accomplishment. There are only two things that I would shame the game in terms of gameplay for, and that is that: 1. when you gain the jumping ability, you cannot jump over enemies or projectiles as you would logistically think, and 2. you can only have one save file, meaning that if you want to replay the game  for a speed-running achievement, you must give up your long and hard progression of card collecting. However, those serve as minor details, and the game is still extremely enjoyable.
If you ever wanted to do the famous ""are videogames art?"" argument, this game would be an excellent example for proving so. Everything about this game is beautiful, to the point where I'm still thinking about it almost daily, even when I have completed it several months ago. This game is intended to be the exploration into the mind of Young, which means that everything is somewhat of a pre-set dream. And Hell, it truly is like a dream. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and fits each individual event or area all too well. The graphics are purposely 16-bit-esque, which gives the atmosphere a surreal sense and further helps move the game's intentions of the whole story. The whole plot is an ambigious exploration throughout Young's mind, which brings up so much symbolism. You could hire the most advanced English professors of the world to try to dissect this game, and even then there would be so many possibilities as to how you could interpret almost anything. Even the very existence of characters in this dream world are controversial as to what they mean. Some themes of the game are given to you on a plate, and whether or not some purposes of the game are clear or ambigious to you, they all share ideas that the most troubled in life may have, and they may easily reflect into individuals on a personal level. This is not a ""princess is captured, go save her"" kind of plot for the thick-headed, and that is definitely an up-side.

 오게 된 경위는 간단하다. 이곳은 가상현실이다. 모든 것이 자유자재로 변화하지만, 프로그래밍된 행동 패턴이 따로 있다. 나는 그런 세계에 놓여 있다.

 “가상현실도 게임인가?”
 내가 테이블 위에 놓인 마이크에 대고 묻자마자 스피커에서 기계화된 무미건조한 목소리가 자연스럽게 흘러나왔다.

 “Anodyne.”
 애너다인, 영어로 편안함, 평화로움에 가까운 뜻을 가진 단어이다. 나는 내가 물은 질문의 답변이 고작 이것이라는 사실에 의문을 가졌다.

 “이건 게임인가?”
 “그렇다.”
 거의 묻자마자 되돌아오는 목소리에 나는 감탄했다. 음성인식은 둘째치고 추상적인 질문에 이 정도로 빠른 대답을 할 수 있다니.

 “그렇다면 이것은 어떠한 게임인가?”
 “우리가 가졌던 의문에 대해 다시금 고찰해보는 게임이다.”
 신기했다. 내 성대에서 시작하여 목을 통해 울려 나오는 소리는 철제 방을 진동시키기에 충분했지만, 스피커에서 나오는 기계화된 목소리는 말이 끝나도 전혀 메아리 치지 않았다.
 하지만, 나는 왜 그가 ‘우리’라고 했는지에 대해 의문을 가졌다.

 “’우리’란 누구지?”
 “게임을 게임대로, 목적을 목적대로, 하나의 클리셰에 처박혀 사는 게이머를 뜻한다.”
 답변은 의외로 간단했다. 아마도 답변자는 사람이 틀림없었다. 그러지 않고서야 ‘우리’라는 표현을 쓸 순 없으니까.

 “이 게임의 목적은 뭐고, 어떤 스토리를 갖고 있는 거지?”
 내가 질문을 했는데도 스피커에서는 아무 소리도 들려 오지 않았다. 나는 질문을 해도 곧장 튀어나오던 무미건조한 목소리가 나오지 않자 약간 초조해지기 시작했다. 나는 1분도 견디지 못하고 의자에서 일어나려고 하자 갑자기 스피커에서 목소리가 나오기 시작했다.

 “목적은 없다. 그저 주어진 대로 행동할 뿐이다. 그건 당신의 몫이다. 스토리조차도 난해하며, 그것을 어떻게 이해하느냐는 게이머에 달려 있다.”
 과연 가상현실, 이라고 나는 생각했다. 그리고 나는 나가고 싶었다. 나는 이곳에서 나가 좀 더 많은 게임을 즐겨보고 싶었다. 과연 이 철제 방 바깥은 어떤 세계일까? 난해하며 내가 생각하는 대로 흘러갈 수 있는 게임이란 무엇인가?

 “더 이상의 질문은 없는가?”
 갑자기 스피커에서 음성이 흘러나왔다. 나는 “이 공간에서 나갈 수 있는가?” 라고 묻기 위해 입을 열려고 했다.

 “그렇다면 좋다. 이상 Anodyne이라는 게임에 대한 질의응답을 마친다.”
 나는 입을 벌린 채로 당황했다. 그가 뜻한 것은 이 방, 이 세계가 아니었다. 그가 지금까지 대답한 것은 Anodyne이라는 게임에 대한 답변이었다.
 
 나는 그저 입을 벌린 채로 멍하니 스피커를 지켜보았다. 생각해보니 이 방에는 문 조차 없었다.

 “여긴 어디지?”
 “참… 평화로운 곳이죠. 안 그렇습니까?”
 그 말을 끝으로 스피커에서 목소리가 나오는 일은 없었다.

The word ""anodyne"" in a literary sense can mean ""soothing"" or ""blandly agreeable,"" and I can certainly give the game the bland part.

For the better part of three hours playing the game I did not know if I could stomach finishing it. I'm getting ahead of myself.

It's a Legend of Zelda-like with a ton of strange thematic choices, poor writing, too much dialogue and tonal shifts that will give a player whiplash. What few inventive game mechanics it employs are spread throughout an atrociously long and dull climb to nowhere. You might pass through seven screens just to get to the next place: no enemies, no obstacles to speak of, just a march. As if the designers (credited indie devs Sean Hogan Jonathan Kittaka) couldn't be bothered, having come up with the overall map of an area, to fill it in with things. This becomes very apparent when retracing your steps. You will find a checkpoint at the beginning of an area, putting you on guard for the trials ahead. Then those trials never manifest and seven screens later there's another checkpoint.

To what end? Was my adversary through that place boredom? Will checkpoints at the beginning and end of a stretch really help me combat that adversary?

The few basic enemies you encounter are all laughably simplistic. Many pose no threat at all. Some cannot even harm you. This led me to think perhaps they were more of a rhetorical device than a game object, really. The only rhetorical question that sprang to mind was ""why am I still playing this?"" Then later I encountered fire-breathing lions and they shot my dandy theory to hell.

But I do know the answer to that rhetorical question, as the game is a little more than a poorly-written, bland, easy Zelda clone.

First, even though the various mechanics are spread out way too far, the few that the game offers are very neat. Even with all the crummy verbosity, the game does not tutorialize, rather giving you the tools and letting you figure things out. A good bit of design. The nugget of a good game. I would never have thought that piles of dust could have so many uses, but there you go.

Second, there is at least one boss in the game that requires a neat bit of fooling and approaches a reasonable challenge. Shame that I can only honestly say that about one of perhaps eight or so bosses, but that one is very good and fun.

Third, there are a few counter-intuitive design choices that I won't spoil that I do admire as choices. It is this last point that keeps my thumb pointing up with all I've said about the game to this point. What I will say is that it's a shame you only get the full, mechanically complete game after playing through the whole thing.

Heck I guess that's a second way it reminds me of Fez. The first was the music and sound effects. Which I didn't mention. Okay.

The music is fine if you're into chiptunes and oscilloscopes. Tones, mostly sine waves. Some triangle. There are several good tones.

Which is more than I can say about the jokes. Those are all tonedeaf. And just grating given everything else that happens. I want to say that, as a rule, you don't get to make crappy puns about bicycles with names in the same game where you murder a man and jump into his corpse-portal to go commit an abortion on a tentacle monster. Which is part of what I mean when I say the game is tonally all over the place. Anything vaguely interesting as a narrative point just gets dropped somewhere; crushed away by screen after screen of nothing happening.

Things I didn't like:
bad jokes
boring, longwinded dialogue
blandness
useless screens
lack of difficulty

Things I did like:
inventive mechanics
post-game elements
certain specific challenges
cute enemy names
no navi

적당히 카드 모으면서 진행해야되니 콜렉션이 조금 강제되는 부분이 있긴 하다. 다만 맵 하나가 그리 큰 편도 아니고, 적당히 다 돈단 느낌으로 돌다보면 어느새 카드 콜렉션은 얼추 완성되있기도 하고.
생각보다 체크포인트도 많아서 좀 죽어도 이어 하기도 어렵지않고.

Игра шикарно выполнена и довольно большая: хотя за 3-часовое прохождение дают ачивку, я потратила на неё более 13 часов, и то не открыла ещё все послеигровые секреты. Авторы не навязывают игрокам скучные простые испытания, общие для начальных этапов большинства приключенческих РПГ. Вместо этого они сразу предлагают врагов с достаточно необычным, бросающим вызов поведением, а также комнаты, действительно заставляющие подумать, а затем попотеть.

Сюжет игры, как это водится в таких играх, пространный и в конце толком не объясняется. Но это не оставляет чувства неотвеченности. Во-первых, в игре разбросано достаточно подсказок, во-вторых, игровой процесс достаточно увлекает, чтобы сюжет был вторичен. Но на атмосферу пожаловаться нельзя: игра вызывает умиротворение, беспокойство, любопытство и мурашки... Также, несмотря на низкую интерактивность, свойственную жанру, она награждает игрока за исследование мира, особенно после концовки (практически выводя игрока на новый уровень геймплея после концовки!). Любители ретро оценят, что даже глюки в игре - не знаю, намеренно или случайно - такие же, как в глючных играх на Денди и Геймбой.

Испытания в игре достаточно сложные, но персонажу даётся большой запас здоровья, и игра не слишком отматывает игрока назад в случае оплошности. Можно не волноваться, что игра покажется непроходимой. Довольно большую роль в ней играют секреты, но только необязательные секреты запрятаны действительно глубоко.

So it's like...a broom instead of a sword? What? Like, one minute you're floating down a river on a pile of dust, the next you're falling down a whirlpool into a weird land with walking trees, and then you climb a windmill and get to outer space, which is ruled by cubes wih faces, but it's actually a hotel filled with evil ghostly cleaning ladies, and there's a town where everything's in black and white and shadows are chasing you and...well, don't get me started on the ending. It's ridiculously surreal.

Therein lies Anodyne's brilliance--unlike Link's Awakening, which had some weirdness but was always internally consistent, Anodyne perfectly recreates the fuzziness and weirdness of an ACTUAL dream. And it does it well! A work of art, really.

The gameplay is great too, of course, standing on the shoulders of giants and whatnot. If you've played the top-down Zeldas, you should feel right at home. Frankly, it's a better Zelda game than some of the actual Zelda games we've seen recently.

Nintendo’s landmark release has inspired hundreds of games and mechanics within them, and you can't take two steps without hearing a developer site it as one of their biggest inspirations when developing their own games. Indie game Anodyne is one such example of a very close replication of LoZ's core gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but unfortunately fails to bring anything new to a very crowded table that results in but another poor attempt to recapture the magic of a classic.

You take control of Young, a man who wakes up in an unknown realm called the Nexus. You are told that you must protect Briar from the darkness, but first must prove your worth by scouring the land for cards. And, that’s pretty much all you need to know. The story unravels in a nonlinear way, leaving much for you to deduce for yourself and numerous questions without straight answers. Unfortunately this initial air of mystery falls apart after you've progressed further into the game and come to realize the developers have no intention of ever answering or even elaborating on the many threads making up its haphazard plot.

You run into a lot of characters during your travels, but none of them have anything relevant or useful to say. One of my biggest issues I had is that the dialog aspires to far more lofty and philosophical heights than it has any hope of reaching, ending up feeling pointless and pretentious, while at the same time completely throwing off the tone of the game. A lot of heavy subjects are brought up, from antisocial paranoia, to self worth and parental neglect, but they are never expanded upon or even discussed beyond a cursory overview (which comes across as forced and in poor taste).

It’s clear this was a very personal experience for the writer behind the dialog, but putting all of your problems and insecurities into your game is a sure fire way to lose your audience. Adding to the disjointed tone is a bundle of worthless profanity that was unneeded and serves absolutely no purpose. I'm not sure why the developer felt the need to include random four letter words, as it doesn’t jell at all with the rest of the game, and even as someone not typically bothered by profanity felt a tad disgusted when presented with it in this context. The ending is the final nail in the coffin, coming completely out of left field and not giving even a remote sense of resolution. I will be the first person to advocate artistic expression, but the story fails on so many levels it had me wishing it hadn’t been included at all.

From a gameplay perspective Anodyne fairs a bit better, but on the whole still fails to do enough with what it attempts. You spend your time split between exploring an overworld, collecting cards and filling out your map, and then dipping into dungeons which comprise some basic puzzles and the occasional boss fight. 

It's a formula that works, but in this case quickly becomes repetitive as you neither gain any new abilities, nor encounter consistently interesting puzzles to solve. So much of the game is comprised of nothing but wandering, that many areas feel like nothing but filler, featuring no purpose but to elongate your adventure and keep you away from the handful of smartly designed dungeons that could have made for a much tighter experience on their own.

The extensive backtracking also contributes to much of your time feeling like a grind, occasionally even breaking the game as paths close and you become forced to retread even more ground taking the long way to wherever you were headed. Simply put, it's poor design that frustrates and belittles the player, dragging the experience on longer than it needed to be and making the enjoyable sections a lot farther apart. It's a shame because at times I really felt Anodyne was onto something, but each time my hopes were shot down as I cursed the many aggravating design decisions the developers made.
 
Truth be told, there were moments when I actually did enjoy my time with the game. The true problem is, to reiterate, the fact that Anodyne does absolutely nothing we haven’t already seen and not well enough to compensate for its lack of innovation. It has it’s moments, but by and large feels all too familiar, and ultimately had me wondering why I was playing it instead of so many other games. I never felt compelled to continue, and I doubt it will be finished by most.

If Anodyne does anything right, it’s the game’s music and art. The graphics wholly envelope the 16-bit era, with a wonderful pixel style that is both beautiful and varied. Each dungeon has it’s own look, from a noir inspired town, to a neon maze it is constantly evolving and giving you something new to look at. It may not all flow together, but it was the one thing that made me want to search out new dungeons.

The other half of the presentation is the music, which does a great job of selling the somber, lonely tone of the story, even when the dialog can’t. From gentle piano melodies, to a pounding jungle beat, it is just a great set of songs, and some I could actually see myself listening to outside the game. They are that good, and easily the best part of the game. 

In the end though Anodyne left me wanting. Wanting for better levels, a better story, a better ending, but mostly, a better game. When I first began, I had little idea what to expect and was actually enjoying myself more than I would have expected. But as time went on, the gameplay never evolved, and the story only strayed farther and farther off course making me want to jump ship before it had completely sunk (which by the end it had definitely done.

By the time the credits had rolled, I was all too happy to be able to wash myself of the experience. I don't say that lightly, and hate to have to be so critical, but I simply cannot advise anyone to play what was one of the most disappointing games I've experienced in a long time.",1385500379,1396494270,False,133,3,0.639229774475097656,3,False,False,False,False,,,

The fighting in this game is fairly one dimensional, and virtually every enemy is best approached by attacking and retreating. Honestly, this gets old pretty quickly and with only one weapon to use, you don’t have much variety in how you play. Coupled with the game’s emphasis of platforming that relies heavily on timing, Anodyne can be a bit frustrating and is best played in short spurts. 

The greatest strength of Anodyne is its surreal presentation. Particularly, it’s bizarre scenery and dream-like setting, blending mundane and fantasy characteristics. Anodyne does a good job of providing a backdrop that feels like you’re exploring the protagonist’s subconscious. The off-beat aesthetics of the game are carried into the game play as well, as you’re given a broom (of all things) to use as your weapon. Some of the ways you can interact with puzzles and levels is clever, and really helps to make Anodyne feel more original than a Zelda clone. 

Having said that, the game is probably best reserved for a sale or bundle purchase. While it’s definitely flawed, Anodyne is worth checking out and I’m looking forward to seeing what the developers come up with next.",1384630565,1384630565,True,1,0,0.519139468669891357,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Anodyne is an exploration game which borrows heavily from classic 2D Zelda titles (especially Link's Awakening). The dialogue is introspective, the subject matter is mature (sometimes even disturbing). It's also one of the strangest games I've ever played.

Exploration is at the core of the game. If Anodyne was a protest piece against hand-holding in video games it would be considered a masterpiece. You aren't given a whole lot of instruction regarding where to go next. This feels liberating, for the most part, as you alone are free to decide your next course of action. It's also intimidating and frustrating though, as getting lost/stuck at some point through your playthrough is pretty much a given. It's not necessarily bad game design, it's a product of having too open a world and too linear a path to success (i.e. to get past this next section, the player will have needed to speak with this person to get this item). There aren't many indicators letting you know whether you fulfill the prerequirements for an area so there's a lot of trial and error involved. Be patient or look up a guide.

All areas have their own themes and every dungeon offers up new challenges. This isn't the stereotypical fire/ice/earth/water stages type of game, the locales are varied and interesting: ranging from hotels to small towns and highway construction sites.

The soundtrack is excellent and deserves to be praised as such. It reminds me of EARTHBOUND most noticably. The atmosphere is palpable; brooding, imaginative, mysterious. I wish there was a sound test option to be able to listen to the soundtrack from the main title screen.

Aside from having a penchant for getting lost, the only other issues I'd express concerns about are the graphics and the flimsy gamepad controls.

The graphics are muddy and crude, utilizing a palette usually reserved for NES/GBC titles. They don't get in the way of the gameplay, but if you aren't a fan of pixel/sprite based games, you won't be convinced otherwise by Anodyne.

Although the XBOX 360 Controller is supported, the controls for movement are mapped to the analog stick and are very loose. I'd like to say this is a matter of preference, but when you're down to one health bar and your character charges at an enemy with reckless abandon despite your best efforts to carefully evade said foes, it's an issue. Nothing can be more frustrating than losing due to struggles with controls. A simple option to control the character using the digital pad would remedy this issue but as it stands, it isn't an option. I ended up remapping my controls through the joytokey program and my enjoyment with the game increased immediately.

If you like exploration games and don't mind the graphics, pick this one up. It'll surprise you.

P.S.
Anodyne easily takes the title for strangest post-game I've ever experienced. It's beyond interesting.",1378160574,1422664145,True,3,0,0.566092252731323242,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Your quest in Anodyne is to save the Land from the darkness that has come over it in the form of The Briar. 
Throughout the game you face many bosses who seem to know deep truths about who you really are. They hint at the fact that you play video games to escape from reality, and that one day you will have to learn how to deal with people.
The collecting aspect of the game is very engaging. You must collect cards and keys in order to unlock new areas.
Anodyne offers a beautifully realized SNES-like game world. It has a intriguing story and there are some really great songs that capture the mood of the game quite well.
Anodyne is a good designed old school adventure game and a perfect choice for those who liked the old Zelda games.

-Swap feature adds to additional game-play after beating game

A lot of familiar mechanics are present here: pressing buttons, running through mazes, solving light puzzles, and jumping across holes. However instead of a large repertoire of gadgets and items, Anodyne sticks with one main weapon and a very small amount of items. The mechanics, from boss fighting to exploring, are largely focused around platforming. Jumping at the right time and angle will be essential at certain points of the game. Given the game's rather brief life, it is understanble that gadgets and mechanics are kept fairly contained.

Layered on top of the game is a bizarre narrative. There is certainly some failed humor every now and then, but you will also receive eerie messages, cryptic details, and what seems like nonsense. Also included among the dialog and regular text are the cards hidden throughout the game that act as indirective narrative. It is certainly an intriguing aspect, but don't expect to be rewarded with sure answers.

Anodyne is not without its flaws though. The mix of humor, nonsensical dialogue and strange text will definitely turn away some players. The art style might scream Legend of Zelda, but this adventure has been pared down quite a bit and this is most noticeable through the lack progression and gadgets. For those of you that like secrets there are some pretty extensive ones here, but if you are wanting everything up front, a large portion of the game is kept hidden away.

With The legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past being on of my favorite games of all time I just had to give this a download and was not dissapointed. 

The gameplay is very reminiscent of old school ALTTP/Links awakening Zelda with an emphesis on puzzle solving and revisiting previous locations. During the game you will come across gates that require cards to get through. The game gives you enough cards to let you experience tha base game but becomes much more difficult and unique with its puzzles if you want to enter the deepest areas of the games. 

The game world is very large and extremely varied with many different locales that can be traversed in a very non-linier fashion. Very late into the game you may notice that you are missing a large number of collectables and will gain an ability unlike any other game in order to fully explore the nooks and crannies of the maps. While doing this you will also be able to discover some very well hidden easter eggs from other indie titles. 

The story is vary sparse and leaves a lot of the reaction up to the player to figure out in an attempt to understand the world you are currently in. 

The soundtrack incredibly well done and can range from slightly eerie and mysterious to down right scary in some sections.

What makes the story special is how the bosses and NPC's seem to have different ideas about what is going on and sharing them with you. The gameplay is very similar to the old Legend of Zelda games. Both have an overhead view and use a weapon for stabbing your enemies. The main differences come with the limited items and main weapon. You use a broom throughout the game to dispatch enemies and activate switches and the only usable item you obtain is some jumping shoes that allow you to jump which is used allot in later areas. The game looks fantastic with a retro art style. It fits the world and setting nicely and the game isn’t afraid of some dark tones when it wants to. The settings are also quite unique where you find yourself in a hotel or a strange universe instead of your usual dungeons and temples. Music is nice most of the time and has some nice tracks that I wouldn’t mind downloading. Anodyne mages to bring back the dying overhead action adventure genre and does it in such a well way.

See the thing is that Anodyne had a really interesting meta story going for it, then about two hours in, the entire thing is completely dropped for no real reason.

The cards are stupid, most of them you won't have any idea where the hell to even find them unless you look up a guide. The game just doesn't tell you.

Anodyne: A 16-bit game that goes through the very dream like story of Young in his quest to defend the Briar! The story of Anodyne is abstract and ‘weird’ and may come off in a way that becomes unappealing. For me though, Anodyne is a beautifully crafted world with a story that personally interest me, its controls are simple and fitting and each area of the game feels unique as well as strange but interesting. The music in this game also does a wonderful job of creating a very mood altering atmosphere. The game is a lot of ‘puzzle’ solving and plat-forming but never felt too hard to be frustrating but challenging enough to keep me interested. With all that said, if you enjoy 16-bith games with a unique style that harkens to older Zelda titles then I highly recommend Anodyne for its full price and hope you find your own interpretation of the story as so many others have.

The controls are simple, basically you use the arrow keys to move and C to fight and to open doors / solve puzzles.
The combat mechanic is simple as well, you use your mighty sword (actually it is a broom) to attack the enemys while using the arrow keys to dodge.

Puzzles: 

The puzzles are quite interesting. Anywhere you go, you will find a puzzle you need to solve in order to continue with your adventure.
The puzzles require a lot of logic. The most common puzzles in the game require you to play with switches, you will find pushing enemys around a very usefull technic to solve puzzles.

Graphics:

There is not much I can say about the graphics. The style is very simple and old school, I liked it.

Gameplay:

The gameplay in anodyne is not the best, you explore the world, solve puzzles, murder stuff and find collectables. The exploring part is really good, there are different kind of areas to explore with many hidden stuff to find. I find the puzzles really annoying because you encounter them a lot. The main problem for me is that killing stuff is just not satisfying in this game, which is really sad.
There is as far as I know only one weapon, and in my opinion its bad. Yes you do have option to upgrade your weapon but thats all.

Players that don't like to explore will find the game really annoying because you have to explore every inch in the level in order to find cards (keys), without those cards you won't be able to access all the areas, and obviously you won't be able to finish the game.
The game is also really short so don't expect a long adventure. 

Music:

The music in the game is great, it helps the mood and I can definitly say that the music is one of the things that encourge you to play. Every level and biome got it's on music and usually it is also really good.

Story:

The story in the game is really average. The begining make you think it is going to be a really good and interesting story that will suck you in but when you go deeper into the game you get to know that it is not spectacular at all.
You play as Young, a guy with a white hair and wierd glasses that uses a broom to save the world. When you start the game you encounter an old dude that give you a quest to search for ""the land"", and thats how your adventure starts.

In conclusion, I have to say that maybe others will find the game much more interesting, but I didn't. I can also blame steam offline system, because I played the game while I had free time in the army and I had to be offline and I lost my save games like 4 or 5 times, and it forced me to play through the same areas.

Having finished it, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, even at full price, for it imparts simplicity, solitude, and subtlety that I find rather underappreciated or ignored these days.

The story, ostensibly about a human named Young attempting to protect ""The Briar"" from ""The Darkness"" that has spread across ""The Land"", would be rather uninteresting if it were not for how the game's description directly states that it all takes place within Young's subconscious. Resulting from this is a somewhat lonely journey which focuses more on succinct phrases rather than grandiose spiels and atmosphere over tangibility, overall akin to going through a series of dreams within a larger dream (which is no surprise as Yume Nikki is cited as one of the inspirations for this game). Later on in the game the ideas and caricatures presented occasionally get a bit too obtuse for me to understand, but the main theme of the plot is still clear and I was quite satisfied by the ending. Moreover, Anodyne never interrupts its gameplay for an extended period of time to exposit or pontificate, which is nice as it means players are not forced to care about the game's script if they do not want to. That would be a shame, however, as the multiple lines of dialogue from the game's NPCs and signs tend to be incredibly humorous or chilling, sometimes both at the same time.

Mechanically, the game is not particularly complex; imagine Link's Awakening but with no items outside of the Sword and the Roc's Feather. Although Young gains several equippable upgrades throughout the course of the game, the majority of them just increase the range of his broom, and the enemy and obstacle counts are not particularly high either. As such, the majority of the game consists of exploring the overworld (surprisingly large and spanning multiple environments), slaying enemies (both passive and aggressive), clearing dungeons (about as much as you'd expect in a Zelda game), vanquishing bosses (all of them uniquely designed and fairly tough), and ultimately collecting cards which are required to progress further in the game.

Nonetheless, the rooms of each dungeon tend to be designed well enough that old adversaries often offer new challenges. There are also some tricky puzzles and platforming sections as well, the latter sometimes becoming a bit too tricky due to the top-down perspective. Honestly though, there are only two points of contention I truly have with the gameplay. Firstly, the collection of said cards might put off players who do not enjoy backtracking and exploring EVERYWHERE. I was personally okay with it, though Young's mediocre movement speed made the task plodding at times. Secondly, the post-game is rather lackluster, basically furthering the card seeking with a late-introduced gimmick which can be hard to control along with literally exploiting glitches; it feels like an afterthought. Other than that, the simplicity of the game is a mark in its favor.

Moving on to aesthetics, the game describes its visuals as ""GBC/16-bit"", which is certainly true and they are sprited very well in that style, but what really stood out to me were the gorgeous overlays that complimented many of the game's areas. I'm particularly a fan of the cliffs (pictured above), which are bathed in a warm sunset's glow, along with some later, gloomier areas which would be a shame to spoil. The sound design is excellent as well, especially the ""Obtain Key"" noise which is utterly jarring and I love it.

Combat is present, but there is a much stronger focus on exploration and soaking in the atmosphere.

Interestingly, there isn't much of anything when it comes to weapons, tools, or upgrades. At the beginning of the game you are given a broom (which functions much the same as a sword in any given 2D [i]Zelda[/i] title) and that's all you get for the entire game. As such, most of the game's puzzles revolve around discovering the various ways in which you can use the broom with the environment. You may be surprised at how versatile piles of dust can be.

Aside from HP upgrades and a few equipable modifications for your broom, the only other major collectibles are trading cards hidden in treasure chests. As you explore The Land you will occasionally bump into gates that require a certain amount of cards in order to open. Collecting these cards becomes your primary method of progression.

Although there are certain recurring themes, there is no real story or narrative to follow. This might disappoint some, but I feel like those who wanted a story from this game are maybe missing the point a little. [i]Anodyne[/i] seems far more focused on creating a strong atmosphere and evoking certain feelings than telling any sort of real narrative, and that's okay. The pixel art is often gorgeous with a strong aesthetic coherence, and the moody, ambient soundtrack is among the best of its genre. The two complement and elevate each other wonderfully.
