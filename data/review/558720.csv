The Pathfinding is not the best.
Trying to highlight your troops can be a nightmare at times as it dose not always work,

But i think it's one to watch as the devs look like there dedicated to the game so i think it will be amazing.

Devs are working hard to patch will update review after next patch


First Impressions:   EARLY ACCESS 

UI – 1/5
Graphics – 2/5 
Gameplay – 2/5
Sound/music – 3/5

The gameplay seems a little slow paced for my liking but I like the idea of having a main unit you control this concept is nice.

Issues I have came across: 
1.	Pathfinding seems a bit off
2.	Some minions will randomly stop building houses
3.	On bridge map camera zooms in quickly trying to navigate the under path
4.	Cannot cancel unit creation
5.	Unit balancing is needed 

Other than the few issues ive come across the game plays like a game that’s in early access – I really hope the devs polish this up I believe it will be a fun RTS game to play with friends.  

At this time i would not recommend this game due to the steep price and the current gameplay.

NOTE: Game would crash at launch – Required a Reboot for some reason after the first time I played.
