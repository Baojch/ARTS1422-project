This is what Revenge of the Titans is about: player gets punished for playing. 

This game is a great example how not to design a videogame 101.

- Your cash carries to the next mission: Cash saved up a lot? Difficulty spikes hard. Did not save much? Lacks enough to defend all fronts in the next mission.

- Little modules to make towers stronger: Not used? Towers are too weak to kill anyone. Use too much? Expensive and space used too much to build more towers.

- There‚Äôs a spec tree: Carefully built to counter next mission? Time to re-spec again every time you start a mission. Well balanced distribution? Mission gets much harder.

It is incredibly difficult to find the fine balance. The developer had this certain numbers in mind that is not revealed to the player on any level. The game just feels like it punishes you either way and you are just barely passing when you ‚Äúwin‚Äù. Where exactly is the fun in that?

Enemy spawns are random. They do not follow path the developers drew themselves on the map. They scatter around and there are no elements to reroute these enemies.

There is no right or wrong action. There is only punishable action, and every action is punished.

Difficulty scales with cash on hand, and perhaps this feature was added as an anti-cheat, but all it ends up doing is encouraging you to spend frivolously. If you haven't teched into an enemy counter then you just straight lose, and enemies will begin to spawn to counter your tech choices.

These other top-rated reviews are spot on. Revenge of The Titans is not a particularly good Tower Defense game in the traditional sense. Despite that, I still recommend this game emphatically. Those 29 hours on record were spread out over [i]ten years[/i], not including unlogged hours, since I own a non-Steam copy as well. This game's charm alone has made me come back to it over and over again. I still find myself humming the techno-classical remixes when I go about my day. I still immediately recognise when Puppygames' style when I'm idly looking for new releases. This game runs just as well, [i]if not better[/i], on my low-end daily Linux machine, today, as it did on the family computer, which was the style back when this game came out.

This game is not a particularly good tower defence game, because when you hear ""tower defence"" you probably think of knowing the enemy's path in advance, laying traps and upgrading buildings- This game has none of that. Enemies will move unpredictably and leave roads for seemingly no reason. More than a few janky balancing issues mean that you're punished illogically for doing [i]too well[/i] in a previous level in the campaign, and the game was near unbeatable before the Respec option was added. But the gameplay loop, the second-to-second thinking on your feet to predict what the Titans are thinking- this game has a [i]heart and soul[/i] to it that makes it not for everyone, but definitely worth your time.

But while the game is worth your time, it might not be worth your money. I grade my games' value-for-time as $1 should mean at least 2 hours of enjoyment to be ""decently priced"", and $1 for 10 to be ""good value"". At time of review, this game is $30 AUD, for 30 hours of play over the last 10 years. If I were in America, where the price is $15, I might consider that a good price- but if I were to stumble upon this game in post Covid-times? whew.

As much as this game holds a special place in my heart as one of my favourite indie games to sit down and chew over of all time, it's not worth the normal asking price, at least here. The Ultrabundle, which is more expensive but includes a few of the other games from the Puppygames catalogue, is better- but that's not an easy ask if you're not particularly interested in those games either. I got this game as part of the second Humble Bundle, and I can easily say that for the $20+5 other games at the time, it was well worth it.

All in all- wait for this game to go on sale. As much as I adore it, and come back to it time and time again, it's priced a bit too highly to subsist on charm alone. It's been an unfortunately long while since that's happened (Puppygames seems to have not participated in the last 2 Steam Seasonal Sales, but I don't blame them considering the economic situtation >_>), but there's always the future.

As an aside: I miss when they used to do Demos. I tried out a lot of their games before eventually buying most of them in a bundle, and the main reason why I haven't bought Welcome to Basingstoke is because I don't know if I'll like it, and I end up forgetting about it whenever I have the money to buy a new game :c",1662595172,1662595576,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,True,

This game has no pause, no 'lanes' to speak of, and honestly can't be called a 'tower defense' at all. The fact that the game can't be paused is the biggest issue I have with this game by far. When each level starts, the monsters start coming IMMEDIATELY... you haven't even got time to think of where you're gonna place your buildings or where the 'best spots' are, you just have to start placing them, else you're gonna lose. So that's a huge issue... the 2nd biggest issue is the fact that the game doesn't have 'lanes' like 99% of tower defense games have, so the enemies often come from ALL directions and don't follow a set path, so you have to throw your buildings in the way of them and just hope you've placed enough defences to hold up against them... if not, then the enemies simply break your sh|t and you have to redo the level. Because of that, the best strategy in the game by far, is to built the Robot units, because they literally pursue the enemies anywhere on the map and they can't be killed (unlike your buildings). So literally the best strategy in the game, involves NOT building static defences, and that's just hilarious in a game that's in the TD genre supposedly. So, is there anything good about the game? Yeah... the music is good. That's it... but if the devs wanted to, then they could fix the above 2 missteps and have a very good game on their hands... but as it sits currently, I can't recommend the game.

I found it a little difficult to figure out what to do in the beginning (not sure why, but there are a lot of concise instructions available now).  Watching game play by someone else was not helpful to me.  It is, in the end, a fairly standard tower defense game.  You have a base to defend.  Titans come from all directions, but mostly follow roads, at least at some point in their approach to your tower.  You have turrets to place along the way, and obstacles to slow them down.  Money has to be collected from nearby ore to fund the building of the towers, which are constantly getting destroyed by the titans or getting depleted of ammunition.  

No doubt one of the pros is the beautiful artwork.  Very simple, but elegant coupled with synthesized famous classical music pieces (can't go wrong with these, but they have to blend, and here they do).  This makes for a pleasant experience.  The story, though simple, is told in a comedic way that makes it entertaining.  There aren't many cons, but one is that the buildup of your upgrades (research) is a slow process and only one is allowed per level.  If you go back, you can get a different one, but you can't build up strength by re-playing previous levels (at least in my experience).

Giant monsters from ‚Äì yes ‚Äì Titan are invading Earth, and after pushing them back from the motherworld, mankind takes to space and battles them across the solar system. Beginning manageably enough with a few lanes of incoming foes with predictable habits, the final levels feature hordes of agile enemies that will evade or steamroller your thin defensive line. Combined with bonuses that must be clicked to collect, ghost enemies that must be manually zapped, a variety of other foes who will resist various elements of your defence, and vast combat arenas with no mini-map or other form of strategic oversight, I confess the burden of clunky micro-management compelled me to give up just shy of the campaign‚Äôs conclusion. Persistent progression also involves a slowly-unlocked tech tree that‚Äôs easy to stuff up, cash carried over between levels that scales enemy numbers, and super-weapon bonuses that carry over between levels as well as being vulgarly available in exchange for your real-world email. These pay-to-win-adjacent balancing headaches feel unwelcome in what is essentially a full-price, single-player experience.

Revenge of the Titans is, however, elevated by handsome retro-futurist stylings that see your little towers and robot warriors pew-pew-ing away at the invading Titan army and your flickering CRT screen fuzz with static when a boss lands on your headquarters. The soundtrack is also great, a chiptune rendition of Holst‚Äôs famous planet suite, and the sound design in general is top notch. The campaign is surprisingly well-written, and developers aren‚Äôt afraid to season the game with peculiarly British humour.

Some of your money persists from level to level, so the better you do, the more money you'll have in the future. Unfortunately the game counterbalances this by making the level more difficult. If you do too well on too many levels in a row, you can essentially bump the level difficulty to near impossible to win. So you gotta win, but don't do too well, that's bad. Does that make any sense? No, but that's the way it is here.

Eventually 'smart' enemies start showing up. Basically these enemies will go off path to go around your towers, making some or a large part of your defenses useless. This also means that restarting levels becomes near pointless. The enemies went around my defenses here, so I'll restart and place those defenses somewhere else. Oh, they just went around them again. The enemies went after my poorly defended refineries instead of my base, guess I'll restart and add more defenses at the refineries. Oh, the enemies ignored my refineries and went straight for my not as well defended main base.

There're plenty of other issues as well.

Also of note is that the developer commented on someone else's review and apparently was upset and 'believes' that someone who has never designed a game can't/shouldn't point out objectively bad design issues with it. That level of stupidity is just sad.",1618753660,1618753660,False,14,1,0.681502580642700195,4,False,False,False,False,

This game is a... Well, copy of Harvest: Massive Encounter, which you can also buy on steam. It has some obvious upgrades: there are more enemy and tower types, there are a bunch of support building you can use to upgrade towers, and even factories that produce units like an RTS... 

Except all the towers are lackluster unless upgraded many times. Unit factories just have units sitting around them, you can't control them, which doesn't make much sense for ""The ultimate mash-up of Real-time Strategy and Tower Defense!""

Armored enemies are a constant pain, making you always try to build Blast Towers which have stupidly slow firerate. It makes sense, they're basically AT guns, but not when almost every enemy in later levels has armor.

Enemy paths stop being relevant when ""smart"" enemies appear, which just means they try to walk around all your defenses, making you spend money to build barricades that break quickly.

Harvesters work incredibly poorly, unless, once again, they are upgraded many times. Harvester upgrades start at the price of two harvesters, and the other two harvester upgrades are even more expensive.

Unlocking new towers isn't even rewarding, since you need to research ""Technologies"" to unlock towers. Each research uses 1 research point. Later on, the game expects you to know the optimum towers and research you need, which changes per level, which you have no way of knowing unless you try and fail. Repeatedly. I'm still on Titan, the final world, and I can't access nearly a third of the buildings because I don't have enough research points.

Power ups may sometimes appear, but they are all useless except for the Repair one. The money powerups? they give you 100 $. That's it.

This game would be really good if research was a tree and had WAY FEWER useless technology researches, the ability to actually control units from unit factories, and improving how the economy works.

Apesar das diferen√ßas, as duas modalidades seguem uma previsibilidade: voc√™ sabe o caminho do invasor.

Revenge of the Titans sacode a f√≥rmula com uma legi√£o de alien√≠genas que avan√ßam por padr√µes desconhecidos pela ci√™ncia. Existem estradas e existem aqueles invasores que obedecem a indica√ß√£o de caminho, mas a maioria deles faz suas pr√≥prias regras e o resultado √© um caos que n√£o se dobra ao seu controle em momento algum. √â o Tower Defense do Inferno, um jogo para se passar raiva e desistir antes de se partir para outra op√ß√£o.

N√£o que eu n√£o tenha tentado. Minha sorte e minhas habilidades estrat√©gicas permitiram a libera√ß√£o da Terra e da Lua das for√ßas extraterrestres, assim como praticamente Marte inteiro. Apenas as √∫ltimas batalhas marcianas conseguiram dilapidar meus √∫ltimos basti√µes de paci√™ncia.

Em sua defesa, Revenge of the Titans apresenta um visual deliciosamente retr√¥, que n√£o enquadra exatamente na est√©tica pixelada convencional e puxa mais para uma realidade alternativa onde voc√™ podaria plugar um Gameboy em um televisor de tubo ou algo assim. Essa escolha de design se reflete tamb√©m na constru√ß√£o dos personagens e das unidades que transporta o estilo de Space Invaders duas gera√ß√µes √† frente. √â anacr√¥nico, mas fascinante o efeito produzido.

Com personagens caricatos dos dois lados do conflito, o jogo n√£o se leva a s√©rio, at√© o momento em que a dificuldade escala e voc√™ percebe que suas mec√¢nicas n√£o s√£o brincadeira.

Com os inimigos avan√ßando de forma quase espasm√≥dica, grana limitada para construir e suas torres sendo tornando um alvo f√°cil entre uma recarga e outra, o campo de batalha deixa de ser divertido bem r√°pido. Revenge of the Titans oferece um Modo Campanha F√°cil, mas meus brios acreditaram (erroneamente) que o modo normal seria o modo correto de aproveitar o jogo como seus desenvolvedores planejaram, embora esses mesmos desenvolvedores estivessem me premiando com Conquistas por ter conseguido fazer isso ou aquilo no ""modo mais dif√≠cil"". Eu estava dando murros em ponta de faca.

Felizmente, o jogo permite resetar sua √°rvore tecnol√≥gica a bel-prazer, o que me permitia experimentar diferentes abordagens para neutralizar os Titans. Ainda assim, as √∫ltimas batalhas das quais participei estavam sempre cada vez mais pr√≥ximas daquela que me faria desistir.

Revenge of the Titans n√£o √© um jogo ruim e conquista pela simpatia. Por√©m, ergo aqui minha bandeira branca e permito que o caos triunfe sobre Marte.

Towers are slightly more complex than typical tower defense games and interact with each other to some extent.

The biggest killer here is the really ugly ""retro"" graphics which were used as a substitute for modern PC graphics.  It's unclear whether this was due to a lack of talent or a lack of budget from the developer, but the result is the same, awful, ugly visuals that don't faithfully reproduce the PCs we had decades ago, they just look bad.  There's also a screen filter to make things look even worse, but that can be turned off.  Fullscreen mode doesn't work if you have a high def monitor, only displaying the top right hand corner of the screen due to improper management of overscan/DPI scaling from the developers.  Rudimentary testing on any modern PC would have caught this, so it's inexplicable why the developers didn't properly test the game.

Ugly pixel graphics, technical implementation gaffes that make this fall far beneath minimum standard for a modern PC game are enough for this game to be a solid reject, but they're charging a ridiculous $21.50 for this shovelware, that price would get you actual strategy games like Frostpunk or Stellaris, so it's just impossible to recommend this bundlemeat to anyone.",1600236236,1600398611,False,1,1,0.114896699786186218,0,False,False,False,False,

[b][i]Revenge of the Titans[/i] is a retro-style tower defense game with much more freedom in tower placement and an emphasis on both strategy and tactics.[/b]

At first glance this game seems like a lot of fun‚Äîit has that retro aesthetic and an interesting skill/upgrade tree so you can progress as you play. No grid means you can place your towers almost anywhere and make tactical decisions mid-round. After a certain point though, the game simply felt unplayable due to the difficulty of the enemies mixed with your limited resources. I thought that the upgrade tree would be free for me to customize, but the game has a specific path it wants you to follow (but it doesn't let you know that), and if you don't upgrade exactly that way then you're screwed and the enemies will decimate you. Even then, the difficulty spike is massive after a certain point and you have to frantically manage your turret placement across the map while the enemies chew up your weak spots.

I might give it another try at some point, but at the moment it's just not very fun to play. If you still think this is your kind of game then go for it.

Historically, I'm a big completionist when it comes to gaming, but my backlog will just not die and adulting obligations continue to mount.

Full review below.

=Intro=

So I thought I'd played pretty much every tower defense game on Steam. Then I found this one.

=Gameplay=

It's a bog standard TD game with a few twists. Resources are gained by mining minerals rather than killing enemies and enemies can also attack your towers if they get in the way, or the AI feels like it.

The 'titans' (black squid like critters) will spawn from their designated area and make a beeline for your command center. You build turrets and defenses to stop them. Heard this one before?

After each level, you can upgrade your turrets via research, unlocking more powerful turrets, defenses and utility structures, such as ones that speed up mining and ones that empower nearby turrets.

Defenses come in a solid variety, and I like the control over how your aresenal grows - although it's far too easy to completely gimp yourself by researching useless crap.

The game's biggest failings are it's sheer lack of information provided. What exactly does this research do? Why didn't you tell me that rocket launcher would destroy my own turrets? What does this building do again? Tooltips are poorly written and even simple mechanics like when monsters spawn, how money carries over from level to level and what specific creatures do are either barely or never mentioned.

Aside from this, the game tries to do a sort of persistent campaign, with some cash transferring from level to level. However, it also aggressively auto-scales the difficulty based on your money, meaning you can inadvertently make things extremely hard for yourself by dint of...doing well in the previous level.

Ugh. I love the idea of a persistent TD world, but this is the wrong way to do it. There is no persistence, only ways to make life harder for yourself without knowing it.

On top of this, towers feel both wimpy and clunky - it can be hard to judge how big a tower is and where it can be placed in advance, leading to frustration and even the bigger and more powerful towers, with a few exceptions, feel weak both in terms of visuals and damage.

Finally, the controls are a bucket of butts. As towers will build wherever your cursor is, it's far to easy to accidentely place an extra utility structure or turret somewhere useless - and since only 50% of the price is refunded, this can neccessitate a level restart. On top of this, when (trust me, it will happen) you respec your research tree, every new research item brings up a screen that will automatically take you to the next level, unless you back out and then re-select it. Odd...and rather sloppy design.

=Graphics and Audio= 

Graphics are retro as heck, with scanlines and screen artifacts lending everything a sort of 1970s B-movie look. However guns look...mediocre for the most part, enemies are all slight variations of 'black squid' and it all looks really same-y after a while.

Audio is okay, but again - nothing memorable and starts to grate soon, in particular the sound effect for an alien dying or attacking your turret. I quickly muted it.

=Style=

Some neat ideas here, but not packaged especially well. Again, I like the idea of a semi-persistent TD game, but this is the wrong way to go about it.

=Value=

Quite a few levels to get through, medals to own and the obligatory Endless mode too. There is also a sandbox/level editor. However...the game just isn't good enough overall to justify a purchase outside of a deep sale.

=Overall=
+ Some clever ideas
+ Distinct visual style
+ Deep research tree

- Very little information provided on essential mechanics
- Research feels 90% useless 
- Weird, counterintuitive difficulty scaling
- Irritating music and audio effects
- Clunky control system

At the end of the day, you can get better tower defense games even at this price point. Defender's Quest and Gemcraft are both far superior titles. If you've played both of these, this may be worth a buy, otherwise - wait for a sale if you are interested.",1564030827,1564031236,False,9,1,0.640934467315673828,0,True,False,False,False,

Mobs do not run on a rail while you shoot them down, they can deviate and will to chew on your defenses or to avoid them.

But, it has a few flaws that makes me not like this game that much: 

First, Many of the info is not displayed and you have to figure them out. Detailed tooltips would have been nice.

But more important is the other hidden feature: difficulty is auto scaling based on with how much cash you finished the previous map. Coupled with the fact that you need to conserve money as some of it caries over means the difficulty spirals out of whack quite quickly. Which in the end punishes you for playing well. If I want a bigger challenge I will crank the difficulty up myself, I do not need the game auto do it for me, thank you!

Questo gioco ha richiesto un lungo sviluppo e lo sviluppatore ci ha messo l'anima, solo che √® molto testardo e non ha mai ascoltato le critiche degli utenti, ed il risultato si vede.

RotT √® un gioco difficile perch√© mal fatto, pieno di scelte errate di design.
Sebbene tecnicamente sia ben fatto, queste strane decisioni di design lo rendono estremamente frustrante, rendendo necessario ricominciare d'accapo la campagna fino a che non avrete capito come lo sviluppatore vuole che giochiate ogni singolo livello, quale dei mille upgrade dovete acquistare e quando.
Un'ottima recensione che spiega nei dettagli quanto √® fatto male questo gioco la potete trovare qui: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027104941/recommended/93200/ (se conoscete l'inglese, e guardate anche quanti voti positivi ha ricevuto).

Dopo essere stato bombardato di critiche e di richieste di supporto perch√© il gioco spesso non si avviava nemmeno, tale sviluppatore ha anche scritto un lungo sfogo nel suo sito, nel quale, in pratica, dava la colpa a questi utenti e non si assumeva nessuna responsabilit√†.
In realt√†, i problemi tecnici sono stati sempre dovuti alla sua pessima scelta del linguaggio di programmazione (Java), e sempre alla sua scelta di utilizzare la versione installata nel sistema per far girare i suoi giochi (che hanno tutti avuto questi problemi).
In pratica serviva installare Java per far girare i suoi giochi, ma ovviamente poi, per i soliti problemi di sicurezza che hanno sempre reso questo linguaggio la pessima scelta che ancora √®, bisognava aggiornarlo ogni volta che usciva un aggiornamento, il che al tempo accadeva spesso. Il ""bello"", √® che ad ogni aggiornamento, gli sviluppatori di Java cambiavano cose che rendevano quasi ogni versione incompatibile con quelle precedenti, rendendo alcuni software inutilizzabili fino a che i produttori non rilasciavano un aggiornamento per supportare la nuova versione di Java.
E cos√¨ anche i giochi di PuppyGames smettevano di funzionare, e lo sviluppatore (che probabilmente non aggiornava mai la sua installazione di Java) veniva bombardato di richieste di supporto tecnico.
Alla fine ha imparato come si usa questo linguaggio ed ha incluso nei suoi giochi una completa installazione locale di Java, come facevano tutti gli sviluppatori di software Java da decenni. In pratica, nella directory dei giochi, ora sono inclusi tutti i file di Java necessari per farli girare, senza utilizzare la versione installata nel sistema.

Anche per quanto riguarda la giocabilit√† tutti i problemi sono dovuti allo stesso sviluppatore, perch√©, come ho detto, non ha mai ascoltato la parte della comunit√† critica ma solo coloro che gli facevano i complimenti, e pertanto il risultato non poteva che essere ci√≤ che √®: un gioco bello da vedere ma pessimo da giocare, che il genere vi piaccia oppure no.
Il voto medio su Steam √® dovuto al fatto che molte delle persone a cui questo gioco non va, lo hanno semplicemente ignorato, oppure recensito negativamente al tempo dell'uscita, e per qualche ragione ci sono molti giocatori che preferiscono i giochi da imparare a memoria piuttosto che quelli che richiedono qualche abilit√†, perch√© imparare come terminare un livello di RotT non richiede nessuna strategia ma solo memoria, e questo E' un gioco strategico...o almeno dovrebbe esserlo.

Ora PuppyGames chiede di dargli dei soldi per realizzarne un seguito.
A parte il fatto che questo modo di fare le cose non mi √® mai piaciuto (chiedere soldi alla gente per realizzare qualcosa...perch√© non fai come tutti e chiedi un prestito o un finanziamento?), ma in questo caso specifico, finch√© non avr√≤ la certezza che abbia cominciato ad ascoltare la comunit√† di giocatori, non supporter√≤ mai pi√π questo sviluppatore.",1562180377,1562180377,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

pros:
- I love the graphic style. i think this is done right
- Sound is nice. That base that kicks in near the end of a wave. Gives you chills!

cons:
- too many upgrades, you get lost in them. Right from the start
- Not big difference in turret styles, I am still unsure what the heavy blasters did vs normal blaster. Their look/effect/sound/rate were too similar..
- Hard to place building. Really.. the grid is not clear, and you will endup with gaps and screw up your placement
- hard to distinguish different type of aliens
- Area of effect upgrades don't do much as far as I can tell. They should literally double the speed of the turret. Otherwise there's no point.

Could have been more pros/cons if I played more. But I just couldn't get into it.

[list]
[*]It's not a pure TD, there are no lanes thus the titans will attack your towers. You also have an economy to manage (crystal harvesting RTS style).

[*]DIfficulty is adjusting based on how well you are doing, making the game very challenging. You can turn that off in the options or even try the easy campaign. Either way, the game is a tough nut to crack. As a testament to this, according to global achievements only 1.5% have beaten the final campaign boss (50 missions). That's concerning...

[*]The art is great, as is the humour - music is generic though.

[*]Large enough tech tree that you can reset whenever you like and try different things/towers/combos. That said, I ran the same setup for the last 20 missions.

Overall, it's a thumbs up since I sinked quite a few hours in the game (some offline). Also the developer is frankly amazing, you can see him answering every thread at community discussions even after all these years. Cheers!

This game throws monsters at you with no guide to how you should set up your defense. Place your center of gravity in one area, and the enemy will walk through a different path.

You get powerups (though you have to get to them and click them before they dissapear) like extended range or quicker reload, and items, like bombs and shields  that carry over through levels. Best off saving them until boss levels.

RotT was released long time ago when there weren't good TD games in Steam excpet Defense Grid. I think it's the reason why this game has such a high rating. I found this game very boring and tedious.

Aliens attack Earth. You need to build up defenses to protect humanity. After that you invade aliens homeworld. 

This game is a mix of RTS and TD genres. You have the command center which you must protect. Enemies come from everywhere. You can build refineries to gather resources and place towers. 

It's like a usual RTS game but you don't make units but towers. Could be really nice, but it is not.
First campaign contains 10 levels. All these levels looks like the same, I have got only 2 towers (actually 1 tower and better version of it) and 3 enemies (alien, big alien, bigger alien). It was like I played same level 10 times. Almost nothing changes.

Do you think second campaign is better? No... i have got totally new tower only at 16 mission. Yeah, missions are short but anyway. it's not fun. Also I played on hard and I am sure i could beat then by playing only 1 toe.

Between missions you make research which unlocks new stuff. And it's the best part of the game.  It's cool. But it's not enough to make the game good, because it's not the main gameplay.

Sus mejor baza es su impresionante acabado gr√°fico, muy pulido y detallado. Supongo que no es para todos los gustos, pero para m√≠ es uno de los mejores ejemplos de su clase (no s√© como catalogar el estilo xD)

La m√∫sica cumple junto con los efectos. Nada que destacar especialmente.

El juego dispone de una campa√±a normal/dif√≠cil (leer m√°s abajo), una campa√±a m√°s sencilla, un modo desaf√≠o, un modo supervivencia y un modo de creaci√≥n. Si la propuesta del juego te gusta, hay chicha para rato.

Este es un juego que empec√© con gusto pero que he terminado teniendo una opini√≥n infoerior del mismo al finalizar su campa√±a principal, por cuatro motivos principalmente:

- Para ser un Tower Defense con gesti√≥n de recursos, llega a ser demasiado fren√©tico. Poniendo como ejemplo el reciente ""They are Billions"", hecho de menos la posibilidad de parar el tiempo para poder preparar mejor mis defensas. 
Uno puede acabarse la campa√±a de forma menos √≥ptima sin problemas, colocando las torretas en rutas de colisi√≥n con los Titanes, por ejemplo, pero si quieres ser econ√≥mico, quir√∫rjico o elegante, en ocasiones el ritmo del juego no te dejar√°.

- Los recursos que consigas en un mapa ser√°n los que tengas disponibles para el siguiente. Esto genera situaciones bastante extra√±as, en las que tienes misiones en las que nadas en la abundancia para encontrarte inmediatamente despu√©s con solamente 2/3 de los recursos iniciales.
No niego que la culpa pueda ser m√≠a por menospreciar el aspecto de recolecci√≥n, pero dependiendo de la misi√≥n (los mapas son aleatorios) recolectar puede hacerse un poco complicado, o simplemente no necesitas hacerlo de forma tan acuciante porque claro, ya ten√≠as recursos de sobra al comenzar... No me parece una mec√°nica del todo clara ni bien explicada.

- La dificultad aumenta de forma exponencial. La campa√±a posee una duraci√≥n aceptable, con una o dos decenas de misiones divididas en cinco planetas. Lo que ocurre es que de uno a otro la dificultad pega unos saltos que parece que falta un planeta entre medias para ajustar.

- Existe un √°rbol de mejoras que vamos desbloqueando misi√≥n a misi√≥n, pero no todas las opciones que nos dan son igual de buenas o √∫tiles. Tres de las seis torretas b√°sicas son pr√°cticamente opcionales, ya que consumen una gran cantidad de recursos desbloquearlas que podemos usar en opciones mucho m√°s √≥ptimas. 
Al comenzar la campa√±a da una falsa sensaci√≥n de libertad y adaptaci√≥n, pero en la pr√°ctica creo que algunas opciones no son tan interesantes.

En definitiva, Revenge of the Titans es un juego aceptable, que sirve para pasar un rato entretenido si te apetece un Tower Defense con algo m√°s de chicha. Es un t√≠tulo al que he vuelto en un par de ocasiones y lo volver√© a jugar en el futuro, porque tiene un encanto que (casi) hace perdonar sus puntos flojos.",1516648907,1516648907,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,False,

You never feel in control of the situation. There is no way to tell where the enemy will approach.

The biggest gripe being the adaptive difficulty setting and funds that persist through across the campaign. It frustratingly makes efficient, tactical play unsustainable, since the next level will require you to spend more than the extra money you saved in the last level to overcome the powerful difficulty spike. The best strategy is to waste just the right amount of money each level to keep the difficulty on an even, managable keel; rather than have a sudden difficulty spike and lose almost everything for the level after. The mechanics of the whole thing are completely obscured so it just takes trial and error and some luck to find the sweet spot of ""finish level 12 with $xxxxx to actually enjoy level 13"", because it really doesn't happen naturally. I'll admit I'm not a fan of these kinds of mechanical slight of hand designs in general, but when they're restricted to helping people who struggle on a certain level or hit a bad spot of RNG rolls, it feels relatively inoffensive. Here though, it's crushingly heavy handed and outright annoying in the way it swings the difficulty around unevenly. Especially so when there's even an option cryptically labeled ""no auto-adjusting difficulty"" which only turns off the ""help-you-if-you're-stuck"" aspect of the system whilst leaving the ""screw-you-for-doing-too-well"" aspects locked in.

Speaking of cryptic: The UI's rather obscructive, there's a number of buildings and upgrades that simply don't give you enough information. There's an augmenting building for resource collection that just says ""faster"" with no indication of if its going to be cost effective to build one on that level without some more trial and error. Likewise the whole robotics line of buildings gives you no idea of the damage potential of what you're investing in. And on the flip side, a number of researches give you a global bonus to something, and tell you, but you only find out about it after you purchase it, there's no way to plan for it without, yet again, some trial and error.

It's a little clunky too. The briefings and unlock information all come up in painfully slow-moving letter by letter text, and clicking to speed it up just skips the information entirely rather than print everything out at once on click 1 and skip on click 2, so you either have to twiddle your thumbs waiting to read, or skip the information entirely. You also have to navigate the map in-mission with WASD or mouse dragging, with no-minimap functionality and a playable area that's 2-12 screens wide is a chore that seems like it could have been easily avoidable. And god help you if you try to drag the view too quickly after exiting build mode, you'll just burn on your money on a useless line of defences instead of moving. 

The building footprints are clearly grid based, but there's no visual indication of the grid itself to make things easier to line up, not even a footprint for the building you're currently trying to place even though a large number have rather unintuitive footprints compared to the sprites. Because of the booster modules, efficient defences are frequently tightly packed clusters, but the grid being small and invisible makes it very easy to accidentally offset things by 1 and ruin the bonus-sharing pattern. You can freehand draw a line of buildings by clicking and dragging, but there's no option for a proper straight-line drag building, even though mostly you want everything aligned. Enemy paths are seemingly semi-randomly generated at level/campaign start and not telegraphed in any way even though they don't seem to follow any hard and fast rules. So the clunky build controls are especially vexing when you have to build defences reactively based on precisely which random path they take, rather than planning pre-emptively.

Overall, no, not recommended. It's charming enough on the surface, but the gameplay actively fights against your enjoyment in some instances and refuses to make even commonplace quality of life concessions for player sanity in others. The whole affair feels like an unsatisfying session of chasing moving goalposts. There's plenty of other good TD games out there, ones that feel like they value your time and enjoyment much more highly.",1511301686,1511302374,False,14,0,0.645122766494750977,0,False,False,False,False,

It has strategic qualities, but either there is a lot of issues in design, or I miss a lot of information and don't even know I should search them on the internet or possibly in some manual.
The game is not simple tower defense game, the invaders don't strictly follow the road in maps. They take shortcuts and can destroy easily your structures alongside or even take a different path to attack them. On the other hand they don't have really an A.I., so they still follow more or less the path. And they disappear, when they attack, except for ""bosses"".
So you build more like forts than plop buildings alongside marked path.
But there the first issue comes: It is not clear, how the buildings will fit. Since the graphics is simple, I would maybe appreciate see the lines of squares, where can I build and what space the new building takes, when I am building. Right now I often ended up with finding out that that space I left between the previous building and rocks, is not enough for any other building. And selling the building does not return you full investments. This is very frustrating to find out that it is better to start playing the map again and perhaps do the similar mistake with other buildings at some other place.
Then the graphics is simple, but not enough symbolic sometimes. Some buildings look very similar (and strange to my opinion, not nice).
But there are visual effects of big explosions or when being attacked. Your screen can shake sometimes or blur‚Ä¶ This is not helping in crisis.
Sometimes you hear or see some kind of explosion, but you don‚Äôt know, what has happened. It can be alien destroying some items on the map, which are probably just a decorations.
But sometimes few your buildings near to the missile tower explode and there was no invader next to them, so I wonder, if there is some random accident rate on hard difficulty‚Ä¶ Or if it was a bug‚Ä¶ In the end it seemed better to not use missile towers.
You might have a feeling that the default high difficulty is very easy, until you get further on and find out that you did not earn enough money in previous maps and should replay them. The money, you start with, is taken from previous map in the campaign!
You cannot zoom out, so some maps are very large and hard to orientate when there are hordes of enemies already flowing.
Maybe part of the issues above could be explained by some manual or forums. The game has not real tutorial in the campaign, but more like hints to let you start playing immediately. So I did not have reason to search for manual etc. I think I will rather get to Kingdom Rush or similar tower defense games, they are more causal.",1511024026,1511024026,False,8,0,0.582166731357574463,0,True,False,False,False,

However, it's clealry tagged as a TD, and is viewed & reviewed as such, so my own review will remain the same since I bought is as a TD. Maybe if you're looking for a quirky strategy game, this could be for you... anyways:

Edit 2: My review was reported/blocked for a long while  by a dev (and I also got banned from the forums... still am, according to what it says) because... uhh... well I guess they didn't like my review even though it's... well, you know... a review... So, yeah, I'll have to recommend this even less now that the devs (or someone working for that company) have shown themselves to be so vindictive and petty against someone who paid for their game and happened to hate it (which as far as I know, I'm allowed to)... so yeah, screw this.

This is such a bad TD game that my biggest regret is I can't permanently delete this abomination from my library without deleting other actually good games because I got it in a Steam bundle many moons ago.

It's SO bad, that I'm actually thinking about deleting the whole bundle and re-buying the others just so I can never look at it again. Yeah, that bad.

It does have a couple of good things I guess, the visual style is, or at least was, intriguing when it came out (now there's a ton of dime-a-dozen ""retro"" pixel art games everywhere), and it kinda looks like an interesting game...

First some positives I love visuals of this game and amount of upgrades but there are lots of things I don't like. Upgrades are not very well designed, first of all you need upgrade one part of technology to upgrade another bot often you ended up looking from one icon to another and compare to see what you need do first to make another step closer to thing you want to do, tree based upgrade system would solve this in no time. Another thing is that you don't have enough information what upgrade give you, some give you only option to upgrade another items but some give you +1 damage, armor or something like that but you din't know it until you actually get this upgrade and get some more information with this.
Gameplay- well this is not classic tower defense, you can place tower anywhere and enemies also coming from general directions of pointer not exact point and can walk freely. not on specific path, so this make it harder to make strategic decisions and you have to react quickly to what is happening on map and you don't have active pause to do so. Camera shakes, glitches and other visuals effects sometimes make chaos on screen and I turned it off quite quickly. You can zoom out and in bigger maps this would be very, very helpful to see better situation on battlefield especially when you can pause and move to different parts of map.  Another thing is adaptive difficulty setting and transferring money from one level to another, this is interesting, in theory sound good but in real life scenario not always work as should, if you do good in one level your reward will be that next one will be harder, sometimes much harder than it should be. And money transfer from one level to another can cause that in next level you will have barely any money if you do exceptional bad in last one but still finished it.
And lastly after some time it all feel the same, levels are generated randomly but due its random nature and way you can place towers and how enemies can walk freely it feel very similar and repetitive. Ans there are some more tings I can complain but I think this is enough to decide if this is game for you or not.",1489801688,1489801688,False,1,0,0.527777791023254395,0,False,False,False,False,

It took me a long time to get around to finishing it due to the fact that the campaign used to allow you to corner yourself in a bad part of the tech tree, but this has since been patched out. What's left is a game that's suitably challenging and open-ended to be quite fun - for the most part.

Of the complaints worth mentioning, some of the levels are so dark that even with my screen brightness turned all the way up I can barely read the terrain. It's also not always clear which objects block construction or obstruct the firing arc of which turrets (but to be safe, assume almost all objects block your turrets from firing).

My biggest problem, though, is with ghostly enemy types that can only be attacked by manually using a Capacitator turret against them. This rips you away from the high-level strategic game into click-driven micro instead, and I think that really interrupts what is otherwise an exciting and challenging high-level planning experience, much to the game's detriment. If the ghost/capacitator system wasn't a part of the game, you'd have a much more cohesive experience overall that really lets you get into the flow of things.

That said, it's still a good game, one of the most engaging tower defense games I've ever played.

At it's core, it's tower defense with funds and research carried between levels. You can replay old levels in order to improve your funds or undo research choices...but going back is permanent, losing your progress after that level. Essentially this makes the game about creating a single, perfect, optimized run...which most people would find incredibly tedious anyway, assuming the gameplay was interesting enough to support constant replays - which it isn't. At the very least, you'll be replaying every level at least twice: once to learn what you're up against and where everything spawns, plus at least one run to beat it with minimal losses. This gets tedious real quick.

The big problem with this is that the game *also* penalizes doing well. Difficulty scales to your funds (= how well you've done so far), and it's not a minor correction, either; monsters get significantly harder (up 3x life and speed) and more numerous and crystals ($) actually stop spawning at all after a certain point. That's ridiculous, and what's more it doesn't go back down unless you lose the game repeatedly and let the monsters wreck your base. In a game whose mechanics practically mandate replaying levels in order to get perfection, this is ENRAGING.

There are plenty of other problematic design decisions (extremely large damage ranges for some weapons, easier difficulty requiring losing to access, lack of a sandbox mode, most Research being useless, etc.), but this is the big one. Ultimately, the game encourages you to play one way, and when you do, it punishes you for it.

Why this might be cool for advanced players, it isn't for new players. After the first couple of missions there is no help from the game. It seems that you can completely mess up the research tree since there are so few pointers of what to do.
The levels feel very random. Aliens come from all kinds of directions and typically follow the road, but now and then they don't and it is impossible to plan for this unless you know that. So gameplay boils down to a lot of trial and error, which doesn't work for me in most games. I prefer tower defense games where I get a new level and then try to figure out a solution from the knowledge gained in previous levels. This is impossible here. There doesn't seem to be any information of how the waves look like. Special enemies are not introduced well. And on the battlefield it is also very hard to distinguish all the different kinds of enemies, because while they have specific differences, most of them look very similar. And everything is very chaotic and hard to follow.
So, in the end you put down a couple of buildings and hope for the best. If you place them in the wrong spaces. you'd better start over.

I did play for a couple of hours and then looked on Steam for opinions on the game because it felt like I was missing something. And a lot of reviews confirmed my impressions. But I also had to learn that the game needs you to respec your tech tree depending on the level, which simply doesn't feel like a good game design decision.

The last level was especially challenging and took quite a few attempts to get it right. The diversity of towers is great, from the hard hitting rocket tower (which if you not careful, destroys your own buildings), to the straight shot laser tower. I found that a strategy that worked for me in the early game, no longer was an option as the game went on, and found myself morphing my stategy into a new one, that I would never have guessed I would use. The campaign was good fun, and was a bit easier to play after tinkering in the endless mode, just because you managed to try all the towers. The campaign had a mini boss to each world, which came back during the later levels. The cash roll over system (the cash you have at the end of the level is what you start with at the next level), was a challenge at times, but the game scales the level difficulty according to how much cash you have. As you progress, you find combinations and ways to save cash. (More cash, higher difficulty). Was a great way to keep the game going even if you had a bad level.

Edit:
I tryed to give it a second chance, but i puked. This is not even a game! So much randomness! It's trial and error. Enemies just go around your buildings or attack them, randomly. Stages have random enemy types. When you win, you win by luck! Upgrades are useless. Most of techs (upgrades) are there to unlock other techs. No planing required - strongest turret wins. Huge levels WITHOUT a minimap!!!! You like to scroll, from left to right, from right to left? Yes, you do! Everybody likes to scroll, especialy when something explodes somewhere! You never build in the middle of the level, because the paths of enemies are unpredictable. So you try to block them where they spawn, but they just go around you, through the black edge of the level. So you build closer to the edge, so you can't even see who or what spawns.

OK, I tried it a third time. I thought ""pride aside, let's do it on easy mode""... and it turns out, it's even harden then the normal mode!

Puppygames is a developer that I genuinely respect & appreciate because they intimately understand how to properly design & create vintage arcade-era retro-games on modern gaming platforms, in a way that is both immensely satisfying & true to form. In fact, they are one of the very few studios who do such games justice in my opinion because their sprite-based pixels feel innately alive and demonstrate a phenomenal sense of immersion for 2D graphics, brimming with a magnetic energy that pulls you right in and won't let go. 

Within their catalog on Steam, they currently offer 4 wonderful titles to choose from which are all highly acclaimed gems, whereby each shares a common style & aesthetic but features differing gameplay mechanics derived from their arcade counterparts. And these include: Titan Attacks, Ultratron, Droid Assault, and Revenge of the Titans - the latter of which shall be the focus of this review. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The Titans to be found here are your arch enemy from the sky, and these morbid monsters with their brightly glowing eyes have returned once more to Earth hell-bent on finishing up the job they started: destroying your prized bases. And there's so very many of them, myriads of waves in fact...marching toward you relentlessly in unison. That's because Revenge of the Titans caters specifically to tower defense fans, whereupon you have the ability to strategically build up a counter-attack in real-time using various clickr emplacements such as blaster turrets, explosives, battledroids, barricades, mines, and tangleweb...to name but just a few...each type offering its individual strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when choosing which is most optimal to use, as well as where it should be placed for maximum effectiveness. 

You'll have a finite amount of money to spend at any given time, and you will be purchasing these defenses and/or upgrades for them via an in-game economy...with collected funds being derived from nearby mining operations which you must set up and tend to continually so as to replenish your ability to engage in more purchases as needed to help stave off these enemies. 

Rest assured that the gameplay is indeed rather challenging...yet also with a refreshing level of depth to it...necessitating the ability to think fast on your feet in order to achieve maximum success. There is a tremendous element of tactical planning involved, especially when considering the wide array of different resource types available at your disposal in the bottom section of the screen.  

And with a whopping 50 levels to overcome in the campaign alone, plus 5 different gameplay modes (standard campaign / easy campaign / endless / survival / sandbox user created content)...it is clear that countless hours of fun are to be found here without it ever becoming too monotonous in any way. I was certainly excited to reach the next successive wave after being awarded various goodies from the last, no matter how many I previously played. There's always new usable items and rewards being unlocked as you progress further in, which is a rather nice touch in facilitating a sense of progress being made the whole way through.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

You'll find that the bright vivid colours contrast beautifully against the black background in their games, and this one is no exception. Furthermore, you have the ability to drag the larger gameplay area around the screen so as to focus on certain sections of it as needed, which is a nice advantage to have...both in planning as well as combat. Additionally, there exists an optional shader effect which can be enabled, adding monitor scanlines plus a distortion effect...thus emulating the look and feel of an old-style arcade monitor so as to increase the sense of immersion. Personally, I was quite content to play without it though, but it's more a personal preference and allowing the user to choose their own is ideal.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

We all know how larger-than-life sound effects are such an integral aspect to these kinds of games, and in this one I'm delighted to report that you'll experience the most surreal auditory sensations. The electronic soundtrack as well as the synth it uses are simply sublime, hypnotizing you with its distinctive melody, while the thunderous explosions of these Titans being annhilated by your defenses will be sure to impress. Puppygames have got this down to a science - it's a definite hallmark of their titles.

[h1]Steamified?[/h1]

It fully is, and includes both trading cards and many achievments to be unlocked.

[h1]Verdict - 9/10[/h1]

As somebody who isn't even a die-hard fanatic of tower-defense type games, I was quite drawn in to this one nonetheless because of who it was made by. I knew it would be presented in a way that was both accessible and user-friendly (especially with the way in which it gradually teaches you the ropes as you go along via an in-game tutorial), while at the same time making me feel like I was playing the cousin game to Space Invaders (ie. Titan Attacks). It all exists in the same universe, and so after having completed that one already, it was only natural for me to try my hand at Revenge of the Titans as a follow-up experience. And I felt right at home instantly, soon mesmerized by the pew-pew sounds and complete obliteration of my foes. And the best part of all is that I had quite a fun time with it as expected...fully appreciating the robust strategy side to its gameplay, and even more, the allure of its premium presentation. 

I'll rate this one a 9/10

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

- Wide assortment of defenses
- Delightful synth soundtrack
- Superb art style
- Steam achievements + trading cards
- Online Leaderboards

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Monster paths can be difficult to gauge, a bit of guessing involved
- Not a big fan of garbled voice effects in general

The Titans have been a real pain in the butt if they aren't attacking they are revenging.  This time the humans are taking the tower defense route to solve the problem of the titans.

Build offensive turrets buff them with technology while defending your base and resource gathering buildings.  Between each round research new tech to keep up with the ever stronger waves of foes.

The game oozes style and has a good sprinkling of humor, however the core gameplay falls short.

The titan AI seems a little... erratic. The game doesn't have enemies on a preset path exactly, so when i place my turrets out of the way, enemies will sometimes still walk over to them and destroy them. While this isn't exacly a PROBLEM, it's still something I wasn't a fan of.

Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.

Titans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.

The stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral. 

All this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths. 

Complementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources. 

Both of these features can mean that it‚Äôs possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn‚Äôt feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn‚Äôt anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.

To sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.",1445549376,1445549376,True,82,1,0.796222150325775146,3,True,False,False,False,

Alors toi tu fais quoi ? Et ben comme tas du bol (avec des nouilles dedans ou autour c'est mieux !) t'as des trucs ""de la mort qui tue"" que tu peux poser un peu partout pour d√©zinguer les gros m√©chants qui sentent fort sous les bras. Cool ! Du d√©foulage c√©r√©bral quoi !

Maintenant tu les places o√π tes trucs de ouf (pi√®ge √† scie sauteuse, tour intersid√©rale avec blaster radioactif int√©gr√© ou encore plants de tomates explosives...) ? Bah √ßa d√©pend et comme les jeux vid√©o sortent de cerveaux humains malades, t'as que deux possibilit√©s : soit les monstruosit√©s d√©boulent toujours du m√™me endroit selon les niveaux, soit c'est du foutage de geule int√©gral et √ßa sort de mani√®re al√©atoire.

Le chaos, j'aime bien moi ! Mais bien enrob√© de machins drolastiques, √† savoir un background qui te met la banane √† chaque fois que t'y goutte, sinon tu bascules dans la barbant fissa !

Ceci √©tant pos√© cher lecteur, que vaut RotT ? 

Contre
- le look r√©tro chic en 2011 dont on se lasse de plus en plus en 2015
- le sc√©nar plut√¥t aust√®re qui te met pas la banane et qui rate ses tentatives humoristiques (on est bien loin d'un ""Plantes vs Zombies"" ou d'un ""Orcs must die !"")
- un penchant STR mal d√©velopp√© parce que trop bas√© sur le retry : premier round, je me fais laminer parce que je savais pas trop √† quoi m'attendre; xi√®me round j'√©clate la tronche des Titans parce que j'ai appris de mes erreurs (multiples). 
- un penchant STR mal d√©velopp√© parce que trop bas√© sur le bourrinage.
- l'√©volution technologique mal pens√©e : trop complexe pour un gameplay tr√®s basique.
- Rejouabilit√© : peu int√©ressante du fait de l'absence d'al√©atoire
- le prix : la blague de trop ?

Pour : 
- Un look r√©tro chic qui tient quand m√™me la route par rapport aux essais actuels
- un gameplay nerveux 

Conclusion :
J'ai install√© le jeu, j'y ai jou√©, je l'ai d√©sinstall√©, j'y ai r√©jou√© et pense √† le d√©sinstaller √† nouveau. L'absence d'univers attachant est pour moi r√©dhibitoire, tout comme le c√¥t√© pr√©d√©fini. Un RotT al√©atoire avec un arbre technologique bien pens√© aurait fait de ce jeu une bombe. Ce n'est malheureusement qu'un p√©tard mouill√©. En m√©ga promo √† la rigueur...",1442750719,1442751284,False,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False,False,

I put up with this a while, but it became so frustrating I quit, as did my buddy who picked up the game at the same time.

While it is frustrating, it's the same kind of frustration caused by games like 'Super Meat Boy'. I can guarantee, fans of 'SMB' (aka masochists) would love this game simply for the replayability and difficulty curve, and I think that's the major issue. This game's targeted demographic is tower defense players, but 'Revenge of the Titans' follows almost none of the normal tropes of tower defense games like 'Bloons Tower Defense 5' (a well polished browser tower defense). 'Revenge of the Titans' I believe suits fans of games with heavy replayability and difficulty, better than the average tower defense player. Now, that isn't to say other tower defense games aren't hard, they just aren't difficult *in the same way* as 'Revenge of the Titans'. 'RoT' requires a much more significant amount of spacial planning and strategy due to the ""open"" nature of the map and undefined enemy waves. There is also a good deal of micromanaging in collecting powerups and bonus money while simultaneously keeping an eye on your turrets, buff towers, and factories, whereas in lots of other tower defense games (like BTD5), you usually just place your towers and then sit back while the wave finishes itself, and this I think is the most important difference between RoT and other tower defenses; *the amount of attention required by the player at any given moment.*


TL;DR While many of the defining qualities of 'Revenge of the Titans' is a huge turn off for casual and/or average tower defense players, it is these qualities that make 'RoT' such a fantastic game for people that enjoy heavy replayability in tandem with masochistic amounts of challenge, and who don't like to sit around waiting for a game to finish its ""autopilot"" to do something again.",1440048198,1440048198,True,13,1,0.55367809534072876,0,True,False,False,False,

The art and effects look's good and different from others, but an open map where monsters can avoid your turrents and go after your base, that's no good.

The game is so fast phased that each round will alst 1~2 minutes, and you will not even research 1/4 of the skill tree before you end the missions.

Very low budget looking, which I could be fine with, if everything else worked. Every level looks the exact same, as it is some brown terrain with your base at the end and then guys coming from off the screen. First off, there is no enemy variety, they all look and function the same, strike 1. Then there is the fact that the spawn points make no sense and they will be all over the place meaning you have to defend a ton of different sides, making your defense weak at every point, strike 2. Then, in a tower defense, their pathing SUCKS. They don't follow the actual paths, they just kind of randomly run at your base and spread out all over. Oh and don't forget they will attack your base, and the game tells you not to build it in their path, but then makes them have inconsistent pathing. This means no matter where you build your tower they will run at it and attack it and you will always lose your towers, strike 3. Then there is the fact that your towers have TINY range and won't attack them about until they are getting attack themselves. This also means you can't put towers behind each other or they won't attack the enemies, strike 4.

 Then there is the fact you cannot maze at all, because if you put up walls they just attack them instead of try to get around, strike 5. Then there is the progression system. Each level you get 1 unlockable. Problem is, they are usually wasted. If you want a new tower, you need to get like 3 unlocks, meaning for 3 levels you waste your unlocks, and during those 3 levels you don't progress or get stronger at all, which can be a problem/ The other unlocks, don't give you a good enough idea what you get or the effectiveness, strike 6. You will get things like collectors to boost refineries or cooldowns to boost towers, meaning you have to spend points researching them, then during the game you have to spend tons of money buying them, just to boost your towers, instead of just researching tower boosting stats, which actually makes sense. Also, the boosting towers you don't get a good idea how much they help, strike 7. In game scrolling over towers doesn't give stats, just shows sell prices or name, not letting you make informed decisions, strike 8. Then there is the fact that at certain points you will be unable to beat the level based on the way you specced. So you need to respec and keep using trial and error to get the right combo, meaning you actuall have little choice as you can't win with different combos, strike 9. I do like the mustache captain that talks though.

So if you let many of your buildings get destroyed, they will not be recycled and that money will be gone even though you won the level. Adding to the difficulty, upgrades to the tech tree are necessary but you don't really know how much they help you until you use them which requires a lot of practice and trial and error. Many buildings you use early on in the game also prove to be less effective or even useless in later levels. You will need stronger, more expensive guns but you will not have the money to purchase them because you were not careful in the earlier levels. Do not be deceived by the cute graphics!

After the introductory missions the enemies do not strictly follow a path and will actively move to avoid your defenses, so you can either turtle by your base, try to control the choke points, camp the spawn points or a combination of the approaches. 

Your resources (money) carries from level to level so if you are doing bad the later levels will be more rough. But saying that, most people don't realize the AI is adaptive so if your money is low the levels will be easier (and vise versa) - actually funny to read how some players cheated and gave themselves tons of money only to find that they could not kill the enemies because the difficulty was jacked up so much. Therefore, if you play within reason, I think the game always gives off a decent difficulty vibe.

One negative I would agree with the others about is the lack of instructions - it can be daunting to figure out how to deal with the new enemy types but I think that as long as you have armor piercing turrets most of the rest is manageable. As a pro-tip, the laser with all the upgrades is overpowered and will help you out immensely. Also consider looking at some youtube videos on later levels to learn how to properly turtle - I think that it is the most effective approach in the end-game when enemies will rush you from 9-10 spawn points and evade defenses.

Overall, I played this game for ~65 hours and got all of the achievements and I think it is pretty great hybrid TD/RTS game. I recommend giving it a shot if you are a fan of either genres. 9/10",1431366045,1431366045,True,1,0,0.539776504039764404,0,False,False,False,False,

(Oh and there will be S.P.O.I.L.E.R.S in this review, so theres a warning)

I can't deny that this game has some very fantastic mechanics, the art style is just AMAZING for one, the tech tree brings variety into the game, will you fight your enemies with explosive rocket launchers that can damage your turrets, or will you go full god like and have powerful blasters behind them with buildings that increase their range, damage, ammo capacity, firing speed and decrease reload time. Or maybe you just think ""I can do SO much better!"" well, sadly you can't have a tower that shoots, but you DO get a tower that SHOCKS the titans as they come into range with a click of the mouse, and add multiple ones together, and you got yourself a FORCEFIELD that will kill anything on your command!

But maybe you don't wanna see towers shoot the titans from far away, maybe you wanna send DRONES in that get up close AAAAND personal, starting with tiny droids that mass produce very quickly and shoot faster than the basic blaster (Puts that blaster to SHAME), then going to BIGGER droids with bigger guns that act like a TANK for the tiny droids, but thats not all, upgrade the droids so the tiny ones have a better weapon and the bigger droids? OH boy lets say they get a WHOLE new weapon (Im not gonna spoil it, but lets say this weapon is DEADLY against anything really that doesn't have armor)

With 5 planets to battle on (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan), the fighting never stops until you defeat the final boss on every planet leading to titan, each planet holds a new variety of titans, earth has your standard titans, moon moves onto armored titans that might force the blasters blasts to be defencless, so you gotta get better ones, mars has ghost titans that are unnoticable by regular blasters (Unless you get that certain upgrade that allows that to happen), so you must use the special shock towers to kill 'em, saturn has FLYING titans that will drop bombs on your towers, crazy isn't it? Titan however, has titans that will SHOOT your turrets from afar, as if titans dropping bombs from above wasn't bad enough, titans shooting your towers with armor will be your biggest problem.

Again, the dificulty IS harsh, i mean this game will full on throw EVERYTHING at you every new level and the game kinda says ""Ok, so you got this thing, kill it, ok? Ok, have fun with that"" each new level, to a certain degree where it feels like its screaming ""HEY BTW WE GOT THIS NEW THING THAT YOUR TOTALLY GONNA HATE! HAVE FUN!"" all the way to the last level where it just says ""Well you know we can't be bothered to google the definition of mercy but were pretty sure it means you need to prepare yourself (before you rek yourself)""

Yes i PROMISE there will be rage-quits, this game isn't exactly all easy otherwise i'd rather not review this game at all.

I top my hat off to puppygames for creating a game that has variety and really pumps some love into a genre that i consider dead now (and tower defence games are my favourite :> )

HOWEVER, i have to give 1 VERY big problem i have...

And that is, there is a bug within the game that puppydog games just either flat out refuse to fix (on purpose) or just try to avoid it, seriously i mentioned this problem twice on the steam forums and all i got is halfway to knowing whats going on then...nothing else, and this problem is only apparent on steam apparently...

[EDIT] BUT- The developer has managed to find a loophole with the steam cloud being disabled, while this 'problem' occurs if you have steam cloud enabled, just disable it and it'll work like a charm!

Sometimes I hate the simple yes/no type of voting. If we're doing it that way I have to recomend this game, but truth is it gets way too hard way too fast and becomes frustrating.

It's fairly standard tower defense. But there's a huge twist in that what you research and the money you collect on one level carries over to the next. So you must be extremely frugal in the early levels to have a shot at winning the later ones. If you didn't do that great say 5 levels ago that can snowball so quickly into a huge defeat later and you won't see it coming and have no recourse but to restart 5 levels back. It kinda sucks.

But the retro styling is very cool and it's solid gameplay, although some research options need more explanation. Also super annoying is the stats for the guns are displayed when you first research them but not again later. The tooltips could be a lot better.

The story is somewhat simple. Basically, aliens (titans) are invading earth and it's your job to stop them. 

Gameplay revolves around classical tower defence cliche's with sum bonuses. Basically there is one campaign to play and you unlock levels as you win them. The aim is to protect your factory from being destroyed. You have a limited number of towers you can place on the field, in order to defend your factory (which has limited health). When your factory is destroyed you immeditely lose the game. As you win each level, the money you earned gets tranfered to the next level. Furthermore, as you progress though the story you earn points which you can use to buy new towers, walls and other buildings. There are a variety of towers available including lasers, plasma, support anti- air. All towers will have limited ammo and will have to spend time to recharge again. Towers may be upgraded when clicking on them and spending resources (ie. money). You collect money by building resource gathering buildings. there are a wide variety of enemies including (strong-weak) land and air units. In some levels you will be facing a boss which requires clever placement of towers to destroy. You can aslo call upon limited abilities to assist in the defence such as bombs and fire-rate boost. defeated enemies may drop money or abilities to use later. The game lasted me 12,7 hours so it's decently long, plus you can replay levels after you beat them.

Audio serves the game well. Weapon fire sounds vary between lazers and other weapons. The sounds also help invoke a strong sci-fi, yet cartoony feel to the game (ie. less serious), Other sounds such as alarms are clear and crisp to help warn you of attacks at your base. Dialogue is spoken through text boxes only and there is no audio. 

There is also a survival mode besides the campaign which tests how long you can last.

Going through my backlog of games, I started playing Revenge of the Titans which I got from a Humble Bundle years ago. At first, it was kind of neat. The art style was simple and kind of cool, the music was decent (in the end levels in particular, there's this really good ambient track), there was a little bit of humour in the campaign, and it seemed like there would be a lot of variation in enemies and weapons as you level up. But several hours in and the gameplay flaws really began to show.

- There are maybe 3 very distinct enemy types. There are tons of enemies in this game, but they pretty much vary only by things like ""oh, this guy moves faster"" or ""oh, this guy has more armor"" etc. 
 - Level after level, the grind shows itself. Same gameplay, pretty much every single level. (Other than when you need to use the Capacitor, a specific weapon used for a specific enemy type.) There's never any variation, or anything that makes you scratch your head and plan something out. And the art of each level pretty much varies only by colour.
- There's loads of weapons and gadgets to unlock and use, but you'll most likely end up using the same combination of weapons for every single level once available.
- Campaign is started on the hardest setting by default...and it's mind numbingly easy.

Most of my play time was spent grinding for the last few achievements (which was honestly the one thing that kept me going.) So, I'd give it a 4.5/10. It is a decent game for being so cheap (especially from a Humble Bundle) but again, only if you are desparately wanting some sort of RTS/TD game can I give a full recommendation.

That is the only positive game element to be had here. Save your money and stay away, regardless of the pandering reviews from what I can only assume are people who have never played tower defense games before. I mean hell, if it wasn't for the art style this thing wouldn't even survive on Miniclip. 

The game feels like a continuing list of bad design choices, a case study in what not to do in a tower defense time. When I complain I feel like a lecturer in basic game design: ""encourage strategic play"", ""present consistent rules for your game world"", or maybe ""release without game crippling bugs and advancement locks"". It's bad enough now, but be greatful you weren't playing when the campaign tech tree was locked and you'd be forced to menu-delete a game when an armored enemy type showed up an you had no units capable of damaging it. 

Almost every mistake (as I'm coming to call them, because I honestly don't think any of them were actually thought through properly), is at once trivially annoying and long term game breaking. Manually resetting and time consumingly repicking your tech tree to deal with new enemy types every level may seem simply irritating, but gradually emerges into an overall expectation that you pick the ""right"" tech tree that enables victory, and all others will fail by default. Having to painfully micromanage your reloads is grating, and eventually ensures that every strategy will be limited to your clicktimes and not your strategy, dooming any kind of open-world defense. And the rediculous armor and repulsion systems vex you piece by piece as your weapons and equipment become obsolete, before finally running the final, game destroying flaw: you will not lose when your defenses are overwhelmed, you will lose when the charming little boxlike enemies have countered every possible defense and your entire list of defensive options have become obsolete. 

It's like the equiptment they give you is just a taunt of what your strategy could have been: oh hey, here's a rapid fire turret. Too bad it does no damage to enemies after level 4, when they all have armor. Hey, check out these repulsion buildings to herd the enemy into chokepoints. Sucks that every other enemy after level 6 has become ""intelligent"" and will simply run up and eat them. Laser weapons? Armor reflects them - useless. Slowing razor field units? Can't be used with the anti-armor explosive guns, which destroy all your own buildings, including your own defenses, because apparently future scientists drink too much coffee to understand friend-foe ID. Similarly, saving up money in the campaign feels rewarding until you find out that the game raises the difficulty with your cash level and thus it's advantagous to avoid any kind of strategic spending. RotT plays like a cod game, where every interesting idea gets thrown out within ten minutes because it happens to be too fun and interesting to keep using. 

I like playing tower defense games because of the evolution of your goals and the resource management involved. I'm not sure I like playing them when resource management is a menial clusterf*** and the evolution of methods is only happening in the enemy forces. I've never had a tower defense game where I've felt so much like *I* was the computer, and the enemy forces were actually the human, getting to play adaptively against me with all the strategy and choice-making I was missing. Playing like a bot isn't a good feeling. I do not recommend playing like a bot. I do not recommend this game.

Gameplay wise it's a simple concept of ""Defend your base"", but the execution can be complex! At first they are just marching at you, but new enemy types and larger numbers as you progress makes you have to think quick! Delete an old turret and place a new one, shut down an old refinery that has done it's job for a quick financial injection you may need to put up more barricades! When you're attacked anywheres the games screen jumps a bit and the titans make noises to distract you too! It all adds up to a hectic yet lovely time.

Some people may enjoy a game where you are frantically jumping around the map, but to me tower defense is about planning defenses, not lighting reflexes.

The single biggest problem is that you can't build while paused and only have a few seconds at the beginning of the mission to build your refineries and set up your defenses before the enemies start coming, ready or not. The enemies don't follow consistent paths and can easily destroy your towers, which means that in the mad rush to get towers down they won't be placed optimally and will probably be destroyed, wasting money that comes all too slowly from refineries.

This snowballs with the fact that your finances carry between missions, so if you spent all your money and barely passed a difficult mission, you'll be broke at the beginning of the next mission. This punishes the player for not playing perfectly and makes some of the later missions basically impossible because you didn't play the early game just right. The difficulty also scales with your finances so you have to be in the sweet spot of enough money to build enough towers but not too much money that your get overwhelmed before you know what is going on.

At least the game isn't as clicky and punishing as it used to be, in earlier versions you had to manually click on refineries to harvest them and turrets to reload them and the tech tree used to be yet another source of punishment to inexperienced players so there might be some hope for this game, but at this point I still don't recommend it unless you like a rather punishing, frantic click-fest.",1412374906,1412374906,False,120,3,0.754494905471801758,2,False,False,False,False,

Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.

Titans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.

The stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral.  

All this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths. 

Complementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources. 

Both of these features can mean that it‚Äôs possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn‚Äôt feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn‚Äôt anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.

To sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.",1411649759,1439662496,True,3,0,0.505738973617553711,0,True,False,False,False,

The graphics and aesthetic are pleasing for the most part and I suppose there's a good amount of content to keep you engaged throughout the campaign. However, my time with it mostly consisted of boredom. I'm rubbish at games like this, and because of that I don't ever play them on any difficulty beyond easy. This could definitely be to blame for the boredom, but when I start struggling at higher difficulties in tower defense games I tend to quickly just lose interest and stop having fun.

Its not to say its a bad game, oh no no no, its actually pretty decent, just I feel it suffers from some oversights.

Basically you have to defend your base from the oncoming hoards of Titans, using what ever you have researched and are available.  Ok simple enough.  You get an icon showing the direction the hoards are coming from and you build accordingly.  Just on some missions, during my play time, I find that an all important hoard direction marker is actually hidden/obscured by my HUD, which lead to my defences getting demolished because I didnt see said marker.

But really...tis a minor gripe, if annoying.  The actual gameplay is pretty simple, just point and click to deploy your stuff or click and drag for multiples, so nice and easy to get your defences where you need them/want them to be.  Research is pretty easy to understand with icons showing what needs what to be available, though the game does tend to recommend tech to you if you havent got it, so it kinda takes it out of your hands a bit, by basically saying "" you need this, not what you are currently thinking ""  Though you can ignore that.  But it does offer you respec points for your research so you can get what you want within you resorce point limit at the time, so thats a pretty useful feature.

Graphically I like it, its a nice and different style to see.  I particulary like how the Titans are designed, especially the sub-bosses.  

But one other thing that gets me is the price.  I would not pay the ¬£7 it was advertised for.  Fun fact, I recieved a 90% off this game coupon from Steam by crafting a badge, so I had it for 70p!  So what I would do, if this game interests you, is get a coupon or wait for it to come on sale at around 33% off at minimum and then I would say its worth it.

Not a bad game, just a few little issues and a bit over-priced, but it is alright.  Should cure your Tower Defence itch for a little while.",1405861151,1405861151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Auf der Erde ist die H√∂lle los, die Titanen greifen unerbittlich an und versuchen die Erde zu vernichten. Das lassen die Menschen nat√ºrlich nicht auf sich sitzen und versuchen den Titanen Einhalt zu gebieten, mit einem neuen Commander und der bist du.

Das Spiel spielt sich √§hnlich wie ein Tower Defense Spiel. Am Anfang eines Levels versucht man sofort m√∂glichst viele Raffinerien bei den gr√ºnen Kristallen zu errichten damit man m√∂glichst schnell an Geld kommt das man wiederum in die Verteidigung des St√ºtzpunktes verwerten muss.

 Die Geb√§ude zur Rohstoffgewinnung wie die T√ºrme lassen sich auf der Karte frei platzieren. Das schafft spielerische Freiheit macht das ganze aber auch schwieriger da dadurch die Titanen nat√ºrlich auch frei herumlaufen. Im Normalfall l√§uft es so ab das man gewarnt wird aus welcher Ecke die Titanen kommen und kann dann noch schnell genug reagieren um die Verteidigung auf diesen Punkt zu konzentrieren. Im Laufe des Spieles kommen die Titanen immer zahlreicher aus den Ecken der Karte sodass man oft an vielen Orten gleichzeitig besch√§ftigt ist.

Nach jeder Runde darf man einen Punkt in die Forschung investieren. Dabei kann man unter anderem neue Waffent√ºrme, Verst√§rkungen, Spezialwaffen oder neue Technologien erforschen. Das ist auch bitter n√∂tig denn die Titanen werden auch sehr schnell st√§rker und zahlreicher. Man muss sich aufgrund der gro√üen Herausforderung schnell f√ºr eine Richtung der Forschung entscheiden und diese schnell voran treiben damit man mit den Titanen mithalten kann.

Das ganze geht soweit das man in den einzelnen Runden gehetzt von einer Richtung zur anderen jagt und immer wieder schnell eine paar neue Geb√§ude hinstellt. Das f√ºhlt sich gut an, wird auf Dauer aber z√§h und anstrengend, da man den Titanen sp√§ter immer nur hinterher l√§uft und nie die Oberhand hat. Das ganze h√§tte man mit einem optionalen Schwierigkeitsgradregler besser l√∂sen k√∂nnen.

Die Grafik sieht mit ihrem Comic Look echt toll aus, der Soundtrack, der auch elektronische Versionen von alten deutschen Klassikern besitzt, geht sofort ins Ohr und setzt sich fest, auch die sonstigen Soundeffekte sind toll und passen zum Spiel. Das brabbeln des Generals oder des Forschers h√∂rt sich einfach toll an. Normalerweise bin ja nicht so ein Fan von elektronischer Musik, aber das Titellied von diesem Spiel ist eines der besten elektronischen Lieder die ich kenne, das originale Lied ist auch zu empfehlen, man sollte zumindest einmal rein h√∂ren wie √§hnlich sich das anh√∂rt.

Revenge of the Titans ist ein tolles kleines Spiel f√ºr Zwischendurch und macht einfach Spa√ü, man st√ºrzt zwar die meiste Zeit gehetzt durchs Spiels aber das macht auch irgendwie den Reiz aus es immer wieder erneut zu versuchen und st√§rker zu werden. Es gibt im Spiel einige Bossgegner die besonders hartn√§ckig sind, einen aber mit viel Geld belohnen. Nach dem besiegen eines Bossgegners kommt man immer auf einen Planeten und so geht es von der Erde zum Mond bis zum Mars und noch viel weiter, bis zur Heimat der Titanen.

F√ºr Spieler die auf schnelle harte Tower Defense Spiele f√ºr Zwischendurch stehen ist Revenge of the Titans wirklich zu empfehlen.",1405101014,1405101060,True,17,1,0.730203092098236084,1,True,False,False,False,

Luckily the towers build instantly so you can place them as soon as you guestimate the route the enemies will take. The decent size research tree and enemy varienty keeps the levels fresh while your are going through the campaign. The difficulty level is not too frustratingly hard, while still giving you a proper challenge.

It is not perfect though, the game explains the mechanics badly and you have to figure out (too) much yourself and the inability too zoom out of the map and not having a mini-map can make navigating and keeping an eye on the field a pain sometimes in having to pan the screen like mad.

Graficamente √® povero per√≤ gli sviluppatori sono stati in grado di mettere dei bei filtri vecchio stile: lo schermo risulta ""piegato agli angoli"" stile televisore a tubo catodico con le righe generate dai raggi catodici. Durante il briefing pu√≤ capitare che lo schermo sfarfalli e questo accade anche in missione quando i titans attaccano  (caratteristica molto fastidiosa che per√≤ si pu√≤ tranquillamente disattivare in ogni momento).

Oh wow, a story! It's mostly for kicks, but at least it gave me a reason to play (as sarcastic as that sounds, I actually mean it. I feel like there was a point to all that).

The research system is fantastic. It may look daunting to the first-timer, but once I got used to it, I started to wish it was even bigger. As it is, it's good.

While I'm sure it's meant as part of its aesthetics, the battle environments always look... sterile and off-putting. I would have liked to see some daytime areas, forests, cities. Maybe more weather effects like rain and snow outside of X-mas. Instead we get... rocks. And more rocks. In pale pastel colors. Add to that an ever-present, pointless dim spotlight effect which makes everything look dull and dim. On every stage. It's a fun game, but borderline unappealing and somewhat hard on the eyes.

I'm not sure if I was playing it correctly, but I had difficulty setting up towers along paths, as creeps would invariably destroy those towers (not including the creeps that specifically go for towers). In any case, it didn't matter in the end, as I found that on most maps I could just make a super defense perimeter around the base and nothing would get past it except for boss monsters, in which case, all that required was a second set of towers attacking the boss right away.

The automatic difficulty scaling could use some work. Once you get the hang of the game, you'll quickly start to rake in funds. But if you do too well (+50k in funds), the game gives you zilch next stage. It feels like it's punishing you for doing well, and even without looking it up, I could tell the game was ""cheating"" by doing that.

Out of all the Puppygames, I regard this one as the best. It's not frustrating, it's not brutally hard, has a good length, several game modes, and even the stages I failed it didn't remain failed for long.",1398477031,1398477148,True,3,0,0.509338498115539551,0,False,False,False,False,

Pros:  
- Difficulty Curve is challenging, but fair.  Enemy strength adapts to the amount of $$ you have, so you always have a shot at winning a level.
- Tech tree has FREE RESPECS.
- The music is awesome.
- Start play from any level you've already beaten, see what would have changed if you hadn't barely won that level, but steamrolled it instead!

Cons:  
- Its sometimes easy to back yourself into a corner with very little money, and no way to defend a sprawling map to allow you to build up your funds again.

Tips:
- Save your powerups for boss levels (every 10th).  They're incredibly helpful there.

Puppygames develops an awesome tower defense game which changes the elements of your traditional TD. The awesome research options between levels, harvesting of resources, and the variety of tools to change alien tactics creates a unique experience between each level. 

[b]Campaign:[/b]
Revenge of the Titans, obviously you know the name as you are looking at this review. This game offers an interesting differentiation onto a typical Tower Defense game; enemies destroy your towers and the idea is to block the path rather than create a route. The world is being attacked by an alien species from Jupiter‚Äôs moon Titan. The name of the game seems to make me believe maybe we attacked them first? But yet again there is no real story other than the world is under attack and you are chosen to lead the defense force. You not only defend the earth, but you progress through the solar system defeating the alien scum at each planet until you finally arrive to Titan. Each planet has about ten levels, each which offer new bosses and pose new challenges that keep you on your toes. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The towers are upgraded by placing upgrading towers adjacent to towers. This is interesting as you can place multiple add-on towers adjacent to a tower to create rapid fire towers, or even long range sniper towers. The difficulty curve seems rather perplexing, with little explanation onto how to play this game can seem rather difficult till you figure it out. The game is incredibly entertaining, once you figure out the general gameplay you can really get into this game. You are given one upgrade point per level which you can use to customize your defense force. With about 73 upgrades and only 50 levels means you cannot research every possible option. The game allows you to respec after each mission, which allows you to manipulate your towers to achieve optimal defenses for each level. When playing the campaign make sure you remember that your money transfers between levels (and your towers automatically sell returning funds from the towers). This information is useful, as you can start saving early making the later levels easier. If you mess up after beating a level and lose too much money you can go back replay the level prior to it and fix your mistakes. This allows you to bring a better end result and alter your starting cash in the next mission. 

[b]Results:[/b]
Revenge of the Titans is an epic tower defense game that drives in new challenges and creates new concepts not seen in previous games of the same genre. The campaign is long and difficult, on the standard setting, but you can make it easier at the drop of a hat. Each level requires you to respect in order to take advantage of alien weaknesses, but this makes each level dynamic and unique. 

Pros:
+Fast paced tower defense game
+Upgrade screen allows for between match tactic customization
+Transfer of funds between levels means how you play the level before impacts the later levels 
+Power-Ups transfer between levels, so you can easily stack them. (I for example used none of my abilities until the last level to make the final boss incredibly easy).
+Great difficulty curve, if you are a beginner you can significantly reduce the difficulty to ease up the levels. 
+Gameplay from prior levels transfers to the next level, meaning you must play tactfully throughout the entire game. 

Cons:
-Poor tutorials, by the time you figure out all the nuances of the game it‚Äôs already over. (I for example didn't realize that levels don't start until you place your first mineral extractor until level 48 - this would have been useful to know early on)
-Recommended upgrades seem rather worthless (it‚Äôs better to just rush barricades)
-Not a traditional tower defense (there is no maze building, and to upgrade towers requires add-on towers which can be hard to space)",1392875196,1396487378,True,47,1,0.71763235330581665,0,True,False,False,False,

As in all tower defense games, your goal is to halt the oncoming horde of enemies by strategically placing defensive towers that destroy them. In this case, humanity is being attacked by aliens coming from Saturn‚Äôs largest moon Titan.

The campaign spans 50 missions across 5 locations (Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan). After you‚Äôre done with the 10-hour campaign, you can spend more time with the game in the Endless, Survival and Sandbox modes. There‚Äôs a good amount of content here. If you‚Äôve played a classic tower defense game, Revenge of the Titans will feel pretty familiar. However, what separates this game from the usual suspects are the subtle yet profound base building and resource gathering elements found in traditional RTS games.

Every map starts with just your base which you have to protect from the Titans. Then you have to build factories that mine crystals in order to make money to be able to purchase other buildings and towers. You also have additional buildings at your disposal such as shield generators, cloaking devices, reloaders, etc. All of these can be unlocked over time in the research screen before every mission. After completing each mission you are awarded with a single research point. Apart from buildings and towers, you can research technological advancements which bring their own benefits to the table. The great thing about the research system is that you can re-spec the entire system before each mission. This enables you to try out different tactics and you will need certain towers and abilities when facing a particular enemy.

Enemies come in a pretty large variety of shapes and sizes and certain missions also throw huge bosses at you which can be very challenging. Certain towers are good for certain enemies, that‚Äôs where the research screen comes into play. You need to pay attention as to what types of enemies are coming so that you can choose the appropriate towers and technologies otherwise you‚Äôll have a pretty hard time finishing a mission.

The game will also randomly distribute power ups and cash bonuses during missions which you will need to manually pick up on the map within a limited time frame. There‚Äôs also a tower that needs to be used against a certain enemy that you have to manually control. Coupled with the base/add-on/tower building, the situation can get pretty hectic at times and certain elements such as the power up pick ups simply come off as an artificial way to increase the action. It impeded on the strategic element and just feels needlessly overbearing.

That said, Revenge of the Titans nails the addictive and tactical core that makes tower defense games so satisfying. And with the RTS twist, it manages to differentiate itself which is really important as the genre is becoming increasingly crowded. It‚Äôs a good title for newcomers and veterans alike.

Pourquoi ?

primo un truc r√©curent qui m'a gav√© d√®s le menu du jeu, l'image saute, vous savez un peu comme si on √©tait entrain de jouer sur une borne arcade de 1950, des fois sa saute de haut en bas ou de bas en haut, des fois de droite √† gauche ou vice versa ... prit s√©par√©ment bon je dit rien, mais quand en plein moment d'action vous avec 5 fois d'affil√© l'√©cran qui bouge, comment voulez-vous pouvoir jouer d√©cemment !!!

ensuite c'est un jeu de type tower defense, le fait que les mobs attaque les tourelles ... moi je trouve √ßa moyen, alors oui il y a seulement DEUX baraquements qui peuvent s'occuper des batiments, le premier c'est le truc qui rend invisible les batiments autour de lui ... mouais ... utile ... le deuxi√®me c'est les drones de r√©paration, dans l'absolut oui c'est bien ... sauf qu'il faut environ 15-20 seconde √† un drone pour r√©parer compl√®tement un batiment, et les mobs te d√©gomme une tourelle en environ 5 secondes ... vous voyez o√π je veux en venir ?

rajoutons une couche, au d√©but du parcours vous allez mettre des tourelles qui depop les mobs qui courent vite, histoire que sur la fin de parcours vos grosse tourelles depop les mobs lent et gros. alors l√† petite pr√©cision, un mob rapide √ßa veut dire qu'il va de son point de d√©part au point d'arriv√© en environ 3 secondes, un mob lent il met 6-8 secondes. vous voyez d√©j√† le soucis ? mais vous avez pas tout vu, nos grosses tourelles de fin de parcours, par exemple tourelle laser tourelle lance roquette ... sa fait des d√©gats qui peuvent toucher VOS tourelles, par exemple le gros mob bien lent qui reste encore dans les d√©fense de d√©but se prend une roquette (la lance roquette √† une grosse port√©e) et pouf vous avez oneshot vos tourelles de d√©part, g√©nial hein :)
vous me direz suffit d'√©loigner chaque d√©fenses les unes des autres pour √©viter ce probl√®me ... oui ... si les mob SUIVAIENT un parcours ! mais non, faire des d√©tours ne leur fait pas peur.
Il y a bien des tourelles qui font peur aux mobs, d'autres qui d√©tourne leur attention, des batiment qui produisent des drones de combat ... ah la bonne blague ces drones.
je vous plante le d√©cor d'une partie qui d√©bute, pas de pause hein le jeu ce fait en un coup, vous avez quelques secondes au d√©but de partie pour appr√©hender la carte qui ne bougequ'avez les touches et non pas en scroll souris, choisir les tourelles/batiments √† construire et l√† c'est du grand n'importe quoi, les mobs qui vont et viennent dans tout les sens.
pourquoi j'ai plant√© le d√©cors ? c'est que ces batiment de drone d'attaques, il y en a deux les classiques et les tanks, sont cens√©s poper les unit√©s toute les X secondes ... mouais ... bah mes parties ont dur√©es environ √† chaque fois dans les 30- 40 secondes donc j'ai jamais rien vu poper les batiments se faisaient d√©zinguer direct. 

Apr√®s il y a les mines ... mais comme les mobs font des d√©tours mettre des mines c'est useless.

Apr√®s il y a les murs, qui ne peuvent √™tre plac√©s qu'en nombre limit√©s, et biensur si tu prend le temps de faire un joli maze les mobs te foncent dessus avant que tu es pu poser ta premi√®re tourelle ...

je ne parle m√™me pas des batments qui boost les tourelles, plus tu les cumule autour de la tourelles plus les boost se cumulent. sauf que comme les mobs attaquent les tourelles et ensuite les batiments de boost ... vous voyez le probl√®me ?

EN FAIT Y A QUE DES PROBLEMES DANS CE JEU.

je dis pas ... si par exemple mon cerveau √©tait directement connect√© √† mon pc, si je n'avais pas besoin de mon clavier et ma souris pour jouer au jeu, oui alors l√† j'aurais qu'a regarder un endroit et penser √† un batiment/tourelle et hop √ßa se poserait tout seul, l√† j'aurais le temps de faire mon maze de mur de poser mes tourelles derri√®re, de poser mes batiments de boost, puis mes raffineries et les boost pour celles-ci, les batiment de drone, les piques au sol ainsi que les mines. oui en 15 secondes j'aurais le temps de faire tout √ßa si mon cerveau √©tait branch√© sur le pc.

mais c'est pas le cas.

Revenge of the titans est un tower defense futuriste o√π le joueur doit d√©fendre sa base contre des hordes d‚Äôaliens men√©s, sur certaines maps, par des boss immenses. J‚Äôai beaucoup de m√©fiance vis-√†-vis de ce genre de jeu.

Souvent mal √©quilibr√© entre les diff√©rentes forces ennemies, leurs vitesses, ou les co√ªts d‚Äôam√©liorations  des ¬´¬†tours¬†¬ª par rapport aux gains effectifs, il √©tait temps de remettre les pendules √† l‚Äôheure, et la tentative des d√©veloppeurs de Revenge of the titans s‚Äôav√®re plut√¥t r√©ussie. En fait, c‚Äôest assez malin et vicieux. Plusieurs raisons¬†: sur la carte de jeu d‚Äôabord, il n‚Äôy pas de chemins par lesquelles les ennemis iront √† la queue leu leu, mais juste des directions g√©n√©rales d‚Äôarriv√©es, autrement dit, le positionnement des tours de d√©fenses se fait par estimation et en temps r√©el. Si vous collectez bien √©videmment de l‚Äôargent en tuant des ennemis, vous ne le d√©pensez que sur la carte de jeu en achetant des tours suppl√©mentaires. Pour am√©liorer (upgrader) vos d√©fenses, √† chaque map gagn√©, on vous octroie une et une seule am√©lioration. Mais elle est gratuite¬†! Sauf que vous allez en avoir des possibilit√©s d‚Äôam√©liorations, surtout qu‚Äôelles suivent une arborescence (le c√¥t√© malin)¬†!

Et donc, vous recommencez pour valider votre th√©orie, sauf que vous vous apercevez qu‚Äôune autre am√©lioration pourrait bien vous aider aussi, etc. Pour les joueurs pers√©v√©rants, Revenge of the titans est un excellent jeu disposant d‚Äôune belle dur√©e de vie.

It can be quite brutal in difficulty at times, but it also forgiving with retrying. I found it a challenging experience with plenty of possible approaches and playstyles to the game.

During play it also actively engages you with player controlled turrets ('ghosts' for example need a special player controlled turret to be killed at first) and it regulary drops some boosters like bombs, freezes, and more or even money to pick up by point and clicking on the battle field. These acquired boosters can be saved cross mission and be used by the player in dire situations. 

The campaign will keep you busy for a while and you can play it differently on another play through. The DLC also offers a sandbox mode. 
In my honest opinion; it's a game you can play, enjoy, put down and re-play again when your bored. The only thing that I would like to see is a multiplayer mode DLC, it very much feels like an expanded version of tower defense games from starcraft and warcraft if you are familiar with it.

Lastly; I found the graphics quite pleasing, it looks simple but everything is clear and its fairly entertaining to look at. The game has its very own identity, and refreshing art style which is further proven by the other games in the same graphical style and theme by Puppy Games.

Les ennemis arrivent donc continuellement par plusieurs entr√©es et il n'est pas r√©ellement possible de les canaliser : les cr√©atures n'attendant que de d√©vorer tout ce qui s'y trouve et les tours prennent l'aggro suivant leur efficacit√©. Chaque partie peut donc changer du tout au tout, et il arrive que l'on s'y remette √† plusieurs fois parce qu'un bout de terrain non prot√©g√© permet aux ennemis de se faufiler ou qu'inversement une partie de notre d√©fense se verra martyris√©e au second restart. En l'absence de pause - sauf au d√©but o√π les ennemis n'arrivent que lors de la premi√®re raffinerie pos√©e - le gameplay se veut donc tr√®s arcade et terriblement stressant : il est vite vu d'√©tablir quelques tours que l'on devra revendre car leur placement est mal optimis√©.

Voyez le jeu davantage comme un STR classique : on y collecte des ressources en raffinant des gisements de minerai √† chaque mission, ressources qui seront alors utilis√©es pour la construction des tours et conserv√©es entre chaque mission. Entre chaque mission vous pourrez alors d√©penser un point de recherche dans un arbre technologique vaste. Vous posez peu de tours afin de gagner quelques sous pour plus tard au risque d'en voir certaines d√©truites sous les assauts r√©p√©t√©s des Titans ou alors allez-vous utiliser un maximum de ressources en prenant le risque de rencontrer des difficult√©s lors de la prochaine mission - bien qu'il soit possible de refaire les missions pr√©c√©dentes afin d'optimiser son √©conomie ? Le jeu est alors excessivement difficile et √† sa sortie beaucoup de joueurs ont abandonn√© une fois arriv√©s sur Mars ou Saturne. D'autant plus qu'il √©tait possible de s'y perdre dans l'arbre de technologie et de devoir tout recommencer afin de r√©tablir une nouvelle strat√©gie. D√©sormais, apr√®s la demande des joueurs, il existe un mode facile comme alternative pour esp√©rer voir le bout de la campagne, mais aussi une option de respec de l'arbre de technologies et la possibilit√© dans les options de d√©sactiver le r√©glage automatique de la difficult√© ; celui-ci augmentant le degr√© de challenge si vous aviez une bourse bien pleine.

C'est donc une exp√©rience hardcore d√©sormais possiblement abordable par le commun des mortels, et rafraichissante pour le genre, surtout que le jeu est accompagn√© d'une esth√©tique envoutante - la musique du menu place tout de suite l'ambiance.",1387792561,1389711973,True,10,0,0.646039605140686035,0,False,False,False,False,

The core gameplay is your usual tower defense: place shooty towers to shoot the monsters, place buffy towers to buff the shooty towers, place special towers to do other things like acquire more money. This part is fairly solid.

I can't stand the wrapper, though. To start with, upgrades have misleading mouseover descriptions. The game is played on a small map where monsters appear from the fuzzy dark edge and quickly approach your base. With this in mind, you might think that researching the Scanner (description: ""Long range detection systems using radar and lidar imaging to improve early alien detection"") would extend the map a bit, giving you more space in which to place towers and shoot monsters.
But no, the Scanner is actually a buffy tower that increases the firing range of the tower it's placed next to! No ""detection"" is involved.

In addition to this misinformation, the campaign mode is very unfriendly to going back and trying to improve your score. Suppose that you've advanced to (for example) level 6 of the campaign, and you're not happy with your performance, so you decide to go back and replay level 3 to accumulate more points there.
The extra points from a better completion of level 3 are not granted to your global resource pool on the campaign map, but to your next play of level 4. Thus, you'll have to replay level 4 and level 5 as well in order to get the new advantages transferred to level 6. In general, you won't be playing with your best results - you'll be playing with your most recent results, which makes it frustrating to attempt to improve your record.

The ""Distortion FX"" setting that is on by default and jostles your screen at irregular intervals, and the typos in technology descriptions, are just icing on the cake. Perhaps these things are meant to appeal to some sort of misguided realism, but when I'm blowing up alien titans with nanotechnology weapons, I don't want the absurd realism of having low-quality flickering displays because the war caused a power shortage and my character couldn't get spare parts delivered. I want an interface that lets me focus on the gameplay, and the lack of such an interface is the worst fault that I found with Revenge of the Titans.",1387725210,1387725379,False,16,0,0.543814957141876221,1,True,False,False,False,

This is more difficult than many of the other tower defense games out there, yet easycomers or young children should not fret since their is an easy campaign in addition to the normal campaign. The game also features an endless mode, a survival mode, and a sandbox mode. The missions are non repetitive and usually include new maps with new spawning locations. The graphics, at times, can be beautiful, but are often hindered by the game's dark atmosphere. There are many things I found that set Revenge of the Titans apart from the other tower defense games. For starters the game places you in the game with a base that you must defend and roads leading from the spawn areas to the base. One would assume the enemies would follow these paths? That person would be wrong as the enemies travel along the path only to increase speed but swiftly disengage the path to attack nearby towers or form a direct path to the base. You heard me correctly, the towers are destructible, easily so in fact. The towers must also reload ammunition, slowly I should add. All these things add to the difficulty of the game, yet I am thoroughly pleased as this adds unique challenges and situations and surprises to the game which allow the game to remain a fun challenge, even after hours of playing. This leads me to the research screen. After each level, the player is rewarded with medals and a research point. The player can then use the point in the most advance research screen I have ever seen in an indie game. This screen feature a myriad of choices and subcategories. One fault i must find is that although the player can research towers, these said towers can not be upgraded, other than the placement of other upgrade towers nearby that can also stack in boosting power up to 4 times. After an hour or so of gameplay, I am throughly pleased with this game and recommend that others pick up this game if on sale, as I find some difficuly in justifying $9.99 for a game which resides in the overflooded quantity of tower defense games on the steam marketplace.

the story/lore starts off about a small redneck football team trying to make it into the big times. denzel washington does some great acting, so it works out well. (i don't understand why the title had ""remember"" in it, since it is the first movie. perhaps a hint for a prequel?)

the demand for more was so great that they signed on for a trilogy set in the same universe, but further in the past. it's about the dinosaur era where giants roamed the lands and fought with the greek. good films. definitely some hints in a post credit scene about where the football team got some of their genes from. definitely worth the popcorn i kettled.

i guess some people complained, because the original football weren't in those last few films. someone read our petition at change.org/petition i think because they made us a game. 

this time it is set in the future. it seems to be implied that a side-effect of being raised in the south, famous, ignorant, and ruggedly swole (thanks titan genes) is that you reproduce like crazy. the football titans have mated to the point of overpopulation, and they are mad. so they are getting their revenge. fun little game really. try to stop them from uprooting all cultures and installing footballism in its place. it's a race against time.

All-around gameplay is excellent--the campaign is decently challenging to outright difficult, depending on the mission, and it's easy to see places where you can improve, though actually ""maxing out"" any given level is quite a feat, requiring a zen-like balance between defense and economy. The variety of enemies present also feels just right, and is one of the best places the game makes use of arcade gameplay sensabilties--you get no information about what enemies are incoming until they reach the battlefield, so the game is just as much about adapting your defenses on-the-fly as it is about big-picture planning, which feels really fresh for a tower defense game. The powerups are also an interesting twist, allowing you to be even more flexible--which gave the designers an excuse to make the game just that much more frantic.

Outside of the battles themselves, the tech tree you develop between missions is pretty nice; almost every new weapon unlock feels like an important decision, though it's a little unfortunate that many of the ""unlock new tree"" techs feel unrewarding, as they only offer the promise of cool upgrades next time around.

The game's aesthetics are fantastic, and make excellent use of the 8-bit style, further  complemented by the badass soundtrack and powerful sound effects--your weapons sound dangerous, the monsters sound terrifying, and the notifications and powerups sound like the coolest arcade game you've never played. There's a sort of vibrancy to this game that is hard to come by.

Extremely hectic Tower defense with a simple yet charming art style.

You will feel totally overwhelmed most of the time scrambling between selling buildings, patching up areas of your defense that are going to be overrun, clicking powerups..

Problem is the game gets HARDER the more money, resources, and powerups you stockpile.

Building vertically is superior to horizontal, so some maps are just frustrating to build on.

For example: It seems to be an intentional design choice that the playing map is just a tad larger than your screen size, no matter what resolution. With invaders coming from all sides, you have to roll the edge of the map left, right, up, and down to follow the action on each side of the map. So watching the action on one side of the map means, by definition, that you can't watch action on the other side. It's just a bad design choice to make the game artifically more difficult. A difficulty gimmick, if you will.

This game is mainly of the tower and defense genre where you must fight waves of aliens of varying strengths and abilities. Don't worry though, you have a MASSIVE arsenal at your disposal. The tech tree in this game is pretty big; there are plenty of weapons and upgrades in the game to suit your style of tower and defense strategy. There are power ups that can be used during the game as well to change the tide of battle like freezing enemies, nuking them, stimpacking your turrets, etc.

Overall, this game is highly polished. The presentation I believe is flawless because I enjoy the pseudo 8-bit style. The controls are easy to grasp and there are of course hotkeys to quickly build your defenses. The campaign is a good length and the game is just enough difficult to keep me from snoozing.

I like it. It's pretty much a tower defense title, except that you earn money to buy and upgrade things like buildings and money AFTER you finish the mission. Everything you buy will then be available in the next mission(s). Since the enemies walk around all over the map and they don't follow a certain path, it's more a tower spamming game. You just place towers all over the place (well, as long as you have the money), and most of them will do their job perfect. I'm missing the strategy part here, which is a real shame. Other than that, it's worth a try, just not for the full price. Get it when it's discounted (‚Ç¨5 or less).

And another interesting idea, is that often the titans will take the roads, but they are not dependant on them (as in they will go around). They are pretty much trying to make it to your base asap. taking the roads makes them a bit faster. I have not thoroughly finished singleplayer yet, but I generally got the idea of this game.

Thankfully the game warns you when a certain kind of tech is going to be important, so you don't end up stuck in an impossible situation. If things get too bad you can always go back to replay a previous level and do it better - giving you more to play with further down the line.
