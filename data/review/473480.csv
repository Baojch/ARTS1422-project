Great family game (could keep a young one occupied for some time)
controls are intuitive and clear.
No mouse needed.

CONS:
Levels do need a bit more vareity
Story isn't entirely clear

TLDR: Top down/Sidescroll weird maze navigation and slightly puzzle-ish diamond collection twitch reaction tablet-grade title. 

Review/Commentary: This is kind of like pacman, but without any addictiveness, fun, and less polish. You control this mole from top down view, except its not, its sideways, but it feels top down because of the strict maze restriction. Most walls are unbreakable except small dirt sections, round boulders are everywhere and will tumble down whenever you dig into something. Get hit by one and die. There are bats everywhere, get close to one it will chase you, you cannot kill it and you are too slow to effectively shake it off. Only way to kill it is to tumble a a boulder on it which is not as easy at it sounds. If it gets anywhere near you you are dead. There is no kill-all power up like in pacman.

Camera kind of sways back and forth a bit while moving, it can be managed but it is there and annoying. Color palette of bright green for walls was a poor choice. Same assets and same mechanics are reused level after level after level, bunch of little mazes that are mostly uninspired and feel like a chore to beat. You need to collect enough diamonds to fill your quota for the maze to be allowed to leave. 

They used some saxophone track as music and it works really good, without any obvious loop point inside it and it is not grating. However they used two separate sound effects when collecting diamonds, a bling  sound and a pop sound, and it sounds like the pop sound somehow conflicts with the bling sound and cuts it short. It is hard to describe but it is annoying. 

Xbox 360 pad worked correctly. Seems like world 1 had 40 levels and more worlds to come after that. I had gotten my permanent fill of this after 12 levels. It seems family friendly but I would feel rather guilty subjecting children to this.",1495771400,1509808188,False,1,0,0.540804743766784668,0,False,False,False,False,,,

~~~~~~~~

Ok, where is my orange helmet? Here it is! My backpack, my ingenious flying equipment, my cool dance moves. . .  I am pretty much set to go! Here I come, my little diamonds, my names is Miko. . . Miko the Mole, and I am on my way to become a master thief!

Miko Mole is an arcade puzzle game where you take control of a cute Mole with a tendency to like shiny rocks. The only small predicament Miko finds is that the diamonds are owned by Evil Corp and they will make it difficult for Miko to steal them.  

The aim of the game is to collect a specific number of diamonds within a time limit to open the exit grid and progress to the next level. If you do that well, you will be rewarded with three golden stars and points at the end of the level. You will have plenty of obstacles to avoid, and you will also have to avoid being caught by the likes of bats and rats.
 
Miko Mole has six challenging worlds in which to play, consisting of 40 levels per world. A whopping 240 levels in total. I find the first world quite easy to achieve the 3 golden stars but when you move to another world, you will find it quite challenging. In some worlds, you will not only have to deal with rats, bats and other animals but you will have to be careful not be seen by cameras, and avoid lasers, sonars, machine guns, boulders and more. However, you can use the boulders to your advantage by dropping them on your enemies’ heads. Some of the worlds will have switches which trigger doors to open. Usually these switches are in the middle of four colourful lights, and next to the light you will also see levers. Activating the switch initiate a light sequence. You will need to reproduce the exact sequence by pulling the levers next to the lights.  It can become very tricky when you have flying bats all around you or machine guns shooting at you! Poor Miko . . .   
 
In some levels, you will need to use dynamite to open a path, picking up crates or boulders that obstruct your way.

This game has cute graphics and an enjoyable soundtrack. In terms of the controls, you can use the keyboard, but I would strongly recommend using a gamepad. In my opinion the controls could have been smoother.

Positives:
~~~~~~~

-	Cute graphics
-	240 levels and 6 worlds to beat
-	The ability to move to another world as you wish
-	Good price point
-	 Fun to play for all ages
-	Achievements and trading cards

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~  

-	Controls could have been smoother

Miko Mole is a fun arcade puzzle game for all ages - everyone needs a cute mole in their game library!

Miko Mole is a clever blend of the puzzle, strategy, adventure, and platformer genre.

Some levels are straightforward while others are more intricate and the difficulty does not necessarily progress in that order. Some people are complaining about the graphics, but I argue that they are adequate if not appropriate for the game. Miko and his co-stars are adorable. Additional elements are added as the game progresses which keeps the game refreshing, but they don't appear until later in the game.",1466088141,1466833424,True,2,1,0.493978619575500488,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As Miko, you strive to ""steal"" diamonds from an evil mega-corp (of course), becuase you can, and female moles are renowned for their love of shiny stones. Probably.

Despite not having any real USP, what Miko does, it does very well. Equipped with a rotor a lá Inspector Gadget, you can fly, dig and walk through each level, accumulating the required amount of diamonds to proceed to the next. Miko has 6 worlds, and each world has 40 levels. (That's 240 by the way. It's a lot). As each level goes by, the difficulty increases, and with each new world comes new enemies, puzzle mechanisms and abilities to ensure a continued challenge and freshness.  

In terms of Steamworks, Miko offers trading cards, and a clever achievment collection that challenges users to achieve a specific target on specific levels, as well as the usual achievement for completing each level with 3/3 stars. Miko also offers full controller support.

At €4.99, Miko represents very good value, with a lot of content and replayability. It's easy to pick up, and will be popular with all ages.

Miko Mole is another Steam release from Ensenasoft, a Mexican studio with a strong catalogue of mobile titles. Miko Mole is also available on PS4.

OVERVIEW
In Miko Mole we control Miko, a charismatic mole that are finding gems for his collection. We need to hurry if we want to get a 3 stars rating at the final of level, and it gets more challenging and fun because we have a lot of traps,surprises and much more things that can kill us. The game has a large amount of levels and it's really small in size. The game is also cheap and features Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.
