1)Turn off the music. There's a bug in the game that makes all of the soundtracks play at once, it doesn't sound too bad some times, but it's not the most pleasant thing to listen to;

2)In the safehouse go till the farest wall to the right and change your tie to blue for SPEEED (cuz health is for casuals and stealth is non-existent);

3) NEVER get the Silenced Handgun, it does 0 Damage to dogs which can easily one-hit you.

P.S.: you can crouch to not die to dogs instantly, but when you stand up you'll die.

Oh and when you buy something, you don't get to keep it if you buy something else

また銃器や防具を購入するカスタマイズ要素もあるが、一度購入したあとで別のアイテムを装備し直すとふたたび購入し直さなければならなくなるという、あんまりにあんまりな仕様があり、１ステージあたりに稼げる金に比べてアイテム単価が高いこともあり、なんというか泣けてくる。

TLDR: Twitch reaction sidescroll shooter. Poorly executed. Relies on limited field of view. Repetitive and bland.

This is a simple game in which you navigaze small mazes in the form of office buildings with elevators. You encounter hostages and hostiles, and must gun down one and avoid gunning down the other and make it to the exit. Everything is black and white, the controls are a bit iffy, there is a delay between shooting and the action that is perceptible, and the hitbox work is approximative and sort of too generous making crouching or strategizing mostly pointless.

Conclusion:  You would be better off playing Hotline Miami which at least makes good use of the twitch aim mechanic and has a more straightforward level design.

I can't really reccomend it, but it's very middle of the road game. I would maybe give it 6/10, it's not [b]bad[/b], it's just not very good. I got this game along with 9 others by buying a set of random steam keys from some online retailer. Most of the other games were very bad and unplayable and in comparison this game isn't like that. I actively chose to finish it and it killed about an hour and a half. It sort of reminded me of a flash game you might play for free or something.

This game is like Gunpoint and Hotline Miami, but without the high octane action of Hotline Miami or the clever writing and gameplay of Gunpoint. It's also shorter and less challenging than either. I don't know how this game took two games I like a lot and managed to mash them together without including anything that made either good, but god damnit they did it. That's a talent in and of itself so good job.

Let's look at the pros and cons.

Pros
[list]
[*] Playable. I know this sounds like a given, but after eating a pack of random steam codes I've found this is surprisingly rare
[*] Art is good
[*] Music is alright
[*] Cheap, it's a decent game for the price
[*] Combat is fun. This is the central mechanic and it works well enough to sustain itself for 20 levels
[*] You can probably buy the game, beat it in under two hours and return it if you want
[/list]
Cons
[list]
[*] Writing, It's just not good and I honestly just skipped past the dialogue most of the time.
[*] Length, The game is short and doesn't end satisfyingly.
[*] Difficulty. This game is really easy. The hardest part is if you get killed really late in a big level you have to start from the beginning, but you can basically play this whole game without leaving cruise control
[*] Variety. There's very little done to mix things up. A few enemy types are added later in the levels, bringing the grand total to 4. A few switches are also in later levels, but there's almost nothing to make one level feel different than the rest.
[*] In the last 5 levels you can't upgrade your stuff, which was a bit irritating to me since I was saving up money for the more expensive upgrades, but it wasn't a big deal since you don't really need any upgrades to win.
[/list]

The game doesn't really feel finished basically.  There's still a few bigs floating around too, particularly regarding the dogs and the fat guys, which can result in your dying. Really though, this game has it's core mechanics and what it wants to be down, but then it just doesn't do enough with it. It feels like there could have been more in just about every category. More levels, more enemies, more difficulty, etc. The game just sort of ends as well. The plot is that you're out to rescue your brother and then at the end, there he is and there's the game over screen. The writing could have used work as well. A lot of games are able to get past lacklustre elements by putting some heart into the story or the line by line writing, but I don't think the developers really cared about the writing at all. It all seemed pretty generic.

To be honest, I feel like the people who made this game can probably make a pretty good game, which is sort of the frustration here. They covered the basics and proved they could put out a concept and this game ultimately works. My biggest problems are just that there wasn't enough of everything and it felt like they could have worked on it for longer. That's an easy problem to fix, and I'm hopeful about future titles from these guys.",1460914884,1460914884,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[u]tl;dr unten[/u]

Ich empfehle das Spiel ""noch"" nicht, in der Hoffnung dass sich was ändert.
Doch erst einmal zu den guten Aspekten:
Ich finde die Idee von dem Spiel gut und die Pixelgrafik versprüht einen gewissen Charme.
Man hat auch die Möglichkeit die Ausrüstung wie auch das Äussere des Charakters zu verbessern welche man sich von den in Missionen verdiente Geld kaufen kann.
 
Leider endet das Gute jetzt schon und ich hätte gern mehr dazu geschrieben...
... nun gut.
 
Wie steht es mit dem Negativen?:
[list]
[*]Das Spiel ist schnell durchgespielt. Mit 83 Minuten hab ich das Spiel jedenfalls durchgespielt. Man hätte ein paar Minuten länger spielen können oder sogar weniger. Aber ich denke meine  Spielzeit liegt in etwa im Durchschnitt. An sich für ein günstiges Spiel vielleicht nicht schlimm mit Wiederspielwert, doch dies hat es bei mir jedenfalls nicht. Das Spiel sollte also für 5 Euro wenigstens eine Stunde mehr Spiel bringen.
[*]Was mich auch sehr gestört hat, war, dass das Spiel auf Dauer eintönig wurde. Die Level unterscheiden sich nicht groß von einander (damit meine ich nicht den Schwarzweiß-Stil) und man verläuft sich ab und zu bei den immer größer werdenden Maps, da wie schon geschrieben man keine Optischen Punkte finden kann an dem der ""AHA"" Effekt auftritt und man weiß wo man sich gerade befindet.
[*]Mit [spoiler]4[/spoiler] Gegnerklassen die sich einem in den Weg stellen ist es dann auch schnell Suppe. Das typische System funktioniert wie immer: Drauf bis es umfällt. Mir etwas ZU stumpf.
[*]Was mich Total stört sind die nicht vorhandenen Hitpoints/Hitboxen. Egal auf welches Gliedmaß geschossen wird, der schaden ist immer gleich... teils kommt es mir sogar so vor, dass die Gegner nicht einmal einen Kopf besitzen da bei Kopfschüssen meist auch gar keine Treffer registriert werden.
[*]Und das Schlimmste ist, dass das Spiel noch recht verbuggt ist. Von Gegnern, die beim hinfallen durch den Boden fallen und verschwinden, zu Gegnern die beim hinfallen durch den gesammten Gang rutschen und dabei alle Türen öffnen die auf ihrem Weg zur nächsten Wand liegen durch die die Leiche dann natürlich auch einfach verschwindet bis zu Gegner die sich nachdem sie sich „leergeschossen“ haben auf einen zu bewegen um einen im Nahkampf zu erledigen und in dem Zustand des „auf einen zu bewegen“ entweder Unsterblich sind oder einfach nicht zu treffen sind (da man keine Anzeichen hat ob man getroffen hat oder nicht ist es schwer dies zu beurteilen). Doch dies ist nicht Selten passiert... bei ca. jedem 4. Gegner ist mindestens eine der oben genannten Sachen passiert... und letztere macht es nicht gerade einfach das Spiel erfolgreich zu beenden.
[/list]

Wäre das Spiel im Early-Access würde ich oben genanntes verkraften können und hätte ich größere Hoffnung auf Veränderungen. Da dies aber nicht der Fall ist, hoffe ich zwar dass sich doch was ändert, aber ich erwarte es nicht.

Ich hoffe ich konnte ein Gefühl für das Spiel (aus meiner Sicht) ermitteln.

It's a pixel art, side-scrolling shooter in which you play an assassin.

I love the artwork in this game. I like how everything is black and white except for the blood.

It really reminds me of Hotline Miami.
Between missions you have a chance to buy weapons and clothes/armor.

At release I noticed a couple minor bugs but the developer has already acknowledged them and says they will be fixed soon.

The price seems a tiny bit high at 5 euros, but not by much. The game feels polished.

It comes with 15 levels. I hope that more will be added later because the gameplay is quite fun. Please?

Pro's:
[list]
    [*]Runs well (I can hear /g/ saying 'no sh*t, it's pixel) but the amount of indie games that have their way with my beautiful resolution and rip 144fps down to 30 is slightly worrying.
    [*]Look's good, although the environments aren't much in terms of setting (offices mostly) detail in them is nice, only gripe here is character design is a bit meh, it could be more detailed, I think it'd look a lot better. Same with blood, there's a nice contrast a bit like Sin City but sprays are too similar. 
    [*]Gameplay is fun, you have limited ammo so need to stab people when possible. But that's it, it's fun but nothing special, people have compared it to hotline miami but I don't really see the correlation apart from the phone calls. Gameplay isn't similar apart from one hit kill on some enemies. 
[/list]

I'll add more when future updates come, now for cons, and why you should wait a bit........

[list]
    [*]Bugs, I know I said at ran well but there's a few glitches, I've seen a few enemies carry on with their movement patterns despite having two bullets in their posterior lobe. That and the upgrade system is just straight up f*cked, you buy stuff and maybe it'll get added or maybe it'll just eat your hard earned cash. I've also found one where dogs don't die or slide away after killing you but for some reason you stay alive for a few seconds.
    [*]It's pretty short so far, I've only played a bit and I'm half way through the 16 contracts, I don't know if there's more to come but I hope so, I know it was only made by three people but if workshop was integrated and levels could be created it'd be a lot more fun. 
This also makes me think about whether this game is relevant or not when you compare it to Gunpoint, that game's got a tonne of content now and more mechanics than this. I generally had a better time with gunpoint in terms of, well everything; gameplay, graphics, story. 
    [*]It gets a bit repetitive, it's quite easy if you take the reckless approach (I guess this is how people are comparing to Hotline), and just run in, duck a couple times then stab the guy. Also levels don't really increase in difficulty consistently, I guess it makes a change but some of the earlier ones I player were harder than the later ones (not because of upgrades)

Contract is a newly released side-scrolling shooter, think Gunpoint meets Hotline Miami. Your brother has been taken and the only way you can get him back is by completing a number of assassination contracts for the only person who knows where he is. As an ex-cop you know your way around a gun but you’re out of your depth as a new assassin, do you have what it takes to get your brother back?

Full Disclosure: A review copy provided by the developer.

[h1]Presentation [/h1]

Contract has a nice pixel art type appearance going on and it looks great. Its appearance is clearly inspired by the likes of Gunpoint but the dull colours throughout and the contrasting blood red make the visuals stand out. Contract’s crosshair makes up one of only two UI elements in the game and it’s done very well. The crosshair’s size increases the further you move your mouse away, giving you a rough idea of where your bullet will hit and making it obvious that your gun has better accuracy at close range, it sounds simple but without it, aiming in Contract would probably be a lot harder. The other UI element is a simple counter in the top right of the screen telling you how much ammo you’ve got, not much to say about this one.

[h1]Gameplay [/h1]

At the beginning of each mission you’re given a short briefing on what you need to do, often including some information on the building you’re going into or the business that operates there. Once you’ve been briefed you just have to make it to your target, kill him and then find an exit. Some missions have an alternate route to your target and you can pick between the two, deciding which one you want to take. It’s also worth mentioning that your target is the only person who has to be killed for you to complete the mission, killing other enemies will award you with a small cash bonus but there is, of course, a risk that you could get killed.

The game has five different kinds of enemies:
[list]
[*]Regular guards: One shot to kill, they carry a pistol with a medium fire rate.
[*]Armoured guards: Three shots to kill, they carry a pistol with a medium fire rate.
[*]Heavily armoured guards: Five shots to kill, they carry a light machine gun with a slow fire rate.
[*]Dogs: One shot to kill, they’ll kill you instantly if they get close enough to bite you.
[*]Targets: One shot to kill, they surrender as soon as you enter a room and will never attack you.
[/list]

So on to the character you’re actually playing as. With the default gear you can take a couple of shots before you’re down for good but if you manage to survive after taking a bullet or two you’ll gradually return to full health, I have no way of knowing how fast that occurs though as there’s no health indicator. You’re given a bog standard pistol to begin with but you can purchase a silenced pistol, assault rifle and submachine gun once you have enough cash and you’re at the safe house. As well as guns you also have a melee attack which can be used to kill all of the enemies apart from the dog, unless you somehow manage to punch it before it kills you. When you’re at the safe house you can also buy new clothes, most of which have an effect on your stats. For example, you can buy medium armour which increases your health, meaning you can take more shots without dying.

Some of the missions also contain things for you to interact with, such as computers to unlock security doors or switches to turn off the lights. These don’t play a huge role in the missions like they do in games like Gunpoint but since the switches and computers are often in isolated rooms with only one way in, trying to find them adds a nice challenge sometimes.

The game’s combat is pretty simple, it’s just shooting back and forth, yet it’s a lot of fun. However, the game does have a cover system, crouching by an object will give you cover and make you harder to hit as well as increase your accuracy. Crouching away from cover also makes you slightly harder to hit and, as with cover, increases your accuracy slightly.

[h1]Audio [/h1]

What Contract lacks in soundtrack variety (there are only two or three tracks) it makes up for in how good said tracks are. They fit nicely with the game’s style and while they do of course get repeated a lot I didn’t find myself growing tired of hearing them. The sound effects for the guns are also very good, they make the guns seem like they have a real punch to them, something you would of course expect from guns.

[h1]Miscellaneous [/h1]
[list]
[*]Contract doesn’t have much replay value since the twenty missions are always the same. There’s enough content to warrant the price tag, just don’t expect much once you’ve beaten the game.
[*]Most of the bugs and issues with the game have been fixed at this point but there may be one or two left in there, nothing game-breaking though.
[*]You can’t pause the game but that’s not a huge issue since as long as you’re not in a room with enemies, chances are you won’t be attacked.
[*]Enemies do react to gunshots on the same floor as them, they won’t come running into the room and attack you but the will be facing the direction that the shots came from when you enter a room so you need to be prepared.
[*]While the three hours is how long it took me to beat the game I’d say an actual run of all twenty missions takes around two and a half hours, I had to restart a couple of times due to my save being broken by updates.
[*]The story isn’t going to win any awards but it does a good job at tying the missions together and it is pretty intriguing, even if it does have a rather abrupt ending.

[h1]Verdict [/h1]

[b]Worth Purchasing. [/b]

Contract is a great side-scrolling shooter that’s easy on the eye, has simple yet satisfying combat and a good amount of content for the price. If there’s one thing I’d like to see it’s a mission generator but if you’re a fan of the genre or just fancy taking a side-scroller for a spin then I’d suggest you give this one a go.
