Не могу точно вспомнить, получил ли я игру бесплатно или купил за копейки на распродаже.

Игра платформер, чем-то схожа с лимбо. Здесь есть сюжет, но всё на английском, я не хотел искать русификатор да и самому не хотелось особо в него вникать, в игру я играл, пока слушал что-нибудь на фоне. Сама игра представляет из себя головоломку - каждая локация маленький пазл. Для решения головоломок у героя есть способность Blink, которая позволяет делать всё вокруг нематериальным, но свет от какого-либо источника остается твердым, если он находится на какой-то поверхности(если вдруг не понятно, то посмотрите трейлер, только первые кадры, потому что дальше показывают решения некоторых комнат)
Постепенно комнаты усложняются, появляются новые испытания, в целом как и должно быть

Немного о мире: мы играем за мальца, который хочет найти своего папу. Как я понял в мире появилась темная сила, которая породила монстров. Один из монстров забрал отца. По ходу игры узнается, что за сила у главного героя, что за темная сила, как на неё реагируют другие люди и в целом как она повлияла на мир.

С технической точки зрения, графика максимально простая, музыка спокойная, создаёт атмосферу. Головоломки простенькие. На всю игру у меня ушло 2 часа, но скорее всего есть скрытый контент, который я пропустил.

First off let's address the elephant in the room: the graphics. The graphics, the music, and the sound design all suck, especially when compared to industry standards.

游戏虽然是用flash制作的，但内容能看出开发者的用心

游戏中的你，获得了一个神奇的能力，当闭上眼睛后，世界将从你身旁消失，而之前在视野范围内的明亮物体将留下残像，你可以移动在这些残像上，帮助你达到之前无法移动的地方
以操作来说，就是按下blink键（默认K或者C）后，会进入残像模式，根据之前光源的范围内产生实体，而之前物理实物则能被你穿越
规则很简单，关卡设计上也是逐渐加强，让你慢慢适应操作
从最初的直接使用blink后穿过障碍，到逐渐自己搭建移动路径，甚至后期出现可以造成伤害的幽灵，非常好的难度梯度
游戏每张地图的流程都不算很长，就算掉落出地图或者碰到幽灵也不会导致游戏失败，只是从当前地图入口重新开始而已，所以总体难度也不高
全流程大概一个半小时，有些成就涉及到隐藏关卡，可参考指南

In blink you journey through a world in search for your father who has left you and your sister for unknown reasons. You do this by platforming around however, this can also be done by walking on the afterimages of light. According to the steam page these are afterimages you see after you rapidly blink or shut your eyes and it is indeed a very interesting concept which is executed very well. 

[b] Introduction [/b]

In blink you are searching for your father and to do this you must conquer the landscape and solve the many puzzles that it has to offer, And these puzzles have been excellently designed. Together with this also the art style and many of the other features like interactions with characters and world design have been done very nicely. The story goes deeper than just trying to find your father with precursor races and more which I will elaborate on later. 

[b] Story [/b]

You the player watch through the eye of an ancient precursor race known as eolians to the humans. You watch through its eye as the boy that you control as a player puzzles his way through various scenes. The boy is trying to find his father while the eolian is trying to find if there are any of his kind left. His species have almost been wiped out because of something called “shadows” you encounter these many times and they are a part of puzzles which is extraordinary!  The way these shadows are designed is incredibly scary, they’re not made to look scary but they certainly are with their menacing slow walk and almost non-existent face.

The way the story is constructed makes you as the player understand a story that the character you are seeing through already knows which is quite hard to do in most games but here it’s done excellently. Even though it’s technically a puzzle game you could almost call it exploration as the story drives you forward in a quest to find out what’s going on and seeking answers. 

[b] Gameplay, movement and mechanics [/b] 

The most innovating mechanic in blink is the ability to walk over the afterimages left by light, in many games the aspect of time travel has been brought as an interesting mechanic however this mechanic that is also interwoven with the story and the enemies is besides from more interesting and original also better implemented.
 
Light that turns into afterimages after you “blink” will be a walkable surface for a certain amount of time before you die because you were “blinking” too long. The best part is that you can interact with the light in many different ways; if you were to jump in front of it then at that place there would be no walkable surface. If you would turn a lamp only at that spot would there be light etc. it’s that devotion to not just slack off a feature like that which makes this game better than your average new grounds platformer. 
With the amount of exploration you can do and how many things you can see just using a relatively simple mechanic as walking on light the game becomes a lot more enjoyable and that is what makes it stand apart so much from all the other hand drawn adventure platformers with a nice narrative. 

[b] Art and Soundtrack [/b]

The art in blink is quite phenomenal, wonderfully crafted backgrounds with fluid animations all made by hand. The art style helps convey the twisted dark atmosphere of some of the scenes while rejoicing in the happier parts which is quite impressive for the same art style. 

The shadows look scary and menacing but this is not completely because of the looks in fact this is also largely due to the soundtrack of the game which varies a lot, it can go from happy to eerie to absolutely terrifying. The last one is used for the shadows when “blinking” as that is the time when they will chase you, depending on the monsters that is, which for a single soundtrack is impressive as well. 

[b] Conclusion [/b] 

All in All Blink is an incredible work of art with an interesting narrative, likeable characters and great puzzles and platforming. You can see that the developers really care about the game and even though 7 euros may feel like a bit much for “just another platforming game” it’s definitely worth those 7 euros.

It’s a cute and intuitive mechanic, with a wide range of potential. Does it live up to it?

Blink’s story is about as run of the mill as it gets: you’re a child who is looking for their father who hasn’t come home for unknown reasons, and you interact with an ancient civilization that helps you on your path. It goes exactly where you’d expect it; there are no surprises here. There’s a few cute chunks of writing in the town setting, but the story is really not the focus here.

Blink uses a pixel art aesthetic, which is fine, though it is evidently unprofessional in quality. Your scarf clad hero has a nice sense of motion in his animation. It will occasionally zoom out for a larger frame of camera, and the resolution will not scale in the way it should. The music and general sound design is over the same caliber. The music is forgettable; I couldn’t hum you a tune from the soundtrack, but it is mostly innocuous and non-irritating. Mixing was funky at times. There was the poor design choice of having the music cut out every time you blinked, as a synthetic hum replaces it, rising in volume. The purpose of this hum is to indicate to you that you should unblink soon (it has a time limit), but this could have been done in a way that doesn’t create a jerky audio experience. Because you blink a lot in this game. It’s the primary function of this game.

As I’ve said, Blink’s primary mechanic, that of playing with light, is something that has a wide range of potential. It’s done in a slightly funky way: light is manifested by circles one can hop on, but it works. Blink does enough with it to come out on the positive side there. Using gameplay dualities (i.e. creating two (or more!) modes of play that one switches in between) is not something new to video games. I would give you a list, but it would be a waste of time, because you are probably already thinking of several titles that play around with this. I’m not saying this to be disparaging. It’s a great mechanic, and I am always interested in games that mess around with it. It works fine here. What is a far less common mechanic is light-play. While it appears in many games on occasion, I can only think of a few games that use this as a fundamental mechanic. By blending the two, Blink creates an interesting possibility space for puzzles. And for the most part, it uses that space to good effect. Puzzles were enjoyable, though a bit rote at times, and I never felt truly challenged. New puzzle elements were introduced at a consistent enough rate to keep me interested and engaged in the experience. It has a few tricks up its sleeve. For a puzzle platformer with only two action buttons, Blink gets a lot out of it’s system. 

I hate to do this, but it’s hard not to compare this game to another. Eyebrow Interactive’s Closure was a game that also played with light, to an extreme and complex extent. If you couldn’t see it, it really wasn’t there. Blink takes the fundamental principle of Closure, but layers on the mechanic of duality. This is great, but I never felt like I was playing a game that was breaking new ground. It’s mechanic of duality is fine, and it’s mechanic of light play is fine, but the whole is not much greater than the sum of it’s parts. It is nothing more, and nothing less. I do not think one should judge the quality of an experience based on what it is not, of course, so I do think this may be personal projection. Playtime clocked at about two hours, so I may be hesitant to purchase at full asking price.

Blink has a fun mechanic, and uses it. The puzzle design is engaging and uses its core mechanic to a healthy degree, if perhaps a little easy-going. It’s a fun game, but you likely won’t feel much of a need to return to it. As a whole, it is inoffensive and average. It is a good game, but not a great one.",1493587251,1493587368,True,14,1,0.618030428886413574,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I have been talking, writing, reviewing Indie games for a long time. After a while you begin to see patterns or formulas form when it comes to Indie games. It’s not that they become predictable or boring, on the contrary. So when I say that Blink is a Limbo-like title, I mean that in a good way completely. It doesn’t change the fact though, that this is a Puzzle/Platformer starring a child with a strange power that helps him overcome gaps, and shadowy death monsters with an awesome art style. If Walking Simulator/Roguelike can be a genre, can’t Limbo-like be one?

I am aware that Puzzle/platformers have long existed before Braid and Limbo came to be but they are the bar these days. Games such as BOOR, Inside and Never Alone continue to prove the passion and demand for these types of games. It’s a crowded genre to say the least but one I hold in high esteem and love. One the developers seems to as well. Which is why I’m more than happy then to start by saying I highly recommend Blink. 

Blink is about a small child whose father goes missing. No, not at the bar type missing but really missing. Without much explanation you wake up inside a mysterious temple and an invisible voice reaches out to you. It gifts you with a power to slip into, “The Eye.” In the Eye, the laws of physics are different. This begins your quest to find your father and unravel the mystery of the voice and shadow monsters that have begun to plague your village. It’s simple, neat and well told. It’s no Stephen King story mind you, but it gets the major points across without unnecessary complexities.

The story does evolve and even culminates in a pretty awesome boss battle. For most of the game though its a rather monotone mood but in a good way. While the puzzles are challenging and even had me scratching my head at times. I never felt frustrated or angry at my mistakes, certainly not cheated. Blink has fantastic controls and responds remarkably well. The entire experience is very fluid and enjoyable from beginning to end. When I started playing it, I didn’t stop until I had beat the game. It’s that just smooth and enjoyable.

To be fair Blink is a rather short experience, topping out for me at 2 hours of total game time. I am fairly experienced at these titles though and it may take longer for others. This is still a rather short experience but I don’t find the pricing unfair at £4.99/$6.99. Especially when others have charged way more for the same amount of game time. (coughINSIDEcough)

Let’s talk about how puzzles work in this game.

With a press of a button the kid can transport himself into the Eye, a realm where an after image can be used to traverse the terrain. The most basic way to explain it is, you’re using light to create a shadow that acts a platform once you slip into this realm. One important thing to note though is that in the absence of light there is nothing. Which means you will fall into nothing, which happened frequently to me. Also you can’t stay very long in The Eye realm, as it will consume you.

What is very impressive is how well this entire system works. You can use light to trap your enemies inside of barriers, create stairwells for yourself, and use the absence of light to slip through walls. It’s all very strange, but it when you get the hang of it, its awesome. The game does begin throwing in more obstacles as you progress. The Shadow monsters are slow and somewhat stupid but become faster and more feral in the Eye. Some shadow creatures can only see you once you slip into the Eye. This leads to it becoming terrifying as they run you down while you try to move through an area. Later areas throw in lanterns, fog, and platforms that shift into The Eye with you. I cannot stress enough that this is a very smooth and wonderfully done progression. It kept things fun but not stressful. I loved that.

One thing I feel that will perhaps make a person think twice is the art style of this game. Beauty is in the Eye of the beholder in this case. (pun intended.) I will be frank in saying that the sprites for the Humans in this game are weird, and they’re my least favorite part. I felt like I was controlling a hot dog child wrapped in a coat. On the other hand, everything else looks spectacular. The rigid nature of the sprites works well for the shadow monsters and makes them feel alien. The backgrounds and the environments are gorgeous and feel like a painting. I couldn’t stop hitting my screen cap button while playing.

Details are abundant and there was plenty of times I stopped and spoke to some sheep. The final area of the game is, by far, the most memorable and really just tops things off so very well. Of course none of this really works without a good soundtrack. Thankfully, Blink has an orchestral soundtrack and it’s exactly what you would expect for this type of game. It elevates the game and I never got tired of it. Sound effects while minimal, are sufficient but nothing inspiring.

As to the odds and ends, Blink does feature Steam achievements but currently no Steam cards. The game features full controller support. No rebindable keys sadly. Replay value is something that will be lacking for this type of game. You might pick it up again in six months and have fun though. This is standard for most games of this nature. The game runs on flash and has zero options menus, those with higher resolutions will have an experience that may vary. Keep that in mind.

Does Blink bring anything new to the table/innovate? Not necessarily but it does what it set out to do perfectly. If you have played games like Limbo/Braid you know what to expect. If you have never played any of them then this is a great place to start. I never found a bug nor crashed while playing. The nature of the puzzles and mechanics of your powers is executed perfectly. It’s what I took most away from this game. It was just a joy to play. Hopefully more people play Blink and spread the love of Indie Games.",1493267438,1493267438,True,7,0,0.54243922233581543,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And I have to say its a very solid, fun indie game.  

Story: You're a young kid that is looking for his father.  While looking, you run into this being called the Eye where everything it sees is a reality for you but when it closes its eye, the world disappears around you and anything brightly lit up leaves an afterimage burned into the vision of the Eye.  Using the eye's powers, you will explore the world, solve puzzles, find out what happened to the eye's kind and find your father.  The story is nothing to get excited about but it provides a good setting for how the game plays and for the most part provides reasons for everything that is happening.  It would be nice to see more of the world and learn more about the characters, but remember this is an indie game made by a small group of developers.  Frankly its interesting and serves its purpose.  You don't finish the game with questions.  

Graphics: The game is colorful and I like the art design.  The shadows and light effects are well done, creating a great puzzle platformer game.  I set the graphics to fancy and I played on a 2K monitor for the entire game and I didn't really see any graphical issues while playing.  But my graphics card has more than enough power to play this game. Kudos to the artists!

Sound: The music in the game is very calming and soothing until you run into the enemies which makes the music tense but not too tense.  The music does not overwhelm the gameplay.  In fact I sometimes didn't even notice there was music playing.  In my opinion the music and sound effects work well with the game.  Its not in your face and its not too soft.  Though I would not get the soundtrack.  

Gameplay: I played this game with an Xbox One controller and I recommend playing with a controller.  The controls are simple and its easy to understand how to play the game.  The game does a good job giving you the instructions and what to do in order to solve puzzles. I never felt like the controls made it hard to solve puzzles.  Its a puzzle platformer that has you manipulate light to solve puzzles, avoid enemies and jump on to platforms to move on to the next puzzle.  Its a very ingenious game that will test your brain a little.  There were times for me where I had to think about how to solve the puzzle (different from my usual fare of shooters and strategy games).  There are not hard but sometimes there is no clear answer unless you stop and think.  Puzzles are well done and clever.  There will be some puzzles that frustrate you at first but you will figure it out.  Note: I didn't run into any issues where I messed up the puzzle and I had to restart but there was one puzzle where I messed up and I almost couldn't restart.  If you run into that issue just quit the game and start it again.  Would be nice to have a restart checkpoint option in the menu.  

Overall: I like this game.  Its different from my usual fare of shooters and strategy games.  For the price you will get a 2-3 hour game on your first playthrough.  After that you may become a pro and get the other achievements.  I would recommend trying this game out.  Its unique, its fun and its short.  It will definitely test your brain a little bit but in a clever way.  Definitely worth a buy and I would buy this for some of my friends.

Blink is a fun little side scrolling adventure game with a unique twist.  The game world can be swapped at will between the normal version, and a version where you can interact with light.  Light in the game world is dynamic, and can be changed to solve sticky situations and get through hard to pass areas.

[h1]PROS[/h1]

-Interesting environment
-Responsive controls
-Ever changing scenery
