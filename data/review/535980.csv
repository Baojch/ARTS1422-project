Or too simple, if you like things that are less simple.  Possibly not simple enough if you are simple yourself.  Each puzzle is a stack of words which gives a clue to a vertical word revealed by sliding the horizontal words to and fro.  This does create some strange puzzles sometimes, because every clue has to contain as many words as there are letters in the solution, and the stack has to contain the letters to the answer, in order.

So let's say the answer is ""ice"".  The stack could be ""incredibly cold water"" since that can refer to ice, and each word has the appropriate letter in it somewhere.  Where it gets a bit odd is when the answer words get longer, and the phrases start to shoehorn words in just to make it work.

Take the word ""unicorn"".  You wind up with a clue like ""equine horned which phallicly often attracts virgins"".  Sure, I guess it kind of makes sense, but don't be expecting dictionary grade definitions here is all I'm saying.

Overall, Phrase Shift isn't going to make you think too hard, except when it gets weird, but it's a fine game to play on a dreary winter day as you sit sipping cocoa, gazing out the window, dreaming of horses.

There are 600 puzzles total, giving you many puzzles for a low price. 

Horizontal words are arranged in rows. Reading these lines will give you the clue about what the word they want you to guess is. You can move the letters in these horizontal rows in order to create the answer to the solution vertically (the white column). 

Although the clues are minimilistic, it gives you enough of a clue that you usually able to figure it out. Puzzles range from 3 letter words to 8 letter words. There are different themes, and depending on your knowledge, some puzzles can be very challenging. The movie pack for example is probably one of the more cryptic ones, given that they are only allowed to give you so much information. Even when you are stumped, you can use a clue to reveal one letter at a time to help with the puzzle. The clues recharge quickly, and there are no penalties, allowing you to use them as many times as you'd like. Even when the clues are a bit far fetched and difficult to figure out, it's not too hard. Comparitively, the rest of the game is pretty easy to figure out.

It has a nice relaxing sound track and easy achievements. It does not have cloud saves - so make sure not to do 39/40 puzzles in one pack on one computer and then move to another one, you won't be able to continue where you left off.

How it works:  You are given a clue arranged in words stacked on top of each other forming a sentence.  One word per line.  Using that clue you have to move the words left or right until the correct letters for the solution are in the lighted up vertical line.  You can see examples in the screenshots and game's description.

The game is arranged in different categories.  3 letter words, 4 letter words, etc. up to 8 letters, then categories like Food, Science, Animals, Fashion, and Misc. categories.  

To be honest the game is fairly easy.  There is a cheat button which will reveal one of the letters.  I have used that a few times when I was stumped and didn't want to sit there thinking forever.  

What I really like about the game is the creative clue descriptions.  They had to really be clever sometimes to have only so many words and with the correct letters for the clue.  

This would be a nice family game.  Everyone sit around the screen and the first to shout out the answer wins a point.  Keep going until a set number of points is reached or a time limit, whatever you decide.  So far it's been family-friendly, no risque words, but I have not completed the game yet, so don't take my word for it yet.

The pace is pretty quick, until you get stumped.  I play for about 15 minutes a day before I get bored and want to play something else.  So this is not one of those puzzle games where you play for hours at a time.

Overall, I recommend this game.  Price is cheap and seems good for the amount of content you get.  Graphics are minimal, as seen in screenshots.  Sounds are limited; I think there's a sound for getting a word right but I don't remember much else.

it's a fun game in general, but there are some quirks to it. firstly, it's very american. *spoiler* [spoiler]for example, a suction device for cleaning would be a vacuum in american, a hoover in british, so certain things might not automatically cross a person's mind. or another example about what hockey players wear, the answer is skates, but that actually only applies to the american ice hockey sport, while there IS actually hockey played elsewhere around the world, where the players just run around without skates.[/spoiler]

secondly, some of the 'descriptions' feels almost forced on and/or abstract, just to have the letters available. this makes the puzzle almost awkward and confusing sometimes. of course, i do appreciate that it's not easy to find words that could make up the description sometimes, that still has the letters needed to form the answer.

finally, i think the 'reveal' button, should have a more limited usage. perhaps just once or twice per round tops. this is because this feature makes the game 'too easy' to beat i suppose. or perhaps do away with it altogether, and add a 'hint' or 'clue' button, where a brief, but further description is given, without revealing any letters. would add to the challenge a bit more.

all in all, it's a good concept, but could still do with some work. one thing that comes to mind, is perhaps breaking free of some american-centric questions, like name of places and presidents (unless it's something, or someone famous where the rest of the world has a chance of answering, like a lincoln or kennedy), and widen it to a more global thing. questions involving europe, asia, africa, the rest of the world too. just a thought.

I honestly didn't expect it to be very challenging at all, as most word games I've played in the past I've found to be fairly simple, but the wording of the clues is clever enough to not be blindingly obvious at times, and given that I'm only up to the  5 letter puzzles, this pleases me, as it means the likelyhood of the whole game being a cakewalk is minimal :)

Some clues are insultingly simple, such as the one with ""bee"" as a solution. Others, especially in the ""movies"" section, are impossible without either extensive guesswork or specific cultural knowledge. (For that matter, some of the ""movies"" puzzles contain spoilers!) And some phrases aren't especially difficult, but just kind of stretch things in an awkward way. There are even a couple cases where a puzzle or solution is repeated! So many answers are simple enough that I want to recommend this game for English learners... but they'd be completely stymied by the more obscure or awkward puzzles.

In the end, despite the crossword puzzle comparison, *none* of these puzzles gave me an especially deep feeling of satisfaction to solve. Everything was either trivial, frustrating, or just kind of blah. Perhaps most damning of all is that while I was solving the puzzles, I made a little challenge for myself to see if I could maximize the number of columns I lined up for each solution. That's right, I had to make a game within the game to keep it even mildly interesting.

I'm left with the feeling that we're actually seeing the wrong end of things: the actual *fun* game contained within this idea would be a social game where you've given the solution, have limited time to come up with a phrase like the ones that form these puzzles, and then vote on who came up with the best phrase.

Word puzzle game where you are presented with a serious of clues and you have to slide the individual words horizontally to form the answer vertically made up of one letter of each of the clue words.

There are 600 puzzles in the game made up of 3 to 8 letter answers spread across 15 40 puzzle themed sets. While most of the clues are quite elegant, some are obtuse and others unintentionally misleading. There is a clue system where you can reveal one letter at a time of the answer if you get stuck so your progress is never impeded for too long. One note: this is an American game so uses American synonyms and spelling, not British.

There are some bugs almost completely contained to the level selection screen and what happens after you hit next puzzle. As you progress through a puzzle set the game will invariably skip at least two levels for some reason meaning you will have to go back to the puzzle selection screen after each set is ""complete"" achievement wise to finish off the ones the game skipped. The selection screen can also bug out showing half of one and half of another or nothing at all.

All in all this is a very nice little word puzzle game, well recommended. It should take somewhere about 3-4 hours and you can get 100% achievements just for finishing it.
