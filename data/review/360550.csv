It has alot of CGs but not that many really stand out.  Some even look almost identical to the other CG right next to it.  In which case they should have combined it.

It's also a Choice-driven VN, meaning it has multiple endings.  All the endings are pretty average, although my favorite was NOT the True ending per se.

Меня очень заворожила идея данной визуальной новеллы. Тем, которых могло бы коснуться повествование, немало. Но в итоге за прочтением последней концовки меня постигло разочарование. Шутка ли - я пишу отрицательный обзор (что происходит крайне редко, я уважаю любой писательский и творческий труд). Хотелось бы разобрать по пунктам все, что понравилось и не понравилось.

[h2][b]Плюсы:[/b][/h2]

 • Графика. Персонажи довольно симпатично нарисованы, но есть нюанс, о нем позже. Присутствует несколько CG, красивые фоны.

 • Музыка. Вполне атмосферная, но иногда прерывается слишком резко.


[h2][b]Минусы:[/b][/h2]

 Отсутствует эффект заинтересованности и погружения в визуальную новеллу, а именно:

 • Нет прямой речи, просто куски текста Для меня это совершенно удивительно, так как прямая речь - важнейший инструмент для интерактивной книги. То, что разделяет книгу и VN. К тебе обращаются. Ты - протагонист. Здесь же просто текст нужно проматывать, где в кучу и прямая речь, и мысли протага, и описания действий. Ужасное решение.

 • Спрайты персонажей. У нас присутствует персонаж, у которого пол лица закрыты повязкой. И имеется на него у нас всего два спрайта - открытый рот и закрытый. Совершенно не постарались ребята. Везде один и тот же спрайт, во всей новелле абсолютно. Халтура или дедлайны? Мы этого уже не узнаем. Так же и с другими персонажами. У Сасы CG было чуть побольше.

 • Персонажи. Плоооские. Не раскрыты. Смерть кое-кого не была обоснована и раскрыта. Я ждала флешбека. Эмоционального наполнения.  Я его не получила. в тру энде нууу просто все хорошо. Ок. Мне пофиг на персов. Пусть живут.

 • Таймскип. Нафига он был нужен? И так же есть у некоторых сцен резкие обрывы.  В целом после получаса бросила все надежды на эту новеллу, так, как поняла, что дальше - только хуже.

 • Шуточки ГГ. Ну вы серьезно? Он себя ведет, как задрот-двачер. Это было бы к месту, если бы ему было 16-20 лет. Я не против шуток, но здесь они были странные и не в тему. Почему ГГ испытывал симпатию к кое-кому? Я хз. Мы должны по умолчанию, видимо, сопереживать. Но у меня он вызвал отвращение. Своими попытками делаться перед дамами.



В общем и целом, из эпизодов понравился эпизод Сасы, Миён и ГГ, где они были вместе и держались за руки. Персонаж Сасы раскрыт более других, у нее есть чувства хоть какие-то. Больше зацепиться не за что.  Жалею потраченных денег. Надеюсь, Birdling лучше.

As a visual/interactive novel, this doesn't feature any notable gameplay, it's just a lot of clicking through badly written dialogue that would never have been accepted or published in print, which poses the question, ""How did something this badly written end up on Steam?"".  

When someone hoping to become an author is unable to get published in print, they spend $100 and dump their high school fan-fiction onto Steam, under the guise of a game.  This e-book was slapped together with the godawfully bad RenPy Visual Novel/E-Book construction kit, so just like no professional writing took place here, no professional game development took place either, it's just a product of filling out templates in the construction kit.

This E-book features Choose-Your-Own-Adventure elements where you make some decisions that don't do anything to change the fact this is just an E-Book.  Nobody finished reading a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book and said ""Boy, what a great game I just played!"".   Because E-books aren't games.  And neither is this.

The subject matter of this E-book is a deplorable anime themed ""I'm 14 and so edgy and dark"" storyline, very cookie cutter, something to do for emo kids between visits to Hot Topic I guess.  So, basically, garbage.

Visual novels/e-books are tedious at best... imagine the best novel you ever read, be that Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Twilight (if you have terrible taste in literature), but then translate that to a format where the words dribble out and you have to click your mouse every time you wanted to read the next sentence, instead of just turning the pages. You'd think it was garbage.

Now imagine that experience, but with much worse writing (because if these guys could write professionally, they'd be published authors and this would be on shelves in bookstores, and they wouldn't have to pay Valve $100 to self-publish this on Steam), and you have your average Steam e-book.

You can get better quality books and comics for free online or from public libraries, or from bookstores for a fraction of the price of this ""game"".  Steam isn't a comic book store, neither is it Netflix, it's for games.  Your gaming rig is not a Kindle.  It's impossible for me to recommend things to PC gamers that aren't really games.

I would've liked it to have been two or three times as long with fewer time skips and more of the character development shown. I do like the main cast of characters, but some extra length could've made me like them even more. The art is pretty nice and the character designs are interesting and cute. The music is perhaps even better, though. 

For endings, to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of any of them. But of all of them, to me, one stood out as better than the others, while another had a nice epilogue. The one I liked the best overall was mostly because it made the most sense to me as what the characters would have chosen to do.

As a side note, some phrasing used throughout the game was very modern and didn't really suit the game. Often times when Gai is expressing frustration, it would be very modern sounding. And there was an instance or two of breaking the fourth wall which I could have done without, but that's just a personal preference as I just don't really care for that in any story. It lowers the immersion and the humor is always very cheap and never seems worth it.

We follow a story of a young boy sold into temple service where he meets a girl named Miyon. A girl with a special 'gift', the titular curse. From that moment onward their interactions become the main focus of this title. After certain time you are presented with a few choices leading to one of four endings.

I sure enjoyed it more than Unhack, a title from the same author. Good emotional trip overall.

The anime art is pretty good, especially considering the fact that this is an OEVN. The number of character sprites is rather limited though. However, there's a good variety of CGs. For the budget price asked it is good value.

Music is quite nice as well. There is good enough variety and themes. Tracks match mood of events nicely too. No complaints on this front from me.

Cursed Sight... is pretty mediocre, sometimes bad. Its turn off your brain kinda stuff. It can occasionally nail an emotional punchline, but those points are drowned out by the much more frequent instances of bad dialogue, SOD breaking scenarios, and tonal inconsistencies. 

The author doesn't seem to understand that emotional story beats aren't something you can just write. They have to be earned. Cursed Sight doesn't manage to earn any of its emotional story beats. As a result, it feels childish and rushed - especially near the end. 

This VN would've been heavily improved by:
1) Better writing. The author struggles by making the young male characters too funny, like the loser protagonist of a rom-com. Its overboard, and doesn't really fit the serious tone of the rest of the story. 
1) Having its length doubled. Really hard to develop or explore the type of themes the author is aiming for with a story of this length. It also would've given more time for character development and introspection. 
2) Smoothing out the pacing with less timeskips. The timeskips and jumps in this story are too grating - the transitions are unsmooth. 
3) More meaningful choices presented better. Each choice you can make in the game is essentially its own ending. Usually the impact of choices builds up over the course of a VN, but the zany changes in what happens at the end based on your choices feels... weird. 
4) Developing the endings better. A lot of the endings take an insane left turn at the last minute, then end on a train wreck, excluding the True Ending which feels forced.

I will refrain from mentioning anything more about the story, because I couldn't hope to give a better delivery than the authors did, so do yourself a favour and read it! The writing style is more or less verbose, but in a good way. The main character has a witty sense of humour which entertains you and keeps the mood in the correct place througout the story. The characters are credible and the main ones are well developed. The art is consistently good as well but remains undisruptive throughout the game.

There are 3 endings, plus a ""true ending"" which is unlocked only after the other 3 endings have been completed. There are only 2 choices in the whole game and I wish I had more control over the protagonist, but that's the only negative thing I could say about this VN.

Even though it features a [skip] function, the VN was designed so that when you complete one ending it opens up a [chapter select] at the menu so you can skip straight into the plot that begins at the branching tree. I liked this concept and hadn't seen it used before in other VN's. It really helped avoid the monotony of skipping through to the branch tree and made it easier to flow back into the story to unlock the other 3 endings.

The scenario is of the young male protagonist, Gai, who is sold by his East Tarian family to the King of West Taria as a servant-boy assigned to West Tarian's [u]treasure[/u] - a 8-10 year old girl named Miyon. 
Gai feels bitter towards his parents for selling him to the King and we see this in his attitude when he first arrives at the Temple but, when he sees the bellstress dancer Sasa, Gai's personality changes as he feels affection for Sasa just as Miyon does.
Much like the premise between East & West Taria, I was conflicted over [i]Cursed Sight[/i] because the starting point to the story has a haphazard writing style.
It focused on a 8-10 year old Male protagonist whose attitude and humour comes across as being arrogant on one hand while caught up in [i]puppy love[/i] in the other hand, and I feel this didn't favour the image of the character profile so early into the story.

Miyon has the 'gift' of [b]cursed sight[/b] allowing her to be able to perform rituals that reveal the future events of a person in visions much like [i]scrying[/i]. 
Miyon also needs to wear a veiled hat because she possesses a fatal curse whereby whoever looks into her eyes dies within a day. This makes her feared (and even despised) by the locals so she is never allowed outside the Temple, this causes Miyon to remain withdrawn and she only shares a friendship with Sasa.

 We see Gai begin to 'crush' on Sasa both for her personality, her kindness towards Miyon (who equally adores Sasa like an older sister) and her ability to calm him when he considers rash decisions. 
It is from this point onward we see the story develop into a blend of war, tragedies, rebellions and revelations. These revelations tell us why the conflict began and we discover the reason behind why Gai's family sold him. 

There is a slow romance to [b]Cursed Sight[/b] that would've vastly improved the story immersion if it were explored on a deeper level but this is where it falls flat sadly. The writing shows Gai in an immature light and doesn't progress his behaviour or personality even after the story jumps 10 years. 
When we consider those 10 years Gai & Miyon spent together it is here the story should've shown a bonding between them but this is only glimpsed at during the Rebellion stage of the story. I feel that the writing had opportunity in that 10 year jump to 'slow burn' the romance which would have benefited the weaker areas of the early plot and help improve reader immersion.

The 4 endings were a good feature as it explored every scenario available giving the reader varying emotional finales. I also enjoyed the writing beyond the branching tree as it seemed to abandon the immaturity of Gai and settled more on the romance even if I personally feel it should've occurred earlier on in the story!

What [u]saves[/u] this from my not recommending it is the overall polish to [i]Cursed sight[/i], the music is effective in its simplicity with piano melodies that soothe you into the scenes and the artwork really catches the eye. [b]Tooaya[/b] and [b]Karla Featherstone[/b] manage to capture the vibrant culture of this Far-Eastern setting with bright colours and gorgeous attention to detail. The loading screens that are displayed between chapters would make stunning Backgrounds and were another refreshing change to help break up the monotony of continuous reading. 

[i]Cursed Sight[/i] features 9 achievements that unlock as progress is made and there are card drops that, thankfully, are consistent rather than spread out. The playtime is anywhere between 3 - 4 hours to fully complete and the only deterrent for some VN lovers may be the price when compared to other VNs that feature in-depth writing or longer content.

What a great Visual Novel! I am getting to be more selective in my choices for VN's and starting to reject the ones that have many, many choices that require an exact set of selections (read: walkthrough) in order to get achievements and/or endings.

Pros (for me):
  o best-written & programmed Visual Novel 
  o most entertaining story
  o decent graphics
  o some interesting visual (& sound?) effects
  o automatic saves at the screen right before a selection has to be made (2 sets of 2 or 3 selections)
  o after the first ending, there is an option to SCENE JUMP to the scene right before a selection
  o endings are relatively short instead of having to replay a lot of previously viewed scenes
  o no need to use a walkthrough to get all achievements; just use all the selections
  o Steam trading cards and achievements

Cons
  o 0 (zero, none, nada... well, maybe another happier ending?)

Working largely single-handedly, this creator has crafted so many interesting, diverse, and [i]human[/i] worlds, in full recognition of the limitations and constraints of the visual novel medium. I'm not ashamed to say that many of these VNs have brought me to tears, and Cursed Sight is among them. In a very short period of time, InvertMouse draws you into novel worlds outside your own experiences in a highly relatable way,  gets you to care about a cast of characters initially presented as flawed and funny, dimensionalizing and fleshing out what might first appear to be two-dimensional caricatures, and then weaves simple, heartwarming, heart-shattering tales with these figures and these worlds in a way that may very well belong in the echelons of classic folklore writers.

This world isn't a fair one. Whatever magic works the lands and chooses these 'cursed children' has no rhyme or reason behind it, nor does it well benefit those who inherit its 'gifts'. Our protagonist shows from the very start how cruel the world can be, so that [i]selling himself into child slavery[/i] seems to be the best of his options. Yet within this mythohistorical construct, it seems not only very real, but also an echo of prior blemishes on the historical record, and we can only witness. When he does try to take his destiny into his hands? Can we say the hope of success outweighs the pains he (and others) must endure? Who gets to live, who gets to die, and which deaths are in the player's hands?

Without spoiling anything, I felt the ending would allow for an return to the world should the dev so desire, and I sincerely hope the game sales might compel them in that direction. There are so many broken lives and so much hurt that not even the group compiled within this game can hope to bring resolution, but I certainly feel that the best of the endings might offer a turning point for another game's bright horizon.",1551648211,1551648211,True,2,0,0.558998763561248779,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ending 3 ends on such a weird note that it literally feels like the writer just stopped writing and called it done in the middle of the story. Ending 2 is incredibly brief and is super heavyhanded, and tries to make us feel bad for a morally obvious decision (WHY??).

The MC is a temple servant who meets a girl with special powers and a cursed sight that will kill anyone if she takes off her veil.

The story progresses in fits and starts and never feels very cohesive or emotional, at one point jumping ten years in a single hand-wave sentence. 

The MC has a miserable personality and despite the old fashioned setting, speaks like any sarcastic, miserable young person on the internet. Some of the side characters are more intersting but never get much deveopment time.

There are muiltiple endings, all of which are pretty bad- both in terms of enjoyment and the fates of the characters. In fact, the writers seem to relish giving bad ending after bad ending as if it makes the game more profound. Even the final ""good ending"" suffers from the no-win-scenario syndrome but at least it feels somewhat conclusive.

- The characters were bland and unconvincing ([spoiler] I mean come on, how can a ten-year-old child be so okay after his parents sold him as a slave? [/spoiler])
- More of a kinetic novel than a visual novel ([spoiler] there are only two scenes where you get to affect the outcome of the story [/spoiler])

All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you get it on a sale or a bundle.

Maybe my hopes were too high after TLB, but really this main character is truly obnoxious. Yes okay, I get that he's been sold as a kid into slavery and that messes you up. But that doesn't talk right all the vomit-inducing low opinions he has about everyone around him BUT NOT HIMSELF. And the times that he goes ""oh I was wrong, I should not think like that anymore"" HE JUST CONTINUES ON, not learning or developing at all. It made me go absolutely bonkers.

Yes not having enough is terrible but having around 60 for only a 2 hour game with 4 endings and about 4 options is just stupid. 2 hour game you say, how do I have 10+ you ask?

[b][u]Positives:[/u][/b]

+[b]Wonderful and charming story.[/b] I cannot stress this enough. It's very touching and will definitely suck you in.
+[b]Likeable characters.[/b] This particular point is divided amongst other players, the argument being that the main character is an arrogant jerk, but I personally think it adds to his character and assists in pushing the story forward. Besides, he's only 10.
+[b]Fantastic art and suitable soundtrack that really set the tone of whichever scene is playing.[/b] The art is really good.
+[b]4 total endings,[/b] with each acccessible via a respective critical choice scene. I really think that being able to select an ending by a single choice really helps drive the story through. Besides, for a VN with great storytelling like this, you'd definitely want to experience all the endings one after another, so the lack of intricate routes and choices does help out here. This brings me to my next point.
+[b]Handy scene jump feature.[/b] After getting an ending, the game allows you to jump to any of the critical choice scenes, further allowing you to experience the endings quicker without having to make multiple save files. Why don't more VNs do this?

[b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b]

-[b]A few typos/weird grammatical choices.[/b] While fast readers probably wouldn't notice these, slower readers will.
-No other negatives!

Overall, definitely get this game, whether you've read VNs before or if you're wanting to try the genre out for the first time.

I kinda enjoyed the read, but don't expect any kind of full blown happy ending.

I bought it on discount so for 2 bucks, it was a good deal.
But.
Objectively speaking, it's bland.
The characters lack depth and I failed to empathize with them.

The setting of the cursed eyes and the powers that come with them isn't exploited. It feels to me like some guy had an idea about a girl with a doom gaze and tried to shoehorn a generic drama into it, because whether the girl has that fatal flaw or not doesn't change the story one bit. The powers themselves are also not important and could have been replaced by any other kind of generic ""priestess power"" without impacting the story (let's be honest, the reason for the war is mentioned briefly in three lines so it doesn't have any impact on the core story that's being told). 
If it doesn't serve the story, don't include it in (panties, giant robots and dandy old men aside, that is). 
There's a timeskip early on and it oh so felt like a narrative shortcut. Due to that, reading the story feel like you have the prologue and the ending and is missing what should be fleshing out the whole thing.

There's not many characters and not many action. It was a short read and it felt like one too. It wasn't boring, but it felt lackluster. I mean, isn't a ""Power to control fate"" auguring of an epic story with lots and meaningful in-game choices/dilemma to make ? But no. Here, it was just part of the background. Imagine a story about time travel, but in the end, it's just about Okabe drunk on Dr.Pepper and talking to aplacas while the banana time traveled and changed its expiry date without anyone noticing.

In the end :
Should you buy it for 2$ ? Yes.
Should you buy it for the full price ? Well, the art and music alone justify the price to support the devs but I personally wouldn't because I'm stingy.",1503450777,1503450777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After completing the game/reading/visual novel last night the one thing i instantly felt was i needed to leave a review on this game, i don't want to do the normal and tell you about the story or write a book review like others have seemed to do, i will not ruin the experince for you, nor will i complain about the length of the game, i played for maybe 7 hours striaght the game was worth its money.

I felt that i would take this moment to thank the dev for such a beautiful game i will also add that i hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel ....

I am a man who is out of his 20s, it's not easy to get me emotional with games or even to show emotion with fictional characters, but this story read like it was non fiction and based on a true story, it knew where to pull at your heart strings it brought you closer to the characters and even nearly reduced me to tears at certain stages reminding me that i am but human afterall, it even picked on a subject that i had thought before.

Obviously there is different endings as i only found out after playing the game, i didn't read the achievements or seek for reviews i went it alone, and was luckily enough to place saves right before the choices took place, of course the first ending i recieved wasn't to my liking although it could have been for some,i played through the other choices but it did not sit right with me, for once i kinda wanted the ""lived happily ever after ending!"" but well this is life and it was somewhat relistic, i will however that the artwork for zeek first made me think that he was a girl that had short hair especially because he was around 10 years old ... he kinda reminded me of ""trouble"" from ""grimm"" or lamorna from scott pillgrim.

I thought i had found a bug in the game when i came across a text box which just had question marks but luckily i saved before it as it was something you unlock later in the game, nearing my bedtime of that ripe time of a 5am i thought i would complete the final ending in a mater of minutes however it seemed that it added another hour and a half to my plathrough so i didn't get bed till 6:30am even though it was pretty much getting up time for some all i could think of in my head was ""wow what a beautifully wrote game i need to review it"" so waking up at 12.30 after having only 6 hours sleep rushed to do just that, thinking i don't want to ruin the experince for anyone although there's plenty of reviews and youtube videos out there that can do that better and some people just watch another and never buy it themselves.

Knowing that my review is just a mere single droplet in a rainstorm i would just like to take the the opertunity once again to thank the story writer and dev for peicing up such a beautiful story, 

I'm sure some people could complete it in a lot less time but i put it on a speed where i could read and asborb the story and had it on auto,

Dieses Visual Novel ist das dritte von [b]InvertMouse[/b], welches ich genossen habe. [b]Cursed Sight[/b] hat mehrere Enden. Wie fast alle Visual Novels sollte man der englischen Sprache mächtig sein.


[b]zum Spiel:[/b]
Ich habe nun knappe 8 Stunden gebraucht dies zu lesen, wobei ich eine kleine Pause gemacht habe. Die Zeichnungen sind gut der Sound ist gut die Story ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Es ist halt eine Geschichte die auf mehreren Wegen enden kann und man ein paar Auswahlmöglichkeiten hat.

Es gibt zusätlich einen Soundtrack und ein Artbook, die man extra kaufen könnte. Dies habe ich selber nicht getan und werde darüber nicht weiter eingehen.


[b]Erungenschaften und Sammelkarten:[/b]
+ man bekommt 6 Sammelkarten (die Recht gut im Preis liegen)
+ Erungenschaften sind fast im null komma nichts auf 100%

Es gibt eine Skip Funktion in der man alles durchskippen kann. Für jemanden der nur Erfolge sammelt ist das ein ziemlicher Pluspunkt. Habe ich zuerst auch so gemacht um den Umfang des Spieles zu sehen um es danach zu lesen.


[b]letzter Punkt:[/b]
Alles in allem ist das wieder eine gute Abwechslung gewesen, allerdings ist es nur seinen Aktionspreis wert. Der Vollpreis ist zuviel und auch die Zusatzinhalte habe ich wegen dem hoohem Preis nicht dazu gekauft. Für Visual Novel Fans könnte es allerdings vielleicht das Geld wert sein, was ich allerdings selber nicht beurteilen kann, da ich diese nicht gekauft habe.

The art is pretty good. It gives personality to all of the characters with rather elaborate yet simplistic designs and wonderful backgrounds.

And it functions as it should. No technical issues.

However, there ARE problems, mostly in regards to the story itself (which is what you rate when you review games like this anyway):

1) The script is hideously anachronistic. I get that it's supposed to be a fictional world and you have magic and such existing in the game, but there are references to things that really shouldn't exist given the technological level present in the story. The author seemed more focused on telling a specific story than dealing with the small details. If references to French Fries in what's implied to be an ancient Asian country (and I mean actually ancient. There's proof in the game that it takes place thousands of years in the past) ruin your suspension of disbelief, it's not for you.

2) It's DEPRESSING. I'm going to come right out and say it that there's no good ending to the game. There's a ""True"" ending, but it's depressing as hell. Of course this isn't by itself a bad thing, as there are plenty of games with depressing plots that are VERY good. But it doesn't STOP being depressing. Seriously it needs a fifth ending. I even have ideas as to where and when in the narrative it should be, but hey not my game so yeah. And that leads into...

3) Really the choices don't feel like they matter. All you're really doing is choosing the best way for the main characters' lives to suck. If they even last that long. I mean I hesitate hinting at this kind of stuff in a review but this is seriously a turn off for some people, and if I met the author I'd chastise them for not fully taking advantage of the medium to give a wider variety of endings, so that the player feels satisfied.

4) The villain is horrible. We don't really get to know him, but we're supposed to feel bad for him. Literally every single piece of misery the characters undergo is entirely his fault. There is ONE part of ONE ending when a bit of misery is NOT his fault, and it feels so forced as to have only been added in to make the main characters' lives, again, suck. He's also a terrible leader, strategist, and tactician, and really should have been assassinated at some point in the story.

But the kicker? He never does. And what happens with him in the True End infuriated me and ALMOST got me to click that ""No"" under ""Do you recommend this game?""

So you're probably wondering why I didn't.

Well...it made me care. I like Miyon. I like Gai. I like Sasa. I like Zoluu. The humor regarding Neek was entertaining (even if it did, anachronistically, involve comics). The characters were complex and multifaceted, with tiny bits of nuance given their limited time (which is a running theme in the story, that people are more complicated than you see on the surface)

I will only recommend this game during sale, it’s not a very long visual novel for its price.

I picked up Cursed sight during the ""anime weekend sale"" wanting to play it since I first saw it. I can’t say I disliked it however, the way the conversations went and descriptions not matching the few visual scenes which bothered me. The artwork is beautiful but it is not matching what is being said, on top of that the West and East temple looks exactly the same just a color change.

Dialogue:  2/10 
Art style:  5/10 
Music:  9/10 - I loved the soundtrack. 
But no voices are a bummer. 


The way Gai speaks and when we read his thoughts are words used in present which sadly ruined the experience. Whoever wrote the dialoged I wish you study how people spoke in old times, yes its fantasy but still. It is hard to get immersed when it is set in old times. Examples: Gai is often sweeping the floor with a broom, yet he mentions a vacuum cleaner later? It had so much potential. 

It was also a bit predictable, well for me at least. No real plot twist or red herring. It’s a story yes, but not with many options to decide your faith. For a small team I will give you credit for making it with a small team though!

I also feel like an ending is lacking with the Taria East king. It could have its own ending making the game a little longer. There´s also another one which could have made the game longer but I won’t spoil. 
I played through all the endings and the True ending.

It's a bite-sized story, as I finished through my initial playthrough in one sitting.

I was immediately interested in this game based on the lovely art and character designs. The soundtrack is very fitting and gorgeous as well, and the characters proved to be as interesting and likable as their designs led on. Without mentioning names, I really enjoyed witnessing the character development throughout the story.

The story itself is a pretty bittersweet take on themes of growing up, war and different forms of love - the overall story definitely isn't something I'd read if I was needing a pick-me-up though. 

There's a little bit of cheesy dialogue in the story, and some of the humor in the second half seemed a tad ... innapropriate for the situation? But both of these things weren't too hard to overlook.

Another visual novel from the creator Invertmouse, this time set in medieval fantasy of two kingdoms, who are struggling for control over the world and the key to solve this is a cursed sight of one priestess named Miyon. Lets see in detail, what went good and what should be better.

GAMEPLAY

+ Nice timing of chapters
+ Animations
+ Multiple endings
- Some cruel moments

Chapters were timed perfectly, story was a bit cliché, but originally processed, what I count as a great plus for this title, due in time, when everything was discovered, original presentation is a key how to achieve a players attention. Also animations were fine, I am glad, that also multiple endings were positive feature, not just self-purpose.

But the moment with rabbit was very cruel and disturbing. I know, this was the purpose, but I think it might be avoided. Just personal opinion. :-D

CHARACTERS

+ Gai
+ Miyon
+ Sasa
+ Queen Hydrianne
o King Lok
- West Tarians

Gai was funny, but also I liked his saracsm, as a kid who was torn from his world and sent to slavery. Miyon was a typical spoiled brat, but when you went under her mask, you saw, what was the true reason behind her behaviours. I liked Sasa from the very start, she was as catalysator of other relationships and a mentor who would everyone desire to have. Positive character was also Queen Hydrianne, I think that is how a leader should behave.

King lok was neutral, I understand his pose, yet, the potential was not fully achieved. But West Tarians had their potentials a bit wasted, especially Gai's sister's companion, who was changing his appearance and poses too quickly and a bit cheaply.

VISUALS

+ Shoujo style

I liked, that this style was chosen, it fitted perfectly for the set-up and story. Nothing to complain here about.

SOUNDTRACK

+ Fitting the stiuation
+ Atmospheric

Efe Tozan did a great work composing those songs, I liked them and some of them I listen to even today. Songs were changing accordingly to the situation and atmosphere. Thumbs up here.

SUMMARY

Cursed sight has a rich story and no superheroes, what allows players to join them and enjoy, what authors presented to us. Even players out of this genre might find this novel interesting, as story is not disturbing, drawings are decent and atmosphere brilliant.

*音乐还成，但是因为偏短再加上我读得慢造成重复度太高会有些厌烦。
*插画CG不多但基本恰到好处，不过有点偷懒就是有一张CG用在了两个不同的情景里。
-全篇充满了男主角Gai的吐槽有不少完全没有必要甚至破坏气氛，曾一度让我厌烦男主角，同时也是阅读的重大障碍来源，个人认为是本作最大的缺点。

本作虽是悲剧但其中不乏温馨属于一个视觉小说佳作。最后感谢这个故事。

This does not make it a bad game, however. It’s actually a great game. It’s a visual novel with only two opportunities to make choices and four endings so most of the time is spent reading. I put the game on auto and read it while eating dinner, it was very relaxing; a digital book with gorgeous artwork.

The [b]story[/b] is about Gai, a young boy from West Taria whose parents have just sold him into slavery to the neighboring kingdom of East Taria. He begins working at the grand temple and soon meets Miyon, the girl with the aforementioned cursed sight. With the ability to predict the future and sometimes change it, Miyon has lived a sheltered life as the kingdom’s treasure and works for the king. You also meet Sasa, a local dancer and friend to Miyon who soon take you under her wing and acts as a surrogate mother to you and the young Miyon. The story advances ten years and war breaks out between the two lands of Taria. What happens next is a series of life-changing events for Gai and Miyon as well as the kingdoms.

Along with this gripping story about life, loss and self discovery is [b]beautifully done artwork[/b] filled with vibrant colors and emotions. Each smile and frown on the characters help drive the story along and pull you even more as the incredibly well written story captivates you. The music in Cursed Sight adds the finishing touch in the immersion as you follow along on the characters’ journeys.

I highly recommend buying [i]Cursed Sight[/i] if you enjoy visual novels. The game may take very sad turns but it’s a testament to [b]how well-written the game is[/b] that it jerks your emotions around and even after finishing the game leave you speechless. I was very moved by this game and believe that you will be as well.

Being a slave isn’t the best career option available, in my personal opinion. Being a slave to a eccentric, somewhat abusive girl who can change fate and can kill you by simply looking at you with her eyes might be an even worse option. That is the predicament Gai, a ten-year-old boy, finds himself in after being sold by his West Tarian family to a temple in East Taria. Gai quickly realizes how bad his situation is when the girl in question is referred to as “The Treasure of the Nation.”

Cursed Sight, from developer InvertMouse opens with a quick introduction to Gai, and the temple in East Taria where he will be serving “The Treasure of the Nation,” named Miyon. Miyon possesses an ability known as the Cursed Sight. It gives her the power to affect the future, at the cost of her energy, which is of great use to King Lok, the king of East Taria. It also causes anyone who makes eye contact with her eyes  to die. For that reason, she must always wear a veil over her eyes, to protect those around her. On top of all of that, she is also about ten years old, the same age as Gai, and extremely stubborn. Needless to say, the two children don’t get along very well, which is problematic for Gai who could very well be executed if he displeases Miyon to the point that it angers the King Lok.

Gai is a treat of a character. At the start of the story, he is only ten years old, and is written as such. He whines, and complains, and gets flustered and embarrassed. Sometimes he acts selfish, and lets his anger get the better of him. Miyon is the same way, and acts as one would expect a ten-year-old girl who is used to only ordering slaves around to act. Now, it wouldn’t be much fun to read about two kids fighting all the time. I could just go visit my younger sisters if I wanted to see that. This is where Sasa plays a huge role. Being older than Gai and Miyon, she acts as a motherly figure to the two, stopping their fighting, making them talk to each other, and just being there for the both of them when times are tough. She is the perfect counter-weight to the two children, and Gai’s crush on her is so childlike, it reminds me of my childhood crushes.

The first half of the VN allow us to get to know the characters very well. The days flow by naturally, with no explicitly stated time progression which allows Cursed Sight to avoid the rapid, sudden character development scenes that plague many VNs (A sudden development to a character that happens in an unrealistic amount of time is what I am referring to. The main example of this is the protagonist and female falling in love over the course of a week in a common route). The story, after building the characters up in a methodical manner, starts moving forward in the second half of the VN. King Lok declares war on West Taria and begins using Miyon’s powers to his benefit. This begins to take a toll on Miyon, tiring her out more easily, and even worse for her well-being and safety, her powers begin declining. Gai, now willingly helping Miyon with Sasa’s encouragement is extremely worried about her, and begins looking for ways to help her.

The story, especially in the second half, is powerful, but still does not ignore the characters, keeping the fun, enjoyable character interaction that I came to love in the first half of the VN. Despite that, things do get pretty heavy later on, and the choices that you must make can be difficult. It is absolutely worth getting every ending though, as care and effort was put into each one. The true ending is phenomenal and easily one of the best endings to any OELVN I have read.

The art of Cursed Sight is very high quality, and professional. The backgrounds are vibrant, and the characters show so much personality through the art. When a character smiles, their happiness shows. It isn’t simply a drawn smile, its a facial expression of happiness (which is even more impressive for Miyon whose face we only ever see half of). What I think I loved even more than that was the aging of the characters. The VN does feature a time skip, and the character portraits age appropriately. Its a fantastic touch, one I’d like to see more VNs with a time skip or long time progression do.

I really only have one area I feel the need to be nit picky on with Cursed Sight. The writing style can be confusing at times, and this is mostly due to the presentation of the writing. Like most VNs Cursed Sight features a text box, but it reads more like a book/novel rather than a VN. The portrait and name of the person speaking do not appear when there is dialogue. Instead, it works like a book, with the quoted dialogue being followed by, “said Miyon” or “she said sadly”. At times, I found myself getting lost trying to figure out who was speaking, though this is more due to my fast reading pace than it not being stated.

Cursed Sight is a fantastic, tightly bound narrative that will pull on the heartstrings more than once. It features fun, enjoyable characters, with great production values, and a wonderful story. It is a bit on the shorter side, clocking in for me at a bit under 2 hours, but it’s very focused on telling its story, and does not add too many fluff scenes just to pad out the length. I highly recommend Cursed Sight for any OELVN fans, and VN fans alike.",1451576881,1451576936,True,2,0,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Now that I've gotten a sampling of a longer VN that's paid for from InvertMouse, I'm sad to say that it's not much better.

So, the good things. Art and music are fantastic, as well as certain choice aspects (providing a branching screen where we can go back to important decisions instead of saving all the time), as well as a switch in narrative at one point in the story.  The concept itself is fascinating, and some of the scenes were great, However, that brings us to...

...the writing. The events that take place were really interesting, but the writing handled them very poorly, with very weak linkages. Characters that we are supposed to feel for suffer from poor development, making it hard to empathize in certain scenes. Motivations that drive key political players (and the overarching war in Taria) get thrown out the window (as well as logic) in several endings of the game, making for a baffiling conclusion to various routes. The writing is at times incredibly bulky, often with really, really bad word choices or phrases that kill any immersion with the story, as well as making me really, really dislike our main character Gai. 

Indeed...out of all the characters in the story, he frustrated me the most. The story is supposed to show that he has grown up, but 90% of the story shows absolutely no indication of that, and when we do see a more mature Gai, it's in one or two endings and is not nearly as smooth and cohesive as I think the writer intended it to be. A lot of things are just thrown into the route to be taken as word, when it would have worked way better had it been shown through development (this goes for all character development and relationship development...don't get me started on the love story).

I think this story really suffers from being short. If the writer had taken time to write more to flesh it out, it would have been stronger and able to stand up on its own. Sure, it would have taken longer to read, but I think, as evidenced by this and Without Within, the writer has difficulty making short stories and would benefit more writing something longer. It just seems he or she has trouble balancing the fine line between condensing the story and still writing believable characters and interactions. It's a shame, because I truly think the concept behind the story is fantastic.",1451129596,1451129596,False,4,1,0.490425258874893188,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- the art is pretty and tasteful though fairly simple.
- The writing is decent although it gets out of the setting character sometimes  (references to chainsaw hands in a medieval China-like country? I almost expected to find the Necronomicon next). The MC feels and talks more like a modern teenager than any peasant servant has any right to.
- Length- ~3 hours. 
- Got it on sale for £2.49, Probably would not pay more for the length so wait for at least 50%.

While it offers an interesting plot and the art itself is beautiful, I'm mainly unsatisfied with how the script is written. Several technical errors were found in the narrative, and the overall tone and language don't fit. In fact, I've come to dislike the main character, Gai, due to the way he is portrayed. 

Other problems:

1. There are areas in the novel that became boring and uninteresting that I've skipped several parts just to get to the end. 
2. The final ending is very confusing and feels out of place. 
3. The shift from Gai's point of view to Miyon's was surprising and unexpected. I think it could be done in ways that blend well with the flow of the story.

Onward to the background, the artstyle is stupendous, seriously, from something that was designed by hand, it really looks like it the artist really enjoyed doing it. The choice of soundtrack was well imported, just due to the case that it feels natural to the scenario in question.
Although this Visual Novel doesn't explore much choices(5 in total), it is still fenomenal, and don't let this turn you down on acquiring it, because believe me, you'll mostly like it, unless you are an heartless hypocrite, joking xD.

《Cursed Sight》是一个典型的泣系视觉小说，没有烦乱的各种女主角，没有乱七八糟的选项，没有做作的表演，没有卖力的配音，只有一段故事留在心中。

整个故事，有着《Narcissus》的淡淡悲伤，也有《Planetarian》的美好与希望。故事从东Taria和西Taria帝国的临战背景展开，主人公出场刚8岁，整个游戏的前半部主要充满着一点点欢快，Miyon和Sasa还有Gai的关系日渐加深。但随着故事的进行，当年的小孩也长大了，平静的日子慢慢消失，他们被卷入因Lok的私欲引发的两国战争，Miyon和Zoluu的Cursed Sight也沦为整个战争的牺牲品。游戏总共只有2次选项，总共有4个结局，前3个让你体会到每个Gai的不同选择导致的悲伤结局，但是最终的结局充满温馨、悲伤和希望，又与前三个结局带有联系，是点睛之笔。

说说游戏的优点：
1. 整个剧情有起有伏，虽然肯定不及key社或者其他大社的作品，但也有自己独特的感动点和细节，对每个角色，尤其是Miyon，Sasa的刻画非常细，绝非赶工品
2. 插画CG做的也不错，关键剧情都有非常有表现里的插画，表现出合适的情感
3. 配乐，虽然游戏中BGM并不多，但大都恰到好处，虽然可能部分重复太多会导致一丝倦怠
4. 多结局设计，虽然在一个视觉小说中引入类似Galgame的多结局设置是否适合值得商榷，但是并不会对游戏剧情连贯性有影响（游戏还贴心设置快速回到选择点），在前3个结局体验后再见到最终结局更能深化一点意义吧

再说说缺点：
1. Gai（男主人公）明显带有欧式风格的吐槽，基本很多独白都是不必要的吐槽，稍微有些干扰剧情
2. 高潮部分、结局刻画可能不够，很多时候很快就略过，让人来不及感动
3. BGM有些短，导致部分场景重复循环，有些倦怠
4. 没有配音……对于视觉小说也许不必要，但是类似《Narcissus》这样女主角配音更容易带入剧情不也更好？
3. 没有中文……不过大部分单词还是简单的，高中水平再配合词典慢慢查也不错，希望之后有汉化组最好


最后，感谢这个故事。

[h1] The Story [/h1]

You are Gai, a young boy at the age of 10, who has been sold to the temple of East Taria by your parents. You work as a servant in the temple, moreso a slave, and have the assignment of tending over a girl generally the same age as Gai, named Miyon, or as the kingdom sees her, the ""Treasure of the Nation,"" for she has a unique ability to control fate, at the cost of her eyesight.

[u] I believe this anything past this would be deemed a spoiler, so I'll end this here. [/u]

[h1] Audio and Visuals [/h1]

Both elements in Cursed Sight are amazing to say the least. The artwork is beautifully drawn, showing every detail on the character's faces, including expression changes. As you progress on through the story, you even have the chance to see chibi versions of some of the characters. The backgrounds, too, were full of detail and nice to look at. The BGM for the novel is also very fitting for each scene. My heart was racing during some scenes just because of the BGM, it's [b] THAT [/b] good.

Overall, this is a visual novel worth buying, I highly recommend this. This story had me invested from beginning to end, I'm sure it'll have you, too. It's a nice change of pace for visual novel fans. Truth be told, it's my first completed visual novel, but I do know what most other visual novels look like and tend to do.

The pacing is a bit awkward near the beginning, but the majority of the game is very well-written. The only ""flaw"" I noticed in the game was that two major plot points are so heavily foreshadowed that genre-savvy readers can tell what will happen long in advance, but this isn't always a bad thing.

Fair warning: there is no unambiguously happy ending to this game. All 4 endings involve bad things happening, and even the ""Final"" ending unlocked from completing the other 3 can be seen as a sad ending.

Another quick thing to note is that while there are elements of romance in this game, it is not a romance-focused visual novel. There are no ""character routes"" that change who the main character is interested in. If being able to choose the protagonist's love interest is what you're looking for, this may not be the right game.

After playing the game and achieving all 4 endings I am still not sure about my feelings towards the game.

The beginning of the novel started out at a nice pace, providing insights into the world that Gai was from and the society he was being thrown into. The narration, background art, and music was all stunning during the first 20 minutes of the game, and had me completely hooked.

Unfortunately once the character Sasa was introduced I felt as though I could slowly tell where the story was going, and some of the major plot points became predictable. Suddenly the music and background art became repetitive, and the narration had turned into something more light hearted, with some sort of slapstick humor occurring every other scene.

By the middle of the game I felt like I was reading something entirely different than what I had originally enjoyed. Miyon, who had been a very interesting character to me from the start, became a hollow tsundere, and Gai seemed to become more immature and annoying despite 8 years passing since the beginning of the game. Each ending felt rushed, and I was disappointed with the ""true ending"" which was only unlocked after viewing the other 3. 

Despite everything I have said I would recommend this game to someone new to visual novels, or trying to get into the genre. It is an easy read, and few choices have to be made during the game. I found the concept of ""cursed sight"" to be enjoyable, but the execution of it was not quite to my tastes. Overall I would give this game a 5/10.

The novel is very kinetic, with there only being two places where you make a choice, and each choice leads to a different ending, so if you would rather a less kinetic novel, this one probably isn't for you. That aside, onto pros and cons.

Pro's
+The character design was pretty good.
+Miyon is a very endearing character, IMO.
+The overall story was good, but I had a few qualms I have with specific scenes.
+The characters are generally likeable.
+The endings, again aside from a minor qualm with a specific scene, are very good.
+It is clean, no echhi at all. This may be a con for you.

Cons
-Gai uses a lot of modern slang, objects, and imagery in his thoughts and dialogue, it can be a bit jarring given the setting and one of the endings highlights how out of place it is.
-Gai will often crack jokes at the worst times possible, this could ruin immersion in a few scenes, the most notable in particular (ENDING SPOILER) when [spoiler] he thinks some wisecrack about a guard, then we see a tortured Miyon begging him to kill her. [/spoiler]
-I found myself disagreeing with how a couple of the endings played out, but that is a minor qualm because my disagreement could be in the minority.
-It is too short for me, taking only about 3 hours to get all the endings. That may not be a con to you.
-It is clean, no echhi at all. This may be a pro for you, as it is for me.

It explores levels of emotion and ties between people that is rarely explored by devs, VN authors or anything at all, the reason for this is that its easy to mess up when going into these sorts of topics, i cant say what they are because they are spoilers.

So Cursed Sight is a bit janky at the start, you may or may not be annoyed as the protagonist starts as a 10 year old, as you can imagine the life of a 10 year old is simple, we dont have much experience and we are a bit immature and indecisive at that age and that is reflected rather well. Pacing issues crop up a lot at the start, mainly for the first thirty minutes while they try and set the foundations down, this is the maining area of improvement id say because its very short, three hours to finish all endings is very short and the longer you know the charecters the more impacting the endings will be.

On the topic of the endings ill say that two are out right stunning, in a good way. Its because the author can string so many emotions into a set of around 500 words and it can be interpreted in so many ways, its the kind of ending that will be left lingering in your head for weeks as you try to fully compile the various effects and outcomes. 

That is where this game indirectly elevates itself from a standard issue VN to a masterpiece, you oddly get many hours out of this because of how much you think about it outside of the game, while its short it somehow becomes longer after its finished.

Many animes and VNs have tried to do something like this, we are talking about stuff like Clannad or From the New World.

On the other parts the artstyle and the general artwork is very good and the interface works as it should. The music fits the scenarios very well but its not too memoriable. 

In the VN market this is 100% a sleeper hit. I look forward to the future works from this dev because they have set the bar very high for themselves now.

A medida que la relación entre nuestros tres protagonistas se vaya haciendo más fuerte, también lo harán los continuos roces entre los reinos del Este y Oeste, los cuales acabarán por desencadenar en una guerra, cuyo detonante principal será la aparición de una chica con el mismo don que Miyon en el reino del Oeste.

De ésta manera la tranquila vida de nuestros personajes dará un giro de 180° que lo cambiará todo.

Cursed Sight es el tercer trabajo comercial del desarrollador InvertMouse, el cual ha conseguido crear un mundo sumamente interesante narrado en su mayor parte por Gai, el cual con un tono sumamente desenfadado y generalmente sarcástico nos guiará hacía una historia divertida, cercana y muy muy emotiva por momentos. 

La duración del título ronda las 5 horas y tendremos un total de 3 finales disponibles en nuestra primera ronda dependiendo de las desiciones que tomemos en [b]2 momentos claves del juego[/b], una vez que los hallamos visto todos tendremos acceso a un cuarto final, el cual será el definitivo.

No dudo ni un instante en recomendar ésta novela gráfica, por que en lo personal es una de las que más he disfrutado en mucho tiempo. La historia es un tanto corta, y en algunas partes ésta avanza muy deprisa, con grandes saltos de tiempo entre un suceso y otro. 
Pero ésta carencia es recompensada con una lectura dinámica y ágil que no se hace aburrida en ningun momento y que atrapa desde principio a fin. 

Si estás realmente interesado no te lo pienses más, y te invito a vivir ésta experiencia, por que es Cursed Sight nos cuenta una historia sumamente cautivadora, un entorno muy envolvente y un pequeño, pero muy difícil de olvidar repertorio de personajes.

Very moving and heartfelt story that will stick with you. Though the pacing can feel a little rushed at times (especially when compared to some of the more draw-out Japanese VN's), it still manages to pack the emotional punch when it matters most.

Story is mostly linear, with a few choice options peppered throughout to provide 4 unique endings. The final ""true"" ending can only be unlocked by completing the first 3, which I highly recommend doing.

There isn't much I can explain about the characters and setting (I really don't want to spoil anything, You need to see that for yourself!) but to give a general idea, this Novel starts off with the Protagonist, Gai arriving as a servant to East Taria, as his Parents from West Taria have sold him off as a Slave to the Temple. He is then assigned the Duty of taking care of the needs of a Girl named Miyon who has the ""Cursed Sight"" This gives her the power to perform rituals that can alter Fate and various scenarios the Regions ruler may desire.

Onto the Technical Side of things

Audio - The soundtrack is very suiting for both the situations and environments it is used in, it is certainly nice to listen to and really helps add to the experience when it gets to more intense story parts. The Audio REALLY complements these well!

Visual - The backgrounds are all pretty and certainly help you imagine the way the area is designed to be. The characters are also wonderfully drawn and to the standard that many VN fans would enjoy, the art takes a very good approach in being pretty and sometimes cute, but also feeling very powerful and succeeds in conveying character emotion when it needs to.

To summarise - This Novel is certainly worth a read in many ways, Your getting a great reading experience with 4 different endings (the true extra ones the best : P). You'd be supporting an awesome Indie Dev who absolutely deserves positive attention. And lastly, it's not that expensive either, your certainly getting Your monies worth! I can say I enjoyed this Novel a lot and will now be proceeding to buy the Digital Artbook and the Original Soundtrack!

And Lastly, Thanks to InvertMouse for this wonderful story : D",1438643482,1438643610,True,13,1,0.573594808578491211,0,True,False,False,False,,,
