Graphics are ok, performance was fine... but this game is just plain not fun.

Its a case where the game has a lot on its side, production value is there, like it feels polished at parts, the theme, the graphics are interesting and have a nice setting, weapon designs are cool and inventive, the audio and voice acting is fine, it has a bunch of different and varied enemies that act a bit differently... 

But somehow the overall implementation when put together, just feels off, weird, not clunky or janky, but... awkward, and boring.  

They try to to be inventive, but it felt cumbersome and awkward to me.

Weapon selection is clunky and even when understanding how it works its hard to do quick swaps depending on the situation. And the weapons use ""steam"" to work, so they have a limited use per time, and each hand shares the steam with all the weapons, so if you deplete it using the hammer and change to the sniper for a quick long shot, you still need for it to recharge.

You get attacked by a horde of 100 mice, and your base weapon a SteamHammer, requires 1 smack per mouse, thats 100 smacks that have to be targeted, and there arent many weapons that could make it easier you know you HAVE to do it.

Recharge is in my opinion way to slow, weapons do upgrade, but progression doesnt feel worth it.

Short ranged weapons feel too short range and i never could get how far they reached, long range weapons are hard to aim and shoot slowly so you cant fix your aim with repeat shots.

Basically weapons are just plain not fun to use. 

Levels while look good, are small and limited, you get sent waves of enemies and you have to destroy them, some times you have objectives like protecting a door, and such, but it really gets repetitive really fast.

Cant recommend this because while it had potential, in the end is more frustrating and repetitive than anything.",1627836929,1627836929,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This should be more fun than it actually is. This is the case where the whole is not more than the sum of the parts. This game has a nice variety of weapons, enemies, & upgrades. It has some nice set pieces. Steampunk robot wacky universe with a cooky narrator and a strange menu system.

Yet somehow, this game falls short of where it should. Part of the problem is that enemies seem kind of dumb. Instead of making enemy AI good, it's just let's throw as many enemies at the player as we can. Your weapon arsenal is pretty slow and can't keep up with the horde. So it's just a matter of running away and trying to eliminate as many as possible, rinse and repeat. Like old school Serious Sam, but not as quick, frantic, or fun.

There is full locomotion and snap turning (with the A or X button on your Touch controller). You can also at times press grip to blast forward. Strangely, there's several areas of the map that you can't travel to, so there are invisible boundaries. Voice commands work great, but you have to memorize them all because you will need to change weapons often. 

I don't know. I wanted to love this game. I just didn't have all that much fun. Buy it on sale. The devs seriously tried, just keep your expecations low. There isn't so much of a story, as just missions to do with this narrator dude who you may enjoy or find annoying. In the end it just felt like a wave shooter where you can move around within a certain area with too many enemy spawns. I think this game could be tweaked to make it more fun, but who knows if that'll ever happen.

Rate 6/10.

https://youtu.be/lWlf0cUp3NE

SteamHammerVR claims that it is ""A truly immersive story adventure..."" and I find that to be borderline false advertising. I don't believe that Wave Shooters would fall under the 'Adventure' genre even if they do have a story.

SteamHammer drops you into the middle of a London intersection about to be overrun by rat-bots with no context or backstory. You're then picked up by a guy in a blimp for equally lacking logical reasons. He then shoves you in a steampunk Ironman suit and sends you out to kill more rat-bots which for some reason want to suddenly attack a single house that you then have to protect. As far as stories go, it's all over the place. 

To be fair though we could poke holes in most RPG stories starting hours so we'll skip that. The delivery of the story I did find rather interesting. The thematic black and white TV with the audio slightly out of sync was amusing and fitting.

The weapons looked interesting at first glance but to the level that I played before I'd had enough, I didn't find them to equally useful. My main weapons were the magents for smashing small bots and the hammers for taking out larger bots. None of the other weapons really felt like they lived up to the other two.

Now. The main complain.

This.
Is.
A.
Wave.
Shooter.

This isn't an adventure game. It's not going to have you traipsing across London as a bad ass steampunk Ironman. Maybe it's just me but that's the impression I got from the social media posts and the Steam page. I very well could have interpreted all of those things incorrectly however I went in with one set of expectations and what I found was nothing more than an average, run of the mill Wave Shooter that just wasn't enjoyable.

There was story. I'd periodically hear dialog while fighting but wasn't really able to follow it very well while fighting. Even playing through the level twice I feel like I missed bits of it and overall I didn't feel like it added much to bending over and swatting at rats.

I can't really quantify fun or say exactly why I didn't find the game enjoyable. Bending over at a 90 degree angle and swatting rat-bots just doesn't do it for me. The larger enemies were equally as unsatisfying to smash into pieces. So...

Ultimately, SteamHammerVR just wasn't fun and for that it gets a thumbs down.",1518994451,1518994451,False,9,0,0.623719096183776855,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Well, what a surprise this game is, set in Victorian London with lots of various maps which you unlock as you clear a level. The enemies are cool and inventive and fit in with the steam clockwork era. Although a room scale wave shooter, it is different in the enemies and kind of suits this Steam Punk theme. 

The visuals are good while not overly taxing and the voice acting and acting are pretty good which is unusual for VR games so far. Musically it's great and the map in the sewers the music is perfect,  there is a room below the main room you start off in where you have a guide and training area for the weapons.

Now the weapons also have voice command which is pretty cool and you can use to combine 2  different weapons (one in each hand) to fight some enemies more effectively. It's  just a matter of remembering which combos good for which enemy.

It's a fun game and at $15 seems reasonable for what you get,  decent amount of levels (11) but the weapons are where this game shines. It's great to go around with a steam hammer in one hand and a Tesla gun in the other.

Maybe one of them, but I haven't got the patience to keep at it.  I'm going to try to be as constructive as possible.  If you're considering a purchase of this game, the things I disliked may have no effect on you and it might be an awesome game for you.  It just wasn't FOR ME.

[h1]Stuff I liked[/h1]
[list]
   [*] The game has a really good Steampunk aesthetic going. 
   [*] The graphics are OK.  Some of the textures seemed a bit dark to me but that could be chalked up to a design choice
   [*] Voice Commands! This is the best thing about this.  You can just say one word and switch to some default loadouts!
   [*] You can combine weapons in several ways so there is some potential for interesting strategies
[/list]

[h1]Stuff I disliked[/h1]
[list]
   [*] The narration/voice in this game is made to sound ""old timey"" which fits in with the steampunk aesthetic, but I found it hard to hear and understand properly. 
   [*] The enemies are all basically rats in the first level (I'm sure this changes) but it felt like I was constantly having to run from them to avoid being overwhelmed
   [*] Run is the wrong word.  I've never felt more restricted in-game movement than this.  You can press the grip buttons to dash to predetermined points in the map and that's it.  I'm not a fan.
   [*] The weapons seem really awesome, but don't really FEEL awesome. There's a tesla coil gun that seems like it should do more but it's pretty weak.  There's a steam hammer weapon that should feel more like you're power-punching enemies but didn't convey the feeling of power at all. On the plus side you can upgrade these weapons though.
[/list]

I think the main thing is that I'm not as big a fan of the Steampunk aesthetic as some might be. If you're into that stuff then this will probably be super cool for you.  To me, it's just a wave shooter with some really interesting but weak weapons and unsatisfying movement methods.

I think maybe the developers could add captions for the speech (which could help with other languages too) and maybe tweak the weapons so that even if they didn't do more damage, maybe they could stall enemies or keep them from swarming you so quickly.   Adding another option for movement would be nice as well.  The S.M.A.R.T. system is really just teleporting to specific nodes on the map, and while it makes sense in terms of the Steampunk world, it doesn't strike me as a fun mechanic.  

If the developers are reading this, sorry that I didn't like your game, and no, I don't really want a free copy.   It's possible that I'm in the minority and everyone else will love it.  It just didn't click with me.

Sorry devs, you're clearly talented guys, the visuals, style and original steampunk weapons are lovely. I played the latest demo for 5 minutes and gameplay just isn't fun. The crawling clockwork rats just aren't interesting, and the weapons lack punch when connecting with the rats. Which is odd as smashing the boxes and barrels is convincing.

So, just played through this full release and it is visually stunning, I just love the attention to detail in every scene, both visual and audio, the story mode is well worth completing...wont say any more as there would be spoilers.

The game play is challenging, there is a small learning curve but totally worth it, you are not equipped with a straight forward 'pow pow' guns as in most games of this type, I think the adding of voice command since Early Access is a total game changer and personally used this a lot rather than fiddle with the controllers.

Having said all that, my favourite mode is Seek and Destroy, this is extremely addictive and frankly the game should be tagged under the category of 'VR Workout' exhausting!!!",1473593740,1502366984,True,6,0,0.466683328151702881,1,False,False,False,False,,,

If London really does come under threat from clockwork creatures, probably best not to call on us!

The game has a great atmosphere and music and background noise has been utilised well, to help maintain the immersive nature of VR gaming. Having the clockwork creatures come at you is alright, at first, but once they really get going, the 360 degree nature of the game, really becomes apparent. They come from everywhere and I found myself twisting round to check behind me, with increasing paranoia, as I became aware of clockwork critters is not yet dealt with. 

The game is harder than you might expect and I am aware this is a tiny proportion of what will be the full game, but it still has enough variables to warrant repeat play, particularly now there is a walk though guide available, showing different techniques for winning.
