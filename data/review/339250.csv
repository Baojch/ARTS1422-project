Winged Sakura: Endless Dream is a roguelite tower defense, with a lot of interesting mechanics, features, replay value and even a cutesy, fun story; however, due to how certain elements are implemented, the positive aspects of the game get overshadowed by the bad aspects. It saddens me, but for this game, in its current state, the cons outweigh the pros, and because of it, I cannot recommend this game.
In this review, I will be summarizing the gameplay, highlighting some of the issues I have with this game, and try to offer some solutions on how these aspects could be improved, so that the game could be better, as I do want this game to succeed and do better. Although, I highly doubt that the game will be receiving a major overhaul, as the game is developed by a single developer, who likely moved onto other projects, since the release of this game…

[h1]Gameplay [/h1]
The main objective of the game is to protect and escort a character named Mimi to the exit. You use your characters abilities and various towers to protect her and try to secure a safe path for her so she can pass through the level and reach the exit. If either Mimi, or your character dies, it is game over. You get 3 tries, but after the 3rd loss, you must reset and start over. 
As a roguelite, each floor is randomly generated, and the layout is different with each level. With every new game all your progress is reset, but the game does feature upgrades and powerups (known as “Sakuras”) which can be upgraded through in-game currency and they retain their levels on subsequent runs. Sakuras offer a ton of gameplay variety, as they can significantly alter the way one plays and approaches a situation. Fun stuff.
The game has 4 playable characters, but there are 3 playable classes (Mage, Archer, Assassin), as one of the characters, Mindy,  is capable of changing in-between these 3 classes at the start of the run. The Mage class is the ranged AOE class, Archer is the ranged burst class and Assassin is the burst, only melee, class. There are also a ton of different interesting towers, which can help you out. 

[h1]Flaws & issues[/h1]

 [u]Enemies[/u] 
Enemies can damage by simply touching you. Certain enemies are programmed to go after the player, but enemies that are targeting your buildings or Mimi, will still damage you, even if they are not going after you. Enemies also spawn and start moving as soon as you unlock a door, and to unlock a door, you have to move your character directly to the door and interact with it. This means that you have to put yourself into a position where enemies will spawn on top of you, and you will likely have to run back to the room where your towers are located, in order to properly defend against the wave. This also means running through large clusters of enemies. Which will damage. Why is there not a countdown of some sort after unlocking a door, so that you can properly reposition yourself, instead of having to suffer unnecessary damage from enemies? By the time you arrive at your desired location, the enemies have already reached Mimi, and she suffered a ton of damage. That, or your towers have already been destroyed by the time you arrive back to them.

[u]Towers are destructible by enemies[/u]
After the 3rd level, you will start encountering enemies which are capable of destroying your towers. This on its own would not be a problem, but taking into consideration how limited your resources are, you really DO NOT want to lose your towers. Once a tower is destroyed, it is gone for good. The resources you spent on it are lost, and now you have a situation where you are much weaker than you were beforehand, and the enemy waves are only getting stronger as you progress. So, to counteract this, you have to protect your towers, on top of being able to protect Mimi (the main objective). The fact that you are forced to both protect Mimi (main objective), your character and, on top of that, the towers, the thing that usually protects you and the objective in most tower defense games, is extremely punishing and frustrating.  If the towers, at least, rebuilt themselves at the end of each wave, the destructibility of the towers would not be a problem, as they would at least sponge off some damage from the enemies.

[u]Grinding & rewards[/u]
Each floor rewards a static 150 petals. To unlock a new powerup (Sakura) it costs you 1000 petals, and you also have to spend more petals on each Sakura if you wish to upgrade their abilities. And the game has over 25 Sakura to unlock... This way of progression seems more fit for a freemium mobile game, than a full price game. The fact that the higher levels give out the same amount of petals, as the beginning levels makes no sense. Higher levels take much longer to complete and are much more challenging. So, if one would want to farm out the Sakuras, the most optimal way of farming them would be to play the first stage of a run, reap the rewards, reset and do it all over again. How fun… By all means, higher stages should absolutely give out bigger rewards than the easier ones.

[u] Character control[/u] 
If your character is not lined up with the enemy, even by a pixel, their attacks will go through and miss the enemy. This is most apparent with the Archer and Mage class, as the rely on their ranged attacks. The Assassin can still miss, but due to being melee, this issue does not hinder their effectiveness as much. Trying to aim with keyboard and mouse is also awkward, as you have to align your characters movement with their attacking. Shooting in a certain direction, does not turn around your character. You have to move your character with the WASD keys first, and then once you properly aligned yourself with the enemy, you can shoot at them. This is tedious and costs valuable seconds. A smooth implementation would be to have the character automatically turn the direction in which you are attacking. 

[u] Gems & Sakura [/u]
I already mentioned the petals, but I also have to mention the gems, which are used to build, upgrade your character and towers, and purchase level ups within the run itself. The game splits the resources into red gems (for building towers), green gems (leveling up your character and purchasing additional Sakura from vendors during the run), blue gems (purchasing tower upgrades) and pink gems (for purifying a room to stop enemies from spawning in that particular room). The only issue I have is with the green gems. Why is character levelling and purchasing of Sakuras tied to the same resource? For building towers and upgrading towers you have 2 different resources, so why is there not a separate type of gem for purchasing Sakuras? Choosing between purchasing a random non-leveled Sakura, or just upgrading your character is pointless, as the benefit of upgrading your character is usually a much safer choice. If a vendor does offer a, upgraded Sakura, then there is a reason to consider between levelling and purchasing an upgrade, but for every other situation, you will just want to level up. If your characters level falls off, you won’t be able to match with the enemy scaling and spawn rates, any you will just statistically lose the game. Why does the game even offer you Sakuras that you haven’t even unlocked as a purchase option during the run? I have not unlocked the Sakura, yet I still can use it. What?

Green gems are also used to heal Mimi. A single heal costs 40 gems… 40 gems is the amount to level your character to (I believe) lvl. 4.  Just why? You also have the ability to heal your character during waves for 3 green gems, but considering the value of these gems, you may as well forget that the heal button exists at all.

The Plot: Um… I am going to assume that it’s something like out of “Dungeon of Endless” because there are some overlaps: Open doors to new rooms, fight off hostiles, put down defenses, and end the floor by escorting your… Pinkhaired Goddess to some central room so you can evac to do it again.

Luckily, you do have some defenses that are upgradable, assuming you can get enough gems to make the upgrade. Resource allocation is definitely a key thing here. And you can buy some help, in the form of companions, but they’re only as passive aides that provide subtle boasts for either you or your defenses. But even at it’s “easiest”, don’t expect to make a milk run out of it. 

“You better get ready to [u]RUN”[/u] 

So far, I am only on the forth floor and even with some lvl up in both character and defenses, my progress can best be described as: 

[*]Open the room: You’re gonna die!
[*]Fall back to defensive position: You’re going to die! 
[*]Rush into room: You’re gonna die! 
[*]Let one hostile slip into the same room with the Pinkhaired Goddess: You’re gonna die!

It can be quite fun and addicting if you are a fan of roguelite games, but there are a few key things you should consider before buying it.

Your goal is to get through the Endless Dream by escorting your partner Mimi to the end of each of 10 levels. You do this by opening doors in a randomly-generated dungeon layout, building towers as needed to help you defeat the onslaught of enemies with every door you open, contracting Sakuras (which provide passive bonuses to your character) for that run, as well as new towers and boosters with Polygons, the game's currency. Between your runs and through story scenes you earn Unsealing Petals which are used to buy new Sakuras to appear in future runs, which can be leveled up. The map layout, and by extention the exit, is hidden until you start unlocking doors, so for each floor you start off blind. Once you're ready to escape the floor, you need to guide Mimi and not allow her or yourself to be defeated by the enemies. Hopefully you used those Pink Polygons to clear a safe path for her, as those are limited, so you must plan ahead as you go through each floor.

There are three combat styles to use, many unlockable Sakuras to choose from, and many different kinds of towers. All these mean that [b]there is a lot to learn and there are many different strategies you can try.[/b] This however is where the game's more frustrating side comes into play: As per roguelite standards, this game starts you off very weak to the point that enemies take many hits to kill, and your inventory is bare-bones. If luck is not on your side on later floors, you may not find the rooms which hold the shops or power-ups you need, you may choose a door that leads to a dead end from a fork at the start, which would waste precious resources, and so on. Enemies that target only Mimi or only your towers come very early as well and make things hard, as protecting your towers takes effort and you can easily be overwhelmed by too many enemies if you are unprepared. Frequent failures is the way roguelikes work for replayability's sake, but this one is even tougher than most of the others I have played yet. While you can retry up to three times per run and save checkpoints if you need to, expect to lose a lot if you want to get better at this game. [b]Patience and an open mind are required here, and even some grinding if you want to unlock more Sakuras and achievements.[/b]

However, if you enjoy roguelites you probably have a fair degree of patience, so I would say [i]Endless Dream[/i] is worth a try if you are such a fan. It probably won't be a piece of cake for you, though; more like a piece of cake that's been left out of the fridge for too long. Don't let the looks fool you - this game will punish you for screwing up.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Very challenging gameplay with three difficulty settings for most modes

- Multiple gameplay styles and lots of ways to customize your strategy

- Presentation is decent and art style is great - the characters are cute and colorful, and the sounds are decent

- Can be addicting if you start grasping the mechanics

- Your runs can be quicksaved, so no need to play the lengthy levels all in one go

- Quite a lot of achievements

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Game starts on a steep slope and that slope only gets steeper with every floor. Doing some tutorials and learning from your mistakes is a must. Precision is required when attacking or else your attacks will be off by a couple of pixels.

- The multiple gameplay elements are fairly balanced but the tower defense element takes a backseat to the roguelite combat. You can only build towers in designated spots and they may not work to your expectations. This is not a true tower defense game.

- The game can lag in some places that use more demanding effects

- Re-mapping the controls can be tricky since the menu does not blank out the key you wish to remap before making a choice

- More than anything else, the game requires a great deal of time and patience which can scare off people looking for an easier game to pick up and play. This is not a fast-paced game.",1532309200,1533175102,True,7,0,0.609530746936798096,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Endless Dream is an odd game. It's a mix of roguelike with tower defense game, and packed with cute (and funny) story bits with anime-looking characters. At first, it plays like a more clunky Binding of Isaac, but won't take you long to notice the differences. This game is NOT about the action, but creative thinking! And it's not just about surviving, you also have to protect Mimi, a (at first) stationary character that sits in the first room. To do this, you can built towers that shoot enemies, towers that heel you, etc. But the resources to build them are scarce, and knowing where and how to build them is VERY important, specially in the escort mission at the end of the level.

Yes, escort mission, and that's another difference from similar games. You have to to to each room, kill enemies, install towers and un-curse rooms, but do all that to reach the final objective in each level: escort Mimi transporter room. The game is not evil though: you can start the escort mission whenever you want (and have found the transporter room), so feel free to prepare the way with towers and stuff. I mentioned ""un-curse rooms"" before, and that's a very important thing to notice: cursed rooms WILL produce enemies whenever you open a new door OR when you start you escort mission. So it's IMPERATIVE that you un-curse them. But you will NOT have enough resources to un-curse every room, so knowing which room to un-curse is part of the strategy.

The game is way more complex than it looks, BTW:  a good strategy is REQUIRED to succeed, even at low levels. The action is not very important: knowing where to install towers and what rooms to open (and un-curse) is the core of the game. It's like a game of chess: you CAN play if you just know how to move the pieces, but don't expect to win if you don't use your brain.

Lastly, the game is packed with random events (and they are usually dialogues between the cute main characters. And are usually funny!) and tutorial classes, but the best thing is that you don't HAVE to see them. After the first few introductory events, the ""New Game"" option is enabled, and you don't have to worry about tutorials and story events, if you don't feel like it. They start in a separate screen, so you just look at them IF you feel like it.

There are LOTS of options before starting the game, BTW. From multiple characters to multiple classes (and one of the characters can be any class), multiple difficulty and parameters, and even multiple supporting passive skills (in form of some fairy-like thingies. And they are cute!).

The graphics are simplistic and kinda repetitive, but the character sprites are very cute and well animated, and the characters' faces in the dialogues are very well drawn and full of funny expressions. And while the action of the game is indeed a bit cluncky, it's like I said before: the action is NOT the focus of the game.


tl;dr:
This game is not perfect, but it surely is WAY better than I was anticipating it. I'm addicted to it, and HIGHLY recommend it if you feel like playing a tower-defense-rogue-lite game with anime characters, optional story segments and a deep and VERY challenging gameplay.",1508494738,1566914744,True,6,0,0.537095367908477783,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Plus, reviews help games like this get more attention (something Steam's storefront fails to do, every time).   And I think this one deserves it.

The game I refer to, that inspires this one, is Dungeon of the Endless, an absolute favorite of mine.  Like that game, this combines a couple of genres, tower defense, and roguelike.  Also like DotE, it is both turn-based and real-time, at the same time.  On top of this goes a layer of RPG-style character stats and similar things, adding more complexity to an already complicated game.

Chances are, going into this one for the first time, you're likely to be a bit confused.  Few other games work quite like this one... actually, only one works like this one, which again is DotE.  The game uses tower defense concepts as the core of the gameplay, but unlike most TD games, a battle is not just constant waves while you struggle to keep up.  Instead, there are two phases:  Preparation, and combat.   The preparation phase is when there are no enemies present.  You are free to move from room to room, construct towers, and interact with various NPCs to do different things such as buy items or research new towers.  When you feel that you're ready, you go and open a door, revealing a new room.  Opening a door effectively means the beginning of the next ""turn"", and advances a number of things.  For example, this is when your resource production happens, and when tower research also goes forward.  But more importantly, it begins the combat phase.  Enemies spawn in every room that is still cursed, and make their way towards Mimi, who serves as the ""core"" that you must protect.  Your towers will do their best to destroy these monsters, but they cant do it alone.  You have to join the fray yourself, adding a very active element to a genre that often consists mostly of waiting.

Unlike DotE, you do not have a full team of characters to manage here.  Instead, you have just your one character who you play as (though there are multiple characters to choose from when you start a new game).  You have various attacks and skills/spells with which to attack the marauding robot monsters, doing everything you can to prevent them from winning.  If Mimi goes down, or if you yourself are defeated, that's it, the run is over.  Like any roguelike/lite/whatever, this uses permadeath, so loss means starting over from the beginning.   Combat is often difficult, as your enemies are outright overwhelming much of the time, and they vary in their functions.  Some enemies will make a beeline for the room that Mimi is in.  Others will hound you endlessly, trying to crush you.  And some will even target your various towers and other gizmos, trying to wreck them.  This means alot of chaos, and it will really test the strategy you have been setting up.  All that preparation you do before each combat phase is very important, and involves alot of careful decision making.

Add to this the random nature of roguelikes.  For example, when you go to research new towers, generators, or whatever, you do not know just which ones will be available (another idea carried from DotE).  When buying items, you never know what the shop will have.  And then there's the Sakuras, a variety of girls with crazy powers who can be contracted to help you; they dont make direct appearances in combat, but you can assign them to be either supporters or operators, to go along with whatever tactics you are using.  Like anything else though, you do not know which Sakuras you will encounter in the dungeon.  Victory in this game is all about taking what the RNG gives you, and finding a way to make it fit.  In my experience, there is always a way to make it work, even though it will seem tremendously difficult.  You're going to have to really use your head to get through this one.

Which brings up the one problem I think it has:  the learning curve.  Chances are, when you start up a run, you are going to be annihilated by robot bees.  You're not going to be quite sure how you could possibly deal with such opposition.  I've heard of players not even being able to pass the first floor (of many).  I recall that DotE had this exact problem, which I call ""deceptive difficulty"".  The learning curve creates the perception that the game is harder than it truly is, because you will find yourself struggling to figure out how you can possibly deal with everything.  You may start to think that things are imbalanced or even broken, or unfair, or... whatever.  Again, same exact problem DotE had.  But once you truly learn the game, you find that seemingly unfair situations actually arent.  You find ways in which you can alter your tactics, new things you can try, new approaches to different situations.  As your understanding increases, so will your progress.  But reaching that point is difficult, and I suspect this will push away many players. Tower defense games can be more than a bit obtuse when it comes to the sorts of ways you can strategize in them, and not only is this no exception, but it takes it a few steps further.

Which is a shame, because like DotE, the game really is lots of fun.  Tons of depth and challenge to be had here.  And there's more that I havent gone into, for example the shop that allows you to unlock more Sakuras between runs (and power them up a bit).  Or the fact that there are actual story sequences, something which DotE didnt really bother with.   The story has issues, but the dialogue and characters are entertaining and the art is well done.  Even when you're dying horribly in each run, new bits of story and such will still open up to you.

But it's the gameplay that really makes this one what it is.  And I'm glad that it exists.  I absolutely adored DotE, and wished there could be more games like it, but nope, there really wasnt.  Until this comes along.  Many similarities, yet still this one does enough to make it stand out as it's own unique thing.  The learning curve is absolutely brutal, and the difficulty only increases the further you get into each dungeon, so expect many losses before you start to get anywhere.  This is not a game for those who are easily discouraged.  But if you can persist with it, you'll find something really nice here that will offer many hours of challenge and fun.",1508165516,1508165516,True,23,0,0.680957913398742676,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Об игре:
Она очень сложная и есть некоторые у меня к ней замечания:

1. Игра не Rogue-lite (хоть и заявленно что рогалик) - нечего из предедушей игры в новую не переносится (лвл персонажа, уровень строений, вещи) кроме ""Сакура-поинтов"" которые начисляются за каждый пройденный этап игры и расходуются в специальном вне игровом магазине (уже по завершению игры) где вы можете купить нового оператора (взять в новую игру вы можете только одного оператора) или улучшить уже имеющегося (достаточно незначительные).

2. Игра не является RPG - в нормальном смысле этого слова. В игре вы можете улучшить своего персонажа только тем, что вам предложить в местном игровом магазине (у NPC которых вы можете рандомно встретить на карте).

3. Менеджмент ресурсов - ресурсы добываются только при открытии комнаты или при нахождении кристаллов ресурса, а ""розовая"" эссенция только в кристаллах. И если у вас не было достаточно ресурсов на ""очистить"" комнату, то следующая дверь может лишь усугубить ваше положение.

4. Рандом - комната телепорта может появится как за следующей дверью (что сбережет вам ресурсы), так и через цепочку комнат с 2-я дверьми (что уничтожит ваши ресурсы в попытках ""очистить"" и оборудовать минимальный коридор безопасности для МиМи)

5. Ресурсы переносятся с этапа на этап в полном объёме, не каких бонусных ресурсов за окончание этапа вы не получаете.

6. Цена на сооружения - до 3-го этапа все нормально, после 3-го появляются роботы способные с легкостью уничтожать ваши сооружения, что при всех выше перечисленных особенностях игры усложняет ее в разы. Персонаж которым вы играете на 3-м уровне становиться малоэффективным в борьбе с противником.

ПС: Лично я, пока, не смог на уровне ""Normal"" пройти 4-й этап игры.

Я все-таки хотел видеть в игре Rogue-lite составляющею - пусть персонаж хоть как-то улучшается от игры к игре.",1508100492,1508105725,True,6,0,0.536162495613098145,0,True,False,False,False,,,

No, the rogue lite part of the game means that in the unlikely case where you'd be able to complete a level you'll be awared some currency. In two hours I was able to to finish a single level that rewarded me 30 of that currency. I did the maths: If I play 8 hours per day I should reach 100% in a 15 months.
Seriously? There are a no micro-transaction so why as a developper would you do that?!

But the game isn't only a rogue lite it's also an RPG... it has to be right? When you level up or during a random event [insert a random combination of letters that the game never told you anything about] increased by [insert random number here]. Well, when I read ""Random Generated Levels"" that wasn't what I expected.

But maybe it's me, maybe I should have played the tutorial? In fact, I did:
""If you press the attack button you'll attack"" was the first one.
""When you find the exit escort Mimi"" was the second one (but sadly it didn't told me that it would turn the whole level even doors that were still closed into berserk mode). 
""If you press the health potion button you'll heal yourself"" was the third.
""If you press the mana potion button you'll restore you mana"" was also part of the third.
""If you press the special attack button you'll use you special attack"" was the fourth, the fifth and the sixth.
Six tutorials, five of them useless, one lacking to deliver vital informations.
Basic gameplay hints? No. Strategy to survive at the very beginning of the game? Neither. Anything useful? You decide.


So yeah maybe it features an awesome scenario that I'll never know about because the game is simply not fun but according to another review it's basically the same one that in the first game (which was ""You won't learn anything but everything will be explained later"").

  The game is really addictive and fun. It feels simple at first, but in fact its REALLY deep. Its like chess, its very easy to learn how to play but its difficult to master. Also there is a luck factor involved, so you got to adjust to the situation even though it may not fit your playing style.

 All in this game feels just about right, natural. I believe that I live in this world. Again its like on a chess board. There is nothing to add and nothing to take away. Those are just my feelings to describe how i like the game. 

 The gameplay is really satisfying. It never feels like a grind though there is some grind here. You start each run at level 1 so it always feels like a new fresh game (again its like chess). This concept is what makes roguelike games a hit. (Desktop Dungeons and DotE 2 of best games of the genre use this conceps and i feel like this game might become the third 1).

 It never feels boring to play because there are TONS of unlocks ... 30 sakuras with unique story each? Stories are short yes BUT its not a visual novel, yet it gives the game a lot of charm. Also you level up those sakuras which is very nice too. CGs are very stylish too. 

 are there any cons? well .. i cant really get used to controls ... i remapped keys to use r and f as abilities butt still fells like i am too slow to use them. But if the game is beatable with those controls its ok. I wil get used to them. 

 Animation in this game is very cool ... it feels satisfying when those bugs die .. and robots too ... laser pistols, arrows, explosion ... awesome.

 Protagonist is very well made. Its a cute girl with nice hair animation .. BUT actuaaly you can play as 4 different girls and 3 classes!! Actually if it only have 1 protagonist and archer class it would have been ok .. but we have 4 of them!!! 

 But the most excitng thing about the game is sakuras you unlock .. at first those buffs seems unimportant .. but once you understand that +2 attack really matters you feel the awesomeness of the game. Also those sakuras are not just random girls. The first girl i unlock is a sniper ... (tho story told me that) and guess what? it gives chance to score increased damage on hits ... and now you understand that you run will depend on sakuras you meet in dungeon. They will greatly change the style you play .. and i havent yed mentioned elements. Trust me its DEEEP ... 

 also .. when i levelled up i didnt believe my eyes ... there were like a hundred slots that can randomly .. level ? depending on the finds in a dungeon? or just random level up? YES finally hardcore ! thats so exciting too ... 

also you get buffs .. random .. like you get +2 attack .. feels standard ? NO its not .. because the buff also applies to towers .. DAMN and it matters now!!!! 

also you start with the basic laser pistol tower (which is very nice btw), and you got to unlock others .. and .. you also level all of them up .. its not easy .. also when i levelled my laser pistol to level 4 or smth it changed to the beautiful red tower which killed bugs in a very cool way ... 

 and here goes another concept ... RESOURCE management .. its easy to spend all resourses in the beginning and easily kill all bugs on firs and second floor .... then .. then .. you gon no resourses to build towers? and those bugs eat you ... :( 

there is so much stuff in the game ... but my point as that all that stuff was added with a real care about the game .. very few developers do games this way ... 

i know there might be some balance issues and other issues but the geme is a rare gem .. you seldom find those games this day ...
