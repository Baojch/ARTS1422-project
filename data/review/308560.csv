Text based games were going out and the genre became the true hardcore games, leave behind tetris and those boring puzzles, here you could control a real character!! Eventually two schools existed, Sierra (creators of the genre with Mystery House) and Lucas Arts (the student that overcame the master), Sierra was text heavy and allowed for a more free approach till were they became famous as ""those games you could die from doing anything"", Lucas was more flashy and direct but accounted for it with glorious IP.

Eventually Lucas raised, with founding from George Lucas and the involvement of people like Stephen Spielberg they starting experimenting more, improved graphics and simplifying the genre to appeal to a wider audience. Sierra was consider to have stayed stale and out of touch with newer generations of gamers, but it provide a template for comedy adventures that Lucas would take inspiration from and the ""Quest"" series would stay historically as a very important step on the evolution of gaming, they were after all the firsts and even though Lucas became more ""mainstream"" you could see on early Lucas works they were pretty much copying Sierra´s formula (LOOM would be a perfect example). 

City Quest has no affiliation with the other ""Quest"" series beyond being a love letter. And what a love letter. The style of Sierra games is on full display, from the graphics to the absurb humor and even obviously the many many ways of dying. It´s not the only thing City Quest provides though, the full display of modern indie titles is here too like achievements, multiple endings, a semi open world... stuff that you couldn´t have on old sierra games and that are a niece addition. THis is a great title for nostalgic gamers, adventure humor fans in general and overall anyone who enjoys playing something to get a kick out of it. For the small price it has, City Quest is an absolute blast capable of providing far more time you would imagine with full fleshed out storylines and sidequests that provide a total of 8 different endings, each one more crazy than the other.

I saw this pop up on Steam, thought it looked quirky and interesting and decided to wait for a sale and when it happened I snapped it up. The only regret I have is in waiting so long, this game is worth it at full price.

This game may not be for everyone as it makes you think out of the box, I understand that the box these days is ""Here is a gun, go shoot things"" but I'm talking about in adventure game terms.

Sure, there's quests to do which are pretty straight forward involving helping the homeless, pimp business and corrupt politicians. Your standard adventure game staples you might think. But you're some white dude with blonde hair who definitely has a disorder of some sort who can be talked into trying to disguise themselve as a Yakuza to aid the mafia.

If that paragraph didn't really make sense then the rest of the game will make less sense. If it did make sense to you then you're probably the protagonist of the game.

I may edit this after a few playthrough's, but somehow I think leaving this game in people's minds with a little morbid curiosity might fare better. If you've seen it and read about it and/or put it on your wishlist just do it. It's one of those games that you think you'll fire up for a few minutes to see what it's like, think ""everything is fairly standard and boring, nothings really happening. That's the first bit over, what's the fuss? I'll play a bit more and... what? Wait! What? Seriously? Is this?... Yes it is happening"" and will just continue on.

If you want an adventure game that really makes use of you interacting with it for Steam achievements then this is for you.

If you want an adventure game that makes you try to find inventive ways for you to be killed then this is for you.

If you want an adventure game that tries to make you find ways to steal babies and then eat them then this is definitely for you, and you should probably seek help.

A Gameplay & Review video showcasing the features I'm about to talk about:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG4GjzcM-es
This game is reminiscent of older point and clicks like King's Quest, except it focuses more on humor.
You can interact with almost everything in multiple different ways.
There's a look, use, lick/eat/talk action. All of them come up with unique and well written dialogue for any character or object you click on.

You will die a lot in this game, it comes with the curious nature of your disconnected stupid hillbilly brain. Because you interact with so many different things in dangerous ways. E.g: Walking into a plane turbine, going up to a carnivorous plant or standing next to a nude man with a huge dong (Don't ask how that one kills you. Watch the video)

The music is really catchy, and accompanies your journey and mini-games (that once unlocked, you can replay) very well.

Here's one of my highlights: I searched a vending machine. I found an abandoned baby. I got an achievement for it. I put the baby back, and got an achievement for re-abandoning an abandoned baby. I then took it back out, and ate it.
