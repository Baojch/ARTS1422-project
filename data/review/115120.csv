 Iron Brigade still holds up well against modern day games, the graphics speak indie dev as it had back in the day when super meat boy held the title of best indie game. If you have a total of four players ready to grind at destroying tubes then your success at completing the game is much higher, although coordination and communication on how you set your trench up is most important. As players get into the late game, it becomes even more important to successfully plan your set up, the kind of trench you'll use, the cost of placements, the time you'll be able to place them, and the health of the team, all of it plays a part to yours and your teams success.

Це не тільки PvE на мехах, але й захист вежами. Що дає доволі цікавий досвід.
Є унікальні боси та приємні локації (враховувати що це старий проєкт і відповідна графіка).

Ви будете керувати своїм власним мехом з можливістю поставити на нього різне озброєння (кулемети, дробовики, артилерія, щось схоже на вогнемет [strike] але це не він [/strike], лазери, снайперські гвинтівки) та турелі (які теж бувають різноманітними).
Сюжет і фінальний бос залишає приємні емоції.

I have completed this game 12 times, 9 times on Xbox and 3 on PC. I rarely give 9.5s (because no game is perfect at least in my opinion), BUT if you like loot, mechs, flashy explosions, and light Tower Defense elements then I think this is the game for you! You can play solo or with up to 4 friends, I recommend either one, playing a game with friends is always more fun, BUT I had a blast playing solo.

My score: 9.5/10

Summary: 
This is a 3rd person Mech ""Arena"" tower defense mission based game. What I mean is you progress through a linear set of missions completing each one to progress to the next. In each mission you'll be defending a ""Base"" from enemies, to do this you can spawn ""Emplacements"" which are turrets that will help you shoot them down or you can shoot them down yourself with your Mechs weapons. Each Mech Chassis can equip diffrent amounts of Weapons and ""Emplacements"", it's up to you on how you want to load your Mech out. Loot will drop from each mission so it's worth completing a mission multiple times to either get more loot or better loot by completing the mission with a better score.

Pros:
>9/10 Mech customization (Not exactly ""Deep"", but in my opinion just right)
>9/10 Weapon variety (Always fun to find a crazy new weapon that does something new)
>8/10 Total Missions
>8/10 Mission Modes (Base Defending / Boss Fights / Moving Bases / Survival)
>8/10 Story (For what this game is. Funny and I enjoyed it.)
>7/10 Enemy variety (Wish there were just a little more, but there are a lot)
>10/10 No micro-transactions 
>9/10 Fun! 

Cons:
>To restart a play through you have to delete your save data and remove cloud back up for this game. (Quite annoying, but worth it if you want to play through the game again from a blank slate)
>Expect to run around the map quite a bit to place ""Emplacements"" down and Upgrade them; however if you focus your Mech on Guns instead of the ""Emplacements"" you won't be running around as much and you can focus on shooting the enemies instead. (I have completed this game as a full Weapon focused Mech and ""Emplacement"" focused Mech)
>Mech movement feels a bit clunky at first. (I know this is a common problem some people have with the game, but it didn't really effect me as much and I got used to it pretty fast.)
>Post Campaign is mainly just getting Gold on every mission and surviving all levels on survival, but I enjoyed it overall, just wish there was more to play.

Notes:
Overall Iron Brigade has a special place in my heart back on the Xbox 360 and replaying it on my PC. It was fun in 2012 and it's still fun today and there isn't another game I can point to to say ""That's a better Iron Brigade"". All that being said Armored Core VI looks great and I can't wait to play it; however Iron Brigade still fills its own niche. I played the majority of the game solo, but I did also play with a couple of randoms and friends on different play throughs.

So I played it originally on Xbox360 (+200-hrs from that device -- it's from that era with its advantages and flaws; and by today's PCs it runs on everything; even a potato ;-).  This is a wonderful, quirky, unique adaptation of revisionist WWII in an alternate universe.  Simple, yes.  Limited tower choices, yes.  But remember it is:  1st = FPS and 2nd = Tower Defense (although there is a light trench (mech) which is the opposite).  I have had a blast with my family (adults) playing this back in 2013-2016 and again with my kids 2017-2020 (shooting ""tubes"" is much nicer than other games for younger kids).  The game is easy to pickup and learn for kids (limited choices) but there are just enough different weapons, gear, towers, and play styles to have decent variety.  The end-game Survival (100-rounds) is just difficult enough you might need to do a few special mission runs to get a good meta-weapon / trench / tower and fully customize yourself to beat it with 4-players.

I will always fondly remember good times with this one and highly recommend it to anyone for some quirky, light fun.  My kids and I would often quote some of the lines from this game, even years later.  ""The tanks in Poland can take twice as much damage.  No complaints!""

[td]
• Enjoyable progression, with tons of unique parts to craft a custom mech suited to your preferred playstyle.

• Combat is fast-paced, enjoyable and, at times, chaotic. The enemy variety is enough to not get stale.

• The quirky, over-the-top humor and tropes are well-done, not cringe, and quite entertaining.
[/td]
[td]
• Tremendously outdated visuals, even for a 2012 release. It looks and feels like an early PS2 title.

• Boss fights are underwhelming, way too easy and forgiving - much more so than normal levels.

• Huge quality-of-life issues: inability to sell towers, absence of enemy path indicators, no map, and many more.

• Balance issues with weapons and towers; you won’t use many of them, as they either suck or are worse versions of something else.

• No pause whatsoever at any point between waves, and you can’t see in advance what’s coming next in them.

[td]It took me, alongside my partner, about 8 hours to complete the campaign, getting Gold rating on most maps as well in the process.

[td]Not really. The price of 15€ isn’t bad for this content amount, especially for completionists, however there simply are many other, better alternatives in the same price range, to play in co-op. Sanctum 2, Orcs Must Die 2-3, Fortified, Hypercharge, Deathtrap… to name some.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Writing & Worldbuilding[/h3]
In-between the (at the time of writing) two World Wars, Iron Brigade takes a detour from reality and has an alien invasion come up unexpectedly. An unknown transmission dubbed “The Broadcast '' starts spawning nightmarish, CRT-themed creatures named Tubes, that quickly manage to overrun most militaries and lay waste to the planet, guided by their very human mastermind, Dr. Farnsworth. As part of the Mobile Trench Brigade, you’ll pilot the namesake mobile mechs against the Tube forces across all continents. 

The world depicted here is bleak, crumbling and polluted - as it should be after a conflict of this scale. The environments of each stage are decently-made, however there are no memorable landmarks or epic backgrounds to reinforce the world-building’s theme. Save for structures strictly there for gameplay purposes or level design, there won’t be much else to sight-see or notice. There’s also no environmental interaction or dynamicity in any of the proposed scenarios - all of it feels too stale and too still. Writing-wise, the over-the-top, quirky, humorous tone works pretty well, and somehow manages to maintain a shred of seriousness despite all the over-emphasized dialogues and one-liners. It’s enjoyable for what it is.

[h3]Customization & Progression System[/h3]
Your mobile base will be a large military ship that will serve as a central hub to invite other players, matchmake (good luck with that one), customize your Trench and Soldier both cosmetically and equipment-wise, trade stuff at the shop and of course, select missions. Building your own custom mech is fun; at each level up, and from loot boxes dropped by some enemies (don’t worry, they’re free!) you’ll gain and unlock new chassis styles, guns, turret types and cosmetics to create a veritable fighting machine. 

Each hull type has a different amount of Weapon and Emplacement (buildable turrets) slots, so that you may choose between a more combat-oriented or “builder” play-style - and then customize it further as you like. It’s not long to level-up, but with the cap being 20, you’ll barely reach 10 at the best of times by the end of the campaign - you’ll have to grind Survival and the DLC for more, which isn’t optimal progression design-wise.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3014517492

[h3]Building & Defending[/h3]
There won’t be any preparation phase or time to see the map’s layout and strategize: enemies, in each level, will start pouring from various spawn points just a few moments after starting out. Building turrets is quick and relatively cheap in most cases, but alas they can also be destroyed swiftly by dedicated enemies that will target them. All of this is quite annoying, as it doesn’t give the strategic aspect needed for a tower defense to work, and instead rushes players without any time to think of a strategy: we had to replay several levels because of this reason. 

The fact no enemy path-finding lines, a core feature in tower defense, are ever shown, or that you can’t anticipate waves if you wish to do so (for an extra reward), and that you can’t even sell or repair towers are all screw-ups that make the experience much more frustrating.

Your main goal will be defending one or more critical structures, or in Boss levels, defeating a particularly tough monster. You’ll be able to build defenses mostly anywhere, but sometimes they may land in a weird way and not shoot correctly, or clip into structures. The thing is, also, that you won’t really be using most defense types except machine guns or flaks, because they do everything, do it well, and your Trench takes care of the rest. Yes, 75%of the entire tower roster is either too expensive to be worth it, redundant or useless - same for weapons, you’ll really only be using sniper rifles and machine guns - we got Gold on most levels just doing that.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Most enemies will just want to destroy your base, however some will either target exclusively players, and your death really means being out of commission for the level, or your towers. Specialized gear like Flak vs. Air foes are a plus, but hardly mandatory. You’ll want to equip your Trench with diverse weapons to deal with different threats not already accounted for by your towers: for instance, you’ll build a lot of machine guns or flaks, and then deal with heavy foes yourself. 

Mini-bosses also appear from time to time, but don't really feel unique except being more resistant, but also slower - they’re not an issue nor a challenge once you figure out the “meta” weapons that are just better than all others. The special abilities granted by leg modules, like Fortify, allowing you to hunker down and gain a major defense  bonus, or Stun Slam, are nice but ultimately, you will just use Quickload, that boosts your reload times tremendously, allowing you to dish out enormous DPS with heavier weapons - everything else pales in comparison.

Anyway, jokes apart .. 

To be honest, being a lover of iron man and marvel likes, I just searched for iron term on search bar and one fine day, steam threw this kinda not-so-known or renowned game. Just the term iron. And it was not that bad, I was expecting a heart-touching storyline, some memory blown plot and forever ingrained cult game, but it was a really plain tower defense game. Right at the start and you are thrown in a playground to splitter-splatter hordes of enemies just using transformer like mech and your arsenal of four different types of weapons which you can pop by salvaging scraps from enemies. graphics have a cartoonish touch and lot of television lookalike inanimate objects because our innocent antagonist is a broadcaster based terrorist or a baddy killing goodies and you being goody entrusted with hip hopping our baddie. Being a tower defense, it is kinda simple. You don't really have to have a lot of understanding of environment, strategic placements of turrets and guns and add-ons. Just more you have, the easier it is. Enemies follow straightforward path to attack the base that you have to defend with your life you noobie.

An easily passable and defeatable game. However, levels don't bring much variation, nor in combat neither in environment, every level look and feel almost same. So, yeah, gradually you will begin to wear off. If you are a fan of mechs and robots and transformers, then I will suggest its a one-time play. 

There are tons and myriads of better game than this one but if you are out of budget for a month, then I will thank steam for suggesting me this game. Best bought in sale. I will give 6 mechs out of 10 to this game.",1689004087,1689011255,True,9,0,0.626911282539367676,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Mech's combat and customization is pretty decent honestly still enjoy till this day, wish this game got a sequel but with a bigger budget and more respect while keeping similar gameplay.

Dwóch naukowców dostało się w zasięg pozaziemskiej fali radiowej, która zmieniła ich w (nieco szalonych) geniuszy-wynalazców. Jeden z nich zaczął tworzyć em... armię samobieżnych telewizorów, z pomocą których dąży do panowania nad światem. Drugi natomiast poszedł nieco bardziej tradycyjną ścieżką - jego arsenał to wieżyczki i mobilne okopy (czyli mechy z czymś przypominającym stanowisko snajperskie na szczycie). Gracz kieruje operatorem rzeczonego mecha i jego zadanie jest (w teorii) proste - umiejętnie rozmieszczając wieżyczki i osobiście uczestnicząc w walce, bronić określone cele przed zalewem telewizorów.

Rozgrywka przypomina Dungeon Defenders lub Orcs Must Die - tu również obserwujemy świat z perspektywy trzeciej osoby, walczymy z kolejnymi falami wrogów wyłaniających się z portali i podróżujących wytyczonymi ścieżkami, w miarę możliwości i wolnych funduszy dostawiając kolejne wieżyczki. Nic nie stoi również na przeszkodzie, aby osobiście pofatygować się do przeciwnika i ciepło go przywitać (najlepiej ogniem z sześciu luf). Pomiędzy mapami trafiamy do okrętu-bazy. Tu mamy możliwość przezbroić naszego mecha - zmienić jego typ (od czego zależy obrona, prędkość oraz liczba możliwych do zabrania broni i wieżyczek), jak również dokonać wyboru samych narzędzi zagłady, jakie zabierzemy na kolejne misje. Nowe typy uzbrojenia odblokowują się w miarę zaliczania kolejnych poziomów - część wypada z przeciwników, część można zakupić w sklepie.

Iron Brigade to bardzo przyjemna propozycja dla miłośników gatunku. Spora liczba broni i wieżyczek do wyboru pozwoli dopasować ekwipunek do stylu gry i wymagań danego poziomu, a oprawa audiowizualna uprzyjemnia rozgrywkę. Największymi wadami jest nieco toporne sterowanie mechem (chodzi wolno, a sprint nieraz powodował zacięcie się gdzieś w zakamarkach poziomu) oraz brak mapy i radaru w trakcie starcia (dostępna jest jedynie mapka poglądowa przy wyborze poziomu w bazie). Sama rozgrywka jest również momentami nieco powolna i pod koniec zaczęła mnie już nużyć. Mimo to - polecam.

[b]#6.[/b] The dps of a weapon isn't shown, so you have to calculate it yourself to see which weapon does the most dmg
[b]#7.[/b] Loot disappears
[b]#8.[/b] The windowed mode and fullscreen mode of the game is borked and the game freaks out when you switch modes (the mouse becomes unresponsive sometimes and other times your game just crashes).
[b]#9.[/b] Loot disappears
[b]#10.[/b] Can't set the FPS of the game
[b]#11.[/b] Loot disappears

Seriously though... the fact that loot disappears is the biggest issue BY FAR... if that was fixed that I could potentially look last the bad points of the game, but it's not fixed, so I can't come even close to recommending it. Go play Sanctum2 and just put a video of ""1hour of tank sounds"" on in the background or something... you'd be much better off than playing this game.

呼び出した様々なタレットと共に戦う迎撃TPS。
キャンペーン、サバイバルの2モードがあり、
どちらもオンラインco-op(野良、フレンド)が可能。
元はXbox用ゲームなので、パッドでも十分遊べる。

〇ソロとco-opの違い
・スクラップ取得時の増加量。
　co-opでは1人が1個スクラップを拾うと、
　人数で割った数が全員に配られる。
　また、初期スクラップ所持量が減る。

・敵の数と体力。
　co-op時の方が数が多く、体力も高い。
　味方の人数に応じてさらに増加するが、
　取得できるスクラップが増えるメリットもある。

・復活システム。
　ソロでは連打で何回でも復活できるが、
　co-opでは誰かに起こしてもらう必要がある。
　全員が倒れると即ゲームオーバー。

〇良い点
・レトロ感溢れるロボ「トレンチ」。
　搭乗するロボは頭も腕もない無骨なタイプ。
　排気を吹きながらガションガション歩く。
　武器はほぼ実弾、一部だけ非実弾だが、
　基本的にレトロな見た目で統一されている。
　搭乗者が剥き出しだが、無敵なので問題ない。

・機体カスタマイズが可能。
(1)本体
　このパーツによって耐久力、スピード、
　武器&タレットスロットが決定される。
　標準型、火力型、工兵型の3系統があり、
　同じ系統でも武器・タレット枠が違うことがある。
(2)足
　ダッシュ、踏みつけ攻撃、固定砲台化など、
　それぞれが固有のレッグアビリティを持ち、
　戦場で無制限に使用可能。
　本体と違い、基礎パラメータには影響しない。
(3)武器
　マシンガンやキャノンといった火砲。
　本体左右の武器スロットに装着する。
　それぞれに1~3のサイズが設定されており、
　サイズと同じ数の片側のスロットを占有する。
　よって、左右1スロットづつの本体より、
　片側2スロットの本体の方が良い武器を装着可能。
　一方、攻撃は左トリガーで左武器一斉攻撃、
　右トリガーで右武器一斉攻撃になっているので、
　左右にスロットが分かれている方が
　残弾を管理しやすく、隙が少ないと言える。
(4)タレット
　自動で攻撃したり補助効果を発揮する砲台。
　軽攻撃・重攻撃・補助の3種があり、
　本体のタレットスロットに装着する。
　戦闘中に敵を倒して得たスクラップを使い、
　指定した場所に要請して配置する。
　配置した当初はレベル1だが、追加費用を払い
　最大でレベル3までアップグレードできる。
　本体によって消費スクラップに差があり、
　工兵型は少なく、火力型は多くなっている。
　ほとんどの敵からは攻撃されないが、
　水色の敵や一部の中ボスからは攻撃され、
　ダメージが嵩めば破壊される点に注意。
　陸戦型の中ボスの進路上に設置してあると、
　踏まれて即破壊されてしまう。
　スクラップ自動収集機と地雷散布機は
　ステルス機能があるので破壊されない。

・敵の攻撃対象が分かりやすい。
　基本的に青い敵は拠点を、赤い敵は自機を、
　水色の敵はタレットを攻撃する。
　これはあくまで攻撃の優先順位でしかなく、
　射撃機は無視する場合もあるが、
　ほとんどの敵はこれを徹底するので戦いやすい。

〇アレな点
・戦闘中にマップが見られない。
　ブリーフィングで上空写真を見られるが、
　高低差や詳細が分からず、かなり見にくい。
　戦闘に入るとマップを見られず、敵の発見は
　基本的に目視でしか行えない。
　(出現警報が少しぐらいはある。)
　マップはどのステージも結構広いので、
　一人ではなかなかカバーしきれない。

・スクラップ回収が面倒。
　敵を倒した後にドロップするスクラップが、
　高さによっては結構飛び散ってしまう。
　ゲームの仕様上、定点で全て迎撃しきることは
　不可能なので、後の回収が非常に大変。
　しかも未回収のスクラップは時間経過で消える。
　補助タレットにスクラップ自動収集機があるが、
　それを置くのにもスクラップを使う。

・ジャンプがない。
　マップには段差で区切られているところがある。
　自機はジャンプできないので、一度降りると
　かなり遠回りして戻らないといけなくなることも。
　ロボデザから考えればジャンプ不可で当然だが、
　やはり不便ではある。

・戦闘中のカットシーンを飛ばせない。
　新しい敵が出て来た時やボスの出現時などに
　ムービーが入ることがあるが、スキップ出来ない。
　ドロップ品の収集目的で周回する場合、
　カットシーンだけで結構な時間がかかってしまう。
　ボスステージ後のムービーだけは飛ばせる。

一人でも遊べるがちょっと大変なので、
co-opで遊べる友人がいれば非常にオススメ。
難しい操作やテクニックもないので操作も簡単。
co-opでは1人当たりのスクラップ入手量が減るが、
誰かが拾えば全員に同じ量が行き渡るし、
敵の数自体が増えるので、取得できる総量は増える。
他プレイヤーが置いたタレットも強化できるので、
編成にかなり融通が利くようになる。

The game is focused on co-op which is long dead, what did the creators expect.
There is no mini map. And often you don't know if there are enemies and if you missed their exit from where.
In some levels, the terrain is large, the towers are quite expensive, considering that the upgrade costs double, and they can be destroyed, but not removed by the player and not repaired. And there are only a few seconds left for deployment. 
And resource gathering sucks. You are like a magnet with a short range in a big map with a short time.
You have a choice of a strong robot that is similar to a tank and so slow.
Or medium strong towers with more variety given that there are only 3 classes and you can only have up to 4 types of towers. Robots are always better than towers. More weapons or bigger more damage.
The shop sells old and no longer needed things. There are more good things in the level. But unfortunately the shop is not upgraded and lags significantly even at the end, I think it's a bug. You need some things though.
The first 3 parts are not so bad, maybe in the beginning. But the fourth one that was added later is unbalanced garbage.
The game depends on the better weapons, when the store does not work properly, it is a matter of luck and always in the next level.
And you only get a little help in some levels from all the useless army and cannons behind your back.
It is also quite short without the last fourth part which is for grinding.
If the creators had really tried it would have been quite good, but it is not.

+ Es un tower defense que se juega en tercera persona con un pilotaje de mechas.
+ Estéticamente y gráficamente (para un juego de xbox arcade del 2011) esta muy simpático.
+ Es double fine, siempre hay que darle una oportunidad a sus juegos, es un estudio que sabe.
+ Tiene coop de a 4 y se nota que fue pensado para jugarlo asi.
+ El diseño de los monstruo monovisores o teletubo estan bien y los mechas que manejamos se ven geniales por el armamento que le podemos equipar y como cambian sus modelos.
+ Los jefes de las zonas funcionan bien y los mapas se juegan bien.
+ Sinceramente le doy positivo porque no existe la opción de punto medio y en oferta vale la pena sus 9 horas de duración.
+ Las Mobile Trench que usamos tienen cantidad de armamento y se puede variar tanto su estilo de juego que da mucha rejugabilidad.

*No esta Copado porque:
- Sinceramente tanto como shooter y tower defense flojea muchísimo al punto que envejeció mal, ya que:
1º- Como shooter falta fuerza en los impactos lo que deja  mucho que desear, ademas que te deja la sensación que siempre  falta potencia de fuego para exterminar cualquier unidad enemiga, sobretodo si no traes equipado un mecha grande con mínimo 4 ametralladoras o cañones sniper o artillería.
2º- Como juego de defensa comete el horrible error de limitar las torres que podes llevar, desde el tipo (3 en total siendo el azul inútil casi siempre) y la cantidad (entre 2 y 4). Ademas de esto son pocas las torretas que en verdad sirven, sumado al echo que igual que las armas muchas se sienten débiles y son solo un apoyo.
- Las animaciones están todas tiesas, sumado a lo mal optimizado y limite de 30 fps.
- El sonido por momentos parece que te explota los parlantes y es muy repetitivo por su calidad tan baja. Por lo menos las actuaciones de voz y la música están simpáticas.
- Esta muy pensado para el cooperativo.
- La movilidad no es un problema, sino fuera que tenes que buscar los materiales a la conciencia del mono.
- Las piernas definen una habilidad extra del mecha: Correr, modo tirador y pisotón. La idea es buena pero las trincheras deberían tener esas habilidades de por si y las piernas ser mejoras que se enfocan en un estilo de juego mas que otra tonta limitante.",1657415561,1688445456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And this one is in 3D!

The story is almost a lampoon of the golden age of scifi. Two childhood friends were exposed to some sort of alien broadcast and gained super intelligence. One engineered robotic legs for disabled soldiers. The other invented the television (well ahead of our prime timeline) and decided to network the world... no matter what's in the way, by creating a new set of robots known as monovisions, or ""the tubes"", to do his bidding, and no army can stand against the robots. The first turned his robot legs into ""mobile trench"" weapon platform, where a soldier can command these weapon platforms, with mechanical legs for mobility, and ability to drop emplacements (turrets) to assist in defense. Now, the former best friends must do battle across the world, and you are a new recruit in the Mobile Trench Brigade. As you gain experience, you will unlock new weapons, new chassis, new legs, new emplacements (turrets) as well as new outfits, and other customizations both for your trench and yourself. 

The game is unique for the time in that you can customize the loadout on each trench, and has the ability to assign different weapons to different sides, and given the Xbox controller has two triggers, have them fire separately. The enemy will shoot back and some are designed specifically to destroy your turrets. Others are going after your trench. Yet others are going after your base. 

The game is much tougher than it looks, even in the beginning levels, and there is no difficulty level selector. And really needs other players, and up to 3 others can join you. 

All in all, a game that's a little ahead of its time. Worth trying.

I love DoubleFine Games. Big fan indeed. I snatched this up since I love tower defense games and DF.

After completing this somewhat short game I'm barely giving it a positive review.

Why? Here's why:

Pros:

-Humor
-Character designs
-Level designs
-Story
-VO work. Especially the legendary Phil LaMarr!

Cons:

-Can't sell turrets. !? This is the first TD Ive ever played where you cant sell towers/turrets. At least give me the option to remove it. 
-Scraps. You have to drudge your slow mech all over the place to vaccuum up after kills. Sure there’s a turret for this but it doesnt always pick  up all the scraps in its AoE. Scraps get caught in things and it makes the collector turrets worthless.
-Time between rounds is short. Ten seconds? Dumb.
-Turret and chassis upgrades are limited. Only the armor, slots and speed are different. Some can only carry light turrets or heavy turrets or tertiary turrets.
-Weapons have few stats displayed. Aside from caliber and distance there is no other info displayed about each weapon. No reload time, ammo capacity, etc. They don’t even explain some of the special abilities some of them have. It’s a guessing game.
-Turrets aren't much different from one another. Aside from distance and caliber some have special abilities but those are few and far between.
-Legs are limited to 3 types.
-Turret placement is limited to where they can be placed and placed near each other.
-Turrets are weak and are easily destroyed; even when theyre upgraded.
-Chassis variety is limited. There are different types and then there are 5 levels for each of them that only improves the armor and speed.
-Cut scenes can't be skipped.
-Only a few survival scenes available.
-Turrets don't always hit targets. Sometimes they don't always fire at all.
-Turrets cannot be customized at all. They only upgrade the damage and AoE at 3 levels. And barely at that.
-No CC or CD or procs for chassis or turrets or weapons.
-Head gear and jackets are superficial (but hilarious).
-No music.
-Crashes. I had load screen crashes; general in-games crashes and start-up issues. It didn't happen much but often enough.
-For a game made in the past decade it didn't look the least bit impressive even with settings at the highest.

There are more pros and cons but the game was frustrating at times and the controls are limited. You can't even remap mouse buttons.

It's a shame. This game could've been great:  A truly fun and exciting TD game but it was more of an unpolished game and maybe even an afterthought of something bigger.

Still, the humor and challenge might be enough to purchase at discount for TD fans mostly.

It's fortunate that it got a Steam release, as there is every possibility the game would be lost to history now otherwise- or at least merely whispered of on emulation forums.

I first played IB years ago at the time of its original XBLA release in 2011, when it was under its former name of Trenched, which it had until a legal entanglement involving a similarly-named, irrelevant board game. It later came to Steam under the current name with the Rise of the Martian Bear DLC included, and eventually even had Games For Windows Live removed and replaced with Steamworks. Other titles with that particular millstone around their necks have not always been so fortunate, such as Lost Planet 2.

For those not in the know, Iron Brigade has a little story behind its development. During a time when Double Fine's troubled but unique heavy metal opera Brutal Legend had no publisher, Tim Schafer ran a morale-boosting exercise wherein he had the studio split into four teams and had them come up with ideas for games in a two week period known as the ""Amensia Fortnight."" Later, after EA ran Brutal Legend into the ground by suppressing all information regarding its multiplayer mode, considered by Double Fine to be the game's main offering, the Amnesia Fortnight prototypes were revisited and each was finished and published. Of these, Iron Brigade, Costume Quest and Stacking can all be found on Steam today, while Sesame Street: Once Upon A Monster remained a 360 exclusive.

Iron Brigade is thematically based on the testosterone-infused men's magazines of the 1940s and 50s, and depicts and alternate mid-20th century. Two fighting men, Frank Woodruff and Vladimir Farnsworth, after losing their legs in the Great War, served in a radio intelligence station in the Pacific. This station was affected by a mysterious and powerful signal we know only as The Broadcast, that fried the minds of everyone on the base except Frank and Vlad, who instead gained superhuman intelligence. Frank used his knowledge to design and build the Mobile Trenches, crude, but powerful internal-combustion-powered bipedal tanks that he intended for crippled soldiers to walk again. Vlad, on the other hand, created Monovision- a means to bring the world to the people instead. But something went wrong. From Monovision came the Tubes- monstrous creatures of wire and static bent on destruction. Whether the Tubes caused Farnsworth to go mad or they were born from his madness themselves does not matter. What matters is that Woodruff and his Mobile Trench Brigade are the only ones who can stop him. That's where you come in.

The game has 20-ish levels total spread across four chapters: Europe, Africa, the Pacific and Mars. Each level tends to introduce one new enemy type or environmental mechanic to keep things interesting, as well as change the arrangement of enemy spawn points and defense objectives, of which there can be between one and three. There are a wide variety of enemies, from simple running Resisters and shooting Tommys to flying Aerials, grenade-firing Burst Transmitters that target your turrets, and angry red Blitzers and Solenoids that ignore structures and instead target the players, and more. There are also boss-type tubes that can do things like spawn lesser Tubes or shell the objective from a long way away. It is worth noting that the Mars levels are considerably harder then the base game's campaign and resulted in a long delay in my getting to finish the game overall when combined with extenuating life circumstances and connection issues faced by my usual friend group.

To properly combat the Tubes you can alter the configuration of your Trench to a large degree, with up to six weapon hardpoints or up four types of turrets depending on your core chassis, with different legs providing supplementary abilities such as sprinting, or deploying your trench to become a turret yourself, with faster weapon reloading. Bigger Trench weapons can take two or even three hardpoints. Aside from carrying more guns, heavy trenches move slower and have more armor, but pay more scrap to build and upgrade turrets, while the inverse is true for engineering chassis, with standard chassis in the middle.

In between levels you can configure your Trench, emote at other players and just kind of run around the deck of the amphibious carrier USS Mckinley. You can change the paintjob on your trench, which of the four pilots you're playing and what their wearing, though oddly only changing their hat affects anything- and only which emotes they can do.

A friend of mine pointed out while playing coop with me that Iron Brigade would benefit greatly from an upgraded remake or updated rerelease of some description, to shake out the dust of its XBLA vintage and build upon its core concepts, perhaps with more levels, trench parts, enemies, that sort of thing. As a generally quality title, I cannot disagree. Aside from some occasional netcode hiccups that results in dropped players from coop sessions at odd times (including after a mission is already over), Iron Brigade is an excellent budget title and worth your time, especially if you have some friends to play coop with.",1626426055,1626465418,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This tower defense game definitely sticks out to me. The WW2 style vibes for the Mechs, the different types of Mechs you can use, a wide variety of weapons all with different attributes, for example, the bog standard machine gun, use it on any enemy, but having trouble with aerial units? Slap on a flak gun and smoke them. Prefer to sit back near the objective? Use a special type of leg set to hunker down, giving you a quicker reload and upping your armour defense. There's so much more to the customisation but bare in mind, different Mech types effect what kind of turrets/equipment you can bring with you. The smaller the Mech the more you can bring, think of it like the less weaponry you have on you, the more weaponry you can throw out on the battlefield. The bigger your Mech, the more you can equip therefore giving you less to call in to help. 
When playing with friends, up to 4 players, try to be strategical.

This is actually a surprisingly competent game.

It's just a really pleasant game overall, and it's well worth playing with friends. Maybe someone can even make an HD graphics texture pack or mod to really give it the shine it deserves.

Gameplay is how you would expect, with a combo of shooting and using towers to defend your base(s) against the enemies.  The setting is quite unusual with it being a weird alternate WW1 setting with mechs and your enemies being the broadcast.  They are these weird cathode ray enemies with names of various parts of TVs and electronics (Knobs, Resistors, etc).  Never really understood what these were supposed to be but the are definitely original.  Your character is a marine piloting a big, cumbersome mech.

The game has some very good elements, but also many very bad or annoying elements.  The best aspect of the game is that your mech is very customizable.  There are different chassis with different weapon slots, tower slots, armor, speed, etc.  There are also different categories of weapons and emplacements and you find and buy new variants as you go.  Many of the weapons have special abilities like piercing or richocet too.  Unlocking and decking out your mech was fun and was easily the best part of the game.  The setting was another positive, very unique.  Unfortunately that is about it for the positives for me.

The negatives are kind of plentiful and really ruined the game for me.  The DLC expansion (included with the game by default) was especially bad.  The biggest problem is that this game is clearly designed as a co-op game, but no one is really doing that anymore so you are mostly stuck with single player unless you have some friends who want to play this old game with you.  Single player is completely doable, but it really isn't that fun.  Towers kind of suck in this game (at least until you get a bunch or upgrade them) and you start with little money so you are largely shooting things yourself until later in the level.  Won't be a problem early in the game but later levels get annoying.  Couple this with your mech being slow and turning weird and many enemies being able to attack your towers and you get a frantic game where you are running (slowly) across the map.  Oh, and you need to pick up the currency (and loot drops) with your character too so more running around.  Just isn't that fun.  Another annoyance is that the cutscenes are not skippable nor are the levels repeatable from in mission.  Want to try a mission again, die/abandon the mission, select the map again, deploy and listen to the same stuff all over again.  You also have to physically move on the ship to select the mission and move to another place to deploy.  The game just has no respect for your time.  Game also has clunky, consol-ish menu's that are more annoying to navigate then they should be (mech customization mainly).  Beyond that, the game also has other bad design choices.  It doesn't tell you what enemies are coming other then some very minor hints in the mission choice screen.  It does give advice on weapons/towers which is a hint too but still you mainly need to wait until they come out or memorize there patterns from previous runs.  It also starts the mission immediately on starting the mission, so you have no time to get your bearings (which is harder on a 3d map in first person).

Anyway, you probably think I hate this game but it is still somewhat fun, at least for the standard game.  I did hate the expansion and ended up quitting on the 3rd level (levels are huge, enemies are harder to kill and it just makes all the annoyances above really stick out).  I just didn't think it was worth the frustration anymore.  I still wouldn't recommend this game though, even for the standard game.  I really like the strategy portion of tower defense games, so this game already is not my favorite style with the shooting added but this game is particularly bad in the strategic part with low tower volumes and no good way to plan ahead.  Orcs Must Die was fun so I can enjoy this style, but this game made too many missteps.  Maybe it's worthwhile with friends but otherwise it is a game most people should skip, there are many better games in the genre.",1619280004,1619280004,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am disappointed there's no weekly leaderboard like there is on the xbox 360 version, but I'm still fascinated with improving my gameplay (like being in position on waves 14-17 really matter).  If the player base were larger, this game would be incredible for co-op, as the difficulty is scaled to the amount of players.  A four-player match is nothing like a solo run....everyone needs to be on their toes and know how to cooperate and communicate.  Overall, the game's art style and the story's writing for the plot were very well done.  If you like shooting stuff and setting up defences then get this game on sale.

There are a decent variety of enemies to kill, a smattering of Trench pieces to assemble and a good array of guns and Emplacements to use. The number of Trench component ""types"" is small, around 6 chassis in 3 classes and 4-6 types of legs. Each type gets 4-5 mechanically identical upgrades with maybe a minor tweak on the highest level. Each justifies it's existence so I can't complain that every option is interesting, but you end up with nothing new to see relatively early for a game that touts customization.

Guns are a different story, there are a few weapon types and within each type there is a base set of upgrade guns and a number of named guns with unique mechanics. Guns with bouncing bullets, automatic sniper rifles, sticky grenades and more provide a smorgasbord of options. Emplacements tend to be linear upgrades on one another but the list of options is pretty good and provides several ways to set up your killzone.

Game looks fine if you're not picky about modern graphics, mechanics are mostly alright although chasing scrap(the resource used to deploy Emplacements) can be tedious and buggy. 

Enemy variety is good, they're distinct, have distinct names and each change the situation on the ground when they arrive. 

Some consideration of the teamwork mechanics is warranted given the emphasis on team play. It's nice to work with folks and the even distribution of scrap among players regardless of who picks things up is nice. Assisting one another is easy and you can upgrade one another's Emplacements just like your own. This suggests that  worrying about individual performance is to be avoided, since putting upgrades on a teammate's Emplacements changes them to your color scheme and (I believe) attributes their kills to you. This means the Assault trenches with the heavy guns and big armor can often put the final upgrade on an Emplacement created by an Engineer trench and there by end up credited with more gun kills *and* more turret kills. This wouldn't matter much except that the game shows a performance report after every mission. This makes playing the ""unique"" option in this game somewhat frustrating as the weaker Trenches just don't feel like they're performing.

Overall the game is great fun, costs relatively little even without a sale and provides a couple evenings of fun for a team at the very least. I like to play games with something new to offer even if they aren't deep and involved. This is a good way to spend a short bit of time and if you don't ask for more than it can offer it's totally worth it,

However, due to the difference in theme, Iron Brigade has something more special in its arsenal - not only does it let you pilot your own mech, you'll get to customize it as well, which comes in handy when figuring out which chassis and legs to use, which turrets to bring, or which guns to equip... the variety is simply amazing here!  

[h1]Watch me play![/h1]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Au4_ocmugU


Besides the typical ""defend a structure"" from waves of enemies, Iron Brigade will also have you on the offensive at the end of every map where you'll get to battle a big bad ""boss"". Bosses have different abilities and will, usually, spawn different enemies so you'll really have to be on your toes constantly.

Now, the game seems to be designed around co-op play and perhaps due to this, I find the game to be, at one point (after the Egypt boss), too difficult to continue solo. It is also possible that the previous levels are intended to be ""farmed"" for ""loot"" like better turrets and weapons and stuff, making headlong progression (no backtracking) too tall an order for most solo players.

As some reviewers have mentioned, Iron Brigade is a pretty old game and I do notice that the game tend to crash fairly consistently whenever I alt-tabbed out of the game and then tried to bring the game screen back up. I also have a bone to pick with the game for not adding in a ""skip cutscene"" option, forcing me to rewatch the same cutscene whenever I have to repeat a level [spoiler]due to failing it of course[/spoiler], or that I can't skip the end screen of each level where the score takes quite some time to fully load.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Challenging boss battles where you'll get to go on the offensive
+ Fun TD levels that get increasingly difficult, more so if you're trying to play the game solo 
+ Can play with up to 3 of your friends in co-op
+ Customizable mechs where you can change basically everything from the paint job, to the guns and the chassis.
+ Incredible variety of turrets, weapons and enemies
+ Humorous storyline with wacky characters 

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Personally, at one point, I don't find the game very solo player-friendly. Best if you can grab a few friends to play the game with you.
- The humour wears out pretty quickly for me. I think younger players might enjoy the humour more though! 
- Some issues with the game crashing without any warning or errors - Don't tab out of the game and you should be fine! 
- Old game so it lacks some features that I value like being able to skip cutscenes that I've seen before.

To begin, my playtime is obviously PC only. I played this for about a year and a half back at release on console, with me playing to wave 100 more times than I can count and spending far too much time simply playing with randoms every night. Basically, I have too much player time. Probably not the most. But spread across 2 platforms, it is substantial so this comes with bias but is under the guise of a Modern review and not a ""I liked this in 2011 so it's good!"" review lol.

Iron Brigade is a 3rd person mech based tower defense game filled with that Double Fine silly charm and gameplay I positively adore.

It is up to 4 player coop though there is a bug on this steam release which makes 3 and 4 person teams potentially unstable.
There are player mentioned fixes for this, but your mileage may vary. For myself, lag isn't an issue, it's a Game Authentication bug that happens with 3+ players which I have yet to find a solution for.

This may sound damning and it may very well be for you hence why I lead with it.

The thing is, I don't consider this as much of a nail in the coffin of a long dead game as you may thing, though it is certainly a large blemish. We will circle back to why I feel it's not the end of the world at the end.


Iron Brigade as a game consists of a simple campaign of 20 missions, 5 of which being from the (included) DLC expansion and offering a slightly higher difficulty than the base game, which as a whole tell you the silly story of Iron Brigade while allowing you to earn plenty of weapons, emplacements, cosmetics and learn the basics of the gameplay.

In essence, it's a silly tutorial though it doesn't feel like it at the time. The main part of the game is the Survival mode- 3 maps from the campaign transformed into 100 wave monstrosities meant to challenge your understanding of the game while rewarding you immensely powerful tools to push even further the next time.

The truth is, the Survival mode is where the game best demonstrates its core solid design. The waves in Survival are often better themed to encourage the player to stay mobile and active and not simply lean back and let the game play itself, and the difficulty curve is interesting with the early waves being challenging as you don't have many emplacements down, the middle section being a nice breeze where you're building up your defenses and trying to maximize your payoff from each wave, and the last handful of waves being where the game tries its best to END YOU.

It's fun. I'm biased. But it's genuinely just really fun and I wish more people got to experience this specific game's survival mode.

It's fun to use the meta options and destroy the mode's 100 waves, it's fun to avoid the meta and try beating it with sillier options, the game is at its best in this mode as it allows all the unique enemies to thoroughly express their strengths against you- and you against them.

Good stuff.

As for why I don't think this game's stability limiting to 2 players is a problem, it's because what's here is simply delightful despite that.
Solo and 2 man runs are a blast, the humor is charming, the survival mode remains my favorite tower defense experience in the entire genre.

I do very much miss playing this game when it was current; Back when I got to people watch with randoms all day and every run was 3-4 players which allowed you to see a variety of playstyles, a variety of game experience on display, and a solid high difficulty as difficulty scales with player count.

But what's here today is still phenomenally fun. Fun enough for my bud and I to come revisit it and see how quickly we could go from level 1 to beating all 3 survival maps with our prior knowledge. It's just a good game. I'd love to see a sequel, or modding tools to appear out of nowhere (never going to happen) lol

Overall, my recommendation is a solid HECK YEAH if you have one other friend who's interested in this genre mashup. Just play through the campaign, then tackle those survival maps ASAP as that is where the meat of the game truly is- I mean it.

If you are solo, I would argue that I myself very much enjoy this solo- but I can not offer as solid a recommendation since the game expands with playercount and you might not enjoy solo as much.

If you are part of a 3-4 player group then I would flash a red flag and say ""BEWARE! BUG!"" *IF* you can play this with 3 or 4 people it's genuinely at it's height, it's the most fun at this range- BUT the game authentication bug is something that will either damn your group or completely ignore you and let you have fun. I can not offer a prediction on which will affect you.",1599693670,1688800276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The other issue is being able to play with my 3 friends, as we have done in all other games on steam without issue. We will take turn hosting the game as the 4th player always get disconnected within 10 seconds of connecting. After we play tag on hosting and can stay in session for a minute or two, we can launch a mission to play. I admit, first 10 missions went smoothly, no lag or shuttering. Unfortunately, this was at 3.5 hours mark of gameplay and this was when things went down hill. At this point forward, any mission we played together, you cannot move from the  lag when a new wave begins. As you know, this is a tower defence game and each mission has an X number of waves. Some waves, we can move after the monsters are already moved to the base. This is just unbelievably poor performance from a game that came out in 2012. 

Steam unfortunately cannot refund me as I exceeded 2 hours of gameplay. But as I mentioned, the issues I encountered was not there until later into the story. We thought maybe one or two waves were poorly designed and would go away, but after a 5th attempt and changing internet providers for one friend, it was just hopeless to continue trying further.

- Ultrawide resolution has top and bottom of screen cutoff.
- A few minor environmental bugs.
- Sometimes farming certain items can be kind of a pain due to random drop chances.

- Some annoying unskippable cutscenes & voice queues.

Pros:

- Lots to unlock even after finishing the main campaign (approx. 10 hours for first playthrough). 
- Infinite replayability through survival gamemodes.
- Incredibly fun, addicting gameplay with lots of polish and complexity. Coming up with a strong defensive strategy and adapting to different maps can be exciting. There are usually at least 3 different loadouts you can take that would easily get you a 3 star for each mission.

Autant on sent que c'est un tower-defense conçu pour être joué à 4, autant je pense qu'il aurait été préférable de donner quelques gadgets de plus à ceux qui jouent tout seul afin de leur faciliter la tâche : encore une fois, aller à l'autre bout de la map pour récupérer des ressources devient vite chiant, encore plus quand on est équipé d'un mecha relativement lent. 
C'est dommage car le concept était là, avec un vrai feeling, la fusion TPS + Tower-Defense aurait pu donner quelque chose de vraiment jouissif et les développeurs auraient pu aller encore plus loin quant à la personnalisation de notre mécha. 
Au final, ça se finit en 5 heures (comptez le double pour faire tout le reste) et c'est pas plus mal tant le jeu n'avait déjà plus grand-chose à proposer.

Man your trench solo, or with up to 3 other players in co-op, and collect new weapons, costumes, paints, parts, take on a good dozen levels, and the additional ""Survival"" modes which offer even greater rewards! 

Theres a great variety of weapons, and balance for the game is quite interesting to say the least, where Enginner-class Trenches (the little guys) specialize in turret placement, and take time, but essentially have no upper limit of power, while large, assault class trenches can slug it out from the get go, but as stronger enemies continue to appear, their usefulness begins to wane. 

But the voice acting, writing, plot, and gameplay all bring in an experience that, while a bit short, is well worth playing, and replaying, and while it has a bit of an 'indie' feel at times, it is a budget title that offers more fun than some triple-A games I have played.

        [td][h1]The Review[/h1][/td]
        [td]Iron Brigade is a game that has an identity crisis. From the look of the game you would assume that it would play like a Mech Warrior game? No this game is a tower defense game. Double Fine seems to believe that they can make a hybrid of both, they think by having multiple types of mech chassis that it can both be action and strategy. That does not work as engineering chassis are the only useful for regular missions while assault chassis is only good for boss fights. So every mission you just drop sentries everywhere and just sit there and wait for the mission to end. The main issue of this game is it is very boring and repetitive. New tube monsters just make it where you use more sentries and does not take much strategy. In conclusion their is no reason to get this when you can get either a pure Mech shooter or a tower defense game.[/td]

However, you most likely have to play this game alone. With average daily player count between 10 to 25 you're not likely finding help any time soon, unless you bring a friend with you.

The game is fully beatable alone, but some maps are seemingly designed to have at least two players on it. It can get obnoxious for one player to run all around the map trying to be mister one man army.

Not a fatal problem, just annoying, as it seems like all progress was saved but the person who lost the connection just had to exit the game and try again.

Sometimes, we would all get ""Internet Connection lost"", which was equally annoying and again, not a big problem, because we would all just reconnect. We tried different people hosting the game (luckily, this wasn't a problem) but it never ran 100% smoothly.

The graphics were a bit on the simple side and a little weird. Not really sure what the story was about - fighting ""tubes"" I guess. A ""tower defense"" game, where we all got our own kind of Mech-like things to attack the nicely varied kinds of things moving in on us. There were a few interesting tactical choices and in general was pretty fun to play.

It was, as usual, far too easy though. After the first couple of maps, where we were just trying to figure out what was going on, we only had to replay a map once. So, once again, I really wish it were more difficult. As far as I could tell, there was no way to up the difficulty. We like a challenge and I would have liked to have to replay a map, trying new tactics, in order to win. I am *not* going to replay a map just to get a better grade on it!

There were plenty of options to customize your mech, although 3 of us ended up with the same basic type. I went with the small, more mobile on, that could deploy ""Heavy"" emplacements. In the end, there could have been more things to customize it with, but in the end, there was just enough.

I liked that anyone could go the the ""Radio Room"" and invite the other players. And I liked looking at the other mechs.

This is a port of a console game and its DLC. It's a tower defense of sorts, in which you run around in a mech/walking tank, shooting robots. You get scrap which you can use to purchase and upgrade towers, and you are awarded cash which you can use to buy upgraded weapons, armor, etc. to kick more ro-butt. The game has a set number of missions with boss battles at the end of each fairly short campaign (three campaigns in the main game and one in the DLC), and there are a few little brief quasi-cutscenes. The story is nothing to get excited over. I love the premise of the game, and at times, I had fun. The fact you can play it in up to 4-player co-op is great as well. However, the game had some serious issues for me.

Lag was horrendous. I can host Tom Clancy Wildlands, Dying Light, Borderlands 2, all sorts of stuff that's far more advanced than Iron Brigade, and even games with more players in them simultaneously than this. However, the game frequently slowed to a crawl, rarely becoming a slide show...no exaggeration. When it got really bad, my friend would disconnect. To be fair, he also has some computer problems, but this game is an absolute resource hog. He could run many newer games just fine, but this one chewed at his processor and sometimes overheated his feeble PC. My computer is just dandy, though, and it still suffered awful lag while playing this game online.

Another issue I had was unskippable cutscenes mid-level. When you're trying to get through an annoying boss or lengthy map and a cutscene starts up that you can't skip, it's pretty dang annoying to me. If that's not an issue for you, then that's good! I got pretty peeved by it.

You know how in most TDs you either automatically get upgrade currency mid-battle, or its auto-deposited for you after a wave? Or hey, in some TDs, you just quickly swish you mouse over coins on the ground. Well, in Iron Brigade, you have to physically run your mech within range of whatever you blew up and hold a suction button to draw in the resources. This is time-consuming and the resources disappear quite quickly! The only alternative is to spend the resources to purchase a magnet to suck them in...and even then, its range is rather tiny, and the bots might attack and destroy those towers, thus wasting the precious resources you built them to gather in the first place!

When they brought this game to PC, I believe they should have implemented better design (for PC resources), better online play quality, automatic resource/scrap-obtaining when blowing up bots (and get rid of the magnet towers, naturally, or just have one at the base that pulls in across the whole map but it costs a lot), and allow cutscenes to be skipped. These issues made the game pretty insufferable at times, and turned what should have been a great time into an occasionally decent time at best.",1535598539,1535598539,False,3,0,0.49505952000617981,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But unlike those two examples Iron Brigade has one game mechanic which totally killed the fun for me:

Killed enemies drop the game currency on the spot and you have to collect it. 

That doesn't sound like a big deal but it gets annoying when you kill enemies all over the map e.g. with sniper weapons to get ahead of the wave. So this results in a lot of running with a clunky mech and even losing a lot of resources if you are too slow.

To be fair the rest of the game is pretty well made and people who don't mind that will have a lot of fun with this game.
But for me I can't recommend buying it.

Strap on your way back when helmets since this is going to get bumpy.
Looooooong before lootcrates, MT's in everything and $59,99 1/3rd games being the standard, there was Iron Brigade.
Originally developed for XBLA (xbox live arcade) it was shortly thereafter ported to the Personal Computer for Windows Ex Pee and Veesta.

It was a massive success for a game that wasn't tied to a huge multiple-A budget and provided many of us with a fresh and engaging coop experience revolving around an alternate WWI setting where mechs and aliens were very real things.

The gameplay is simple enough at first but gets challenging pretty fast.
It sets you off on earth where you're informed that earth is under attack by an evil mad person and only you and 3 other people can stop him/it.

You do said things by securing pieces of the warmap such as locations in each continent, strategical locations elsewhere and space.

Doing so requires a few things. A pilot (you & friends), A giant stompy warmachine of your choosing and stationary defenses to deter (read: riddle with bullets) whatever is on the opposing side.

Normally i go on and on about how good this game is but in this case, it wasn't for two reasons.
1: GFWL. (Yuck. I know)
2: A bug that made longer game sessions unplayable.

As of 2015, said bugs (both) have been removed and the latter was caused by the former. Naturally everyone moved on by this point but that shouldn't have happened to begin with.

As of writing this review, you too can own a very underrated Mech/TD hybrid for the ever so low price of <$2,50, which is practically stealing it.

You won't find open lobby games practically at all, but some die hard people like me still play from time to time and do pre-made coop sessions, so the game is still somewhat alive if anything.

Worth your time? You decide. It was worth my entire playtime combined and i can't stress how badly this game needs a sequel.

Essentially, if WWII was fought between human mechs and sentient TV monsters, it would be this game. Start the game with a basic mech and work your way up to building more and better mech designs; As your mech improves, take on harder missions. You also earn turrets you can lay down on the battlefield, so the game is as much about passive tower defense as it is about you doing the shooting yourself. Some mech parts can only be collected by random drops, so collecting them all involves grinding a particular mission until you get what you're looking for (this includes getting high scores on the survival missions).

I know from playing the XBox version of this that multiplayer play is a lot of fun, and the difficulty scale is about right for the number of players (the game is slightly harder overall with more people). However, I've never actually been able to play the PC version in multiplayer mode; The game has longstanding problems with multiplayer support, and it is still not fixed, in spite of the developer's claims otherwise. This is also one of the few DoubleFine games to have never seen a Linux port (although it mostly works on WINE).

I love mech games for the same reason I love survival games: elements of both action and strategy blended well together. You have to plan out what kinds of parts to equip and where to put your turrets, but you also have to pilot your mech and keep up with the incoming enemy waves. I've beaten every mission many times, collected every non-multiplayer achievement, and I still enjoy this game.

The only problems with it are slightly dated menus and a low player count.

Behind this is a very playful, tongue-in-cheek style of humour that strives for ""Rated 'M' for 'MANLY'"" in a dieselpunk world changed by the coming of cable television, and enormous mechanized walkers - the Mobile Trenches.

""Turn no-mans-land into REAL-MANS-LAND!""

You get to pilot one of the afor-mentioned walkers, taking to the field personally to defend objectives against terrors of screens, wires and other components besides to prevent the CRT-based 'Tubes' from conquering the world. Your walker can be personalized with a variety of interesting, fun, and sometimes downright wacky weaponry and abilities that lets you dominate the field. From small, fast ranging scouts, to lumbering mobile turrets, you are not defenseless in the least, and can take the fight to the Tubes, up close and personal!

You don't have to do this alone, however - as you have a slew of towers at your disposal to aid you. Initially you can only field a limited number and type of towers. As you upgrade your walker, and customize it to your liking, more towers and tower types become available. The variety and selection of these towers ranges from the usual suspects of sentry guns, to more unorthodox jammers, snipers and explosive barrel deployers. Creative use of these towers is key to success, and is as much fun to find and devise unique combinations for even more destruction.

Being a coop focused game, other players are welcome and recommended - as each player can only field a certain number and variety of towers. More players means more options, and more potential for deadly traps to be established. Not only that, extra walkers means extra guns, and sometimes that can be the difference between success and defeat.

Being an older release, support (now) is naturally lacking as far as new content - and while it doesn't lose it's charm, it can become repeatative. A small community, and sometimes sketchy online compatibility also means the biggest strength - the coop - is a little hard to come by. This is especially troublesome with later maps, which all but require a full teams' worth of firepower to complete.

In all, I love this game, and I think it's a shame the community isn't as active now as it was on release through Xbox Live.

If you like the aesthetic you might also like Fortified.  Both games have a similar sensibilities and each game has their own set of problems.  I’m not a huge fan of third person tower defense games.  They feel like an exercise in true masochism. 

I picked up Iron Brigade for $1.50.  In principle I got my money’s worth.  I’ve owned it twice on XBL and Steam.  If you paid more than that, you were robbed.  IB is cute in a steampunk inspired WWI mech sort of way. It supports 4-player co-op though it feels mechanically unbalanced. 

Your loot drops are dependent on your player level and the map you’re actually playing on.  I disagree with the former and have no issue with the latter.  I resent unlocking gear that I’m too low level to use.  The art style is quite charming to my 10 year old self.  

It’s pulp-inspired U.S Vs. Russia 1940s style sci-fi tower defense and if you couldn’t grind to level up your mech I’d say that Fortified was the better game all round.  Games that follow the pulp-hero-shooter formula are fairly hit or miss, more so misses than hits if they also happen to be TDs or RLs.  

The maps look very washed out and almost grungy and the objectives do feel a little bland and very samey as you progress even if the level design is moderately interesting to look at.  As you progress the waves gain variety, they get tougher, the number of waves and the number of enemies increase the more go on. 

The boss maps are interesting though grading your performance on how fast you can kill a giant tentacle is very lacking in imagination and even more so in execution. When Iron Brigade players grow up they realize that Sanctum 2 is just an all-round better game. That’s an objectively verifiable fact. 

If you’re one of those hardcore die-hard people who play every tower defense under the sun, you’ve probably already got this game and if you don’t have it by now, you don’t need it.  It’s alright though IB decided to set up shop in an already crowded market place and they have only themselves to be blame. 

It feels like one of the Double Fine development team just saw Sanctum and decided to rip it off, dumb it down and make it third person because those dumb scene kids will buy anything.  It’s ok. It’s not a must own the way Sanctum 2 or Killing Floor 2 or Orcs Must Die 2 might be for some.  

You get a lot of ammo, and a lot of turrets, though I don’t recommend playing Iron Brigade solo.  It’s not that good. It becomes needlessly hard and feels very unsatisfying after about two-thirds of the way in.  It doesn’t bring anything new or exciting to the genre.  Get Sanctum 2 or Orcs Must Die 2 instead.",1526555578,1541895501,True,0,0,0.287808030843734741,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Some scientist got crazy and wanted to destroy all the world. Funny, he is Russian. But.. brave Americans won't to afford it. So they sent a huge battleship with innovative a mech to fight against the aliens.

This game plays as Orc Must die. You have a character with basic attacks and you can build towers. But... Orcs must die is more fun in my opinion.

So, enemies come, you kill them with the mech, gathering cash and sometimes place towers. An idea is very nice.. but it plays not fun. Big maps, the mech is low and can't jump, you need to always move to gather cash. You can't see enemy health, so you are just shooting and hoping it will be dead soon.

After missions, you get new weapons and new towers.
I finished 5 missions and didn't want to continue the game. It is just not fun

- An interesting setting, story and intro comics

Cons
- No difficulty settings. The levels are long, simple and boring
- No info about enemy health. No tactics. Just run and shoot
- Incredibly bad mechanic of gathering cash.
- Awful UI. I got stuck  several times because I didn't know what the game wanted me to do to start the next level
- the game was originally made for consoles. It lacks of depth in the gameplay.
- Levels are huge and were designed to be played in co-op. But noone plays this game right now.

fun little game but not good enough to try to get invested in it:

Pros:
-campaign is decently fun
-decent tower defence/action mix
-concept of trenches and it's customization is fun
-fun weapons
-game's writing, animations and quirks can give a few giggles
-dlc is included
-variety of enemies with unique function to each to deal with

Cons:
-completely empty multiplayer (unless you have a friend playing it and available)
-short lived (obviously)
-the Jacobs (enemy unit that make every other units around it invincinble until killed, will explain in the survival mode section why it is a travesty)
-survival mode (defend the base until it's destroyed vs infinite horde, each 5 turns finished gives a loot) has a very limited map choice: 
-1st decent map 
-2nd harder decent map
-3rd horrible map

and your run will always end because you'll get to a turn where they will spam the jacobs, meaning a guaranteed loss of every towers (there's camouflaged towers that enemies can't attack... but they're not enough to survive) and sudden complete destruction of the base's (or bases') health. (obviously can maybe be dealt with by changing your build, but then what is the point of trying to have fun if you have to switch from a build you have fun with to a boring one?)

-since survival mode is the obvious time sinker of this game, it's enjoyment can be set back by a whole lot, making the game boring very quickly

This is what I thought of the gameseveral months ago when I last played it. Everything was fun to do, worked as intended, and I found myself coming back over, and over again.

I have no clue if there's an issue with my install of the game, or if changes were made since I last played, but turrets practically do nothing, so I'm, losing missions left, and right, because I'm literally the only one doing the work. 

Turrets just randomly work, or don't, I've had cases where a turret will fire a single shot at something it couldn't possibly see yet, then freeze up, and the opposite, where something standing right in front of it doesn't trigger it to fire at all. I replayed the first mission of the game, and I almost lost, when I remember breezing through it fairly well. The turrets are broken, I don't know how, or why, but they flat out do not work anymore, so the game hase become unplayable, and unwinnable. 

I'm recommending the game because when I initially played it, it was fantastic, and I still love it. It's just the fact that the turrets do basically nothing anymore, so I have not been able to complete a single mission past when I last played.

tout d'abord je tient a prevenir qu'il est devenu impossible de jouer au jeux en multi a cause des cerveurs surement morts , c'est pourquoi si vous chercher un jeu simpas a faire avec vos amis passer votre chemins , mais  si vous n'avez pas d'amis et que vous amiez faire exploser des TV , alors vous aller aimez ce jeu.

-Points positifs :

-quelques soit vos choix d'equipement , le jeu reste très amussant a jouer

- grand nombre d'equipement (Mitrailleuses , Sniper , Canon d'artillerie , Shotgun , Lance grenade et meme des émeteurs d'ondes nocive pour les enemis ) vous pouvez egalement changer le chasis ou les pattes de votre tranchée mobile , pour cela plusieurs choix s'offrent a vous : 
(-)2 pattes : possibilitée de courir . 
(-)trois pattes : possibilitée de s'asoir sur la troisieme patte pour benéficier de bonus comme plus de pv et temps de rechargement des amres reduit de moitier.
(-)quatres pattes posssibilitée d'aséner des coup de pattes asomants 
et tous sont accesible très tot.


- Points negatifs :

-j'ai récement essayer de jouer avec un amis mais celui ci a été deconecter au bout de 2min , comme le jeu est vieux , les cerveurs qui ebergent les parties multi sont surment a l'abandon voir carement detruit du coup impossible de jouer a plusieurs. j'ai pourtant eu l'ocasion d'y jouer avec mes amis en multi il y a 2 ans et le jeu fonctionnais tres bien..",1518792923,1518792923,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,False,False,False,False,,,

(8 hours.) 

What this game has to offer: Riding a robot as the screenshots show. Enemies come at you, and you shoot them with guns you can customize. You can change the legs of your ""Trench"" including the chassis so you can put on different types of weapons, which are ranked in power by 1 to 3 slots. If a weapon has 1 slot, you can equip 3 of them on one side, if your chassis even allows you to. You also have different types of objects to place down, going from regular guns, to explosives, to healing or collecting scraps. What types of placements you can use, and how many of a specific type you can use, is dependent on your chassis. You have specific points to defend, of course. You have customizable clothing as well, so you can look any way you want in battle. You can play up to, I think either 4 or 5 people and there are different characters to choose from to play as. 

Problems: Well, honestly, I haven't really found any. 

My personal problems: The game keeps giving you weapons or clothing items one or two levels above the current level your at. This has been somewhat frustrating as I dont want to keep getting things I can't already use/wear. 

This next problem for me is also a bit of spoilers:

On the level right before Mars, (or technically the first level in the ""Mars"" section) the difficulty goes up a lot. The enemies have significantly more health than they did before, and I have failed on the first Mars mission 4 times. The paths they take to the points I have to defend are rather annoying, as well... and the worst part is, I have like 7 turrets defending one point and they haven't succeeded in doing anything but fuck all.

今となってはグラフィックがへっぽこな印象を受けるが、低性能なPCでもそれなりに動く、手堅く楽しめる一品といった印象だ。同時に4人まで遊べるのでフレンドと遊んでみてはいかがだろうか？

価格も手ごろで特に不満はない…と言いたいところだがいくつか。
■敵に砲撃がヒットしたときの効果音やエフェクトが控えめ…というか弱い武器だと　ない。　ないのだ。　なのでマシンガン等の射程がギリギリ届いてない状態で敵に攻撃がヒットしてないのに気が付かないで延々と無駄玉を打ち続けるということが結構ある。この辺、点滅程度でいいから何かしらエフェクトがほしかったところ。
■ロボのカスタム画面がわかりにくい。コアのスロットの状況等もUIが独自な感じでかなり見難い。慣れるまで大変。

FPSやTPSとミックスされたタワーディフェンスが好きな人ならおすすめできる作品だ。

In fact it feels like the world of Crimson Skies after a transmission game that changed everything, and through such the USA was re united, and world affairs came back into order between said transmission and WWII.

Now I'm often not one for Towar defense, but this game is a chunk of that, and honestly probably one of the first to do it well, and it stands up to this day. If you like that sort, you'll be at home here. If not, you still might find this is the game that makes it worth your while.

Gun shots feel meaty, a good audio effect to boot if something blasts too close to you and your hearing comes swiming back in slowly after the puckerd sounds die away. Few have done it better. Meanwhile the torrent of bullets, blasts of buckshot, sniper cannons, and said defening artillery all make you feel something when you pump it into the enemy as you stomp along in your fortified trench location mobilized by mechanized legs. After all this game was once called. TRENCHED back on the xbox 360, but for some odd reason the name had to be changed. I should look up why some day soon.

Wondering where the DLC for this game is? Why, it's included in your one time purchase these days! The adventure will continue into new frontiers you wouldn't expect the moment you thought you rid the Earth of the tube menace, the interesting threat born of mad science and the unknown is one you need not feel bad about thrashing, and there will be many varriants you will run into in your ventures that you'll be ushered across by a sailing and stomping aircraft carrier which will also be your lobby for you, friends, and others who still play the game to this day. But indeed if you have three friends, consider picking up the four pack.

Also survival mode seems to be all the rage these days. SO, you got that too! And it'll unlock new and un usual loot you may not find else where. Weapons and other goodies for you to enjoy. Even unlock some new looks for your Trench pilot by leveling up your rank through experience. I'm currently sporting an air tight suit with a gas mask, looking like I'm part of the Death Korps of Krieg.

If you like a lil bit of comedy with your monster smashing, and otherwise stomping around mechanized machines with massive guns and cannons, there's little reason for you to NOT try this game. The venture spans a good chunk of time with plenty of unlocks through a fun game of blowing up threats to mankind. Whatch your guns open, lock down with fresh ammo, and line up with your friends to deliver the next salvo of difference making booms.Even your quick dropable gun and tool emplacements will add to the fury and customizations along with the options in trech legs, chasis, and varried weapons and paint jobs to be unlocked.

Iron Brigade isn't awful, but it is nowhere near as polished as those other games I mentioned.  Controls are clunky, unskippable cutscenes drag down the tempo/flow of the game, and the game is hardlocked to 30 fps.  

To top it off, I only got to play about 30 minutes before the mouse completely stopped working in game.  I can see and move the cursor fine in menus, but the buttons don't work and the mouse doesn't do anything at all once past the menus.  I scoured the internet and there are only a hanful of support posts about a mouse not working, and they're all related to Games for Windows, which is not used in this version as far as I can tell. 

So, basically I got to play 30 minutes of a mediocre game and now I can't play at all.  Thumbs down.

It's not great, just good. It has a slow, boring, start that makes most people likely quit. A friend and I tried it out and it took us maybe two hours to get into it. It has so many avoidable issues, bad designs, that makes the game less user friendly and a tad overwhelming. Because there is so much thrown at you, the game has a very bad first impression. 

The game allows you to customize your mech, in this game called a ""Trench,"" customizing its core (body) that then allows you what emblacements (defense towers) in varrying types and quantities in trade off for various weapons sizes and quantities. You are able to pick from a healthy enough variety of weapons and can pick some really powerful weapons if you so choose to sacrifice emplacement options for it. You also can choose the legs of the ""Trench"" which gives varrying abilities that will accomodate some playstyles. 

There is not an overwhelming large variety of emplacements, there is maybe slightly more than ten. However, like the weapons, there is different variants of each emplacements from quality of weapons. For example, there is ""advanced"" versions of weapons or emplacements that need to be unlocked through progression (such as leveling up and earning money) to purchase it through the store the game has or getting it by chance in the so very common loot crates.

The weapons uses an inventory system which means if you want two of a weapon on your mech.... you need to own two. Some things however have no need to have multiple variants of, such as emplacements or cores, but you seem to be able to get them anyways which is always disappointing if you get them from loot drops. Also a negative point, the store makes it difficult for you to know what you already have, meaning you need to exist the store menu and check inventory just to be sure. 

The story is mediocre, it's not bad but not good, but it gets the job done. The story is more of an excuse for the gameplay, which is just fine considering many tower defense games, including Dungeon Defenders, do. The gameplay allows players to have more emphasis on emplacements or gun combat, something I think is a good design choice. The enemies are diverse and create many challenges I am sure in the late game that will need good team coordination. However, as of right now, the game is very easy and has virtually no challenges. 

The game has a bronze, silver, gold, grading system that grades you based on time. I am sure this will generate mild replay value, some gold scores being overwhelmingly low compared to our bronze finish which hints we are suppose to come back later with very good ""trench"" mechs. If it can keep our attention long enough for that, I am sure we will appreciate the something to do. I do think that such a system is bad design, nothing is more fun than playing with overwhelmingly powerful mechs on lower levels to complete trivial tasks just to finish a grade for your gold collection.


The game is far from perfect, I would argue it deserves a 7/10. It's enjoyable, just not for the default price. I am very glad I got it in a bundle long ago. Get it for under $10 with some friends, only then would I say it's worth it.",1502043823,1502043823,True,9,1,0.561304390430450439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a FPS Tower Defense game that puts you in the controls of a Trench which is just a mech. You fight agianst robot enemies created by a devious russian sicentist.  
The game play is really fun.  Running around shooting protecting your objetives.  You are able to build and upgrade towers during combat.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to pick up. I play on a controller by the way.  The mech mechanics are well thought out and add some strategy to the game. There are different types of cores.  Standard. Engineer, and Assault calss.  Based on those cores you have so many weapon slots and so many tower slots.   This is important depending on what kind of mission you are going on.  Your weapons are divided into left and right fire, this leads to you coming up with combinations of weapons for each side.  Like on one side you can have all machine guns, and on the other you can have a grenade launcher and a shotgun firing at the same time.    The levels are challenging but not infuriating.  You will havea good time and play them again trying hard to get your gold medals.

やたら安価だが、もともとXbox360でも売られたりしていたゲームで作りもしっかりしている。クオリティについては安心されたし。

タワーを設置しながら戦うことからTD要素が注目されやすいが、ぶっちゃけ序盤から性能の微妙さを感じることになるため、あまり某タイトルのような「TPSとTDの調和がある」とは考えない方が良いかもしれない。せいぜい対空をサポートさせたりするのが関の山。
しかし、その分と言ってはなんだが、プレイヤーの乗機である「トレンチ」の外観や組み換えに幅があり、ある程度眺めたり動かしたりしていて楽しいロボゲー的側面を持っている。上位互換パーツに組み替えていくと性能だけでなく見た目も変化し、積んである土嚢の数が増えたりしてワクワクする。泥臭い重機じみたスチームパンク兵器が好きならかなりハマるだろう。

フレーバーテキストやストーリーもバカゲーじみていて愉快で、基本的にジジイとジジイが繰り広げる大人げないケンカにオッサンたちが駆り出される展開になるのだが、いろいろな土地を転戦していくのでビジュアルの変化もあったりしてなかなか飽きない。エリアの最後にはボス戦なんかもあるので、戦いのメリハリがついていて面白い。

アメリカンジョーク満載のおっさんでスチームパンクなロボを駆り、各所の戦略拠点を守っていくタワーディフェンス兼ハクスラもどき
セール時最大90%OFFと非常にリーズナブルな値段設定と安さの割にかなり派手なエフェクトが視覚的にGood
装備はクリア・非クリアにかかわらず拾っていた場合マップ終了時に手に入れることができ、雰囲気はずっとギャグ満載でアバター要素はネタばっかりである

ただしタワーディフェンス要素はかなり疑問
というのも、他レビューであるカスタマイズ性の狭さもあるのだが、それより何より装備できる武装に対してタワーが弱すぎるのである。
火力面においてはリロードこそなくほぼ必中といえるほどの命中率はあるものの、同一レベル帯での装備品の5分の1～10分の1以下の火力しかなく、適正レベル帯ですら補助火力程度の火力しか出ない上少し高レベルのマップに行くとザコ敵の集団を倒すどころか削る役割すら満足に行えない。
耐久面においてはもっと絶望的で、一番射程の長いスナイパータレット系列ですら手持ち武器のマシンガン程度の射程しかない上に敵のタワー破壊ユニットに射程でも物量でも勝てないため一方的に破壊される。
コスト面は明らかに高すぎ（または初期コストが低すぎ）で、一番タワーコストが引かれるコアを使っても最初のウェーブで満足に防衛することができない。というよりまともなタワーを2個も作れればいい方で、仮に2個作っても前述の通り初期のラッシュすら満足に倒すことができない。タワーは強化することによって攻撃力が数倍に伸びる雑調整なのだが、いかんせんこのタワー強化コストも高すぎて、開幕に建てたタワーを強化するためにそのままタワーを増やさず2ウェーブほど耐える必要が出てきたりする上に、強化していたら別の場所は絶対に守れないため結局プレイヤーの力で9割方守ることになる。

こんなバランスのためタワー強化型の編成は早々に使い物にならなくなり、両側に3枠武器枠があるコアか、片側3枠片側2枠のコアの2択になる（ほぼ前者）。もはやタワーは安くて強化の必要がないスローか、狙いにくすぎて倒すのがめんどくさすぎる空中敵を倒すためのフラックか、ずっと後半に手に入る攻撃を当てるだけでコストを生産する「シュレッド」効果の付いたマシンガンか、回復用のリペアくらいしか持つ意味がない。
結果としてただのちょっとタワーが置けるだけの普通のTPSみたいになってしまい、それがタワーディフェンスとしては非常に疑問なのである。

TPSとしては前述の通り派手で大雑把で気軽に楽しめるため90%OFFならコスパは非常に良いといえる。

An alternate-history, post-WWI apocalypse, where a radio signal has created hordes of telivision-themed monstrocities that threaten humanity. And to combat them, Heavily-armed walking tanks, called Mobile Trenches, are invented and deployed to stop them.

I fucking LOVE mechs when they're walking tanks. Forget the Gundam mechas, this is the REAL good shit.

However, this game suffers. A lot.

First off, thanks to Games for Windows Live, this game has had a lot of problems pop up. The Removal broke the multiplayer, making it so that you can't connect with ANYONE online. (Or, at least, I haven't been able to.)

The entire game can be beaten by yourself, but it can be an uphill battle at times, and pretty frustrating.

The game also has no way to reset your progress in-game. If you want to reset your account and start from square one, tough luck, because ther'es basically no way to do so. There's SUPPOSEDLY ways to alter the game's files to reset your progress, but so far, none of the methods have worked for me, unfortunately.

The game also appears to be locked at 30 Frames per Second. This is mainly due to how the game's engine is set up. As a direct result of the engine, you can't manually unlock the framerate via the game's files, so you're kinda stuck there.

Those 3 1/2 problems can be kinda off-putting at times in the game, especially since there's no real replayability after you've beaten the game. If the multiplayer worked, I believe THAT would make this a much more replayable game, but thanks to Games Fucked by Windows Live, that's almost impossible, and the patch Double Fine put in hasn't seemed to fix it, either.

This game is good, don't get me wrong. It's a decent game that you could spend a long time playing, even in singleplayer. But you're not going to get the full value of the game due to the bugs left behind by Microsoft's terrible attempt at a PC gaming program.

It's a passable Tower Defense title set in an alternate timeline where World War 2 is waged between giant mecha and psychokinetic, electric monsters. Customization options are surprisingly deep: you can select a character, modify the chassis and weapons of your ""Trench"" (the bipedal walking tank that carries you into battle), and the selection of turrets you want available for construction on the field. The gameplay itself is shallow and poorly balanced. Iron Brigade, like many other Double Fine games conceived during Amnesia Fortnight, is a generic game too reliant on the classic Double Fine charm to appeal to gamers.

The most obvious comparison would be Dungeon Defenders, a game that offers similar gameplay mechanics, but with much more varied monster and level design. Unilke Dungeon Defenders, Iron Brigade hardly acknowledges the third dimension, with generally flat levels and straightforward monster pathing. Turrets are separated into offensive and support turrets. Weapon and turret progression is so poorly balanced that you can progress through much of the game with simply support turrets to slow monster advancement. Though the concept of combining Mechwarrior and Tower Defense is a fresh one, it's poorly executed. Was unable to test online capabilities as the player base is non-existent.

If you're looking for a 3D TD-Shooter hybrid, Dungeon Defenders II offers greater community, more robust gameplay, and a better pricepoint (it's Free-to-Play).

Un Tower Defense et un TPS, votre personnage à bord d'une sorte de ""mécha"" doit arrêter des hordes de monstres avant qu'ils ne détruisent les objectifs. Vous allez donc devoir choisir entres vos tourelles (4 maximum) et vos armes embarquées (6 emplacements maximum), le choix est cornélien et souvent crucial pour bien réussir une mission mais vous avez quand même la possibilité de l'adapter à votre style.

C'est un jeu avec des mécaniques rodées et l'univers est volontairement parodique (classique chez Double Fine). Passé la surprise du début, on s'adapte et on peut prendre du plaisir.

La progression se fait à l'aide de points d'expériences et de butins. Chaque arme ou module possède un niveau, il faut que votre personnage ai au moins ce niveau pour l'utiliser. Il est donc parfois utile de refaire quelques missions plus faciles pour obtenir de l'expérience et/ou du matériel (on peux aussi en acheter mais le choix est restreint) et ainsi réussir des étapes plus délicates (notamment l'obtention des médailles d'or).

Les trois premières campagnes ne sont pas trop difficiles et peuvent se faire quasiment d'une traite, par contre la quatrième m'a semblée plus coriace et j'ai donc refait toutes les missions pour obtenir un niveau d'équipement suffisant (et toutes les médailles).

La durée de chaque mission est de l'orde de 10-20 minutes, les combats de Boss sont beaucoup plus rapides (quelques minutes). On peut donc facilement caser une partie.

That aside, this game is one of the most solid productions Double Fine has managed to offer; Gameplay is very energetic and hectic, there's plenty of variety to build/pilot the kind of robot you want to play, and the enemies have a decent variety that take a combined arms approach. That said, in general the game is fairly accessible, if slightly difficult if attempted in low numbers of players.

Since it went through the GFWL grindmill at some point, then later got converted to Steam multiplayer, I can't be too certain of the stability multiplayer; It's worked fine for me in the past but it's also failed me, in part due to instability in foreign connections, I can only assume. One of the updates after that claimed that the netcode was fixed, but most of my friends only had a passing interest.

The gameplay is simple, has flaws, and definitely isn't the BEST shooter/tower defence hybrid out there, but what little it lacks in the gameplay department the game more than makes up for in charm. The setting is portrayed well in a way that, while it acts seriously enough to not be offputting, never forgets the fact that it is a videogame about a bunch of ww2 or so era soldiers riding around in giant robots shooting evil television demons constructed by what is basically the equivilent of a hammy golden age comic book villain.

One of the game's most important and coolest features is customization. Since you're riding around in a mech, you can change your weapons and turrets using a ""slot"" based system. Each mech has a certain number of weapon slots and a certain number of gear slots, meaning some machines will have loads of weapons but almost no tower variety, while others will pack only one or two smaller weapons but have hordes of towers that they can place more cheaply and easily. All of the various cores, legs, and weapons change the way your machine looks, so you get a real sense of actually changing your stuff around. The mission select screen is set up to encourage this as well, pulling everybody in your multiplayer party onto the same boat HUBworld, so that you can walk around the ship, looking at and talking about what everyone is customizing and packing while hearing about the mission objectives.

If you are a massive fan of tower defense games, something you should know before buying is that while towers are important, there's much more focus on the shooting aspect in this game. This game has no mazing, there is no way to alter the enemy paths so if you really enjoy tower defenses for the ability to strategically manipulate your enemies' path, you will find absolutely none of that here. Instead the tower strategy consists of finding somewhere safe to put your turrets so that they wont get destroyed easily while hitting as large a range as possible.

So the final question would be whether or not it is worth your money and your time to get this game, and I'd say that absolutely yes it is. So long as you don't mind the absence of certain tower defense mechanics, Iron Brigade is a charming if very slightly dated take on the genre that is solid and obviously had a lot of love put into it by the developpers.

Tower Defense c вашим участием от третьего лица. Вы должны защищать стратегические объекты, сами при этом управляете механической платформой оснащенной ногами и пушками, пулеметами. Дополнительно можно ставить турели. 
По мере прохождения выпадают и открываются новые орудия, турели, детали вашего «меха». Играть можно в четвером. 

Первые две локации с уровнями мрачно темные, потом на тихом океане и на Марсе становиться жизнерадостней. Сюжет есть, авторы явно что-то курили, вместо с броадкастом. 
Концовка на Марсе не понравилась, какие-то анти-Русские намеки пошли. Неужели нельзя сделать игру без внесения политических взглядов?

Что еще не понравилось, передышка между волнами секунд 10 за это время не всегда успеваешь сообразить где турель поставить. Турели привязываются к вашему меху (Не понятно зачем так сделано). Чем больше у вас слотов для оружия тем меньше слотов для турелей, хотя я не понял каким местом они относятся к вашему меху, их с корабля поддержки засылают. 
Для того, что бы ставить турели надо собирать высыпающиеся кинескопы (я понял что это именно они), они видимо превращаются в железо для турелей :-). На самом деле Мех двигается не шустро и бегать собирать некогда. На мой взгляд тут можно было бы упростить процесс давая кредиты за убитых врагов. 

В конце каждой локации Босс.  Перед началом уровня вам дается вводная и предупреждают какие орудия лучше брать. 

После каждого уровня вы возвращаетесь на корабль идете к голове генерала и получаете новое задание. Беготня под конец утомляет. 

Часто в начале уровня, в конце или перед очередной волной идут сюжетные вставки, с не особо содержательными диалогами. Которые никак пропустить нельзя. И если первый раз еще ничего, то после нескольких перезапусков уровня это вымораживает. 
Особого интереса в том, что ты на мехе нет. Вы громко топаете и не можете прыгать :-). Сами  мехи прорисованы не очень. 

В целом игра для 2012 года нормальная, но особо не впечатлила. Графика средняя красот в локациях нет. Игру кое как допроходил и возвращаться к ней не буду. Sanctum 2 в многом выигрывает у IB. 
Широкой массе не рекомендую, а любителям TD можно посмотреть по скидке. 
Но если в не знаете Sanctum 2, лучше идите срочно знакомиться. Сюда успеете.

Iron Brigade is a game developed by Double Fine Productions and moves very differently from it's original cute point and click adventure games and takes on a wave based tower defense game with a sort of interesting story

The game at first is fun to play and with the addition of co-op makes it ten times as better, however, for me personally after three hours into the game playing mostly singleplayer, since not many people seem to play the multiplayer portion and I have no friends, it got kind of repetitive and boring

The game is split into Europe, Africa and The Pacific and all you need to do is place turrets and protect your base from alien creatures after a certain amount of waves (usually 15 waves) you win. After a while it can get repetitive and very very boring

And that is what made me stop playing Iron Brigade, the constant tower defence and wave based gameplay gets very boring after a while

Iron Brigade is a mixed bag to me, it is getting a recommend it because it is a fun little indie game to play but it can get boring after a while. Iron Brigade is only recommended if you like tower defence/wave based game or you are a fan of Double Fine Production and their games

Plus, the game is locked at 30FPS, why? Have no idea why...

[b]Released:[/b] 2011 (Xbox Live Arcade), August 2012 (GFWL & Steam)

Indie budget hybrid Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter with a very appealing post World War I alternate history setting, where players have to defend the world against the deadly ""Broadcast"" by defending various installations and eventually taking the fight to end the ""Monovision"" threat, stomping about in mechanized battle trenches shooting guns and placing turrets to defeat a wide variety of cool looking ""TV and Radio"" themed enemies.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list][*]Very competent action tower defense gameplay.
[*]A lot of mobile trench customization options where you can mount up to three different weapons on each attack button, or if you prefer traditional tower defense, sacrifice gunpower for cheaper and larger selection of turrets.
[*]I love a good setting, and Iron Brigade has it!  Awesome 'pulp alternate history post-WWI' design and overall art style, crammed with attitude and goofiness.
[*]Up to 4 player online co-op.  If you got the friends for it and can get it working, probably THE best crafted and most fun to play co-op tower defense you can find.
[*]For a long time after Steam release and after GFWL requirements were patched out of the game, the developers were very active in the community gathering feedback and letting the players know they were working on fixes for technical issues.  I LOVE seeing this, and wish more developers were as involved as these guys.
[*]Full controller support
[*]Steam version includes a nice DLC 'expansion' in which you travel to Mars, free of charge![/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]Game is locked to 30 frames per second.  Impossible to unrestrict.
[*]While playable in single player, IB is clearly not designed for it and most of the time is spent sprinting between lanes before defense points are destroyed
[*]Online connectivity is a MESS.  This is a huge drawback as this is what the game is designed for, yet starting a game with 3 or 4 players is in my own experience 100% impossible without disconnects.  Some say they've had some success with it, but me and my friends were far from alone in not getting this game to work, AT ALL.  Playing with 2 players is slightly less disconnect prone but even then I see occational disconnects during levels.
[*]Despite working on the above point and many others for a long time, DF were never able to fully fix a number of technical problems with IB, most important being the co-op disconnect issue.
[*]DF then posted a check list of improvements they had made to the game and declared everything fixed, and that they were done.  An obvious lie right in our faces, and IB sits in the Steam store to this day pretending everything is great.  Such a disappointment seeing this after they had done such a good job being on the level with the community about the ongoing attempts to fix their game.[/list]

In summary this game has a lot of things going for it and is possibly the best co-op TD action you can get, [b]IF[/b] you can get that to work.  The online connectivity problems this game has and Double Fine's dishonesty claiming this was resolved is why this game lands on a thumbs down, from me.",1459277371,1475578099,False,72,8,0.556666374206542969,19,True,False,False,False,,,

So you have to choose between having a good mech, and only one type of tower, or 3-4 towers and a mech that can't put a dent in the weakest  enemys in the game.

It's pretty good overall, though none of the aspects are at their sharpest. There's interesting and varied loot, plenty of customisation for your mech and a variety of enemies and battle scenarios.

Unfortunately, there is one significant misstep. This is a game built around a degree of repetition if not grinding for loot, XP and better results which by itself is fine. However, it contains unskippable dialogue and cutscenes. Something which was amusing the first time around is less so the second and third, and downright grating after that.

Thankfully you can get through at least the main campaign without grinding much. It might be a bit more of an issue if you want to finish the DLC or Survival mode, but you should well and truly get your money's worth before that.",1457218956,1457218956,True,4,0,0.561546564102172852,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What is the gameplay?

Well, you are in a mobile 'Trench' that can hold weapons on it. There are different ""Chassis"" which give you a certain amount of weapon slots on each side. A ""big"" chassis gives you 3 weapon slots on each side. A medium would give 2. A small would give you 1. Certain weapons take certain amount of slots. A machine takes 1 while a artillery will take all 3 on the one side. Snipers take 2 slots. Also, the weapons get stronger as you progress in the game, some getting ""special"" abilities. For example, an artillery that has shock, which stuns the monovision. Second thing is there are turret slots. Like machine gun turrets, Sniper turrets, land mines etc. they each take a slot and depends on what type of slot. There is a support, light, and heavy slot. Snipers and land mines are heavy, machine guns and shotgun turrets are light, a support would be a repair crane, Dampening Genarator, or a Magnet prong. 


What am i fighting? 

They are called monovisions. Essentially, its kind of like an alien life form, but look allot like electricity and blue wires. There are unique monos that target certain things, or attack in certain ways.

All in all, i bought this game out of Nostalgia (i think thats how you spell it) and dont regret it at all. the game has replayability for the achievements, loot to find, and even has survival mode. *Kinda like Zombies on Call of booty* how long can you last. You even get loot from the survival mode. There are 3 survival maps from what i know. I got to 56 on one, 76 on another, and my favorite map, i got to 100.

Truly, if you are into strategy, and want to use defences and even your own trench to protect a building, drill, or gun. Then you arent far from finding an amazing game.

Это игра в стиле ""башни"", где вам придётся много стрелять от первого лица. Интересный сюжет, хоть и коротковат на мой взгляд. Всю игру мы будем сражаться на боевой тарантайке-полуроботе с монстрами телевещания, ведь главный герой задумал захватить всю планету при помощи радио-телевещания.

Плюсы:
Оригинальна идея бэкстори
оригинальная идея выпадения ресурсов на поле боя
Интересные боевые персонажи, как твои, так и вражеские
Не плохая система прокачки, оружия, персонажа, ваших ходулей и башен.

Недостатки:
Ваши башни без вас ни когда не справятся с возложенными на них задачами (если только не вернуться на несколько уровней назад, когда прокаченые башни порвут вся и всё)
Коротка история всехо 20 игровых карт. 3 основных миссии (в европе, африке и океании) и одна дополнительная (на марсе). В каждей миссии 4 карты типа защити базу/ы и одна типа убей боса.
Мало карт в мультилеере - всего три карты. 
Мёртвый мультиплеер, нйти игроков в мультиплеере очень тудно. Вообще это болещнь всех игр издательства DubbleFine, у них мёртвые мультиплееры, которые ни кто и ни когда не поддерживает.
И последний, критический недостаток, по крайней мере для меня. Главный герой он такой канонический негодяй - русский. С таким эпическим акцентом (как у Мутко, еред олимпиадой: ...Лэт ми спик фром май хард...), бородой, храмом василия блаженного с красной площади и конечно же с медведем (в которого потом переселится главный злодей). Увидев всё это остаётся только сделать фейспалм. Не знаю, как остальным, а мне не нравится, когда мою страну и меня вместе с ней выставляют такими вот исчадиями ада.

Итого:
Интересная задумка и неплохо реализованная игра, но очень короткая и с мёртвым мультиплеером в которой предстоит бороться со злыми русскими. Игра которую после прохождения придётся забыть и выкинуть.

PRO'S:
Game has a moderate amount of content for a $15.00 2-Gig Game.
While there are some games out there that are just as interesting that are
cheaper, it's hard to find a good Mecha game on steam (I've Tried) it's even
harder to find one that you can play with your Mecha Finatic Friends.
The game ran decently well on a 4-Year Old Gaming Laptop.
You can use WASD+Mouse or Joystick if you like, Reccomend (Thrustmaster)
There is a lot of subtle but very amusing humor that helps push the story along.

CON'S:
$15.00 is kind of up there for a 4-Year old game, so if you can catch it on sale
like I did (90% OFF) and get it for you and a half dozen of your friends that's great!
Sometimes the Multiplayer Aspect does experience Lag or a Disconnection but I have
friends all around the world, so that is subjective to my situation possibly.

[h1]About the game:[/h1] (spoileralarm)
[spoiler]You are a marine standing in a big ass walking killer machine fighting on different maps against all kinds of electrical aliens defending your base or bases. On some maps you also need to attack the aliens and kill a boss.

Between the missions you are on the ship modifying your trench (the thing you are walking around with), adding friends to your game/joining other games and choosing your next mission.

[b]Modifying your trench:[/b]
There is a level system which grants you to use specific items. There are a lot of items like many different types of legs, chassis, weapons and towers. All of them are also available with different abilities. Of course you can also change the color and the look of your trench and your marine.

[b]Adding friends/joining other games:[/b]
The multiplayer system works good. You can add your friends on steam and join random games. You might join games with people on a much higher level so with much more difficult missions. And from time to time (maybe once per hour) the game looses the connection to the lobby. The maximum number of players in a lobby is 4.
When you are in the lobby you can see the other players and their trenches on the ship and together you can discuss the next mission or whatever.

[b]Choosing your mission:[/b]
There are different areas with different maps you can choose from. Furthermore there are some survival maps where you fight as long as you can. But all in all I would like to have more maps in the game.

[b]Enemys:[/b]
Like there are many different enemys (fast and small, flying, heavy) there are also items effective against the different enemys. So you always need to check the equipment you and your teammates are using for the missions.[/spoiler]

Besides replaying levels the game isn't half bad.

Iron Brigade is a FPS tower defense game similar to Dungeon Defenders, Sanctum, and Orc Must Die to name a few.   You control a character on a map, the camera is in 3rd person, you have the ability to place towers and traps, and you can also directly engage the enemy.  If this all sounds par for the course, that is because it is.  That isn't to imply that this is a bad game, it just doesn't do much that is different.

For the most part, the only thing that this game has over other games in this genre is charm. And this can be seen in its visuals, VO, animations (saluting is hilarious), and the general game's setting.  

I know a lot of people like to use the saying that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but in this case, you can for this game. Watch a trailer or two, and if you enjoyed what you saw, then you'll probably enjoy playing this game. However, if the style doesn't grab you, than there isn't much that the game will do that change your opinion.

In the end Iron Brigade is a competent  FPS TD game. And as such it has the same things going for and against it. I personally found myself getting fed up with the game about half way in, when the game's design started to show that the maps were design for multiplayer (big maps, lots of spawn points, and defense mission objects). And given the game's age and popularity, I wasn't able to find any random people to play with. However, even with that being said, I still enjoyed the game, to the point where I feel that other people would enjoy this game too... well, they would enjoy it for a bit.",1448916486,1448916486,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

ข้อดี + จุดเด่น
 - เลือกเล่นได้ทั้งแบบ Tower Defense หรือ Action + Third-person Shooter ในเกมเดียวกัน 
 - หุ่นรบสามารถปรับแต่งได้ตามใจชอบ ซึ่งแต่ละแบบก็จะส่งผลกับการเล่นที่แตกต่างกันออกไป
 - ศัตรูในเกมก็มีหลากหลายประเภทด้วยกัน ซึ่งแต่ละตัวก็มีลักษณะเด่น ความสามารถและพฤติกรรมที่แตกต่างกันออกไป ทำให้เกมมีความยากในตัวเอง
 - สามารถเล่นแบบ Co-op ได้มาถึง 4 คนอีกด้วย เพิ่มความยากและความเพลิดเพลินไปพร้อมกัน
 - ความยากของเกมนี้ ก็อยู่ในระดับที่กำลังดี ไม่ยากหรือไม่ง่ายจนเกินไป
 - สำหรับการเล่นแบบ Campaign นอกจากนี้ยังมีด่านให้เราเล่นเยอะพอประมาณไม่สั้นหรือยาวจนเกินไป
 - เครื่องสเปคต่ำก็น่าจะเล่นได้สบาย เพราะมันเป็นเกมที่ค่อนข้างจะเก่าแล้ว และไม่ต้องการสเปคสูงมากมาย

ข้อเสีย
 - สำหรับคนที่คาดหวังว่าเราจะสามารถแต่งหุ่นยนต์ได้เท่ๆแบบ Gundam เลิกฝันไปเลย เพราะลักษณะของหุ่นมันใกล้เคียงของ Front Mission มากกว่า และเป็นแบบที่ไม่มีหัวของหุ่น เพราะเรานั่งขับอยู่
 - การเคลื่อนไหวของหุ่นมันจะกึ่งๆผสมกับรถถัง คนที่เล่นเกมแนว FPS + Action มาจนชิน อาจจะตะหงิดเล็กน้อยเวลาเล่น และที่สำคัญหุ่นของเรากระโดด หรือบินไม่ได้!
 - คนที่คิดว่าจะซื้อไปเล่น แล้วหาเพื่อนเอาดาบหน้า อย่าซื้อ เพราะคุณคงจะไม่เจอคนเล่นหรอก! แต่ถ้าคุณซื้อพร้อมกับเพื่อนก็จัดไป และสำหรับคนที่คิดจะซื้อแล้วเล่นคนเดียว ก็โอเคอยู่ เพียงแต่ว่าอาจจะสนุกไม่เท่ากับการเล่นแบบ Co-op เพราะการเล่นแบบ Co-op จะยากกว่า
การเล่น Co-op กับคนที่ระดับสูง หรือไอเทมที่ดีกว่า อาจจะทำให้เกมนั้นดูน่าเบื่อ ผู้เล่นที่ Co-op กันควรจะอยู่ในระดับใกล้เคียงกันกับผู้เล่นด้วยกัน และด่านที่กำลังเล่น
 - สำหรับคนที่เน็ตไม่ค่อยดี แล้วคิดจะเล่นออนไลน์ ก็ไม่ควรจะเล่น เพราะถ้าระหว่างที่เล่นอยู่ เกิดเราหลุดขึ้นมา เราก็จะกลับเข้าไปเล่นในเกมนั้นอีกไม่ได้อีกแล้ว ถึงแม้ว่าเพื่อนของเราจะยังอยู่ในห้องนั้นก็ตาม",1448535091,1448535091,True,2,0,0.538202345371246338,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I quickly snatched it on discount for under $4 during the 2015 mid year sale. Definitely worth more than that!

It's a wonderful coop experience. I'll never forget all the times the game crashed with authentication state error on each start-up when organising a game with sauce and trash. We'd all go crazy, revalidating Steam cache files, restarting Steam, restarting the PC. In some cases the game would crash sauce's PC. trash and I would be like, ""sauce you still there?"" as we watch his Mumble name disappear off the screen a few seconds later in dismay.  

Sometimes we'd hit over wave 30 and for some reason sauce decided that it would be a good idea to unplug his Ethernet cable from the back of his PC. Who'd knew the game would be smart enough to detect that and show a message!? Meanwhile trash came up with this brilliant theory ... we must all press the ready button within 2 seconds of a mission launch in order to stop these connection problems. I guess ... sometimes it worked ...?

Essentially this game is a 3rd person mechwarrior (trench) tower defence genre. There is a levelling up system with item drops to enhance your trench as you progress through the campaign and survival modes. You can customise the chassis to standard, assault or engineer. The chassis differs mainly by how much emplacement (towers) slots you can take, the amount of weapons you can arm yourself with, the costs to build the emplacements and speed at which you move. All in all we figured out that for a team of 3 players, it's good to have 1 engineer and 2 assault.

There is some really classy Charlie Chaplin style humour with the characters. Dynamic lighting and weather. And a very generous amount of survival maps ... three in total. Thanks devs. Each map was fun whilst it lasted, but with all those tubes collected with the collection prongs, sad everything had to end at wave 100.

Had great fun figuring out the strategies cooperatively. There is some history to be dug up in the very tiny community. You'll find tips and tricks like knob traps, tactics and the best loadout for your trench. I would rate this game something like an 8.3 out of 10.

In  a world overrun by the Broadcast and its evil minions called Tubes (TVs, in fact), the last line of defense is brave soldiers fighting in trenches (mechs).

The game features a fairly lengthy campaign mode, where each level consists of defeating a set number of enemies while defending key targets. At the player's disposal are its trusty trench, and emplacements - autonomous units that will provide offensive, defensive or support aid. AKA, your towers.

The trench itself is highly customizable. You have a choice between core elements: the chassis and the legs, with each providing different abilities and possibilities. Double Fine did a mighty fine job on balancing each build. There's no ultimate trench, no ultimate loadout. Instead, a certain loadout will make you blast through some levels, while on others it'll cost you your victory. The core gameplay encourages experimentation with many kinds of light and heavy weaponry, short- or long-ranged, etc. New enemy types are introduced at a constant rate. Just when you think you've got it all, some shiny new Tube appears forcing you to adapt your strategy to it.

There's also survival mode, which is very fun to play, and the ultimate way to test your winning loadout. And, of course, multiplayer.

Unfortunately, my computer is barely capable of running it with quite a bit of lag, and it's very fast-paced, so I can't really give this game the full trying-out it deserves.

However, from what I was capable of playing, the interface was absolute shit, and the controls were a little clunky (a bit of that was from the lag, though, but not that much) both of which seem like they stem from the game being designed for console controlers rather then keyboard and mouse. The actual gameplay, however, was quite fun, though it seems like it takes some getting used to. In particular, the game is very fast paced for a tower defense (the first wave, from the two levels I played not counting the tutorial, seems to always spawn immediately or nearly immediately upon starting the level, and there was very little time to gain your bearings between waves. I don't know how much of this was lag, however) added a nice, hectic pacing that really drew me in, though was not very conducive to strategic planning. It would probably be easier with multiple people, with at least one shooting and one planting turrets, and it did kinda seem like the game was really pushing me towards playing with multiple people, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how many friends you have. A minimap also wouldn't have been misplaced in this game, and seems like an odd omission that I found myself instinctively looking for.

Overall, it's a fun second-person shoot-em-up game with some tower defense aspects thrown in. I would say it's worth the $15 if you like those kinda games. Especially if it's on sale, or if you have friends to play with.

Customize your mech (known as trench) and go out into the field to defend the objective. Iron Brigade combines the 3rd person shooter combat with the classic tower defence gameplay of strategically placing turrets of various kinds to help you make a stand.

There is a large variety of enemies, which are introduced bit by bit throughout the campaign, ranging from fast fliers to slow yet durable Big Willies, to suicidal Blitzers, and hordes of spiky balls known as the Knobs. Each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore you are required to outfit your trench with optimum weaponry for each mission in order to be effective. Most of the enemy designs were pretty creative and had a sort of personality.

I've played throughout the whole game solo. The early missions are fairly easy, but latter ones do pose a substantial challenge and might require several tries to get your strategy up to perfection. It's fun if you like a challenge. The game also has a handful of boss fights, so to speak. They do feel kind of different and out of touch with the rest of the gameplay though, especially the final boss of the original campaign.

There were some small annoyances, like there being too little time in between the waves and cutscenes/dialogue not being skippable (not that I've found anyway), but other than this, it was fine.

I didn't realise there was also an expansion act to the game, called 'Rise of the Martian Bear'. After playing the first mission, I'm a bit disappointed with it. It seems co-op play is encouraged much more here than solo play (so I might have to try them out on co-op), not to mention a strange lag that wasn't present in any of the previous missions. You also get some survival missions where you fight an endless horde of enemies.

It has Mech, its a tower defence game with a progression and customisation options. You can build to your playstyle, tower heavy or gun blazing, ignoring most tower options.

Overview: Third Person Tower Defense 


The Good:

+ The main feature of the game is that you can customize a mech in a variety of different ways. First you choose the chassis which allows you to carry more weapons or tower placements (but not both) . Then you choose the type of weapons you want to use: machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles etc. More powerful guns require more weapon slots. Then you choose the type of towers you want. Different maps require different load outs. Experimenting with different weapons and towers is part of the fun.  

+ Plenty of weapons and towers that can be bought or found 

+ Lots of enemies that require you to change up your tactics, some enemies target your towers, other target you etc. 

+ Killing enemies and completing levels allows you to level up allowing you to use more powerful weapons and towers

+ Good voice acting

+ Full controller support

+Coop

+Removed GWFL


The Average:


Maps that require only one area to defend can feel repetitive because the basic strategy never really changes.   

Big difficulty spike in the last few maps 


The Bad:

- multiplayer/coop is dead and thus completing certain achievements will be hard

Conclusion:

A fun if not short tower defense game that focuses more on third person shooting than actual tower placement. A fun diversion.

A budget title, and yet it's one of the most solid and enjoyable things I've played in years. A seriously excellent and gleefully imaginative third person shooter that I haven't seen the like of since Planet Moon's days. 

Only got a few criticisms really - a way to save custom loadouts for your Trench (what they call the mechs) would be appreciated. Because switching between my Selker Mk 1 and the Karlsson is a little annoying - though attaching the guns is always pretty satisfying (props to whoever was in charge of sound design).

Dans le style tower defense/TPS, le jeu se pose là. Ce jeu m'a pas mal rappelé un autre du même genre qui avait de plus jolis graphisme, de meilleurs effets sonore et qui prenait plus le parti du tower que du TPS et ce jeu est ... ah zappé le nom ... bon je vais chercher ça ... évidemment c'était à la fin de ma liste ... donc Sanctum qui est mieux en tout point à mon goût. Là iron brigade est pas mal, mais très très brouillon.

Il n'y a pas de vue tactique, superrrr pratique pour poser des tourelles ou des champs de mines, souvent je passe les premier instant à voir par où arrive vraiment les ennemis avant de poser mes premiers modules histoires qu'ils soient bien placés car même la map de briefing est pas top ...

Bon sinon on peut dire quelque chose de positif c'est que la personalisation et le loot sont vraiment important dans le jeu. C'est un point positif alors soulignons-le. En effet il sera bien difficile pour quelqu'un ne jurant que par le bourrinage pur et dur de terminer une map sans poser un seul module, se sera moins casse tête c'est sur car du coup le scrap metal des ennemis ne sert à rien et donc plus besoin de se précipiter dessus, mais ça complexifie énormément les choses quand on doit défendre des objectifs, soit 95% du jeu. Les seuls moments où l'on passe en full bourrin c'est pour les boss, c'est tout.

Il est vraiment dommage que les tourelles ne puissent pas être posées via une vue tactique et que l'on est obligation de déplacer son mecha jusque là où l'on souhaite en voir une, c'est complètement stupide puisque ce n'est pas notre mecha qui construit la tourelle mais juste qui demande un déploiement dans une zone. S'ils avaient un peu plus copier sur le voisin j'aurai vraiment donner une meilleure recommandation car le jeu aurait gagné en clarté et en lisibilité sur le champs de bataille, mais non, ils ont voulu faire à leur sauce et finalement ça ne prend pas.

Donc je vous le recommande, à petit prix, à petite dose et surtout à jouer entre amis en coop afin d'y trouver un peu de fun car en solo c'est ennuyant au possible.",1435260306,1435260306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It spans many of my favorite genres, has plenty of content, co-op! I will just list things :)

[b]Why this compelled me[/b]
* Tower-defense, more so when playing single
* Shooter, more so when playing multiplayer
* Mech-game with customization; weapons, chassi, legs, towers, paintjob
* Character progression, challenges, achievements, all doable without much grind outside of completing the game.
* Customizable player character, only cosmetic, but fun when running around in the lobby before starting a multiplayer game.

[b]What impressed me[/b]
* The multiplayer lobby is the same as single player, other people just loads up in the empty slots on your ship. It's great design really, and you can look at other people's mechs and gesture at their characters :)
* Anyone you have invited to a multiplayer game ends up in your regiment, which has separate challenges to complete, it just happens automatically and it's kind of great :o
* All customization on your mech and character are visible immediately in game, has custom animations and models, so nice :3

[b]What I found interesting[/b]
* Many of your towers can actually be killed, and they are not at all used to build labyrinths, you cannot block enemies with towers. It's just different :)
* The whole game design seems built around quirky humor, at first it's quite odd but after a while I just ran with it. Game mechanics sold me on the experience.

[b]What I missed/issues[/b]
* An overhead map, on some symmetrical levels it can be really tricky to know where you've placed towers, makes for quite a bit of running around. It does make sense though as the player characters probably do not have any radar och satellite to provide map data.
* In the shop I would love to see if I actually own an item already, especially the cosmetics for the marine, it's a minor gripe but it felt like an obvious feature.
* Playing during a summer sale makes Steam a bit glitchy, several times one or several were disconnected from Steam during multiplayer which boots them from the game. Sadly you cannot rejoin, this was kind of annoying in Survival which can take 1-2 hours depending on your success. There were no issues while the USA was asleep though.
* Some maps have places where you can get stuck, and you cannot jump or even walk over very low  walls, this is pretty annoying when it happens. But then I always try to get to places I'm not supposed to go :x
* I took me a while to realize why this felt exactly like playing on a console, I think the game is locked to 30 fps, which is kind of a bummer when using a 120Hz monitor.

All in all I was very impressed by this game, I was looking for another tower defense game, saw this in a short clip on YouTube, and kept an eye out during a summer sale.

+ cartoonish steampunk graphic style makes it looks nice for its age
+ visual during firefights is satisfying
+ loadouts offer different playstyle

+ player progression is a plus, something to work for

+ gameplay is entertaining, more in co-op play
+ removed GFWL

[h1]The Between:[/h1]
+/- shop and credit system
+/- game difficulty gears toward casual style hybrid TD
+/- good, but annoying player response during gameplay

[h1]The Negative:[/h1]
- too short, lack of survival mode for each story mission.
- difficulty scaling is too easy in co-op missions with experienced TD players.
- the half-baked loadouts management kills the purpose of shop and credit system
- not bad, but clunky interfaces here and there, could use improvement

The Mixture of Tower Defense and Gunning a Mech is just great. And its even implemented very well.
If u want Fire Power on your Mech, u got to sacrifice heavy Turrets and the other way round.
Speaking of which, I think there could be even more Chassis with different Turret loadouts and Weapons.
Cant actually remember which combination it was i wished for during Playtime, but well, you might encounter the very same wish during playthrough. So lets say its a feature of the game, since u have to adapt to the possible choices and loadouts to figure out a good strategy to beat the later (and harder) maps.

Unfortunately u will have to do quite some grinding now and then for leveling and upgrades, but it also offers ways to experiment different approaches on same maps.

Действие происходит в альтернативной истории в сеттинге дизельпанк, где оказывать противодействие злодею и его армии, по среди всеобщего упадка, нужно будет используя шагающие механические сооружения - мобильные траншеи, которые с некоторыми допущениями можно назвать роботами, а роботов я люблю!

Собственно о геймплее, здесь он динамичный и сбалансированный, но сразу вызывает недоумение отсутствие уровней сложности или же я их в упор не заметил. Робот в игре всего один - тот, который вы сами скомпонуете из предоставленных модулей корпуса, вооружения и сооружений-башен, все-таки это тауэр дефенс, все детали открываются по мере прохождения игры, получения новых уровней и имеются в действительно обильном количестве. 
Определенных рамок в процессе создания робота нет, есть только предпосылки к выбору отдельных частей, в зависимости от миссии и набора противников (их здесь то же не мало видов!), но соблюдение этих рамок далеко не обязательно, как принято говорить: ""Что хотите, то и творите"".

Помимо, на мой взгляд, достаточно продолжительной сюжетной компании здесь есть миссии на выживание, где можно получить уникальные детали. Учитывая кооперативную направленность игры, так же в наличие различные средства индивидуализации, такие как краска для робота, предметы одежды для солдата и жесты, всего этого то же достаточно. Если говорить о графике, она консольная, все в меру детализированно и роботы и локации и визуальные эффекты, но без излишеств и некстгена. 

В заключении не большое замечание о коопе, на момент написания обзора я играл в него три раза и заметные лаги были только в первый раз, когда стояли самые высокие настройки графики, в последующие разы я убрал тени и лаги практически исчезли.

Essentially a tower defense game, but not so much in the sense ""you"" may think. You control a walking WWII mecha with a variety of WWII and retro-like futuristic fantasy (WWII imagination) weaponry assortments ranging from machine guns, to sniper rifles, to futuristic ""radar"" like microwave guns and more. Towers to an extent are important, but this game focuses more on what YOU must do as the player/mecha, which you control. The main damage you do, is from the mecha and the assortments of weapons that you attach on it. As turrets are generally piss poor at dealing damage, and if you choose to ONLY use turrets, it can only carry you through the first level. As with later levels, it becomes more and more challenging, making you, the mecha/player and your strategy and weaponry, your involvement first hand more important. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

- Mecha WWII machines of war

- A lot of customization options

- Really fun grinding for rare items and customizable clothes, weapons and paint jobs

- Stupidly easy to play

- Learning curve is on the softer side

- Beefs up and becomes harder appropriately near the end 

- Co-op

- Replay value is good

- Amazing graphics, the main advertisement screenshots do not do it justice

- Got the hang of the game in about 4 missions (learned how to play that is)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Tutorial for me at least, threw me off a little

- Wish they had more missions

- About 4 different campaigns, with 4 to 6 missions in each

- Co-op can get a little laggy at times

- Replay value is cut short after you acquire all rare items and complete all missions and survival missions on gold

- Wish they had even “more” weapons

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

I am simply aghast, amazed that this game isn't more popular. The graphics are great, the missions are fun, replay value is huge (especially co-op) and the price is cheap and out of this world. The ONLY reason this game doesn't have a lot more popularity and was put into the gutter and I did some research into this. Is, as I saw some other reviewers comment about this, and I did not understand what they were talking about. So bear with me quickly. Is because, the game was licensed to only be played/playable on and through the Microsoft Gaming Platform Program, the equivalent of Steam. Apparently playing the game through the Microsoft Gaming Platform really made the game laggy, crashed, and near impossible to play when it was streamed through the Microsoft Game Platform Software. The game owners then switched their accessibility to Steam and everything is all o'kay now. 

P.S.: (If you didn't understand, let me make this clear, yes, you can play this on Microsoft computers just fine, it is referring to Microsoft's attempt at making and implementing an online gaming platform equivalent to Steam and they failed horribly at it, which the above mentioned is about.) (The game runs fine.)

All in all, I am surprised I didn't find out about this MUCH game sooner, give it a chance, and I can promise you, you will be throughly impressed and satisfied. (Mobile Trench Brigade over and out!)

I would definitely recommend and encourage this game to friend.

[良い点]
・完全日本語字幕(パーツの説明なども面白く書いてある)
・4人coop対応
・タレットだけではなくプレイヤーも""トレンチ""に乗って戦闘に参加できる
・タレットのみクリアも可能
・トレンチのカスタマイズパーツが豊富(大きい種類としてはトレンチ本体、足パーツ、色、武器、使用タレット、搭乗員の服、搭乗員の帽子)
・順当に難しくなっていくレベルデザイン
・MAP構成や特徴的な敵キャラ(見落としがちなmap構成やバリアーを張る敵などの多様な敵)
・タレットが自由な場所に置ける(オブジェクトの上など)
・アップデートでsteamマッチングに対応した
・やり応えのあるサバイバルモード(50waveまでクリア報酬ありで最大100waveまで)
[悪い点]
・人が少ない(steamマッチングに対応して多少マシにはなったが)
・クラッシュや永久ローディングなどのバグがまだある
・人によってはキャンペーン序盤が簡単すぎて退屈

良いmap構成のせいもあり自分が見落としてた進行ルートを味方がカバーしてくれたり協力プレイが楽しいです。ただsteamマッチングに対応したのも最近のため人が少なくマッチングが地域制限かかってるぽい(これは予想ですが)ので日本以外にはつながらない様子。セールで激安なのでフレンドとやるか持ってる人とフレンドになろう。1人だと人によっては飽きてしまうかも。ただ、ネタ的なもの含め色々なパーツや武器を組み合わせて試したりするのが好きな人やタレットのみクリアとかチャレンジできる人は楽しめるはず。
　初期のsteamマッチング未対応やバグの残念さからか賛否両論な感じですがsteamマッチング対応と少し時間がたつと激重になるバグが直った今セールで買えば値段以上は楽しめるはず。",1433064811,1433064811,True,8,0,0.574918866157531738,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Though it is nowhere near as bad as it was back on GFWL. But since TakeTwo now have IP rights, we should see some patches and fixes.

Should you get this game despite the bugs? Definitely. It's 80% off and the developers have acknowledged fixes are on the way. So it will only get better (Also maybe more DLCs are on the horizon? ;D)

Third person, unlike some others, and in its own way both more and less customization.

You might be unable to carry certain emplacements or weapons on chassis due to size limits or carry limits, but almost every weapon class and emplacement class works on every chassis in combinations. You won't get the biggest guns and five of the strongest emplacements on one chassis, but you aren't truly locked out of something entirely. The weapons handle well, the missions are fairly well made, the survival modes are fun. The game is actually made a lot easier and a lot more fun played co-op.
The only downsides I can think of is that a lot of the cutscenes are unskippable, which does get annoying; and there are a few items you get as rewards for completing something, such as gaining a level or completing a mini mission thing that you can't get back if you sell it. Rewards for completing a story mission can be had by doing it again, but the extra bonus rewards are lost for good if you accidentally sell one.
It's similar enough to Dungeon Defenders and Sanctum to draw comparisons in how it works; you defend against waves of enemies and build defense towers while also shooting them, and yet it's different enough to be worth having if you enjoy this style of game.",1432771735,1432771735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Best played with co-op. 

This game can be so much fun. I mean, you have loot in the form of equipment that you can customize your chosen mech with. You can pick different types of frames, treads, and other gadgets like a ""scrap magnet"" to make gathering the game's currency that much easier and grind missions by repeating them to buy even crazier weapons when they become available. 

You can lay down anti-aircraft guns, turrets, wield railguns, missile launchers, giant shotguns...there's lots of great action in this across plenty of maps. You can also unlock costumes for your pilot, extending its replayability if the weapon drops aren't enough. Want to wear a top hat while riding your mech into battle? Go on and do it then, good sir. The battle will wait for you. Overall, it's kind of like a mech-version of Crimson Skies (the PC version). Just with tower defense features.

Two reasons dogged my experience in playing this -- one is the scrap lag which is already well documented in the forums and other reviews by other users. Essentially, the longer you play the game, the more unstable it gets before it just becomes unplayable and you just have to force it closed. I can't count how many times that spoiled co-op with my friends, having to exit the game and then come back, sometimes more than a few times. Argh.

Two is its reliance on Windows Live. If you don't have the client, you'll need to install it. Apparently there was a plan to eventually remove it by Double Fine, but their hands were tied by Microsoft and that's apparently where the initiative died. The game is all but abandoned at this point.

It's pretty much why I'm sad in giving it a very marginal thumbs down. If it weren't for these two issues, I'd wholeheartedly build an army of steam powered mechs to preach this game to the masses because if you can live with a buggy game that will never be updated, there's some awesome fun tucked away behind these problems.

Co-op Iron Brigade is a lot of fun!

[strike]GFWL is not dead. I had a working GFWL install from playing FUEL, and was up and running in 5 minutes. However, if you haven't, you probably need the updated client, which is here: http://www.xbox.com/Live/PC/DownloadClient You can probably download and install this before you download iron Brigade, or you can install Iron Brigeade, uninstall GFWL, and then install the newer version. Make an account, copy and Ctrl-V paste the serial, done. (GFWL often takes a minute ro more to connect, and sometimes needs more than one attempt.)[/strike]

You need to play two missions in singleplayer; after that, you know the basics of the game and get access to the ""radio room"" where you can invite friends, search for games etc. [strike]""Friends"" means GFWL friends and not Steam friends, of course, so you need to add each other on GFWL. [/strike]You can do in-game text-chat with ""T""; [strike]if you have configured speech in the GFWL settings,[/strike] you'll also automatically have voice chat with everyone in your game [strike](if your microphone isn't claimed by Steam)[/strike]. The co-op missions are the same as the singleplayer missions, so you advance in singleplayer as you play co-op.

I like the co-op rules. You need to collect ""scrap"" (= drops from the enemies) to be able to build turrets; any scrap you collect (or that scrap collector turret collects) gets shared equally (as are the random chest drops), but any turrets you place go off your own budget. You can only build those turret types that you have equipped (they're called ""emplacements"" in the loadout screens), but you can upgrade any turrets on the battlefield regardless of type. Of course you can revive each other.

Tactics for us was to go into each new map with the same loadout as the previous one, slightly modified by the hints the game gives you. We were only defeated once, but then we do go back and refine our strategy for gold star performance. This means talking about weapon and turret loadaouts, turret placement strategy, fire sectors (very loose), and the like. We were already on the chassis that has a maximum of weapon slots and a minimum of turret slots, but careful planning was still necessary to get that coveted gold star: even at that extreme of the game balance spectrum, you can't just adopt ""shoot everything that moves"" as a viable tactic.

Game balance is excellent: chassis types allow you to trade weaponry (fps) against turrets (tower defense) -- this affects both the turret types you can equip and their cost. Special skills are equipped via legs, and they're balanced as well: ""quick reload"" means you're stationary while that skill is engaged; ""sprint"" means you're fast, but can't turn while running, etc. You need to use your skill wisely, i.e. tactically.

[strike]The ""stutter bug"": 6 hours into the game, after 7 missions, the game started stuttering when scrap is being collected. That bug is not present in the Xbox version, and the FAQ says that since it seems related to GFWL, it is difficult/impossible to debug, and Microsoft is not being helpful. So that bug is there to stay. Since you can't shoot while collecting scrap, you tend to only do that when no enemies are around, which means the bug is an annoyance, not a showstopper at this point.[/strike]

I got Iron Brigade for free when I bought ""Hack'n'Slash"", possibly because I previously owned a lot of Double Fine games, including at least one bundle (Amnesia Fortnight). Getting it on sale seems definitely worthwhile even now, [strike]but if you have an Xbox, you're probably better off getting it there, because of the stutter bug.[/strike]

As a game, Iron brigade is exceptionally well designed: it is easy to get into, has tactical depth, and allows for a wide variety of approaches to beating a level that are well balanced among each other, both in singleplayer and co-op.",1418670106,1432703463,True,143,4,0.885521471500396729,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Довольно давно играл, но игра запомнилась с хорошей стороны, особенно в плане геймплея.

[h1][b]プラス評価[/b][/h1]

-Mechのカスタマイズ要素、自機/武器/ポッドのレべリング要素
Mechのカスタマイズ要素はシャーシ(本体)、ポッド、レッグ、カラーの4種に大別できる。シャーシによって強い/沢山(弱い/少なく)武器が積載可能なもの、ポッド積載数(多い少ない)の違い、自機の装甲やスピードが強い(弱い)ものと個性がある。更に武器(6種)やレッグにも各種特色のある個性があり、ポッドも含めた独自の組み合わせによってお気に入りの自機を組み上げた上で戦う事が可能となる。ステージの地形や敵の種類、自分の好みのプレイスタイルに応じてポッドでの殲滅を優先するか？自機での撃破を優先するか？バランス型で行くのか？等、都度構成や組み立てを考えられる点やスタイルの異なる遊び方が出来る点は面白い要素。

加えて上記カスタイマイズ可能なアイテムには全てレベルが存在する。無論高レベルのものは性能も高く、中にはスペシャルアビリティを持つものも。各アイテムはショップでの購入 or ステージクリア報酬で入手。Lvの低い機体、武器、ポッドをそれぞれ時間をかけてレベルアップ＝強力化していけばスキルを補う事も出来るデザインになっている。

-個性あふれる敵
小さい敵から中くらいの敵、飛行型から中ボス的な大きめの敵、ステージ毎に存在する4体のボス。それぞれ見た目や攻撃方法、攻撃ターゲットが異なっておりAIの個性付けが上手く出来ている。完全な余談になるがチューブ(敵)の一部は映画版「All You Need is Kill」のエイリアンに酷似。

[h1][b]マイナス評価[/b][/h1]

-ポッドの種類や戦場へ持ち込める数が少ない
種類はライト(4種)、サポート(3種)、ヘビー(4種)。戦場へ持ち込めるポッド数は2～4種となる為、どうしても取り回しが便利なポッド利用の頻度が高まる＝戦略が硬直化しやすい弊害を起こしてしまっている。

-ミッション中は全体を俯瞰できるようなミニマップが無くどのルートからどの敵が襲来するか判別しづらい

-ステージ開始や途中に入るムービーシーンのスキップが不可＝テンポ悪

If that sounds appealing to you, think no more, get it. It does its job very well!

You're a pilot of so-called mobile trench in a campaign against Monovision ravaging the world after mysterious Broadcast. The tongue-in-cheek campaign consists of missions tasking you with defense of a strategic point(s) from waves of enemies spawning at concrete locations on map and converging on their target. You fight partly yourself directly, dealing out punishment from guns mounted on your mechanized trench, and partly you summon turrets for help, paying for them with scrap gathered from fallen enemies.

There's a big selection of guns at your disposal - machine guns for relatively small but sustained damage, with flak variety focusing on airborne enemies, and a wide selection of burst damage weapons varying in range, area of effect, and reload times (shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, even artillery cannons). There's also a unique type of weapon - broadcasters, with huge, continuous damage, but very short range and long time to replenish (sort of like EMP version of flamethrower, I guess).

And all these guns also come in a standalone, turret version, automatically tageting enemies in their range, except broadcaster type of turret is not for damage but rather a support one, slowing enemies down, and there's a type of turret that lays mines rather than shoots at enemies. Other support turrets include magnets that  automatically gather scrap for you or can repair your trench.

(by the way, normally your mechanized trench CAN'T be blown up during a mission, you're just disabled for a short time and only lose when defended target is blown up, however stages of campaign end with boss fights where you yourself can be considered the target and then repair turret sure comes handy - or pretty much required)

There's a gotcha however - a harsh limit on what you can actually bring with you to a single mission, and mixing and matching a loadout before launch is big part of your success. Generally you can either go with a chassis that can dish out huge damage itself with lots of gun mounts, but very poor selection of turrets to summon, or a chassis that can deploy powerful turrets but has very limited space for guns on itself (there's also a middle ground, having an average number of gun mounts and limited only to light offensive turrets). These also differ in speed and armor values, and come with a choice of legs that give you some special move, for example let you sprint very fast in straight line, or give option for faster reload times if you root yourself in place. There's also a smashing variety of legs that complements your damage potential.

The selection of guns is ever expanding in their power and sometimes additional effects (like more scrap, or magnetic effect on grenades - very useful perk), you have this feeling of constant progress in power as you level up your pilot, very well realized indeed (but of course mission difficulty also ramps up to match it).

This is not a condemnation of GfWL, but rather entirely due to a bug caused by its implementation.   In short, a memory leak is introduced that, after a couple minutes, causes the system to begin delaying frames.   As levels drag on, this eventually renders the game unplayable.

While this bug can be remedied in the campaign missions by quitting the game and restarting it after every mission, this option is not possible when playing the survival modes (which I would consider to be the most challenging aspect of the game.)

Being a fan of the more hands-on third person defense game genre, I had high hopes for Iron Brigade, and it met those expectations beautifully. The personality in the game had me chuckling as my mates and I, kitted out in our multi coloured walking 'trenches', blast away wave after wave of downright impressive looking enemies. Diverse story maps, a hoard of loot and a garage load of customisation made this game a sure win.

Gameplay is entertaining and flexible, three types of trench giving you the choice between 'I'll kill it!' and 'Build ALL the turrets', and somewhere in between. Tactical placement decisions and rationing upgrade costs keeps your gears turning, and unique weapons and alternatives to standard turrets keep evolving your playstyle, which all comes together in the adequately challenging survival modes.

The negatives are few, but are as follows. I personally found the final map to be a bit underwhelming, the end of the game putting a single sour note on an otherwise awesome storyline. Wrestling with Games for Window's Live also made getting set up a bit of an issue, but that really can't be helped by Double Fine, so I won't hold it against them. Lastly, the game stutters nastily if your computer isn't up to scratch at handling the numerous turrets placed on an extended map, but that's likely just my old laptop struggling.

Overall, this is a game I'm very glad I bought, and will likely put more hours into it in the future. I didn't expect any less, and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A definate must buy for all fans of the defense strategy franchise.",1394557513,1394557513,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its essentially a tower defence game only its fought in the third person and you control an active unit on the battle field, a massive hulking robot called a Mobile Trench. In each area you have several areas to defend and a certain time limit to set everything up before the enemy come in. Rather than do this from an overhead view, you stomp your trench around and set up assorted turrets on available building platforms, trying to create the right sort of deadly crossfire. 

You have to think on your feet once the attacks starts as they foes will becoming from all directions and you can only be in on place at a time, so what do you rebuild? Your own trench is heavily armed and can be upgraded between missions. You can collect loot boxes that drop from powerful enemies that can give you powerful new equipment to customise your mech with.

 The games atmosphere is an over the top setting remeniscent of a fictional world war one with anachronistic technology. The sense of humour is kinda crazy, I chose as my character a dapper British dude whose trench came equiped with a humidor for his cigars, at the end of every battle he would light up a cigar.......with his pistol.

До этого все игры Тима Шейфера игрались на ура, а тут.. провал.

Слишком унылый геймплей этой вариации на тему ТД. Тут можно пройти любой уровень вообще без башен (навесил кучу пушек на толстое шасси и зажал кнопку огонь). В кооперативе любой уровень проходится тупо с расстановкой башен в рэндомном порядке, а играть одному - убийство (просто не интересно). Лучше поиграть в Dungeon Defenders или Orcs Must Die!, чем тратить время на это.

Оценка 6.5/10. 
Строго рекомендуется тем, кто любит бегать с зажатой гашеткой и минимум думать. Любители вдумчивой расстановки башен будут разочарованы как я (много экшена, примитивные карты)

While it is a solid tower defense game, the enemies and maps just lack any personality and originality. I know Double Fine isn't the biggest company there is, and that there were several teams working on three different games basically all at the same time, but Iron Brigade lacks the charm  (not the humor) of Stacked and Costume Quest. 
For a TD game Iron Brigade definitely has a lot of customization. Pretty much anything can be customized. Your trench, marine, turrets and weapons.
Killed enemies will sometimes also drop loot boxes that give you random new gear.
The game certainly doesn't disappoint in that department.
And unlike other TD games, the game will (properly) increase in difficulty as you progress.
There was a bit of a performance issue later on in the game, where it would freeze for a second while collecting scrap. Nothing major, but worth noting anyway.
Now if only the maps and enemies were more diverse...

It is a fresher take on mech warfare, with some added tower defense esque gameplay. You play as a marine in your mobile trench (cool concept imo) and are faced off against an enemy known as ""the broadcast"". Your main goal of the game is to takedown the broadcast and pretty much build the best trench you can. The trench is customizable with a nice selection of cores, legs, emplacements, and various types of weapons. The emplacements add the tower defense aspect, and they assist you in different ways (flak guns for air, machine guns, repair cranes, etc), I just wish they were a little more useful then they tend to be.

It is very common to experience dropped sessions in multiplayer, and doing so often causes you to be booted out of the mission entirely. Additionally there is an extremely annoying sound glitch on the free-DLC missions (which represent about 25% of the total game length), which evidently also has to do with GFWL but occurs in whichever mode you play. 

When GFWL is phased out soon, it is uncertain if Iron Brigade will ever be patched to continue supporting multiplayer at all-- Microsoft is the publisher for Iron Brigade and DoubleFine can't fix this unless Microsoft tells them to, reportedly. Even so, as things stand now the lobby system drops your friends constantly and there's no way around it, so multiplayer as it stands right now requires a lot of patience and luck.

Original Review: It's very good. I've stayed up late two nights playing it already (16 hrs total, haven't finished it yet, though I've been replaying missions a lot to get gold medals). It's skewed heavily towards action but it's still a tower defense game, which I usually avoid but big stompy mechs make it all good. It does have GFWL, which is still clunky and terrible, but after getting to grips with it and setting it to auto-login it's stayed out of my way entirely.. could suck if you lose internet for prolonged periods while playing though, since a GFWL connection is used to save your progress. However, I've still really been loving this game and couldn't recommend it heartily enough.",1345031736,1385466436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,
