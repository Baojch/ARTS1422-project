[*]You [b]cannot use both hands/arms[/b] for playing like you would in real volleyball for setting (the ball will fly anywhere except for where you want it to)
[*]If you just let the ball hit your hand it bounces back really far, if you hit it hard, it is not much faster.
[*]You cannot go close to the net, you will stay about 1m away from it but the bots of your team often set the ball so that you would have to hit the ball directly over the net.
[*]Joistick movement is really slow
[*]No description on how to jump (it is pulling both triggers)
[*]No description what the settings do
[*]Jumping is just teleporting you into the air for 2s
[*]While jumping you can still move 
[*]Almost no Valleyball rules

We have a community of players that are very active on Discord (many of them play volleyball IRL). Their feedback guides the development of the game. If you would be interested to join us and bounce ideas you're more than welcome: 🙂 https://discord.gg/CMVGFtbU

Two hands/arms: There's a specific feature that detects when the player brings the hands and arms together and modifies the physics model to better represent the intent of the player. It's not perfect, and we have seen that for some body types and VR setups this isn't detected properly. Going forward we'll adjust this to make sure it works better for people.

Ball goes far/short: By default, aim assist is enabled to make it possible for players of every skill level to play. The ball will be clamped to the play area so they you can't shoot it outside. If you are experiencing this with aim assist disabled, then it would be interesting to discuss it more.

Cannot go close to the net: Before players could go to the other side of the net. We talked with the players what we should accept. We decided that we should not be able to cross over, and we then keep the play area on ""your side of the net"" so you should be able to step forward to the net physically on your play area. If you can't, we can tweak they to let you move further.

Slow joystick movement: We have discussed this in Discord and decided that the movement should be faster. 

No settings descriptions: We have added more and more settings so players can tweak the experience to their liking. I agree with you that descriptions would be good!

Jumping is just teleporting: Some players have suggested that the jump should be a smooth animation up and down. Would that work for you, or do you have something else in mind?

Movement while jumping: in the beginning you couldn't move when jumping but players felt too constrained by that so we made it possible to move while jumping. Would you like an option to turn that off?

Volleyball rules: The fundamental volleyball rules are in place but there are a few things that we could add, for sure.

Thank you for the feedback, once again. I'd love to hear more so feel free to join us on Discord, or write a post here, or send an email to support@neuston.io

Have a great day! 🙂"

It is fun, great physics, and plays like real volleyball. You recieve, set, and spike. I haven't found any other volleyball game that compares to this. I know this game is still in early access and you guys are still working on it, but there are still some things that I would love if you guys added an option or changed. For instance
- Setting 
I feel that the setting in this game is really awkward and unrealistic. You just use one hand and slap it. I tried to set the ball with my two hands above my head like in real life, but it just doesn't work. If you guys could some how find a way to integrate more realistic setting with both hands, it would be amazing. 
- AI Setting
The setting overall is pretty good with the AI, but starts to feel repetitive. However, now that you added the ability to move with the joy stick, it unlocks more potential to spike from different areas, but the problem is that the AI isn't the best at reading where you are. I wish there were an option for the bot to always set to you so you can practice spiking anywhere in single player. (Since we have quarentine, I would love to practice different spiking position.)
- Receiving 
The receiving is also very smooth and nice, however It doesn't have the real volleyball feel. The best way to receive in this game is by one again, slapping the ball with one hand. Realistic volleyball, you have to receive with both hands and use your forearms. If you could find a way to make it more realistic, it would be even more amazing. 

I know that this is alot of things to change and might make the game completely different, so maybe you could make it a whole new game mode, like ""realistic volleyball.""

Very well designed, very well made, and cheap for what it offers. The only reason that i've only played this game for 3 and a half hours, is because it lacks customization. This game can be one of the best VR games out there and I know it! Before stops being early access, and you guys release it to full access, I recommend you doing some of the changes and adding some of the features I have listed here:

-Body and uniform customization. Make a menu where you can change your skin color, shirt color, pants color, skin color, etc.

-Difficulty customization. Make an easy, medium and hard. The easier you get the less harder they hit, and the harder difficulty you get they hit harder and do more accurate hits and dumps etc.

-Bump assist toggle. Right now, in normal mode, you can legit turn around and serve the ball behind you, and your back left person will just bump it over as if nothing happen. Sometimes I try to lose, and its actually really hard.

-More maps. You guys are probably already working on this, but I think that an indoor court or smthn would be really cool.

- Ajust how many people are on a court at once. 12 people, 8 people, 4 people, and 2.

Overall, great game, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a really good volleyball simulator. Work on these suggestions to make it the best it can be.",1572665091,1572665091,True,15,0,0.709703624248504639,0,True,False,True,False,,,

VR EXERCISE RATING: EASY
GAMEPLAY RATING: FAIR

A really nice pace and flow, quite a relaxing experience.

This scratches that itch right on the head. Allow me to elaborate:

Lets say you log into steam after work to see that your favorite game just got a six gigabyte update. Typically, one would load up a 'low end game' and let the update run in the background; something mindless to pass the time. 

In VR, that really isn't an option. Any VR game you launch typically can take a few minutes to load (if your like me; a slave to spinny drives) and leave you standing in the room spinning aimlessly in circles. By the time the game is loaded, you've already made yourself motion sick and do not require the game to do it for you. I would hope we both agree that this few minutes of wasted time cannot be allowed to continue! How dare I allow myself to stand there bored!

That's where Volleyball Fever comes in. 
Vollyball Fever has absolutely no complications to it. The game turns on nearly instantly, runs smoothly, and allows you to play something mindless yet entertaining while other games download or simply just to pass time. Of course there are cracks... odd AI behavior, occasional crashes, ect.. but if you allow this game to just be a hub between two other games, or even just a way to pass a quick 10 minutes, this game scratches an itch that I have not yet seen scratched before in VR; Especially if you can just grab the game for 5$ on sale.
