So, do I recommend this game?  Yes.

I still only give this a 6 out of 10 though, simply because whoever wrote this game made one of the romantic interests more important than the main character.  The character I'm talking about is Melody, Aria's (the main character's) childhood friend.  The book that is the main focal point of the game is apparently incredibly heave and really difficult to lift, except to Melody who can lift it with ease.  She can also do spells from the book, read the book with no trouble whatsoever and, if you do the harem route, integral to breaking the curse that's affecting the demon realm of Vega.  Also, if you do that route she not only becomes the Human Ambassador to the demons, but sits on the Council and has absolutely no trouble getting a hug fan base among the demons, who are supposed to be seriously anti-human.  While Aria gets relegated to, in her words, ""A glorified hall monitor"".

So the game's only worth playing, at least for me, if you ignore her route completely and go with either Lyria or Sherza.  At least then Aria takes on more importance, being the one that facilitates the breaking of the curse.  Hell, in Lyria's route Lyria even halves her lifespan to make Aria live longer, just so the two can be together for a longer amount of time.

So yeah, Melody is the only reason I'm rating this so low.  Not that I dislike the character *herself*, per se, I just don't like how she was written to be more of a 'main character' than the main character.",1681809326,1681809326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The soundtrack and sound effects were decent, with gorgeous art. I think this is an entertaining enough visual novel, and I recommend it for the story, however I do want to share some critiques I had. 

The choice system could have been vastly improved in my opinion. In other visual novels I've played, the routes are usually pretty conventional. I don't mind a ""traditional"" path, even if it isn't as creative or innovative as it could be, if it aligns with the narrative and makes sense when choosing how to be with, I'm content. There were several times with Starlight Vega that I felt the choices didn't correlate with the character route I was trying to follow, and on my second playthrough to achieve all character routes, I had to follow a guide. I didn't mind the ""good"" and ""bad"" endings for each character and thought it was interesting, but there were some plot holes and inconsistencies in the storytelling, as well as times where, even though I saved the game before each choice, a lot of scenes and dialogue were repeated with no skip option available, making the gameplay a bit tedious.

Route-wise, I preferred Melody's the most. It was the most believable and held some emotional tension too. There was growth, maturity, and also the journey in understanding one's own feelings toward the people that are such integral parts in our lives, and how sometimes friendships change. The magic aspect was neat, I only wish we could have possibly seen flashbacks of Vega before [spoiler] the curse, or the way it flourished after the curse was lifted. That would have made Vega more real and grand, instead of just hearing descriptions about how lush it was. It was fun to see the different endings though, especially in who chooses to stay and Aria and Melody's future roles in Vega and on Earth. [/spoiler]

I also liked the themes of morality, the history of mistreatment between humans and demons, and especially with Scherza's route, the importance of saving Vega, realizing just how many people were affected. It touched on the sacrifice of one versus the sacrifice of many as well.

Moving on to the *special* Harem ending: I'm not usually a fan of endings that become unlocked once other ones are achieved, and felt it was a letdown in quality, not to mention feeling out of character and overall not needed. Much of the Harem route was re-hashed from other routes with only a few changed dialogue scenes and lack of any suspense.

In regards to Lyria, she is revealed to be a character with a lot more depth than initially expected. Even though it can be said that she is a common trope, a character coming across as shallow/manipulative/selfish but proving us wrong in the final acts, I liked that we did get to see more of her emotions and backstory. HOWEVER, I didn't appreciate the numerous times Lyria made sexual advances to Aria that were not wanted or reciprocated. Even though this is *sort of* addressed later in the game, where Lyria listens to Aria and realizes that Aria's first kiss should be important and when Aria wants it, it doesn't really excuse prior behavior. It felt more like the developer was trying to push Lyria's advances as a personality trait, being sexy, exciting and forward, instead of bordering on assault. There is a massive difference between flirting and being physically/sexually aggressive toward a character who hasn't made up her mind yet and is visibly uncomfortable and pushing away. It's not sexy, and it was unnecessary. I would have been fine with Lyria being flirty at times as long as it wasn't constantly brought up that she wants to basically throw herself at Aria, not to mention it being almost disregarded later on as Lyria just ""being annoying"". Also, in Melody's route, when [spoiler] Aria and Melody announce they are dating, Lyria REFUSES to accept this fact and instead forces a kiss with Aria. [/spoiler] I couldn't help but think of the outrage if this was a male character, pressuring Aria and invading her space. Lyria is obviously meant to be a rowdy and playful character, but I hate how her sexual advances were brushed off to be no big deal or that it's just ""how she shows attraction"".

Other minor gripes included some awkward transitions and repeated art (mostly in Vega, when the narrative spoke about the different rooms etc), as well as a soundtrack that wasn't as memorable as it could have been (looped tracks and some silent moments).

While some parts dragged on and more closure on the story and couples could have been implemented, I still would recommend this game, possibly on sale though since it is rather short and the main story can be completed in around two hours or so. It's not the best Yuri game out there, but I enjoyed it nevertheless due to the story and atmosphere.

It's second game from Razzart I've been playing (first one was Wofl tails) and again I enjoyed it very much. Plot it's not really that complicated and easy to follow, and writing is really fun to read. 
Characters were quiet appealing as well! Sometimes they may be a little to cliche, but hey! This is a visual novel. not Noble-worth novel. It was fun to see how they intercat with each other and there were moments my little cold heart flicker a bit.

Gameplay is... there. It's vn, what are you expecting? Sometime you have to choose dialogue option. I got a small problem with it, to be exact - with harem ending. It's not really this hard, because while finishing other routes you just unlock it... and that's it. It was fine, but I think it would me more fun to just put it in game and then that could be a real challange. But I'm cherry picking here...

There are two things striked me tough. Inconsistency in art is the first one. In regular game and event CG art difference can be shocking. Second one is rapid changes in songs. Songs themselves are fine, I have no problems with them but changes between them are so rapid it can hurt your ears. A little fade-out would help?

Overall it's fun game you can sink in and like its characters and their relationships ( Scherza <3). Worth buying, worth playing, worth investing your time. Ciao!

Pros
Charming characters
Multiple romance plots
Intriguing story beats

Cons
A little unpolished. Sloppy music transitions and minor spelling and grammar errors.

Watched it on YouTube once, bought it here on Steam to support the developer, played it again and liked it even more.

The artwork in this game is nice to look at and the CGs really capture the feelings of a scene and are great images overall. 

The music always perfectly fit the events and are generally really nice compositions, so that I sometimes just stopped reading and just listened to the music.

The characters are all great too (and of course, demons are a big plus). They all have their unique quirks and motivations and are not some copy-pasted dere-type.

When it comes to the story, I think every main route is a very entertaining read and each have satisfing endings, even though it is pretty clear that the [spoiler] Melody [/spoiler] route got the most polish, as its epilogue is quite longer than the others. The romantic part of the story is really cute and heartwarming and every route has its own events that fit well into the flow of the story, so its not just the same route with another character inserted.
There are lovescenes with a little bit more explicit writing and a CG (which show characters naked, but nothing else, eg nipples), but they are definiatly not the main point of interest. While I have seen some people calling the story confusing or claiming that it even contridicts itself, after playing every possible route, I cannot find such issues.  

One thing I have found to be quite confusing though is how to skip stuff, so if anyone runs into the same problem, you need to hold the ctrl button to skip, which is something the game does not really tell you ( or maybe I just missed it dx)

The music and background art are a bit eerie and quite nice, the character design is mostly plain and aiming for cute.
What I liked was the background story of Vega and the dialogue options - although there could have still been a few more of both - some pictures were used too often for different places. 
The game would have profited by more mature dialogue and art, I think - maybe having adult protagonists and more serious talking. Also, the art was not consistent in quality and there were a few spelling mistakes.

- Aria’s thought helps to imagine better love moments.

- Music is fine, not too exciting but not too disappointing, sometimes feels repetitive, but is not a big issue.
- The drawings are beautiful; they fit for shipping and love scenes, but I’d preferred they preserved the same style for all pictures, at least the colors. Lyria’s skin tone is not as yellowish as the key moment draws.

Sometimes she behaves like a little puppy, begging the MC to stay with her. I like her so much that I'm reluctant to go through other girls' route, as I must reject her feelings. 

Humor is another pro. Lyria and Sid, the 'master' and its 'pet', keep picking on one another. Their sour comment to each other is right to the point, and that makes it funny. And although I don't particularly like the harem ending, I appreciate its comedic effects, especially the 'climatic' final battle.

Starlight Vega doesn't have an epic story that makes people talk for years. But its art and characterization make it an enjoyable read. Overall, an attractive yuri story.

百合 - 百合度满点，H（主要是亲吻）场景描写的好。

Though sometimes I'd get a little bored with the story, and end up skipping through most of the dialogue. I'm unsure if it was the writing or the plot, or if I had just been playing the game for too long. Either way I enjoyed the game until the very end regardless.

I grew to love all the characters with only finishing one romance route (Lyria; I mean come on, she's smoking fucking hot and such a compassionate, loving, and charming lover)
I kind of don't want to follow the other routes because I truly wish to stay 'loyal' to Lyria. She seemed that real.

I was so upset when I found out that the end was the end.

It got slightly boring at first, then enticing, and eventually leaded to pure romance with an amount of drama that wasn't overwhelming, which tends to be the case for interactive romance novels and apps such as Episode.

Though, I was expecting many more decisions. To my disappointment, I was restricted to following along a preset path majority of the time; but regardless of the restraints, I thoroughly enjoyed the story the entire way.

I highly recommend this interactive love story to any hopeless romantic lesbian striving for a taste of fantasized romance; regardless if they look for more realistic romances.


Personally, ever since I was a child, I never really thought about fantasized love stories; I preferred more realistic-styled romances in order for me to get a true feeling of being in love as I wait impatiently for my time in life to find the person I will eventually spend the rest of my life with. Even after I had gained the realization of being lesbian, I still didn't have much interest in finding the princess and marrying them, nor did I think of being with a rich or famous woman. Indeed, it was an enticing thought, but I was no child to wear a suit or dress imagining I was meeting 'the one'. Therefore, I could deduce that my feelings toward it as a child had nothing to do with not liking guys.
(When I was younger and didn't know of my sexuality, I still didn't fantasize about guys like that)

In turn, I never searched or was interested in searching for stories like this; but being bored and intrigued to an extent to give it a chance, I was impressed, to say the least.

I did love demons and the 'evil villains rule' as a kid, so that may or may not have slightly leaned me towards checking this out; however, I know that that wasn't a factor because I cringed looking at them being demons and the slight glimpses of the demon's (or, 'vegan's' {vay-gan-z}) advances towards the protagonist.

I had low expectations but the reviews stating 'very positive' intrigued me. I wasn't sure how to feel about this mainly due to the perverted men that could have just been intrigued by seeing two women together, but like I had said earlier, I was not disappointed in the slightest.

I enjoyed this story a lot and I hope this game gets all of the love it deserves.

I wasn't very wild about Melody, so I was a bit disappointed when her route had more story to it than Lyria's, but I guess it makes sense given that Lyria and Aria just met and didn't have the history that Melody and Aria share.

The main criticism I have when reading the story is that there are a LOT of grammatical and spelling errors. I think Razzart should focus more on proofreading in the future, because IIRC Love Ribbon also had this problem. 

Another issue is that there is no Skip option at the bottom right of the screen. I had to look online to find out how to skip the text, because it's not indicated anywhere in the game that I could see. Apparently you have to hold the control key to skip.

Having played visual novels for years, I have not enjoyed a VN as much as this one in a while. It has got everything I would expect from a quality product: great art design, suitable music, and excellent writing. If you have played ""Kindred Spritis on the Roof"" or possibly ""Animal Lover"" you are in for a big treat.

If you have looked at the previews on Steam or played any other games by Razzart Visual you probably know what to expect visually. The characters have different facial expressions and seem realistic apart from a few minor characters. The style is something you will either love or hate. For me, it was just perfect as the design goes well with the overall mystical story. The soundtrack is varied, chilled at most times. During intense scenes, it increases the suspense and grasps the reader's attention to enhance the effect of immersion.

Story-wise, this visual novel is something else. The writing surprised me as an avid reader and surpassed what I would expect from a 10$ VN. Suspense and descriptions come together to form a fully immersive fictional world. The characters are convincing and round. The story world is well designed and there are few plotholes. Although there are a few minor errors concerning spelling, the story is truly captivating.

This sure takes me back to the old fun times of erotic VNs of yore (and by ""yore"" I mean mid-to-late 90's)

So two things I have to get out of the way first.

One, it's erotica, but not straight-up porn, everything's reasonably tasteful, except maybe the harem ending, and not too explicit. There are some ...evocative visuals though, so it's still, well, smut. Also, if you didn't pick up on it from the description, it's about lesbians (or yuri as anime-heads tend to call that)

Two, the picture on the banner and the title screen might suggest some things about the characters that are simply not there, with those half-smiles and shadows cast over their eyes. So that particular picture is not in any way indicative of the content. A bit of a bait and switch if you ask me.

So... yeah, the overall story is rather straightforward, as you would expect. There are some twists though, but those are rather predictable.

Art is nice, for the most part, but there are some awkward angles at times that look a bit strange to me. Nothing too distracting, but I've spent some awkward moments staring at some CGs not because I was captivated by the picture or the story, but rather because I was confused as to what exactly I'm seeing.

Characters are... well. This is a bit complicated. So the girls aren't cardboard cutouts, and the main character isn't purely self-insert either, so there is some depth there. And while you keep to the same route, characters behaviour is more or less believable. But on different routes, some characters behave somewhat inconsistently, so... there's that. This isn't necessarily a negative, mind. But it did feel a little bit forced at times, kinda like characters behaved the way they did because the plot demanded it. Everyone is more or less pleasant for the most part [spoiler]although Scherza is a dangerous mix of tsundere and kuudere, so yeah[/spoiler]

Most routes are rather sweet and more or less believable. Some are less believable than others though. And obviously, the harem route is not believable at all.

Music is nothing to write home about, it's not distracting, but not amazing either. And it tends to switch very abruptly, which can be a bit jarring.

Branching is good, for the format. Routes are reasonably different from one another (although the places where routes intersect are very obvious).

No voice-acting. I don't really mind, but I know someone will.

Of course, I have to talk about the naughty bits. As I said, nothing too explicit, at least image-wise, and rather tasteful. Text descriptions, on the other hand... boy, there is some rather explicit stuff there in places. Everything's pretty vanilla though (well except it's yuri), so nothing to be concerned about there.

So, well, anyway, despite some flaws, it's a decent read if you're looking for some relatively believable and tasteful yuri in your life. So, if that's something you might be interested in, I say give it a go.",1521099072,1521099147,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Starlight Vega is a sweet yuri story about Aria, the main character, who accidentally becomes magically bound to a flirty demon, Lyria, who is trying to save her homeworld Vega from a curse.  Lyria enlists the help of Aria and Aria's best friend, Melody, as well as Lyria's wyvern familiar Sid to try to find a way of breaking the curse.  Meanwhile, both Lyria and Melody develop feelings for you (Aria), and the choices you make during the course of the story will affect the unfolding of events and which character (if any) you pursue a romantic relationship with.  There are several different endings, some good, some not.

[b][u]Things I liked about Starlight Vega:[/u][/b]  Although there were not many characters in this story, most of them were fleshed out pretty well.  There's Aria, a regular girl trying to make her way through events, and (at least at first) totally oblivious to the romantic intentions of those around her.  There's Aria's best friend Melody, who is simply one of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  She's quite smart, too, with a natural affinity for learning magic.  Then there's Lyria, the playful demon who knows no bounds between flirting and sexual harassment.  :P  Lyria is a ""hands-on"" demon in more ways than one.  There's Sid, the grumpy misanthropic wyvern who wants to hate all humans but falls prey to Melody's kindness.  And there's Lyria's sister Scherza, the cold queen of Vega who gives off a bit of a Nazi vibe.  Characters aside, the music, story, and sprites (artwork) were all well done too.  Concerning the story, I will say that the preview video on this page seems oriented towards a male audience, and while the story does have some adult moments (tastefully done), the emphasis is definitely on the romance, not the physical aspects.

[b][u]Things that could have been better:[/u][/b]  There were a few spelling & grammar issues, mostly the occasional missing or extra word.  Not enough to seriously detract from the story, but it may bug you if you're a grammar nazi like I am.

There were some mostly minor inconsistencies in the story as well.  Things like how and under what circumstances magic works & who can use/learn it, what exactly the curse on Vega was ([spoiler]it is alternately referred to as a blight and a drought[/spoiler]), who can be ""glamoured"" (charmed/mind controlled), how lifestones work, whether Scherza was Lyria's older or younger sister (I think I recall her being referred to as both), etc.  These are things I feel could have been better explained in the interests of avoiding reader confusion and more fully fleshing out the story.

Overall though I really enjoyed this visual novel, especially the [spoiler]Melody good ending[/spoiler].  It has decent replayability as well, so you can start again and pursue other courses of action to see where they lead.

I very much enjoyed my time with its interesting mix of fantasy and romance, its characters that were generally endearing and the amazing presence that the more colourful members of the cast had. In my 8 hours of playing it left a solid impression on me, but it very nearly left an even more amazing one.  For me what stopped it from achieving greatness was that the characters were often acting in frustrating ways, the story was almost identical in each of the routes and occasionally the quality took a turn for the worse. However I’d definitely still recommend it, for me its flaws didn’t stop my enjoyment and I felt that its highs evened out the lows. Those are my general impressions but I’m going to go more in-depth below so you can see if this game is for you.

Aria is a regular schoolgirl whose life gets turned upside-down when she becomes linked to a demon named Lyria after freeing her from a magical stone. The first thing Lyria decides to do after meeting Aria is to hit on her. Aria’s best friend Melody (Who may or may not have a secret crush on her and also a passing interest in the supernatural) tries to help Aria break the link caused by the stone. Cue some whacky hi-jinks, a strong rivalry between Lyria and Melody and a comic relief character named Sid that is introduced as Lyria’s familiar. 

On my first play-through I ended up on Lyria’s route, which happened unintentionally just from spending the most time with her though I think I would have still chose her. I really enjoyed her character, and it was fun to see the quieter moments with her too. She draws lots of good reactions out of Aria and their interactions together are great. There were also facts and world-building sprinkled throughout about the land demons come from, Vega. The fantasy elements had clearly taken some thought and I could appreciate the blend of original ideas with established ones. The final act of the story deflated a bit towards the end, but followed with a sweet prologue. 

Next was Melody’s route, I liked that she was such a contrast from Lyria. The early scenes with Melody were incredible, and one of my two favourite scenes overall is the flashback to her first day at school. She is so earnest, hard-working, kind and it was impossible for me not to like her. Sadly my problems started here. 

At the half-way point of the story Melody’s route fell in line with where Lyria’s route went. The scenes that I thought were Lyria specific, for example taking a walk in the garden, cliff scene-1 or exploring the house just replaced Melody where Lyria was. Melody would have slightly different things to say but Aria would usually have the same thoughts (About the over-arching plot) and ultimately it was never meaningful enough to make me not feel like I was stuck on the same track the other route had. To add to this there are old scenes that have no difference between the two versions that I just skipped past, lots of Aria and Melody translating, a witch named Rhiannon talking to them, conversation with Sid. I struggled to get past all of this repetition and find the new sections, which eventually there are a few of but to be honest the longest stretch of new sections came as soon as I’d started Melody’s route.

The third route was probably my favourite, in which you romance the queen of the demons, Scherza. It had enough different than the first two plot-wise to feel new and explored branches the story before could have taken. There was so much depth to Scherza as a character and her ice-queen persona. She constantly acts nice towards Aria despite being harsh and thorny with her words. My favourite moments of hers were the glimpses of her ruling over her subjects, which to me captured everything about her. 

Annoyingly however, Aria in this route becomes very wooden. I can see all the reasons that Scherza is in love with her, but Aria’s interest is only ever stated as attraction. Aria constantly says that she doesn’t understand Scherza and is left confused by her, but instead of ever communicating with her Aria responds to her mostly with silences, stumbles her words or gets embarrassed. A prime example of this is in my favourite scene when Scherza storms off after a heated argument, only to be stopped by Aria. For other reasons I had to stop the game here and spent the whole day just picturing what they might say to each other with emotions running so high. When I booted up the game the next day Aria tripped over her, stumbled her words and contributed little to their conversation which drained away the excitement I had built up. What I wanted so badly was for these two characters to sit down and talk on some personal level, but instead it felt like Scherza was just talking to a brick wall, she would constantly open herself up but Aria never did the same back and I think that’s what their relationship was missing. 

Finally on my last play-through I got the harem ending which was a lot of fun, especially the epilogue that follows after. What I will say though is that it highlights the issue with the other threes shared final act. Namely, what was even wrong in the first place? If just one simple conversation could have avoided all the danger did the final act even need to happen?

There was one other flaw which I felt I had to mention and it’s about the LGBT side. Early in her route Melody blames Aria for not realising her feelings, at one point saying “do I have to make it obvious?” but this isn’t true to how Melody would feel. She would feel trapped and be struggling with her feelings for someone of the same gender, or at least not magically assume Aria’s into women. The tone here felt more a hetero relationship that involved two girls rather than a lesbian one and I think it’s disrespectful to not treat it as what it is - to add to this, none of the characters sexuality is ever directly addressed or talked about in any of the routes and I think it really needed to be at least once. Either having a small moment with Aria realising she might be into women and change those Melody lines or establishing early on in the universe that girl and girl relationships are common is my suggestion. I’ve played other Yuri games with the exact same tone and the problem here wasn’t the word by word dialogue but rather the silence and how it feels like the topic is being avoided and stepped around.
 
About the art and sound, the soundtrack is fantastic and gets a top score (heh) of 10 from me. It’s really unique and catchy and adds lots to the mysterious fantasy setting. I thought the art looked nice, if a bit cartoony but absolutely loved the designs for the two demon girls and all of the CGs. 

Re-reading through I think my review reflects how I feel about Starlight Vega, that it’s a good game but far from perfect. I’d say if you don’t feel particularly put off by any of the things I’ve listed or are willing to bear with them then give the game a go. It has a real heart to it and feels its way around for itself instead of copying or trying to imitate, which I think is admirable.

Par ou commencer, à mon sens le point fort du jeu, le scénario. Il y a une vraie histoire et une vraie intrigue, ce n'est pas juste une grosse excuse pour nous servir de la romance entre jeunes femmes pulpeuses avec pour ultime récompense la tant convoitée scène de cul (qui sont très soft, soit dit en passant). Les personnages sont bien écrits, bien encastrés dans l'histoire et pour la plupart hyper attachants (gros coup de coeur pour les démones). Il y a une route pour chacun d'entre eux, et chaque route est différente et aboutit sur une fin différente en fonction des choix que l'on fait (qui sont décisifs, c'est pas le cas ds tt les VN!). On glâne des informations au fil des routes et on accumule tout ça ds nos petits cerveaux. Il faut vraiment avoir fait le jeu de fond en comble pr bien comprendre toute l'histoire je pense. L'OST est clean, le style des perso et des CG est simpliste mais raffraichissant, ca change du style moe qu'on à l'habitude de voir ds ce genre de jeu. L'ensemble de ces points procure au jeu une atmosphère vraiment particulière qui fait tout son charme.

On en arrive aux points négatifs. Certaines routes ont des bugs scénaristiques plus ou moins prononcés ce qui rend parfois l'histoire difficile à comprendre. C'est rien de bien grave mais ça ralentit un peu la lecture et gâche un peu le plaisir d'y jouer. Je ne sais pas si c'est la barrière de la langue ou simplement moi, mais j'ai l'impression que BEAUCOUP de questions restent sans réponses à la fin du jeu. Même en ayant complété toute les routes il y a toujours des petits coin du scénar que je n'ai pas compris et qui restent un mystère. Il y a aussi quelques incohérences dans le scénario, la encore rien de bien grave mais un peu décevant. Les bruitages et effets sonores sont assez pauvres et répétitifs. Enfin, et ça reste un avis personnel, mais la fin harem (je ne spoil rien, c'est ds les features) est très décevante, et encore une fois accompagnée de bug scénaristiques et d'incohérences par rapport aux autres routes. 

Mais dans l'ensemble c'est vraiment un très bon jeu qui vaut le détour, qui vaut son prix et qui vaut bien les 40 longues heures que j'ai passées dessus (comptez la moitié si vous avez la lecture facile).

7.5/10

Starlight Vega is a wlw VN that nicely balances story, romance, and spice. You play as Aria, a young woman who moves into her grandfather’s old house. She doesn’t know much about him, but she never could have guessed that the gem he was hiding in his study held a demon inside! That gem becomes fused with Aria’s body, binding her to Lyria, the demon. Aria, her best friend Melody, and Lyria have to work to find a way to remove the gem - and then get Lyria home.

This is a finely made VN - the sprites are appealing, the CGs are plush and well done, the writing is fun and bouncy and lively. Aria has three romance options - Melody, Lyria, and Lyria’s sister, Scherza - that are all different and all well done. The love scenes - which you can choose to turn on or off from the settings menu - are spicy without being ultra-explicit, and they’re tender and sweet and loving which is all that I give a shit about.",1516474925,1516474925,True,9,1,0.65231788158416748,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I will keep it short;

1- The Art is different and refreshing from the Manga type of anime we normally see.  This style is more 'realistic'.  At first i wasn't sure i was going to appreciate it, but i did.   it gives the VN a sort of grounding and seriousness that make you quickly think this is not 'just' a game.

2- I quickly became attached to all the caracters in the story.  Although they sometimes feel shallow, it is normally in order to make the story logical depending on your choices you makes.  So i did accept this and i was fine with it as the story unfold.

3- The greatness in a story is when it keep your interrest all the way.  This novel did.  I mostly enjoyed every conversation (9/10) between the protagonist and the other caracters.

4- The descriptions of love scene are very well done and the CGs that goes with them 'fix' the moment very well.  I loved the art of this.  I felt the scene and that is a sign of great writing.  Don't expect them to be 3x though, since that part is left to your imagination.

5- Personaly i found the music to be totally nice and adequate to support what was happening.

6- Sound effect could have been more present but what is here is good quality and again support very well the action that is happening.

7- It is not a very long story, i have a 7 hours first pass at it.  Perfect for a rainy day or cold day.

8- Like when you get out of a good movie, i wish i could have see more.  That is a sign of a good VN.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW 2018]: I first saw this VN on YouTube and watched two of the endings play out on there (Lyria's and Scherza's). Normally I'd be satisfied with that and move on to the next thing I wanted to watch or play, but not this time. Starlight Vega captured my attention first with its art style. It's got a looser artistic style than most other VNs I've read. At first I wasn't sure if that'd leave me with a negative opinion of the visuals, but it didn't. If anything, I think it really added to the VN in some way I can't quite put my finger on -- perhaps by adding a certain level of charm and grace -- but it fits. The harem endign CG doesn't save due to a glitch of some sort, so if you want that on hand then be sure to either screenshot it or make a save right before/during the scene with that CG. On the topic of the CGs, they're all beautiful. There is one in Scherza's route that looks unfinished as it doesn't have the same level of shading as any other scene does (CG or not), but it's still well done.

The soundtrack is great and hasn't ever felt like it wasn't in sync with the moment. It's got a more of a classic and acoustic sound to it overall than being heavy on electronics, which works especially well with the story being told. During more intense moments of action there's a more electronic beat which, while it works in the moment, overal sounds a little out of place with the rest of the soundtrack. Yet since it fits with the moments it plays during it can be shrugged off in spite of being a noticeable change. Even the main title screen music is great and catchy. I do wish there had been a track similar to it used somewhere in the story itself, but what's there already is already lovely.

Speaking of, the story is fantastic. Sure, it can be boiled down to girl finds strange book, meets demons, goes to their world, but what really brings the story to life are the characters themselves each with their own unique personality. Depending on the ending you go for, some characters get less screen time than others, but that's to be expected. It's definitely worth going through the VN multiple times for different endings to really get a feel for what each character is like. Of the characters, Scherza's won me over the most. The one thing that struck me as a little odd was the portrait for Aria's mother as she's always looking away, off into the distance, rather than at Aria/the player, so it felt a little strange to see her on screen. She's doesn't show up too much though so it's an oddity that can be overlooked.

The writing is straight forward, nothing overly eloquent sounding -- nothing superfluous -- plain, you could say, but not without finese. It's not uncommon for me to sometimes start skimming while reading VNs, but not with this one. Starlight Vega held my attention from beginning to end without my interest dwindling even after the first playthrough of it.

The soundtrack, characters, and the choices you make where each causes a clear impact and change on the story's direction, all come together to tell a beautifully written story with loveable characters, and strong soundtrack to accompany it and further set the mood of the scenes.

I'd absolutely recommend this VN, it's one of my favorites. If you aren't certain about whether you want to get Starlight Vega or not, wait until it's on sale. It's worth the money either way and since it has seven outcomes, and with the achievements scattered between the majority of the routes, there's absolutely replay value for the completionists and even for those who want to see how the different routes pan out as the changes are significant between each route taken. It's also worthwhile to play through at least every individual character's good ending to get the full depth of the story as well. The harem ending is more for the fun of it being a harem conclusion.

If you're feeling unsure about getting Starlight Vega at full price then wait until it's on sale as it may feel like you don't have to expect quite as much if you get it then than at full price (though the VN is still very much worth full price to me as well). I will state that I got Starlight Vega on sale, but I wouldn't mind spending the full amount on it since I know I'm going to go back and read it again even though I've gone through the endings already.",1514784088,1693975677,True,8,0,0.59463965892791748,0,True,False,False,False,,,

（由于本人只通且只想通melody路线，故本评测带有强烈的主观色彩，请注意）

  Starlight Vega（中译：星光织女星）是一款典型的欧美百合向视觉小说。虽然画风可能有些人不能接受（女主母亲的立绘一上来差点把我劝退），但因此错过一部优秀的百合gal实在是太可惜了。

  我这个人虽然很喜欢视觉小说，尤其是百合向的视觉小说，但说实话，近年来我玩的VN是越来越少了。生活中的压力让我变得浮躁，越来越倾向于快节奏的游戏，很难得静下心来玩VN了。

作为为数不多的能让我一口气通关的VN，starlight vega对我而言自然是极具魅力的。原生的英文阅读流畅，画风除了女主她妈和她祖父以外看多了你就习惯了，我个人还蛮喜欢的。

  选择支很丰富给玩家提供了多种展开的可能性，虽然有些让我隐隐地感到一丝恶意（为什么和melody在一起后还会有反悔去和lyria好的选项!!!不要虐我melody啊!!!）当然最优秀的当然还是剧本。

 melody是女主的闺蜜，转到女主班上后因为邻座的女主主动打招呼聊天而慢慢成为朋友，逐渐日久生情喜欢上善良的女主（走melody路线的话你会发现当时女主就有好感想和melody交朋友所以主动亲近，看来本来这事就有戏）。melody美丽温柔，为女主的事情一直在忙碌。她是个对超自然很热衷的人，喜欢阅读，对古老的事物和发现新事物都很有兴趣，是故事发展的重要因素。
  
  melody路线可以用“好想急死你”来形容（我一开始以为不去展开超自然剧情，避免lyria的出现就能稳走melody路线了，结果直接跳end…看来没个推动还真难走到一起）。

  强势直白的外星女lyria的出现给了暗恋女主的melody巨大的危机感，所以她一开始对lyria颇不客气，自己一个人埋头为女主的事劳碌，期间还得听女主一遍又一遍地说“你是我的好朋友”。吃lyria醋的时候大多会忍着自己难过，女主担心她时又不敢说。

  melody路线里女主其实相当多的地方都能看出对melody的好感，不仅夸melody漂亮就有很多次，遇到事情会想念melody，连“奇怪的想法”有时都会冒出来（这里很多糖!）。只是前期两个人一个懵懵懂懂搞不清自己的情感，另一个支支吾吾掩饰自己，好不容易鼓起一次勇气最后还逃了，真是太让人着急。

  melody路线中lyria的存在非常强，作为一切故事的缘由，lyria开放不掩饰的性格堪称melody的天敌。前期床咚女主，后期得知女主和melody在一起后强吻女主。最初我很不喜欢lyria，不过后期她有情有义的表现改变了我的看法。
  
 拯救女主，当女王答应了条件要牺牲melody拯救星球时站出来对抗姐姐并拯救情敌，后期也显得很洒脱，最后甚至和melody改善了关系。那句对melody说的“你要照顾好她”让我感慨不已。

  祖父是彻头彻尾的反派角色，前期一个神龙见首不见尾，甚至颇受憧憬的人物却那样自私自利，让人寒心。女王虽然是为了自己的子民，后面也和好了，但总让人觉得不舒坦。反观lyria的小使魔（其实是女王的），被melody感动后不顾女王命令对祖父动手和lyria一起保护melody，很让人感动。

  melody是个优秀的人，她的美丽让女主还没意识到感情时就被其吸引。她可以原谅欺骗了她更把她送到外星的小使魔，让那个整天抱怨着“最讨厌人类”的家伙不惜反抗主人的命令去保护她，称她为最喜欢的人类（melody小天使!!!）。她可以体谅女王决定牺牲她的苦衷，可以和情敌lyria成为朋友。

 melody是才华横溢的，她记忆力优秀，能很快明白并尝试掌握超自然力量（melody熟练后第一个魔法就是传送到女主身边方便晚上一起睡，haha）她可以流利地进行双语转译。几年后她甚至可以稳定地建立通往织女星的传送，按理说这时她完全可以和女主过小日子不管织女星的事情，可她喜欢那个新世界，想念自己的朋友，对女王没有恨，和一辈子情敌lyria的关系也变得友善了。她甚至感谢织女星让女主和她走到了一起。melody宽容，不自私，重视友谊，对爱执着坚定。

  starlight vega的剧本扎实，感情发展平稳合理，心里描写非常出彩。（melody线就算在一起了后面还好几个跌宕起伏，稍稍有点虐不过剧情把控得不错不算喂药）。

  一开始是女主迟钝，不知道为什么melody情绪不稳定，lyria都吐槽“melody她还真是辛苦了”。还好因为意外女主看到了melody的记忆加上lyria的助攻明白了自己的感情（lyria都看不下去了喂），melody也不知道是不是被女主膝枕枕晕了头，紧要关头还来“不知道你看到了什么但可能有误会”这套，还好女主这时已经坚定了一发告白解决问题，然后就亲了个爽……咳咳。

  总的来说我非常喜欢melody路线啦，俗话说“陪伴是最长情的告白”，好闺蜜比起天降外星人甚至是外星王女还是更适合的。当然其他路线肯定会告诉我们其他两位女主的加分点和黑点，没玩的我自然不会妄加评论。不过怎么想那俩线肯定都要虐melody啊!（我讨厌后宫线，当然be线就更别提了）一想到melody默默付出那么多还得看着闺蜜被野女人拐跑我就累觉不爱了。我相信羁绊的力量不会输给天降系，我相信努力的人终获回报。

  [spoiler][strike] 谁反对melody我就打爆谁的狗头.jpg	[/strike] 	[/spoiler]

  几年后melody和女主搬出去住在公寓，女主努力工作，在背后默默支持着melody，melody能够稳定地打开空间通道与织女星的朋友们相会。过上了理想中平凡却又不平凡的生活，一起经历了风风雨雨的她们手牵着手，相视一笑。

  “无论是在地球还是在织女星，无论是平凡的日子还是超自然的事态--”
   
  “我都会陪着你，去到两个人的海角天涯”

While it doesn’t do anything especially original, it tells an enjoyable story, with a fairly serious and tasteful approach to relationship arcs and rather timid, but well thought-out eroticism. While it has love scenes, it’s presenting them with literary descriptions rather than explicit artwork (illustration stops at partial nudity) – the approach I very much appreciated.

The artwork in general and music, while somewhat simple, complement the story very well and some situational illustrations were a joy to look at, even though they weren’t super-heavy on details. The “indie” feel is very much present through the whole experience, but never gets in the way, even if sometimes I had a feeling that the writing could be better if a larger team working on it. I think I’ve also seen rare misspellings and strange grammar. It wasn’t a major complain though and the story itself was very much gratifying – while short, it didn’t lack amusing dialogues, good character development and rewarded multiple playthroughs, uncovering new lore, showing the major story points from new angles depending on the player choices and offered a bunch of distinct endings.

One thing that made me wonder is the portrayal of yuri romance itself – while I think that the writing for the main character seemed solid and believable in most ways, her (and other female character’s) sexual attraction towards women is never explicitly mentioned/elaborated upon. As Aria is a high-schooler, she’s either atypically certain about her orientation or the writers just didn’t think to add that angle to the story – and I think it would benefit from it quite a lot. She seems uncertain about her feeling and doesn’t properly read her best friend Melody’s intentions, but the way it was presented in the story makes her feel just dense, rather than properly confused by her unusual feelings. Other than that I find all the characters rather interesting and having decent depth for such a short story (although it shows mostly if you follow their separate romance routes).

[b]In general, I’ve found this game very enjoyable and I can recommend it to anyone liking VNs or just looking for a nice romance story to read. I’ve bought it on -50% sale though and it felt like pretty much the right price for the content offered, $15 could have been a bit too much[/b].

In the end I don't regret a thing. I was impressed by the quality and will say that it was well worth the price.

The art is great. The characters are well designed and have satisfyingly expressive sprites, and the CG's are of great quality.

I enjoyed the story, or pehaps I should say stories. My choices always felt like they mattered, which is obviously a big plus for any game with multiple story paths. The routes all felt like they were developed equally, rather than there being some routes written significantly better than any others. The good endings all came to satisfactory conclusions, and resolved their problems differently, rather than having one main story path with ""detours"" depending on your choices.

The romance was tasteful (perhaps aside from one particular ending) and well executed, each girl felt different but all were pleasant.

I can heartily recommend Starlight Vega to anyone at all. It's a great starting point for those new to visual novels (or new to yuri), as well as a great visual novel for veterans who just want a fun read.

Characters are not too plain as well, to be fair some might say Aria (the MC) is plain and boring, but isn't that suppose to be the idea of most VN? Plain MC gives the accessible feeling and might even intentionally made as such so the players feel that themselves are closed to what the MC is. Not always a bad choice.

好吧，废话不多说了，下面谈谈我的玩后感吧——
首先谈谈女主的闺蜜Melody，她是一位聪慧温柔，害羞腼腆的小姑娘，走她的专情线，你会感受到女主对她情感的转变。不得不说，看着两人的关系如何从朋友到恋人的蜕变是一个非常有趣的过程，当然女主的迟钝一度令我恨不能敲碎她的木鱼脑袋，所幸她喜欢的人也喜欢着她，双向暗恋sweet！
第二位出场的是魔女Lyria，她是一位热情奔放，方式直接的魅力女子。初次登场的时候，几乎一下子就吸引了我的注意，走她的路线估计是三位可攻略女主里最搞笑的一条线路了。通过女主对Lyria的深入了解，你会发现这位总是面带笑容，热情洋溢的女子也有忧伤的一面。（然而最后结局里她的表现却不怎么让我喜欢，个人看法罢了）
第三位也是整个游戏中最为神秘的女性——女王Scherza，她的出场方式比较奇特，通过梦境与女主产生联系，走她的专情路线，女主会主动帮她夺走魔法书之类的。其实从一开始，我一直以为Scherza是一个反面角色，但是通过走另外两名女主的路线你会渐渐发现她所做出的一切只不过是迫不得已罢了。毕竟她作为一名女王，在亲人离散，子民遭受诅咒，自己又无计可施的情况下会做出伤害其他人的行为都是情有可原的。
攻略Scherza的话，你将会看到一个真正的她，并没有她表面看上去的那么残酷冷漠，在面对女主的时候甚至会表露出她口是心非、傲娇的一面，总而言之，她是一个被塑造的很丰满的角色（唯一想吐槽的就是她和女主跳舞时的CG能不能不要那么敷衍啊QAQ）。
最后借用一下女主对女王Scherza的评价——她就像一朵带刺的玫瑰花，试图用自己的刺蛰伤所有靠近她的人。

Un beau mélange de fantastique et de romance, saupoudré d'un peu de mystère. Je ne m'y attendais pas au premier abord, mais c'est un sacré coup coeur.


Point positifs :

- Les musiques, elles apportent un vrai plus au jeu
- 3 arcs avec chacun une bonne et une mauvaise fin (+ un dernier arc caché dispo que après avori fini les 3 premiers)
- L'histoire, on sent que c'est travaillé et réfléchi, c'est cohérent.
- Des CGs magnifiques, qui viennent réhausser les dessins des persos qui semblent plus brouillons (mais c'est le style qui veut ça je pense)
- Un style graphique peu commun, ça change des trucs trop manga
- SHERZA !!! (un gros coup de coeur pour elle) <3 <3 <3 <3

Points négatifs :
- Un style graphique peu commun qui pourrait ne pas plaire à tous
- Quelques bugs scénaristiques suite à certains choix (merci les guides de la communauté pour ne pas faire les mauvais choix xD) ou pour débloquer toute la galerie de CGs

J'aurais pu mettre le prix en point négatif, mais je ne regrette tellement pas mon achat. 14h de jeu pour en venir totalement à bout, le pire c'est que j'ai pas vu le temps passer, mais pas de sentiment d'inachevé ou autres sentiments négatifs.

[i]Starlight Vega[/i]’s plot, while not spectacular, could have made for a decent story if the characters’ writing had been strong. It isn’t. Everything in this visual novel feels flat, and falls flat. 

This is especially disappointing as Aria at first looks like a strong-willed protagonist, but in reality over half of her lines are just bland descriptions of her surroundings and of the people next to her, without any personal input that could give the reader some hints about her character and the way [b]she[/b] sees her new world (as she has just moved in a new house, where all the supernatural events unfold).

The game attempts to touch at political intrigue, but its obvious main appeal is romance, and if I were to find three phrases to describe it, it would be tedious, unconvincing and full of bad fanservice. The first two go hand in hand. The characters do not spend enough time together or don’t have any significant bonding moments/common traits that would justify the sudden feelings Aria has for her love interest (or is ‘she’s good-looking’ alone supposed to be convincing ?) And when they eventually kiss and declare their love for each other, the writing makes it feel so unrelatable I just couldn’t rejoice, empathise with the characters, find them cute or any other positive feeling. I would make an exception for Melody’s route, which was the better of the three and felt more solid to read, but unfortunately it still couldn’t shake off the boredom the game had brought about in me at this point.

Fanservice is my main problem with the game, though. If it just consisted of a few raunchy CGs, it’d be fine. The issue is, this game (and especially Lydia’s route, which I had the misfortune to play first) makes its plot unfold thanks to a certain amount of gross tropes you would traditionally see in some bad fanfiction, and not a game you have to actually pay for. Namely, Lydia can’t seem to stop herself from sexually assaulting the main character (who eventually returns her feelings despite this, [i]obviously[/i]), even after the latter makes it clear to her she isn’t interested in her advances (there is even an achievement for this scene, what the hell). I know it’s supposed to be sexy and to make the player want to pursue a romance with her, but I found it off-putting and it made me feel really uncomfortable, especially considering the fact it happens several times. The so-called harem ending is also terrible in that aspect, as it is out-of-character for at least half of the characters involved and a cheap excuse to show us a CG that doesn’t even appear in the gallery by the end.

The art is decent and probably the best aspect of the game, but it lacks polish and one cannot overlook the fact that the same backgrounds are repeatedly used for different locations and the sprites lack diversity. The music is forgettable.

Tl;dr: I’m saddened to be writing this kind of review for a f/f dating sim, as there are not so many of them, but [i]Starlight Vega[/i] being at best tedious to read and at worst trying to justify romance with creepy tropes and cheap feelings, I just can’t recommend it, especially if you’re LGBT+ and looking for good representation.

At first I was disappointed, because right from the beginning I knew which girl to follow [spoiler]Melody of course[/spoiler], but I neglected the other one, so after about an hour instead of finding true love I found myself a bad ending -.- About eight hours later I was again disappointed, because now I had run through all the dialogue options and had nothing more to explore. In between lay the most enjoyable gaming experience I had this year.

Especially compelling was the heartwarming combination of artwork and character design. Aria is a believable main character, whose rational distance to her own emotions and devotion to her friends make her really likeable. Her facial expressions were charming and fitting throughout the whole story. All the love interests played well together and I enjoyed the route of every single one of them. Their traits, design, interaction and the fantastical story made me truly care for them and I was happy, when the story proceeded happily and sad, when I got bad endings. The CGs are wonderful. This altogether created an affection of the higher kind for me, because I didn’t just feel for the characters in the game, but also felt the satisfaction of experiencing a subtle hint of the author’s own joy in creating them so diligently.

Music was pretty good too. The title theme was catchy and I found myself browsing through the CG sets to enjoy the tune some more. Rest of the music was also fitting despite being less memorable.
I also liked the right amount of sensitivity in the intimate scenes as well as the use of language for those and the story as a whole. A lot of thought was put in the narration, which made the novel a comfortable read.

I won’t deny that there are still some flaws. The male characters were in no way as charming as their female counterparts. The backgrounds were sometimes inappropriately repetitive. There are holes in the plot or at least some parts were not as well played out as they could have been [spoiler]the whole curse for example[/spoiler]. Some choices seem rather irrational, too (and my last achievement and the best CG are still locked -.-). But who cares, right? (maybe all the people who aren’t into demon yuri visual novels with choices…[strike]and those who can’t appreciate good games xp[/strike]

okay without personal bias I would still highly recommend this game, if you are open minded to Indie VN and Yuri, although maybe the flaws hit a bit harder here. And if for reasons unbeknownst to me you cannot connect with the characters, then maybe the art is all that’s left for you.

But with personal bias this game was just my cup of tea.

Things I did like:
+ overall art direction
+ love scenes were touching and feel integral to the story, unlike many other VNs

Things I didn't like:
- narrative is very broken between the scenes, it's like some scenes were built for a specific route, and then stitched together in other routes with no respect to overall flow in these specific transitions, so you'll see characters being very polar all the time
- some scene transitions make no sense: there's no transition at all between some disjointed scenes, with no lead up or explanation after the fact, so you'll be confused at times at what exactly is happening
- character motivations are very narrative-forced, especially in Scherza and Harem arcs
- overall plot twists are almost non-existent: you can take everything at face value and will not be mistaken; also, some endings a conflicting with in-universe laws that were established in other endings (one glaring example is for harem ending and traveling between worlds)
- consistency: all-ages CGs for love scenes often do not match quite explicit texts; also some random swears for no apparent reason in a couple of scenes
- very limited art selection for characters, as well as for backgrounds, even for key scenes (like, when Aria wearing a dress before the mishap, some backgrounds reused 3-4 times for different places); I don't demand completely new assets, but make some minor changes with details that reflect the narrative? Can we have at least 2 mom versions: for home and for school pickup, etc?
- music is ok, but it often doesn't match the scene, and overall there's no overarching theme to it

To start: There are two things I adore. Good characterization, and Yuri. Seeing women loving women depicted well is amazing. That is definitely on display here. If you're like me, and don't even need a plot, stop now. Buy it.

If you do? There's conflict. It's not SonoHana level fluff where all you're doing is making decisions to get one more scene at the end. I say that as someone who loves SonoHana, but sometimes wants a bit more to sink my teeth Each route has some conflict, and you really feel that even the ""good"" decisions come with some complications. These are characters you can really feel for.

Do you like characters shown with writing that makes you cry? Play this.
Do you like good writing that can make you laugh or cry or both at once? Play this.
Do you like a plot that comes from conflict within the characters' desires? Play this.

The only thing I find not perfectly to my personal preferences is that I wish the protag was a bit more gung ho about being in a yuri story from the start... but she does grow into it very well.

I personally really loved the music. It's a bit repetetive and seemed to turn off randomly if I left a scene up for too long, but this never felt super unwelcome. The sexy music is sexy. The sad music is sad. The dramatic music is dramatic.

I really like that our humble narrator is visible in the corner of the screen and reacting to events with different expressions at almost all times, which gives us visual shorthand as to how she's feeling at any given moment.  That's a really smart piece of design other VNs would do well to steal.

Don't get me wrong; it isn't a terrible game.  As far as visual novels go, it isn't too bad.  The soundtrack is mostly forgettable.  The best thing about this visual novel was the art, I think. 

Let's start with the basics; character and plot.  The characters, as most characters go, are fairly cliche; that's nothing too bad, though.  It's really difficult to come up with original characters nowadays; what matters more is what you do with them.  The protagonist caught my interest; while nothing innovative, she is a solid and relatable female lead, somewhat intelligent and quirky enough to keep my interest. 

The supporting cast is much of the same; all are somewhat interesting.  

But one of the biggest problems of this VN are revealed; every single character is shallow.  None of the characters have much background at all, only that which is immediately relevant to the plot.  While that isn't normally a bad thing, this ties in to a major failing of the plot, but we'll get to that later.

So the characters aren't anything special.  I won't remember this VN in a week.  There isn't anything particularly memorable about this.

Moving on to the plot and general play.  Don't be fooled by my time; this VN only has about 6 hours of playthrough; I spent the other six AFK.  There's really not much playability in this despite there being four different routes and about eight different endings.  At $15 USD, that's a fairly hefty price as far as games go.  There are quite a few few VNs out there with much more playability, so expect to eat through this fairly quickly.  

The routes and options don't always make sense.  The [spoiler]secret harem[/spoiler] route, for example, is out of character for at least two of the characters.  And while we're talking about love and plot, well, we should note that there are so few interactions between characters, relatively, that it's hard to believe that enough time has passed for the protagonist to love any of the characters.  The only one that makes sense is the Melody route, since they've been friends for a while, but the protagonist's thoughts on love are done awkwardly.  The fact that there isn't really a sense of time to the story when they [spoiler]go to Vega[/spoiler] doesn't help. 

There's extremely limited backstory to the game; only what matters to the plot is talked about, and that creates a sense of shallowness and disconnect that makes it hard to really feel.  Outside of the story, the characters really are relatively normal...and while that helps us relate a little, it also means that we aren't really emotionally invested in them.  

Much of the [spoiler]Vega[/spoiler] portion of the game, I think, could've been written better, especially in regards to [spoiler]the curse.[/spoiler]  Everything happens in a relaxed manner despite the urgency of the situation and what could have easily been an emotionally deep tale just feels boring and mundane.  

The climax of the story is atrociously dull; the only route that intrigued me was, again, Melody's route, because there was a little bit, and JUST a little bit, of emotional suspense.  The story itself already indicated that all of the characters had [spoiler]plot armor[/spoiler] so that wasn't too good, either. 

The bad routes just felt off, too.  One of the choices that makes sense actually leads you to the bad route, which was weird and disappointing.  A lot of the farewell scenes were rather unrealistic, and only [spoiler]the Melody Bad End Route[/spoiler] was actually particularly bad; everything else was neutral.  

There's this entire world out there, and it's barely, barely explored; only the plot-relevant details are mentioned, and some fluff within the routes.  That was disappointing.

The music is nice, but not special.  The sound effects were good, though.  

The art was definitely the saving grace of this piece.  The CGs and sprites are gorgeous.  Enough said.

The smut is...intriguing.  Only [spoiler]Melody's route, again[/spoiler] actually went into it in any detail; every other route cuts off.  What's there is pretty nice to read.  

All in all, this visual novel isn't bad.  What exists is enough to interest.  The single failing of this piece is that there is a lot of potential to create an emotionally thrilling VN...and that potential is only scratched at in this story.

It's not special, and, as a result, simply isn't worth $15 dollars.

First of all, the most important aspect for a VN: The story.

Quite simple, yet refreshing and interesting. The fundament is solid and enjoyable. Only problem I see is its shallowness due to fast and superficial pacing and writing. With its 10-14 hours playtime it's by far not one of the longest and most detailed VNs. It manages to convince you nonetheless, as long as you dont expect too much detail. 

Secondly: The characters.

Whats brings the story to life are its inhabitants and Starlight got a small, but nice and loveable cast. The main heroine is easy to understand and follow, and takes you into her world quite easily. Furthermore, the three love interests are enjoyable and realistic. Once again, a little more depth wouldnt hurt, but you can still get into them.

Thirdly: The music.

Here does SV shine the most. The music is on point and well made. Enhances the atmosphere perfectly and gives each scene alot more depth and feeling. 

Lastly: The scenery/visual composition:

Not out of this world, but also not too shabby. It fulfills it duty and gives you a visual impression of the story and its characters. Though there are not many background sceneries, each of them is detailed and provides a good atmosphere.

[h1]The story[/h1]
You play as Aria, a girl who moves into her grandfather’s old house. While exploring the upstairs study one night, she and her friend Melody accidentally unleash a flirtatious demon named Lyria, who spent the past fifty years in a stone. After freeing her from her prison, the two become attached by a ‘lifestone’, which means Lyria can’t go far from Aria without feeling repercussions, and vice versa. Now Aria, an ordinary highschool girl, must find a way to free herself from Lyria, who seems to crave the exact opposite. Add to that the increasingly realistic dreams plaguing Aria, the sexual tension between Aria and a select few girls around her, and the supernatural phenomena – it seems like Aria’s life will never be the same again.

The story overall is interesting but I was not captivated by it and it has failed to immerse me into the story because the individual routes each has their weak points in terms of there were some important points that were not explored on that individual route, for example 1 of the routes did not explain or even hinted of how Lyria got trapped in the stone. I am not sure which route is that. Apparently among all the character routes I liked the harem ending the most it felt more interesting than the other “good routes” as it touches on almost every topic and the characters in harem ending has more “backbone”they all group together and fought “Reid”.

Character wise I like Scherza: Current Queen of the demon realm. She has a very icy personality and little like for humans. The pacing her route is alright it is not to fast or slow. The main reason I liked her from the start is provably because of her looks and character design she fits into the character personality perfectly, she looks so intimidating and “royal like”.

[h1]Audio and Visual elements[/h1]
[b]Visual Elements –[/b]The visual elements is provably the most distinctive feature in the particular visual novel [well for me] I absolutely adore the artwork and art style being used in this visual novel and it is very consistent with character sprites,  not to mention the backgrounds are very beautiful as it compliments nicely with the overall art style.

[b]Audio Elements –[/b] The music sets the mood for every situation, but it is not memorable and did not leave an impact on me. I think they could have done better for the music because I felt that certain soundtracks was repeated too many times and some were just plain boring.

[h1]To Sum Up [/h1]
To sum up do I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer, yes. People who likes yuri will definitely enjoy Starlight Vega as it is very heavily yuri themed and the romance does not feel forced. Something else worth mentioning is that for the yuri scenes they are all very descriptive and detailed, overall an enjoyable read from the start to finish.

В этот тёплый весенний день позвольте мне поделиться с вами некоторыми моими мыслями и эмоциями касательно данной визуальной новеллы, и, не тратя больше времени, начнём:
I. С самого начала мне следует обозначить для вас два важных положения относительно Starlight Vega, а именно то, что игра полностью на английском языке, и о переводе пока ни слухом ни духом (я во всяком случае), это раз, и два - это юри-новелла, что подразумевает возможность завести главным героем-девушкой романтические отношения  с персонажами исключительно женского пола (других тут практически и нет). Итак, прояснив основополагающие моменты, двигаемся дальше.
II. По моей маленькой традиции начну с рисовки, как с визитной карточки, ""лица"" любой новеллы. Она мне понравилась практически во всех моментах: CG, BG, спрайты - всё справлено на ура, с душой, чувствуется, что художник подошёл к своему делу с большой охотой и старанием. Радует большое разнообразие эмоций у спрайтов и множество CG. Единственная даже не то чтобы ложка дёгтя лично для меня, это то, что в рисовке спрайтов чувствуется некая ... неловкость что ли, скромность. А может мне просто креститься надо. 
III. Сюжет вначале может показаться тривиальным: главная героиня вместе со своей мамой получает в наследство старинный дом. Вскоре после въезда во время осмотра дома Ария (ГГ) вместе с подругой обнаруживает таинственную комнату, полную древних фолиантов и странных предметов. Героиня дотрагивается до одного из них (а может не дотрагивается? выбор ваш), и с этого начинаются её приключения. Должен признать, что сюжет меня завлёк, и вёл до самого конца, и в этом заслуга качественно прописанных диалогов, истории, и стиля написания в целом, но не только. Об этом далее.
IV. Музыкальное сопровождение. Очень понравилось, музыка подобрана точно в тему, будь то ситуация или персонаж (да-да, у персонажей есть темы). Бывало, что во время чтения я останавливался просто для того, чтобы послушать звучащую композицию, вот такой бонус к погружению она даёт. Надо будет поискать отдельно.
V. Цена. Вот то, что как ничто другое отваживает людей от приобретения этого произведения в обычное, нераспродажное время. Скажу за себя, совсем не хотел брать даже с 10-процентной скидкой, однако взглянув на скриншоты и отзывы, перекрестившись купил. Не пожалел, как видите, а впрочем и так никогда не жалею. Однако ваши кошельки - это ваши кошельки, и решение тоже ваше. Я поддержал разработчика, и рад этому.
VI. В заключение хотелось бы сказать, что оценок я ставить не собираюсь, однако РЕКОМЕНДУЮ эту новеллу всем любителям и не только, и помните, что это моё личное мнение, у вас же обязательно сложится своё, и это замечательно! До встречи в следующих обзорах!",1461086328,1461086383,True,43,3,0.788954555988311768,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The Art is interesting, very much a western style, though admittedly it appears that the person who drew the standard interaction CGs and the one who does the more intimate ones was totally different. The latter being far more high quality, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can get a bit distracting. I imagine this had something to do with more funding. 

Overall the story is fairly simple and choices in the game do make a impact on the various endings you get, and even make sense in most ways in terms of how they turn out.

Starlight Vega is a fairly light hearted love comedy with LOTS of yuri in it. Just subtext? No! This is 100% bona fide yuri with love confessions, kissing, and PG-13 love scenes. (I would still not play this in front of your parents.) Art-wise, it's adequate enough. It's not bad, just adequate. Soundtrack is enough to set the mood. A single run through can easily be done under 7 hours depending on how fast you read. A complete run with old scene skipping took me 12 hours for all endings. Now for the nitpickings.

[u][b]There MAY be some slight spoilers. Read the next paragraph at your own discretion.[/b][/u]





PLOT

[u]Almost 4th ending exclusive:[/u]

There are definitely moments of [i]""it's magic I ain't gotta explain shit""[/i] going on. Sometimes there are story transitions where it may feel a tad forced. This becomes pretty apparent in the unlocked ending with the way the antagonist is disposed of. Wait a gosh darn minute, we had such a pain in the rear time dealing with this twerp in every other route and all of a sudden it's [spoiler]Persona style All Out Attack on the jerk. All of a sudden everyone but the MC just figured out the quickest way to get rid of curse was to beat the living undead shit out of a malevolent spirit. What da hell?[/spoiler] You girls just reconcile out of the blue ridiculously quickly. For one thing, Scherza's [spoiler]abandonment issue[/spoiler] was only really addressed in Lyria's route where she finally learned [spoiler]what really happened 50 years ago.[/spoiler] Even in Scherza's route, she's one heck of an ice queen to woo. The only times Aria really ever interact with Scherza one on one was [spoiler]in a dream when they haven't been kidnapped to Vega.[/spoiler] There have been instances where she does talk with Aria in a more private fashion, but nothing as deep as whatever happened in Scherza's own route enough for Scherza to get romantically interested in Aria...? To sum it up, the 4th ending just seems to parachute in from out of nowhere. There ARE attempts at trying to make this work, but the progress at how we arrived at this point just seems loosely held together by... [spoiler]harem[/spoiler] anime logic. Yes, Kickstarter incentive and etc. I really enjoyed it but it could've done with more polishing.

[u]Choices[/u]

Yes, there are choices. Choices that easily dictate which route you are going to end up on and some do seemingly absolutely nothing. For all the choices, I wish at there are things I can do more of. Ok, the bracelet in the study. It was briefly brought up and [i]never[/i] heard from again. Could've been funny if that was somehow used. The whole thing between Lyria and Scherza was unfortunately only properly addressed in Lyria's route. Aria has no say whatsoever regarding what actually transpired even though she may have come across the diary and whatever Lyria told her. She has 0 influence whatsoever as a main character and I find that very unfortunate as I do want the two of them to get along. 

[u]Characters[/u]

I adore the characters: Aria, Melody, Lyria, Scherza, and Rhihannon. I'm tempted to say Aria has some issues as a MC, but I've seen much worse performance from otome games so I guess she got [i]just[/i] enough done. I feel for Melody, a lot. She really got the shaft in not her endings. Such a good trooper and super friend. Lyria is just Lyria, fairly straight forward. Scherza is a slight mixed bag due to her behaviors in her own route and whatever happened in the 4th ending. The antagonist is... weeeeeaaaaak. Not enough build up.[i] OOoooh, sinister silhouette. That should totally be enough to give it away.[/i] Not quite. I want to dig in into whatever happened back then. It's all just he says vs she says. Seriously, was it really as bad as it was thought or was there enough room for different interpretations? Scherza does paint the situation different than what was described by everyone else. More plot points please.



The story definitely had a few hiccup points, but overall it holds together well enough for me to gloss over the minor pitfalls it have. Would I recommend this to anyone interested in yuri game? Absolutely. I would try to sell this to anyone who's open to a light hearted visual novel. I got great milage out of it.




More nitpicks
I need more save slots though. There just isn't enough for every choice in every route. 
Please check your grammar and spelling again. There are definitely a few mistakes. I think there is also some coding issue in the special thanks section where someone' name shows up as 4 rectangles... I get there are a LOT of people who donated in the Kickstarter, but that's quite the speed at which you are scrolling...
Not everyone plays visual novel on a daily basis. Nowhere was it mentioned that CONTROL key equals fast forwarding. Interface is already incredibly bare boned and could do with that option instead of relying on the keyboard.

They discover that there is a whole other world named Vega, were demons and magic is common place. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say anymore about the story. 

This is a GxG game. Aria gets to romance Lyria, the sultry demon, Melody, her best friend, and Scherza, a mysterious woman she meets in her dreams. After you complete the game you get the harem route where you can go out with all three of them.

It took me around 6 hours to get through (I skipped read text). So it's not that long.

The overall story is interesting. It has its surprises and you do want to know what is going to happen next but I did feel like the resolution for the problem in Vega was resolved in a very anti-climatic way. Like it just gets solved so easy. I was like, “that's it?”. I also felt like some routes just kinda ended. Also, some of the stuff that happens with Aria's grandparents could have been a bit more in depth. I just wanted to know more about them and what exactly happened in the past that lead to the current events, but that's just my personal opinion. Game does give enough info to get the gist of it.

The actual character routes that dealt with the romance were well done. There's some conflict between the characters that makes things more interesting. In each route you learn something new about the overall plot and everything is revealed little by little as you play all three routes. The harem route seems more like an extra.

To get each character route you are given choices. Some lead to bad endings but it's not that difficult to figure out what you did wrong. I was able to get through this game and get all the achievements without a guide. Just save when there is an important choice.

My favorite character was Scherza, I just like those types of cold characters that warm up as the story goes. At first, I didn't like Lyria much but as I played other routes I also ended up liking her too. I liked Melody too and some parts in her route made me feel bad for her. Aria takes a while to realize things. I liked all the characters, even Sid (who seemed annoying at first but I really liked that little guy as I got to know him better).

The CGs are all well drawn except for one that seemed unfinished like they forgot to finish coloring it or something. It's not big deal but it did bother me a bit. The sprites do look different from the CGs but they are fine, well except that Lyria looks older than in her CGs. There are adult scenes but nothing explicit there is an age verification for reason for this page though. As for the backgrounds, some are more detailed than others. 

I did spot some spelling errors but nothing that heavly distracts from the overall reading experience.

Overall, it's a great game and I recommend it.",1460858089,1460858089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It allows you to make some choices here and there that guide you towards a particular ending, but otherwise you'll be spending your time reading--which is fine, because the story is engaging and complex.  [/h1]

.Story.
It's so difficult to comment on this without spoiling anything, so I'll just say that it's cute and fluffy at times, raunchy and suggestive at others. There's political intrigue, humour, fantasy/magical elements, supernatural elements like ghosts and other realms, combat, romance, non-explicit limes... The list goes on. I imagine there's something here for everyone, especially if you're a fan of reading. 

There were only a few typos, which I greatly appreciated. Thank you for your level of polish, Starlight Vega, you beautiful beast. There are also a couple of plot holes (and one big enough to fall into), but I was so focused on the *adorable* romance that I didn't really mind all that much.

.Game play.
What are you, new here? This is a visual novel. Click your mouse and read the text that appears. 

You can save and load at any point, barring when you're in the middle of making a decision, simply by pressing the right mouse button, which is handy. There's also a gallery for all of the CG you unlike by triggering events in the story or as part of the normal playthrough. 

You can play in full screen or windowed, though I preferred the latter because full screen gives you black bars on the sides.

.Soundtrack.
There was never a moment where I felt as though the music didn't suit what was going on in-game. Romantic scenes featured softer, slower tracks and fight scenes featured upbeat electronic scores. The background music kept me immersed in the story, never drawing away from what was happening, but also making what I read that much more memorable because it was so well-suited. 

Hell, I went to the store while playing to see if the store had the option to purchase the soundtrack separately.

-A minor gripe is that some of the sound effects used for things like gusts of wind and magical attacks sound a little hokey.

.Art style.
The game looks great. Kudos to whoever handled the art.  It's all done in a brightly-coloured anime style, and the backgrounds share the same feel. 

The main character's portrait, which is almost always presented in the bottom left corner of the screen, changes expression depending on what's being said. It's a nice touch and very well detailed. The other characters have a host of different positions and facial expressions that are cycled through, which is another nice touch to make them seem more than just some beautifully-rendered image.

-The backgrounds were pretty limited and, though the game takes place in a variety of settings, you only ever see the same series of images; i.e, the bits where you're at school utilize the same image of the woods that you see when you're at home. Again, this is minor. The backgrounds were still nice to look at, it was just a matter of taking a moment to ground myself in what setting the action had moved to.

.Characters.

There are eight main ones who get detailed portraits. Everone else is just a name on the screen. The cast is varied without fulfilling too many over-used tropes like the emo pretty boy or the girl who wants his attention. Not a single character was annoying, which I find tends to happen a lot with this kind of game. That's a major plus.

Characters include demons, humans, and a wyvern. His name is Sid. He's adorable.

Again, not much to be said here without spoiling anything.

.Bottom line.
If you're in the market for a visual novel, this is definitely worth your money. The game looks good, it's well-written, and you'll get multiple playthroughs out of it. I adore this game. It's one of the better visual novels I've played on Steam; I'm only stopping here because it's very late at night. 

Needless to say, I'm hooked. I whole-heartedly give this game my recommendation.

Mouse wheel to scroll back and forth (wheel up is go back)

Also taking notes is recommended for keeping track of everything. Some paths are difficult and notes are useful for getting these.

I played it all day long and it was a nice break from life XD. Though there are some things that might be a bit off, Starlight Vega is a very enjoyable visual novel. Now onto the review 

Story 
I find the story to have some very strong points but also some weak ones. The story overall is very interesting from the book, to how Lyria became trapped in stone, and the curse plaguing Vega. My problem though (and this depends on the route) is that thehe story can be weak at times. I think the story stayed pretty strong in Lyria's route. Not only do you find out who Aria's grandpa is, but you also get to know how Lyria came to be in the stone. Same goes for Melody's route to. Where it falls weak though is when we get to the curse and the book itself at times. I sometimes felt like the curse put on Vega wasn't shown enough and wished to feel more of that dread. I admit in Scherza's route that the curse is a bit better played out, but it kind of ends just like that. Still the story was written well and I will give major kudos to how the creator handle the intimate scenes. 

Characters 

One of the best parts of the game and they are what hold the story together. I'll give my thoughts on all of the main five. 

Aria- Our main character. She is an average yet interesting girl who is put into a tough situation. I'll say Aria is pretty likable. She has a personality and tries her best to deal with all these new things thrown at her. I admit sometimes I kind of wish she had more of a spark, but for what we got I did enjoy her and she made the romance feel true with the girls. 

Lyria- I think the best girl. From the moment I saw her I really did enjoy her personality and flirtatious, yet sometimes forceful attitude. Her route I believe was the strongest and I felt Aria and she were the best match. What I liked most about her route was the pacing with the romance. It felt very genuine and the pair had good chemistry. Also her story felt the most complete and I kind of wish the bad guy was in all of the routes since it made more sense. If I had to pick something I didn't like....well I can't think of it XD. Lyria was really a good and well thought out character. My fav to. 

Melody- Aria's best friend. From the moment I saw this girl's design I knew what she'd be like and I was right. Now don't get me wrong, Melody is a good character and the type of friend I'd want. I admit though she was the most boring of the three, but don't get me wrong, I still liked her character. Her love and care for Aria was really sweet and though I found her route to be the less interesting of the three, I did care for her. Only thing is I think she'd be better as a friend to Aria, but that's just me. Her route was cute though and she really has some beautiful CG's

Scherza-I'll admit, I was a bit surprised by this character. I knew she'd be the cold demon and some may find her not too likable. However Scherza, especially in her own route, shows a great deal of sadness and loneliness through the story due to the events in the past. What surprised me even more was she wasn't a Tsun type character despite being cold. In fact I really felt for the girl in all the routes. Her relationship with Aria was done pretty well to and that last CG in her route is pretty amazing. I did feel like Scherza was the second best matched for Aria to. Some points I didn't like about her route was how sometimes it felt rushed. Though the curse is touched upon more and you do feel sorry for Vega, I wished that it was a bit longer to show more of the problem Vega was facing But the creator did do a good job with pacing in her route, so it's not that big of a problem 

Sid- At first I hated this little guy, but he does grow on you. I can't say much without spoiling anything, but I'll tell you that you will feel sorry for him as you read. 

Art

Art is Starlight Vega is very good. I love how the sprites have  unique style. I admit I wish they had some more outfit variations. It was odd to go from sprites and then to CGs where the girls are wearing something entirely different. Still the sprites are very well done. 

CGs are exceptional. Every single one was done very well and I'll tell you I'll be looking back at them XD. If you can save them do, because Razz did an awesome job. 


Backgrounds are pretty good to. I admit some are better then others, but I never got put off by any. I think the demon castle had some of the best backgrounds. I do think that the castle bed rooms needed just small variations as well, but that's a minor thing. 

Music 

Music is good. Some songs may be a bit off putting, but overall the track was nice hearing. I never turned it off.

Closing Notes 

Starlight Vega is a very good and  fun visual novel. It's the first one I've played straight through in a while. The characters, art and story are overall great and I thank the creator for doing a GxG visual novel that can be enjoyed by all people and not just a certain group. Another thing I appreciate is how she handled the intimate scenes. They are done very well and I feel like if she did a more adult game she'd handle them well. 

Anyway if you're looking for a fun, pure GxG, romance story this is it. The price is far and I think you'll have a good time reading it I know I did =).
