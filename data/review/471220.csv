As an only child growing up I would create different games in order to keep myself amused. It's also part of the reason why I'm such a computer game nerd but that's another story. One of the games that I played was tapping a balloon, a ball, or anything that would have reasonable air time. I would try and keep it from touching the ground for as long as possible. I imagined that there was a world championship of some sort and that I was always trying to qualify. It was stupid and mindless fun. As a result, I always ways to alleviate boredom. I never expected that one day I would find a similar game on Steam. Don't Drop the Bass is exactly that. It is in Steam Early Access and is being developed and published by RadishBox.

[b]Simple Mindless Fun[/b]

The best part of Don't Drop the Bass is that it doesn't take much thought to play. It's very simple. Simply maneuver your dude around the screen and stop the bass fish hitting the floor. Events take place throughout the game that stifles concentration due to distraction. As a result, those who will be most successful will be those able to sustain concentration for the longest. It's a very simple game and is presented in that manner.

[b]Party Game[/b]

I haven't played the multiplayer version of the game. I know, I know. Part of me is still that lonely only child who had to find ways to entertain themselves when I couldn't spend time with my friends. But that's okay because come September our house will be full for a week and we'll be looking for games such as this to play. It's another game that is very accessible to younger players who I think will get a real kick out of it.

There are several multiplayer modes that can take up to four players. These include the co-op mode where anyone can save the fish from hitting the ground at any time; Roulette Versus Mode is a competitive mode where you have to keep the fish in the air on your turn and attack your opponents on theirs; and Slap Versus mode where the object is to slap the fish the most amount of times in a set time period.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

[b]Graphics[/b]

The graphics are well presented and cartoony. However, I do have one issue with them. From time to time I found it difficult in knowing where and when the fish was going to drop. It seems like you have hit gotten into the right position but then you are notified that you have lost a life. This becomes really aggravating and is the one true frustration that I have with the game. I'd like to see this cleaned up and worked on throughout the lifetime of the game being in Early Access period

[b]Sound[/b]

The sound presently in the game is catchy and fitting with the atmosphere and mood of the game. There isn't anything more that needs to be noted about the sound.

[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]

Not yet. The game hasn't got trading cards or Steam achievements. It also fails to use any of the other potential features of Steam.

I'd like to see the game utilize the Steam leaderboard system. The game has already got 'record times' set into the gameplay. It wouldn't take very much effort to incorporate the leaderboard system. As a result of the leaderboard system a competitive spirit could evolve with the game as players see who can the bass from dropping for the longest.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Don't Drop the Bass is an enjoyable game that has rekindled childhood memories of the games I used to play to keep myself entertained. The presentation is cartoon-like and adds to the fun of the game. It has potential to be a very solid casual party game and is suitable for all ages.
