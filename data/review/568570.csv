Через пару лет решил всё таки, что чего-то не понял в ней. Установил заново и просидел ещё 2,5 часа и моё мнение не сильно изменилось. Но теперь могу отметить плюсы и минусы, на мой взгляд.
Плюсы: разнообразие крафта (шмотки, оружие, декор и прочее, всего много)
разнообразие собираемых ресурсов (много крафтов=много ресурсов, но считаю это плюс)
Минусы:
Интерфейс, по моему самый убогий из всех выживачей, что я видел
Отсутствие хоть какого-то сюжета и предыстории, вы просто тупо появляетесь неизвестно где, в трусах, всё - идите выживайте.... Очень странно
Отсутствие кастомизации персонажа, при виде от 3го лица она обязана быть в игре
Игра очень очень оооооочень сильно затянута: Отсутствием бега/ускорения, скоростью крафта, да любое действие персонажа - медленное
Прокачка идёт только от заданий, бредятина
Ну и лично от меня, это самая уе.....ая система ловли и приручения животных, чтобы поймать курицу, которая в отличии от персонажа может бегать нужно попасть ловушкой 2-3 раза подряд, т.е. не 1 раз, а 2-3 подряд, после первого попадания кура убегает и если остановится, то нужно снова попасть 2-3 раза. Какой уникум это придумал? Я  такого маразма вообще нигде не видел.
Периодически животные/гоблины выхватив приличное количество урона - разворачиваются и убегают, а персонаж не может их остановить, по мнению разработчика и не нужно, ведь зверь спустя 20 сек бега отхилиться полностью и нападёт.
Итог: разумеется я не рекомендую это, в данном жанре присутствует много интересных проектов, но данная игра к ним не относится, возможно позже, привыкнув к механике кидания ловушек или появления возможности ловить с первого раза животных, а также появления какого-либо добивания убегающих игра и станет лучше и веселее, но где же столько терпения то взять? Начало/пролог должно быть таким, чтобы заинтересовать игрока делать задания/исследовать мир и вообще проводить тут время. Возможно, когда-нибудь я наберу терпения на прохождение этого шедевра, но пока нет!",1712339452,1712339452,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There is a lot to like about it (which is why it took me a while to give up on it), but ultimately there are some core flaws that I never was able to get past. So I sadly can't recommend this game.

Let's start with the good...
Early game is nice, so long as you stick to your starting area. Keeping the protective layer of plantlife around your base is ESSENTIAL... but so long as you keep it there, home base can become a nice spot for continuous progress. Progress feels nice. New things unlock even more new things and there is always something new to aim for.
The quest path is fairly straightforward. There's always something to work towards, and it teaches you the game as you play rather than throwing you in some odd tutorial world thing.
The scenery is pretty nice for a game of its age. I was particularly fond of the sunflowers.

Then there's the bad...
The controls are a mess. Pulling up the correct menu never felt right, so I ended up unintentionally forming a habit of opening my quest log to access everything else, which flooded my screen with a bunch of windows. Moving around is strange. Invisible wall collisions happen so often that they nearly caused the death of me multiple times. If you're trying to do ANYTHING in build mode, you can't rotate the camera. If you try, you exit build mode... that is just... mind boggling...
Progress is explicitly limited to your little safe zone you started in. Fences within range of enemies WILL be destroyed, so you can never truly claim an area for yourself and spread outward. It really puts a damper on the ""taming nature"" vibe I think the game was going for, and it makes it very difficult to venture out beyond a daylight's worth of distance from base camp. Maybe this is what the larger walls were for, but those were so resource-heavy that I didn't get to it during the 10 hours I spent playing it... partially because...
Enemies respawn when the game loads. This means no matter how much I tried to push back the tide, they always came back and attacked anything I tried to build beyond my safety wall of trees. And if a bear happened to spawn anywhere near my openings in the brush, I couldn't go that way. Even after upgrading my gear multiple times, I could not win against a bear.

Again, I really wanted to like this game. It's an older game at this point, and it looks like they have a sequel out. Hopefully they learned a lot from making this game and used it to make an even better one. This one had enough potential that I'm willing to give the next a try sometime in the future. But if you're on the fence about getting this particular one, I'd personally say it's not really worth it.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

графика и управление первые 5 минут разочаровывали, а потом начался геймплей. 
первый запуск подарил 7 часов веселой добычи бананов, кокосов, прокачки и исследования мира. 
карту открыла не всю, но мир кажется довольно большим. биомы разные и на каждый нужен свой шмот.
хочу отметить приятные саундтреки завязанные на локации.
КООП:
в коопе все получают уровень хоста (я была 8, тиммейт 3. на моем сервере оба 8). 
умер 1 игрок=умерли все. 
так же в коопе не респавнятся мобы после сна и золотишко/мясо/шкуру не добыть.
упираешься в край карты и не можешь дотянуться до вожделенной шкурки или растения.
мой тиммейт фармил пшеницу на базе, а я уничтожила все живое на карте и было грустно, что дяди медведи не нападают, чтобы отдать шкуру на новый сет одежды.

в общем: много гринда, нападают толпой и делают смертельно больно, шкур нужно много, да и всего нужно д0xy@.

The only saving grace is the co op and somewhat chill atmosphere.

+ Can be calming, its nice to just talk with your friend while you chop down trees and work on the main objective little by little, laughing at how bad the game is.

+ Progression is decent, you always know what you need to do and there is always something around the corner for you to keep going.
+ Nice graphics overall.
+ Quite a bit of content like gathering, building, crafting, fighting, alchemy, exploring
+ Co op mode
+ Runs well
+ Picking off enemies can be interesting

- THE GRIND, everyone already talks about this. It is insane. If i didnt play it with two other people in co op mode i would have never played this kind of game. Everything takes ages - not only does everything take a lot of materials but it just takes time to craft everything. 
- View distance is terrible, just like Morrowind from twenty years ago.
- Game is split into regions, your friends and you have to be in the same region which is annoying when some of you want to explore and others craft in the home base.
- enemies can destroy your base very quickly. There is only one spot to build a safe base and that is in the starting zone.
- Ending is terrible. You spend twenty to thirty hours to finally get the Force of Nature and you just get a pop up text box saying ""Congratulations!"". What a letdown.
- Combat is very basic, archery is super bad. Scorpions are very annoying to deal with.
- Enemy variety is strange. It is a mash of random enemies from some 3D store (goblins and undead are fighting together?)

- Jeu vraiment chill et sympathique
- Possibilité de jouer à plusieurs
- Craft et exploration agréables :)


Points négatifs : 

- Le jeu crash très mais TRÈS souvent, que l'on joue seul ou en coop, ceci est très frustrant...Sachant que lorsqu'on relance, bah...les mobs sont revenus aussi et c'est reparti pour du nettoyage :< (le lit est cool pour cela mais ne sert à rien dans ces conditions). Le jeu crash dès fois au lancement d'une partie multi, d'un chargement de carte ou d'une téléportation avec un allié.

- Multijoueur : Les joueurs alliés ne peuvent pas monter le niveau d'eux-même, c'est à l'hôte de le faire, il n'y a pas moyen de faire une partie privatisé (mais bon, le multi étant en bêta, c'est un point négatif qui devrait se régler avec le temps même si le deux est sorti xD). On ne peut pas se téléporter sans forcer l'allié à nous suivre, ce que je trouve dommage car l'un ne peut donc pas explorer pendant que l'autre fait du craft ou de la culture à la base.

- Le gobelin dompté n'attaque pas si on ne lui demande pas de nous suivre et on peut en avoir qu'un. Je trouve ça dommage car ça aurait été cool d'en avoir pour défendre la base d'éventuels envahisseurs (j'ai eu un renard qui a couru à côté de lui sans que celui-ci ne se dise ""il tape la base"" xD). Lors de crash d'ailleurs, il reste là où on a eu le crash et le temps de le rejoindre, il se fait tuer...D'ailleurs un gobelin niveau 3 qui se fait dégommer par des gobelins niveau 1, pas compris...

Résumé : Très bon jeu mais présentant de sérieux problèmes d'équilibre au niveau du jeu (crash intempestifs), c'est dommage car il a du potentiel...Je continuerais d'y jouer car le jeu me plait bien mais il se peut que je l'abandonne un jour pour cette raison vraiment agaçante...Du coup je vais quand même voter ""non"" pour la recommandation car c'est un point vraiment désagréable mais qui, une fois réglé, je repasserais en ""oui"".",1697399942,1697400543,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

- No se puede automatizar prácticamente nada.
- La jardinería es un infierno. Tienes que estar súper encima para cosechar porque tarda muy poco y tienes que estar todo el rato replantando uno a uno cada uno de los cultivos.
- Con un pozo sacas 6 de agua cada rato. Pero 6 máximo. Y cada cultivo requiere 1 de agua. Así que si pones 6 cultivos, vas justo, porque además sale al mismo ritmo más o menos.

The premise of the game is fairly typical of the genre: you basically arrive naked on a huge deserted island populated with  wildlife and monsters, the majority of which will attack you on sight. Your goal is to explore the island, gather resources and craft the items you need to survive, while protecting yourself from the creatures that attack you. The strength and number of enemies increases as you travel further out from your tropical beach starting point, and environmental hardships such as heat, cold and darkness, as well as character status hardships such as health and fatigue, are also part of the game. The leveling process is contingent on reaching various goals, such as crafting newly unlocked items, finding specific resources, or collecting set amounts of different drop-items (such as coins or gems) from defeated enemies. Building a camp is mandatory, since crafting some items (such as a crafting table), which can only be placed inside a structure such as a hut or dugout, are required for level progression. 

Players can pleasantly pass a few hours exploring the island and building a camp, but this can quickly become very tedious once the character has progressed through the first half dozen character levels, as each level requires greater and great effort, which often results in longer periods of grinding and hunting for required items. It should be noted that the ability to craft an item is level-restrictive, which can be very frustrating. 

The last game patch was Oct 14, 2021. 

Final thoughts: 
Because Steam only allows a yes/no vote for recommending a game, I am giving this game a ""YES"" vote, although I feel it should be more of a ""MAYBE"" vote. Although completely playable and a fair time-killer in general, the off-balance leveling system, lack of better late-game progression, unfinished feel (for example, maracas shown in the game trailer mesmerizing enemies have no function in the actual game), and lack of polished features such as being able to label containers makes this game progressively less enjoyable to play once your character has advanced past the first half dozen levels. However, the simplistic nature of the game mechanics, large playable game area, and (as of this writing) under $10 (USD) cost may make some players feel that this game is a bargain for the price.",1689306198,1689308211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

- Sehr große Welt
- Einfach, aber schönes RPG, Rohstoffe sammeln, Sachen craften, Level aufsteigen
- Einige Biome, auch wenn diese teilweise zu groß für dieses Spiel sind

[h1] Kontra: [/h1] 
- Spiel stürzt oft ab, wenn man in einen neuen Kartenbereich kommt
- wenn es nicht abstürzt, ruckelt es dafür ordentlich
- je weiter man auf der Karte kommt, desto schlimmer wird es und der Ton wird ebenso schlimmer, der ruckelt dann auch
- wenn man ein neues Biom findet, kommt gute Musik, warum gibt es sonst keine Melodie in dem Spiel?
- der Gegnerspawn ist zum Kotzen, kaum bist du weg spawnen immer mehr Gegner und du musst alle besiegen, denn die sind schneller als du und machen dir ordentlich Schaden

[h1] Für Erfolgsjäger: [/h1]   
94% gut machbar. Der letzte Erfolg ist für ein Hardcore Spiel. Durch die Steuerung und den Immensen Schaden selbst durch kleine Gegner echt schwer.

[h1] Fazit[/h1]
Ich liebe diese Art von Spielen und auch hier, obwohl es so klein und ich sag mal billig ist, konnte ich 60 Stunden beim ersten Spieldurchlauf verbringen. 

Warum empfehle ich es nicht, wo es alles hat, was mein Herz höher schlagen lässt? Crafting, Coop, erkunden, Farmelemente, Tiere, Kampf, Levelsystem und eine große offene Welt?!

Wie gesagt es ist schön, aber leider auch nervig. Gerade das man immer jeden Gegner besiegen muss, diese viel zu oft spawnen und man teilweise stundenlang zum nächsten Ziel dadurch unterwegs ist, zieht das Spiel ganz schön in die Länge ohne Spannung aufzubauen. Im Co-op geht es noch, weil man die Gegner zusammen verhauen kann, aber alleine...
Hinzu kommen die dauernden Abstürze und das die Musik nur einmal kurz in einem neuen Biom spielt und man sonst die ganze Zeit nur Soundeffekte hat. 
Explodiert bin ich dann, als ich im Hardcore Modus zwei Mal fast fertig war und jedes Mal bei der letzten Scherbe beim teleportieren das Spiel abgestürzt ist und ich dadurch angeblich gestorben bin...",1688571070,1688571070,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by the game's stunning visuals, enchanting soundtrack, and engaging gameplay mechanics. This review is a testament to the incredible experience that Force of Nature offers.

One of the game's standout features is its breathtaking graphics. The attention to detail in the environment is simply astounding. The lush forests, cascading waterfalls, and diverse wildlife create an atmosphere that feels alive and teeming with beauty.

The soundtrack of Force of Nature deserves special mention. The game's musical score perfectly complements the natural setting, enhancing the sense of wonder and adventure. Each track seamlessly blends with the gameplay, making every moment feel epic and magical. The combination of visuals and music truly elevates the gaming experience to new heights.

What sets Force of Nature apart from other games is its unique gameplay mechanics.

Whether I was building my own shelter, crafting tools, or cultivating a garden, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. The game strikes a perfect balance between exploration, resource management, and survival, keeping me engaged for hours on end.

Moreover, the game offers a variety of activities and quests to undertake. From hunting mythical creatures to uncovering ancient mysteries, Force of Nature never fails to surprise and delight.

노가다 장인들을 위한 멋진 노가다 게임!
노가다로 시작해서 노가다로 끝이나지만
매 레벨업시 새로운 장비,음식 그리고 지을거리 등이
생겨나다보니 저도 모르게 계속하게되는 그런 게임이었습니다.
물론 그렇다고 개재밌다 이런건 아니었고,
딱 8천원대 값어치에 준하는 재미였던거같네요.
우선 스토리 그딴것도 없습니다.
그냥 시작하자마자 메인퀘스트를 따라 진행하시다보면
여러분 집과 생산시설, 농장, 도구 그리고 장비들이
하나하나 생겨날것입니다. 
근데 이 메인퀘스트들은 매 레벨마다 
3,4개씩 한정되어있기때문에,
다음 퀘스트 진행을 위해서는
레벨업에 필요한 요구사항들을 충족시키고
레벨업을 꼭 해주셔야됩니다.
문제는 그러는 과정이 진짜 엄청난 노가다...
추후 동물들을 길들여 자원을 생산하고
고블린을 내편으로 만들어 용병으로
데리고 다닐 수 있는 등 점점 삶이 편해지기는 한데, 
어쨋든 이 게임은 친구랑 함께해야 
훨씬 편하고 빠른 플레이가 가능할것같네요.
뭐 저야 혼자서도 충분히 재미있게 플레이했지만
하는동안 제 원형탈모가 짙어진거에 대해서는
누굴 탓 할 수가 없었습니다.

[단점들]
제가 이 게임을하면서 가장 힘들었던 부분은
좁은 인벤토리, 불편한 조작법, 개느린 이동속도
정도를 꼽아볼 수 있었는데, 뭐 이로 인해 이 게임이
노가다 게임이된게 아닐까 싶네요.
계속하다보면 중간중간
""이게 도대체 내 인생에 무슨 도움이 된다고 이 노가다를 해야하나?""
라는 생각에 잠길때가 많았던거같습니다.

[팁]
전투하다 죽으면 템들 개많이 잃기때문에
죽을거같으면 바로 esc눌러서 일시정지시키고
게임 종료 누른뒤 새로 접속하면
기지에서 아무일 없었다는 듯 다시 깨어납니다.

[결론]
저는 14시간째 즐기고있는데 아직 3분에2도 못끝냈습니다.
제가 볼때 총플탐 20시간이상은 족히나올거같네요.
이 게임은 할인을 자주해서 1700원에
구매할 수 있는 기회가 자주 오지만, 
솔직히 정가 8천원 값어치도 충분하기에
저는 정가에도 추천할만한거같네요.

You start out on a beach in nothing but a pair of pants, like you've been shipwrecked or something.  Starting quests are the simple stuff (find a good stick to dig with, tie a stick to a sharp stone to make a knife, build a fire, etc.).  You move up to things like build a straw hut, chop down trees, forge metals out of ore, and grow some crops.  Eventually you have to fight other creatures like goblins, bears, and foxes.

The crafting and building menus are very complex and very numerous.  Sometimes when I need to craft an item, I find it hard to remember which ""station"" I need to be at in order to craft that item (the fire, the anvil, the forge, etc.).  Animals like rabbits and chickens are very hard to catch and kill in the open.  Trapping animals is a pain as the traps often don't work.  And combat is as plain vanilla as you can get.  Simply click on your enemy repeatedly until either they, or you, die.

Biggest gripes?  Firstly, when you die, you lose a lot of the items in your inventory.  It's the penalty for dying, I guess.  Secondly,  resources don't grow back or respawn, so you have to play conservatively.  For example, once you shake all the coconuts off a tree, they don't grow back.

-беготня скучная, медленная и с каждым разом все дальше, есть конечно порталы но забыв песок для него, в джунгях я его так и не нашел что бы построить и не бежать обратно

+цена (купил с купоном за 22 pуб)

Saying the combat is lame is an understatement. It consists of trading blows with your enemy using your choice of clubs, with no dodging, skills, or other abilities. To make it even worse, half the enemies run away when close to death, with your slow half run speed you have no chance to catch them. Good luck using rocks throw and finish them off too.

あまり続けてやろうとは思えないので、おすすめしないにしておく。

最初は「安いし、しょうがないな」という気持ちがあるから、
多少のことは気にならないが、いくら安いといっても、
その安さを理由に、
ストレスになるようなゲームをおすすめにはできない。

◆まず第一に『操作性が非常に悪い』
何かするのにすごく接近しないとクリックできないし、
ひとつでも画面を開いていると、視野角度が変えられない。
そして、敵に遭遇した際も、自キャラの移動速度が非常に遅いので、
逃げても絶対に追いつかれる。つまり戦う選択肢しかない。
だから戦うのだが、キツネやイノシシなどは、攻撃してくるくせに、
戦って90％以上HPを削って残りが僅か
（あと1撃で倒せるくらいの状態）になると、
さっさと逃げてしまう。
移動速度が全く違うので追っても追いつけない。
結局、ドロップアイテムも何もゲットできないのに、
こちらの体力と気力はだいぶ持っていかれたうえに回復アイテムを消費させられる。
という非常に不愉快な思いをさせられる。

戦闘の際に、何かに嵌って動けず、
身動きが取れずに、死亡してしまう事もある。

※とにかく操作性が悪く、非常にストレスになる。

◆それから、インベントリがすぐに圧迫される。
アイテムによって、イベントリにストックされる数がまちまちなのだが、
この枠がそれほど多くなく、調整が大変。
倉庫代わりのコンテナも作れるが、これも入れられる数が少なく、
すぐにいっぱいになる。

◆そして、一番厄介なのは、動物の『捕獲（テイム）』。
トラップを使うのだが、トラップというから、どこかに仕掛けておけば、
引っかかるのかと思いきや、投げ網のようなものを投げて捕まえるらしい。
「らしい」と書いたのは、これが全く捕まえることができないからだ。
何かやり方があるのだろうが、書いてあることを読んだだけでは全く分からない。
すでに「レベル１０」のクエストもこなせるくらいアイテムはそろっているのだが、
レベル４のクエストの『動物を飼う』が終わらないので、先に進むことができない。
罠（トラップ）を100個以上作って試したが、全く捕まえられない。
それに、飼える動物も決まっていて、どの動物でもいいわけではない。

もう少しプレイすれば何か面白くなるのかもしれないが、
あまり続けてプレイする気にはならなくなったのでこの時点でレビューすることにした。

総評としては、
単純なサバイバル：木を切ったり探索したりを、
暇つぶし程度にプレイをするだけなら、安いし、いいかもしれないが、
あまりお勧めはしない。

This first is the crashes; don't expect to be able to play for more than an hour without the game crashing. The other things are gameplay related issues.

Combat relies on stamina, and each attack uses up your stamina. This is regained by eating or drinking certain foods. If you have no stamina and you're not carrying fourteen litres of coffee then literally all you can do is stand there and watch the enemy kill you. This brings me to my next point: when you die, the game straight up deletes some of your inventory. There is no way to get it back. This is one of the worst mechanics I've ever seen, most things in the game take a very long time to gain, either by crafting or by gathering or by RNG. I've lost an entire session of progress from dying before and this is really not acceptable in a game that is by nature tedious and 'grindy.'

The game is easy tho, enemies are brainless and can be dragged one at a time and once you get to the short sword tech you can just kite most of em without taking a single hit. Currently at the time of this review I'm almost at the end I have all the shards of nature (force of nature) and am grinding for the gems also haven't died a single time, the games only difficulty is from having to grind like a madman for rare resources and the few enemies that can negate your run speed (Yeti and moose, the fox can as well but it hits like a toddler). Some enemies will run away if their HP gets low which makes it quite hard to even catch up as you run like you skipped leg day since birth. I say the game is worth the reduced price for sure, other negatives such as having to manually feed each animal why couldn't they add a trough/feeder for the animals to eat from themselves? also collecting water from the wells or the bee hives there should either be a larger max limit or some sort of collection device to do it automatically. 7/10 game maybe higher if you enjoy grinding.",1663869344,1663869344,True,3,1,0.533851265907287598,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Nice learning tree and crafting system to the game. Lots of different things to find/do. Combat is poor though... it's a single click, no blocking or parrying, no dodging/rolling/sprinting away. You just stand there and click. The game is also a bit grindy, but compared to other similar games I haven't found it TOO bad. One last negative is foliage - If ANYTHING blocks your path (even a leaf) you need to cut the whole tree/bush down. 

It's really not a bad way to spend some time and I definitely think it's worth a couple of £/$/€ if you like this kind of game.

mostly run-of-the-mill stuff, gather resources, craft, fight, explore, and luckily there's [b]no hunger or thirst[/b] to manage, there's even [b]a bit of auto-regeneration[/b], though I read that [b]protection against the cold is necessary in later biomes[/b]. I never got that far though.

[b]I also like how progression works, on paper anyway.[/b] there are a bunch of quests, largely regarding crafting, which of course involves gathering and fighting, and after they're done, you can gain a level. unfortunately, a bunch more resources are also needed, so might as well grab more than the quests demand (requirements can be checked anytime). stats go up and new recipes and related quests unlock, so [b]guided progression, if you will, but you're still mostly free to do what you want within your means[/b]. (there's a creative mode with every recipe unlocked but it seems pointless, no resources for anything advanced at the beginning anyway.) [b]inventory size is decent and dropped items never despawn[/b], which is great.

[b]controls are a bit weird and need getting used to[/b] (pickups are very piranha bytes-esque, unfortunately), but they're rebindable and there are hotkeys for 'harvest all' and 'grab all'. though seeing as 'interact' only works in certain windows, all these could've been merged into one. [b]the ui could use some improvements[/b] too and [b]the game doesn't pause while you're managing inventory or looking at the map[/b], another problem.

crafting is way too finicky and tedious with all the windows and [b]making anything takes real-time minutes, like in a shitty f2p mobile game[/b]. some of the resource requirements are crazy too and you can't queue different things at the same station, can't even top up the current process (start making 5 coal, can't add more ingredients to make it 6, have to wait until all 5 are done) and [b]the number of buildings is arbitrarily limited by your level[/b]. it's absolute nonsense that you can't have, say, 3 of a certain crafting station if you have the resources. god forbid tedium could be decreased in any way.

[b]taming animals and even enemies[/b] is also a thing, they can fight on your side or provide resources. [b]farming and fishing are available[/b], pretty easy too, but once again farming is on a timer. there's eventually [b]fast travel with portals[/b] and a bunch of other cool stuff.

[b]combat isn't great either.[/b] I was honestly and pleasantly surprised I didn't get insta-killed by goblins and boars when I first encountered them (waited until I got a quest for it, didn't go looking for trouble as soon as I woke up on the beach), and with a less effective weapon you can dodge too. [b]aggro range is pretty big[/b] and you really don't want to get attacked by more than one enemy, but the most annoying thing is [b]everything takes off at lightning speed either after the first hit or before the final blow[/b]. you'd think a mortally wounded creature would move slower but nope. not a chance in catching up, though there are some ranged weapons and sometimes (not sure how it works) if you find them later they still have the same health, so finishing them off is easy.

another annoying thing is, [b]enemies destroy your stuff[/b] and apparently [b]the only safe place is the starting beach[/b], mobs don't spawn there. just make sure to keep all the barriers intact (sturdy stuff like bushes and sunflowers) so they can't get to you when aggroed. a single clear path a bit further away should be enough and later there are portals to explore further.

it's still not that horrible if you're careful, one could say, but there are 2 major dealbreakers. [b]stamina always kills all the fun in a game[/b] and this is no exception. sure, use it as a resource so special attacks or whatever can't be spammed, but [b]everything except moving, crafting and picking up items uses stamina[/b]. movement speed isn't fast to begin with, especially compared to the speed boost everybody else gets during combat, but without stamina you're barely able to walk and of course can't do anything useful. the options are waiting minutes to chop down more than a couple of trees or using consumables that take ages to gather or make. [b]the game would still be tedious enough without a stamina system, but with it it's unbearable.[/b]

[b]respawns are the other major issue.[/b] on the one hand, [b]resources never come back[/b]. stones and ore I sort of get, though it's usually not a problem in similar games, but nothing ever regrowing is just sad. it's a big world and you're unlikely to run out of anything by farming plants, animals and enemies, but come on.

and on top of this [b]enemies respawn when you sleep, die or quit[/b]. sleeping isn't technically necessary, you won't even have a bed for a while, but it heals and who likes to explore in the dark. [b]dying is obviously something to avoid, especially since half your inventory disappears in the process[/b] (nothing from the hotbar and hey, no corpse runs at least), but it's bound to happen. unless you save & quit to avoid it by getting teleported back home, but that also respawns mobs.

[b]periodical autosaves are nice, as is the save & exit option[/b], and it's great that I don't have to worry about killing everything every in-game morning or so, but [b]respawning enemies at the beginning of every session is a colossal waste of the player's time[/b]. after finally clearing an area I'd be happy to just gather stuff there next time, but no, I either have to spend more time playing when I should be going, or start over next time with the killing. I'm aware some other games do the same, but it doesn't make it less annoying, plus those tend to be arpgs largely about killing the same things a million times and this has a lot more to offer. or had, were it not for idiotic design decisions.

fortunately, [b]the sequel is a lot more sensible and customizable[/b] (for instance, you can save without respawning things), so I'm looking forward to playing that for the right price, though I'm sure it'll still have some annoyances. [b]this, however, is not something to recommend[/b], unless the improvements from the second game ever make it here, which is doubtful.",1653849504,1653849504,False,9,0,0.57049715518951416,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(I tried to post the full script here but Steam has a Char limit)

Force of Nature surprised me. I wasn't expecting at all what this game had to offer. 

In short, the world is really interesting and interactive for a $5-$8 game, and has a lot to explore. 
It's quite intriguing really, and there's an amazing variety in the environment and creatures for a small indie game like this. 

However, the controls suck, and there are no QoL features at all, and it desperately needs them. It makes the game way grindier than it needs to be.

Also the main questline had a really anticlimactic ending IMO

Worth it for the price, give it a shot if you like survival games.

That's what I've felt so far with this game.  Survival games can have a wide swing in quality and this one lands firmly in the middle.  It's not bad, having a very naturalistic feel and an almost realistic cycle that makes the grind interesting.  Graphics are better than they should be for a game that has so much else lacking (more further down); the day/night cycle, fog & weather (actual thunderstorms and rain), terrain generation, and basic mob designs all are quite beautiful and can be quite enchanting for a simple, casual playthrough.  I found myself often just exploring just to find a few nice looking screen caps or places to imagine building bases on.

However, my main issues come when taking this game further.  At 15 hours, I have found that, although the skills and items progression is realistic and straightforward, I found the cycle of gameplay to be a little too rapid (crops to animals, charcoal to melting, digging to building) all happened a bit too fast.  I found myself getting trapped in back-and-forths that would distract me from forward progress or even simply base building.  The goals are well laid out and progressive in a logical way, but eventually I found myself questioning just WHY I was progressing as there seemed to be a large map with no structures or variation after a while.  Grind became ""for grind's sake"".

And that is where my biggest issue lands: Sprinting is non-existent, and there is no way to increase a sprinting skill to make this better early on (I have heard there are items later to mitigate this, but comments have also said it is not worth it).  At 15 hours, I am quite sick of a slow walk and wearing out my W key insistently pressing it down to move sooooo sloooooooowly.  The game could be so much more, but the slow movement through the map, the frankly LARGE map for how slowly you move, and the length of time it takes to get things to help with this (portals, compasses) takes all of the good above and just knee-caps it.

I played this when it first came out, and then just in the past two weeks.  In that long time span, nothing much changed my opinion (eeehhh then as well as now).  The fact that a sequel now exists makes this a NO recommendation for me.  Would that other survival games looked as simply beautiful as this one, though.",1642575629,1642575629,False,5,0,0.549615919589996338,0,True,False,False,False,,,

COMO HACER BUDÍN DE PAN: 
Cortamos las rebanadas de pan en dados y los colocamos en un recipiente hondo y amplio. En caso de utilizar otro tipo de pan, podemos retirar las cortezas y quedarnos solo con la parte blanca. No es necesario, pero el resultado es un budin blanco y más homogéneo en color. Es una mera cuestión estética.
Calentamos la leche en un cacito junto con el azúcar. Removemos sin parar para que el azúcar se diluya. Cuando no se noten granos de azúcar, apagamos el fuego y añadimos la esencia de vainilla. Removemos para homogeneizar.
Vertemos la leche sobre el pan troceado y removemos bien para que se empape en condiciones. Dejamos reposar cinco minutos.
Batimos los huevos y los añadimos al recipiente anterior. Trituramos con una batidora de mano para que el pan quede más integrado.
Caramelizamos un molde rectangular de 25 x 10 cm (7 cm de alto), extendiendo bien el caramelo líquido por la base y las paredes. Después rellenamos con la mezcla del pan.
HORNEADO Y PRESENTACIÓN
Colocamos el molde en una bandeja para hornear con agua caliente que cubra hasta la mitad del molde aproximadamente y tapamos el molde con papel de aluminio.
Introducimos en la parte más baja del horno, precalentado a 180 ºC con calor arriba y abajo, y cocemos durante 1 hora y 15-30 minutos o hasta que esté perfectamente cuajado. Esto lo podemos comprobar pinchando con un palillo, si sale limpio es que está listo y lo podemos retirar del horno. Sí no, lo dejamos unos minutos más.
Retiramos el molde del horno y dejamos enfriar completamente antes de guardar en la nevera.
Cuando llegue el momento de consumir en budin, retiramos el papel de aluminio, pasamos un cuchillo por el contorno y desmoldamos sobre un plato de servir.

The game starts off well enough by introducing solid crafting mechanics well known in the genre. But only a couple of hours in it quickly turns into a mindnumbing grindfest. It's not even the amount of grinding that will make you go insane, but the fact that you'll spend hours killing generic mobs (4 different ones in the first hours) with an atrocious combat mechanic that will require you to press and hold left click while chugging health and stamina items - that's it. Soon you'll need to kill mobs in the triple digit range for each level up. You'll often be attacked by more mobs than you can fight at once which will result in you dying and losing a part of your iventory. It is soulcrashing and slow work, there's no fun in it. I've hab jobs less tedious than this and those jobs actually paid me for the work I did!
Now you might say ""Oh it's 90% off, I'll just have a look"" but I want you to have a hard look at yourself and ask yourself: Is this actually how you want to spend the precious little time we have on this earth?  Is it really? Or are there games out there that are actually fun?

약간의 자잘한 버그 (장비 착용 바꿀시 딜레이가 사라지는 등)
지형을 기어 올라가지 못해서 빙 돌아가야하는 불편함
정글맵 오브젝트들의 미친듯한 물리엔진 블로킹으로 인한 벌목유발..
캐릭터의 매우 느린 속도
그놈의 아이템 사용은 스페이스바를 누르라는데 스페이스바는 개뿔
시점조절과 근처 아이템 확인밖에 되지 않으니 번호칸에 아이템을 옮겨두고 써야하는 설명 부족.
일반 모드 기준 퀘스트를 깬 후에 추가적인 아이템을 준비를 해야 레벨업이 되는 등
약간의 불편한 요소가 있지만

요즘 대충 게임 만들기 엔진으로 대충 풀 나무 돌 늑대 곰 몇개 박아놓고
써바이벌 게임~ (BGM 전쟁브금같은거 두두두둥) 하는 양심없는 게임들보단 훨씬 낫다고 볼 수 있겠습니다.

초반 체력과 지구력은 버섯과 갓혜자 해바라기 씨를 이용하여 정말 무난하게 넘길 수 있고
자유도가 높아 탐험을 할거면 탐험을 해도 되고 집을 꾸미고 싶으면 집을 꾸며도 되고
동물도 포획해서 농장도 만들 수 있는 갖출 것은 다 갖춘 게임입니다.

이게 200메가도 안 된다는걸로 두번 놀라게되고
정말 컴퓨터 하드웨어 쪽쪽빨아먹는 최적화 말아먹은 양심리스 게임들에 비교하기엔 이 게임이 정말 천사로 보입니다.

부족한 점은 있지만 장점이 좀 더 돋보이는 게임이네요.

i definitely wouldn't recommend paying full price, it's about on par with an app game
the core game-play is fairly interesting, with the combat being pretty simple

Pros:
the crafting is complex enough to add some depth and keep it interesting
the early game is a bit slow but once you start farming and raising animals there will be plenty to keep you busy
the building is intuitive and buildings/items can be easily moved
considering the price the graphics are pretty good and planning out your base is fun
there is a dynamic weather system and a day/night cycle with the nights being dark enough that you don't wanna be out exploring, but short enough that you aren't stuck sitting around for a long time

Cons:
- 1 big con with the game are the enemy AI, whenever you get an enemy to low HP they almost always run away (the ENEMIES can run, but YOU can't) so you'll go out on an adventure but you'll only get the reward for killing an enemy like 50% of the time, the rest of the time they'll take off and you lost your HP for nothing

- the other big con is the inventory management, when you die you lose ALOT of the resources on you so you'll want to keep things in chests, but everything has to be manually dragged into and out of each box, with no shift-click option, which gets tedious fast",1637994836,1637994836,True,3,0,0.511890709400177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Multiple difficulty levels as well as softcore/hardcore.  Cards/achievements included.  I'm usually an antisocial SP, but MP is in the works.  

For readers new to this type of game:  You'll collect resources (wood via sticks/logs), eat plants/seeds, make a fire, assemble tools (knife/ax), weave rope with palm leaves, mine for stone/ore, synthesize more advanced components, construct infrastructure (coal furnace), eventually farm/hunt, etc,  

There's no XP, per say.  Upon the completion of assigned tasks/quests, you level up, which provides additional health/stamina capacity.

You'll also battle critters (goblins, wolves/bears).  I'm glad there's a punishment when you die.  (and die, you will)  You'll lose some of the resources you were carrying in active inventory.   Dropping/storing protects it.

** Comments: Fortunately, I didn't have the crash experiences that others have reported.  Apparently, that's long been patched.  [edit: Turns out I did have regular crashes, but it autosaved.]

** I'm embarassed to admit that it took me a while to discover I could multitask w/crafting.

** Content-wise, it's comprehensive, logical, and authentic.  Note that things take a reasonable and appropriate amount of time to accomplish.  It's a HUGE island to explore with night and day (sleep not required).  There's often more than one way to do something.  There's an informative hint system (without blatant spoilers) and a well-organized encyclopedia. I'd consider it pretty casual. Are you into grindy and crafting games?  If so, this scratches the itch. Will I get the soundtrack?  Maybe.  I'll definitely buy the now-released sequel.",1635719632,1638859898,True,3,0,0.564896285533905029,0,True,False,False,False,,,

По большой скидке - получите удовольствие с первых 5-10, край 20 часов (см. предпоследний абзац). Дальше это беспросветный гринд и уныние.
-----------

Графика простенькая, но приятная. 
Звуки - нормально. 
Музыка - странная, электрогитара и фентези слабо совместимы )  Плюс настройки таковы, что вы и музыки то толком не услышите. 
Сюжет - его просто нет. ""Собери артефакт из осколков"". Всё.
И главная боль: геймплей. 
По сути у нас песочница с рандомно генерируемым миром (а я эту штуку очень люблю за реиграбельность... но не в этот раз). 
Добываем ресурсы, строим, выращиваем, рубаем монстров. Загвоздка в том, что... со всеми 4мя пунктами у игры проблемы.
Строительство, крафт и выращивание СИЛЬНО ограничены искусственно, даже при наличии ресурсов. А ресурсов надо  много. Т.е. гринд ресурсов + гринд на производстве из-за недостатка мощностей. Также интерфейс мануфактур таков, что от них буквально не отойдешь - ни очереди на производство, ни склада. 
Для продвижения по игре требуются ресурсы, падающие с мобов. Опять гринд. И чем дальше - тем больше. 
[spoiler] Последний квест - чистый гриндфест часов на пять [/spoiler] 
Боёвка примитивна. Экип только крафтится, выбора снаряги нет, дропа снаряги нет. Монстры берут числом, здоровьем и дамагом, что выливается... пра-а-авильно, в промышленный гринд хилок. 
Много ресурсов невозобновляемых - железо, например, из-за чего железные стрелы для лука - непозволительная роскошь. 

Единственное, что стоит внимания - рандомная карта и приятный стиль графики, атмосфера. Локации разные, и вот это ощущение первооткрывателя, когда ты прорубаешься через джунгли в лес, из леса в тундру, и тундры в пустыню - оно тащит игру. Разумеется, если ты любитель исследовать мир. Если нет - играть в это вообще нет смысла.

БЫли бы нормальная боёвка, варианты снаряжения, разнообразие дропа, нормальный интерфейс производства и отсутствие глупых ограничений - была бы нормальная игра. А так... есть мысль, что это как бы демка. Посмотрю 2ую часть - проверю теорию.",1632960283,1633088028,False,9,0,0.620311141014099121,2,True,False,False,False,,,

肝心のクラフトはレベルアップする度に作れる物が増えるのですが、そのレベルが上がっていくとクラフトがどんどん複雑になっていきます。例えばAを作ろうとするとBとCとDが必要で、Dを作るにはEとFが必要で、さらにFを手に入れるには……と、工程がとにかく煩雑化していって、遂には今何のために何を作ろうとしているのか分からなくなる有様でした。その上、高レベルのクラフトになるほど完成までの待ち時間が長くなります。材料作りに数分...次の材料にもまた数分...と完成まで常に待たされているような状況になっていました。

あ、ちなみにマイクラなどで家作りが好きな人は尚更向いてないと思います。好きな構造で建てることは出来ず、決まった形の家がでんと建つだけです。

またレベルアップと共に解放されるのはクラフトレシピだけではなく、移動速度が上がったり、新しい武器によって攻撃速度が上がったりします。つまり、序盤はめちゃくちゃのろいです。攻撃力が弱いぐらいだったら上手く立ち回って強敵に勝つ楽しさもあるというものですが、動きがのろいんじゃどうしようもねえや。

以下9時間やった上での簡単なTipsです。
・作業台やチェストなどは小屋の中にしか置けませんが、使う時は近くに立ちさえすればいいので、小屋の外から外壁に向かって使用できます。
・設置した建物は移動が可能ですが、ポータルや小屋は移動できません。設置物にハンマー等の道具を入れていたり、チェストに中身が入っていると移動できませんが、空にすることで移動できます。
・ポータルはグオングオンと不快な音が常に出るので、生活の場からは離して設置することを勧めます。
・死ぬとリスポーン地点で復活するほか、ランダムで一部のアイテムをロストします。大事なアイテムは拠点に保管しましょう。

セールで160円ほどで購入しましたが、値段なりだなと思います。高くても400円。800円のクォリティはありません。

80円で購入し、フレンドと4人でレベル6ぐらいまでプレイ。マルチは一生ベータ版とのことで、一度クラッシュしたり若干不安定ながら特に問題なく楽しめました。
P2P方式のはずなので、もしかするとホストのNATタイプ次第ではモデレートとスクリプトの人同士は一緒に遊べない場合があるかもしれないので要注意。

クエストクリア型のレベルアップ方式を採用しており、レベル上がらないとクラフトアイテムは増えず各設置物の上限は決まっている為、どんどんクエスト進めていくのが吉。
操作は独特ですが、CTRLキーとALTキー連打してれば取得＆採集は楽々。スペースキーを押せば炭窯を選択したり他プレイヤーの名前を確認できます。
割とオープンワールドな作りながら何処かでマップ移動の区切りがあるらしく、マルチだと1人が内職して3人行動してると突然マップ移動して一緒に飛ばされる事も暫しありました。
そのため行動する際は2-2で分担するとマップ移動しないので無駄を減らせると思います。
マルチの場合、ホストがレベル上げれば他プレイヤーも共にレベルアップし、ホストだけが建築/移動/修理/破壊できる仕様になってます。
誰か死ぬと全員死亡し、スタート地点に戻されて道連れになりますが、ランダムにアイテムを失うのは死んだ本人のみの模様。

個人的にしっかり日本語対応してますし、この値段且つクオリティなら満足。クエストやらないと一生進めない仕様上、煩わしさはありますが値段考えたらこんな物かなと。
ただ小屋にチェストと作業台置いただけで中にも入れない狭さだったり、トラップをビュー視点に変えてから2回当てないと捕まえられないのは結構なクソ仕様。
動物達が瀕死になるとプレイヤーよりも高速で逃げ出したり、何処かにスタックしない限り一生追い掛けて来るのは中々面倒臭いです。一応マルチなら四方囲んで袋叩きにすれば逃げられず倒せます。
加えてゲーム起動する度にゴブリンや動物は復活する為、拠点構築や建築に関してはスタートエリア限定に絞ることをオススメします。
因みに目印としてトーチを立てておいても、次の起動からゴブリンに一瞬で破壊されるので気を付けて下さい。

Steamコミュニティ見てると最大レベル12まで上げるとかなり大規模な建築が出来るものの、復活の仕様やクエスト進行の面倒臭さを考えるとソロは苦行に近そうなので4人マルチを推奨。
サバイバルゲーでは珍しく、同名アイテム""フォース・オブ・ネイチャー""の作成がクリア目標になります。
もしゲーム性は好きだけど低品質なのは耐えられないという人は続編の『Force of Nature 2: Ghost Keeper』の方であれば、ある程度満足できると思います。

Местами игра душит, сильно душит, в частности крафтом и растягиванием геймплея за счет крафта. Скрафти это, потом это, затем вот это. Вместе с этим происходит обучение игре, запоминаются какие-то вещи, а с другой стороны нужно бегать по полчаса-часу искать гоблинов, чтобы выбить 15 золотых монет, но с этих рандомно падают либо медные монеты, либо золотые (медные чаще), а потом еще кидают свинью в виде скрафти 5 золотых слитков (1 слиток = 15 золотых монет, ага). И это только начало игры.
Боевка вялая и по сути ее тут нет, состоит из банального затыкивания, причем обоюдного, даже кайтить врагов нет смысла, максимум получится пропустить мимо 1 атаку, все остальные попадут. Эпичные бои в виде: 1 удар от игрока, 2 удара от кабана. 1 удар от игрока, 2 от кабана. Кабан умер, стоишь ешь клубнику и семечки восстанавливаешь стамину и здоровье. Стрельба с лука как отдельное искусство, враги бегут по каким-то непонятным траекториям, прицеливания нормального нет, приходится стрелять на интуицию наводясь левой пяткой.

You wake up on a desert island, you collect resources, you build stuff, basic stuff but fun.
Typical of these games, not a lot makes sense. I can build a furnace before I can build a lean-to. I hide the route to my base, everything can find it easier than me. Meh, that's part of playing a game like this.
The UI is crude and awkward, but you get used to it.
The look is good though, and it entertains, in a gentle, low key kind of way.
There is some combat. I avoid it when I can, but it does happen, no turning the monsters off.
There is a sequel out, I got this on a great sale. If you can get it for a buck or under, it is fun, but if you have money to spend and like the genre, you might prefer the sequel, as this clearly the rough prototype.
ADDENDUM: Over 26 hours in, and still enjoying this one. It is pretty darn deep... 
ADDENDUM: I walked away at about 40 hours, and while I haven't changed my opinion, I got this game on a great sale, I thought I would share the issues that bothered me, just to let people know.
As you might expect,t he game has a farming mechanic. The things you grow become useful items, a potion that lets you see in the dark was very useful, as well as food used to replenish your health and/or your stamina. There were also animals you harvested items from, milk, eggs, feathers for arrows and wool for clothing.
The cycle by which things became available was so quick however that by the time I planted all my plants and fed all my animals, the plants were done, then so were the animals, and darn, the loop was so darn quick. If you did anything else, like most of the game, it felt like I was missing out. 
I really wish you got more for your effort, but could only collect one a day or something, instead of every three minutes.
The bigger issue was the balance (or lack there of) of the combat. The early part of things were great, goblins were tough, I got better, goblins became easy. I mice pattern, and one I expected to see repeated with each level of monsters. 
But then bam, the jump went from level 4 to 6 critters, to level 15 and they killed you, unless you found some place to attack from where they couldn't hit you back, which really feels cheesy.
And this brings me to the biggest frustration, the game was a bit grindy, but grinding really didn't make you any tougher. You got tougher by completing specific tasks, and you could grind all day without doing them. So if the task was very hard, the only way to get there was build everything possible, and if that wasn't enough, there was nothing you could do.
Grinding without more of a reason to grind eventually made me quit. 
It also didn't help that by the time I was able to build decent armor, I was required to go into places where I couldn't wear the armor to advance things. 
Anyway, still fun, think I paid two bucks for, certainly got my moneys worth.",1630305707,1631194223,True,18,0,0.739169120788574219,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has to be said that running around getting water, planting seeds, cooking stuff, feeding animals etc just to get enough food to fight the next bunch of Mobs, does get a little tiresome after a while, but not so much as I don't want to return. So, I'd say it's a casual game, one you play like Solitaire where you play til you're bored, then put it down. Later you come back and play some more. It's that kind of game.

- Отсутствие автолевлинга противника. Уровень врага фиксирован территориями. Чем дальше от респауна, тем мощнее и жирнее мобы нас будут встречать. Сами развиваемся до определенного уровня (примерно до 11-го лв), а дальше выживаем за счет шмота, оружия, расходников и нашего скилла.
- Наличие разных биомов по климатическим особенностям (зимний, жаркий, тропический).
- Очень бодрый хардкорный режим

[b]Минусы данной игры:[/b]

- Отсутствие сюжета. Вместо него мы имеем задачу: найти фрагменты предметов, название которого является эта игра. При этом нам не рассказывает о мире, в котором мы появились и зачем вообще нужно искать эти фрагменты.
- Отсутствие элементов выживания, таких как ""голод"" и ""жажда"". Вместо них есть ""энергия"", которая восполняется отдыхом или едой. Совсем не то для игры подобного жанра.
- Все здания и сооружения имеют фиксацию по количеству, которое можно будет построить за игру, при этом они еще имеют достаточно маленькое внутреннее пространство. 
- Лютый гринд. Не ну серьезно, крафтить себе хавчик и бусты несколько часов реального времени для того, чтобы сходить только за одним фрагментов артефакта? Добывать нужное количество угля, при этом перевалив пол леса, тоже норм? Это лютый пи**ц! Практически 70-80 % геймплея это бесперерывный крафт на вашей базе, причем по абсолютно драконовскому времени. Более монотонного др****ва я еще нигде не встречал...

2.боёвка без уклонения, поэтому всё сводится к тупому обмену ударами и долгим ожиданием восстановления здоровья и стамины или идем крафтим ""восстанавливатели"" (опять крафт,крафт,крафт нудный и ресурсоёмкий ).
 3.стрельба тоже выбешивает, мобы двигаются странными резкими рывками, так чтобы все твои стрелы с трудом скрафченые летели мимо, и их скорость полета черепашья.

5. выносливость тратится на всё, восстанавливается долго.

Bir de çubukla toprak kazıyışı o kadar komik ki, bilemiyorum ne desem... Buna kozmetik dersek bir eksi sayılabilir. Ayrıca kamera açısı gökyüzüne dönmüyor, ufuk çizgisinde belli bir hizada kalıyor, bu da beni biraz rahatsız etti. Karakter mekaniği ve oyun kontrolü etrafında biraz eksikleri var fakat içerik olarak hoşuma gitti. Görevler ile ilerlemesi hoş, bugün şunu yapayım da öyle çıkayım diyebiliyorsun. Harita biraz daha geliştirilebilir. Başta ingilizce oynuyordum, Türkçe seçeneğini görünce denemek istedim ama Türkçe açıklamalar biraz karmaşık olmuş, yine de zorlayınca anlaşılır ama İngilizcesi daha rahat anlaşılıyor.

El sistema de combate consiste en tanquear golpes mientras haces daño, según el nivel del arma, mientras consumes la comida en grandes cantidades, que previamente has tenido que farmear y esperar. Es ridículo que tengas que curarte full con enemigos 1 VS 1, o que los enemigos golpeen x2 veces la longitud visual del modelo. Todos los enemigos son más rápidos que tu, excepto las rocas, que es el único enemigo al que puedes esquivar de alguna manera efectiva. Enemigos que te envenenan 812739876 millones de años, con un único hit el 100% de las veces.

Escupido ya todo el hate sobre el sistema de combate, recomiendo este juego en oferta. El sistema de misiones te guía por ej juego y, si bien son excesivos algunos requisitos de subida de nivel, se hace entretenido hasta el punto de perder la noción del tiempo. el 98% de los arboles son destruibles, el 100% de la maleza es destruible, se obtienen recursos. La construcción es un poco rudimentaria, pero cumple su cometido y te permite personalizar tu base. Sistema de TP que se agradece. Sistema de plantación de recursos, que no está mal, limitado por agua y tiempo. Un poco tediosa la limitación de cantidad de construcciones del mismo tipo.

Multijugador en decentes condiciones, protegido contra soft-locks, permitiendo únicamente al anfitrión tomar los items clave (está bien pensado por si alguien se fuera a llevar un item necesario con su personaje y no volviera a conectarse).

En general viciante si te gusta farmear. Recomendado a pesar de mi aversión al sistema de combate. Y jugaré a la segunda parte en cuanto haya una oferta >30%.",1625941733,1625941733,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not because the enemies were difficult nor because the game was challenging, but because the grind to do anything was insufferable. Had we not been constantly making fun of how bad the game was, I'm not sure we would have finished it. The content drastically drops off after the early game, where there are almost no new domesticated creatures after the first area (and endgame creatures are often just reskins of other creatures). Stamina drops like a rock and takes a silly amount of grinding to replenish (unless you want to afk for 5 minutes after mining three iron ore), and if you want healing you've just doubled your workload. Everything requires tons of resources, but getting more production buildings is level locked, severely limited in quantity, and each strawberry or egg requires additional grind to ""craft"" and time to wait. And that's before you actually fight anything.

The combat system is slow and clunky, basically heavily favoring ranged attacks through spots that enemies can't path through. Combat is so stamina intensive that you need to be extremely well stocked on stamina recovery...so much so that we had to leave combat and return to base due to no stamina rather than low health. The loot tables are also awful, with some late/end game enemies dropping irrelevant early game loot and nothing that progresses the game. Certain enemies are trivially easy, while others are nearly impossible to kite...and the region they spawn in has no impact on their difficulty. As for combat progression, equipment progression essentially had halted for the last 20% of the game, and the actual mechanics of combat are identical after you unlock the first weapons. As a final insult the end of the game was so anticlimactic we thought we missed it. I write this review only to serve as a cautionary tale: don't play this game unless you're willing to spend a lot of time doing nothing.

Moi taper, Gobelin taper, l'un des deux morts (le Gobelin normalement, mais s'il a ses potes à côté, c'est foutu).

Les graphismes sont très moyens, les musiques convenables et l'arbre de craft assez bien fourni si ce n'est que ce n'est pas un arbre mais un tronc.

Ingredientes:

150 gramas de manteiga sem sal em temperatura ambiente
2/3 xícara (chá) de açúcar

Raspas de meia laranja (ou mais se quiser)
2 xícaras (chá) de farinha de trigo peneirada
1 pitada de sal
1/3 colher (chá) de fermento químico em pó (uma pontinha de colher)
2 colheres (sopa) de leite ou suco de laranja (só se precisar)

Preparo:

1. Misture a manteiga com o açúcar até formar uma pastinha, eu usei uma colher mesmo.
2. Acrescente o sal, as raspas, a baunilha e misture.
3. Acrescente a farinha de trigo, o fermento e misture com a mão, se sentir que a massa não está bem unida, adicione o leite ou suco.
4. A massa não pode grudar nas mãos e também não pode ficar seca.
5. Envolva em um plástico e deixe descansar uns 15 minutos na geladeira se estiver calor.
6. Abra a massa em uma bancada bem enfarinhada com espessura de mais ou menos meio centímetro. Não pode ficar muito grossa porque cresce um pouquinho.
7. Corte os biscoitos e coloque-os com um espaço de 2 cm na assadeira forrada com papel manteiga, não precisa untar.
8. Asse em forno pré aquecido a 180 graus, por mais ou menos 10 minutos, fique de olho quando o biscoito dourar nas bordas, está pronto.

Well, I only have 83.1 hours in the game according to the library... it was 2 playthroughs... 1st one in 2018 which I abandoned due to dying or almost dying many times just few steps outside my base to lvl. 25 grenadier goblin spawning in one direction there and stupid me wanting to kill it no matter what) and 2nd one where I put almost 50 hours to leisurely beat it yesterday so I could play the 2nd one without regrets... but I think that I can say some things which I find great or not that great.
I just love the animations, all the different sounds and mainly ambient music.
I love that You can tame animals (well rather You have to tame someones) and farm many things... I am from a village and only thing I miss in this game are potatoes.
I love that You can tame hostile creature to fight for You or in my case with me... it's just that I don't know if it's possible to tame only goblin or other ones too because I was only capable to tame a normal goblin. Also it would be great if You could tame multiple ones even if You could order only one at the time to follow You (others would be keeping the base safe).
I love the crafting system and various crafting stations... only thing that I would like to be able to queue some additional things other than the one currently crafting... but only because I would progress much faster (much more exploration done before needing to go back to base).
The progress system is unique based on quests and even though I don't like that very much I understand that because it keeps the game challenging as the creatures are more tough in later zones.

I would recommend this game 1000% to any survivor game addicts out there... sorry, to players like me... mainly to ones that like relaxing with occasional combat... the sounds and music are really great in my opinion.

然后说说其他问题。

1硬核难度只是一条命而已，豪无挑战性。
2后期制作物品耗时实在是太长了，等起来很无聊。
3友军系统相当于白给系统，抓起来太费材料，那蠢得要命的队友还是一次性的。
4大部分资源建筑都闲置，而水井产能永远不够。
5烹调和炼金相比就是孙子，为什么会有两个重合度90%系统，后期烹调系统直接报废。
7重甲系存在有何意义，后期地形不是过热就是寒冷，没有任何温度调节的重甲只能放着生灰。
8近战走a迷一样存在，怪物不是速度超快就是攻击距离超长，站桩掉100血，走a掉90血，还不如400瓶血药钉头锤站撸呢。
9buff系统提升可怜，40秒5%提升，后期一瓶药可能你连一个怪都打不死。
10远程伤害也是迷一样存在，用最强弓石制箭头满级次要伤害依然一箭射不死你门前的那几只兔子。
11所有动物和逃跑敌人自带80%闪避，他们只要逃跑你用弓基本都射不到，只要一个小拐弯就能躲开你的箭。
12谜一样的弓箭射程和精准度，初期弓射程如60岁老头尿尿，长弓射程最远准头也不错，最后解锁的轻弓射程飘忽不定，射人需要先射3箭定位，射击距离还是坡度加成，高打低你射的不是箭而是火箭。所有弓都不带自瞄而且射速超慢，歪一点或者目标移动一点你都射不中。
13宝石碎片掉落低到想杀人，刷钻石碎片太痛苦，还不如回去种玫瑰做碎片。
14抗旱装应该再提升一个等级，后期对抗雪怪，北极熊一类的太过无力。
15多种挂件只有耐力恢复挂件有用，最无耻的是最后区域强制挂安抚挂件才能进去。
16魔法箱子3个做齐就从来没用过。
17传送阵制作后传送阵音效就会不停的响，听多了头疼。
18房屋制造太费劲，造完了发现你没有什么可以放进去的东西。
19床这东西主要是重置怪物的，但是没有esc回城加重置好使。我是玩了80小时才知道有这么一个睡10次床的隐藏成就的。
20steam成就丧心病狂，杀1000只哥布林，杀2500个敌对生物。天知道我刷了多久才完成的。
21整体流程太过感人，你以为你集齐7个自然碎片能召唤神龙，结果人家告诉你集齐碎片就通关了。
22和炼金比，南瓜汁就是神，虽然我从来就没种过也没喝过南瓜汁。
23那么多装饰品，为啥就不设计几个能放室内的家具。
24这游戏不能做一个可移动光源么。
25不要养猪。

[b]Force Of Nature[/b] (FoN) is a third-person open-world survival sandbox set on a remote island untouched by civilization. Players impersonate an unnamed survivor, that finds himself stranded, without any supplies or help available. For whatever reason, he decides to look for all the fragments of the ""Force of Nature"", a mythical gemstone of great power - which will prove an arduous task indeed.

[h1]In-Depth Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Pros[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
From wooden huts to contain facilities, to open-air furnaces, defensive palisades and animal pens, FoN does feature everything required to create a full-fledged encampment suitable for long-term operation. Each character level will unlock new blueprints about weapons, buildings, facilities and more, allowing progressive base expansion. Base building proves satisfactory, comfortable and accurate to perform.

[b]2.[/b]
The vast island is divided into ""slices"", each with diverse temperatures, enemies and flora / fauna. More often than not, one will need special-purpose equipment and suitable weapons to face both the territory and its inhabitants, or else face swift defeat. Each of these slices inevitably houses one of the Force of Nature shards, enshrined in an altar guarded by an elite troop of enemies. It is quite interesting to discover new places, enemies and territories.

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
While it's true players can operate many diverse facilities, ultimately they all boil down to the processing, refining and construction of increasingly more expensive items in order to fulfill quests - that in turn bar new levels from being gained. There are no unique events, optional quests, special enemies or landmarks to find, at any point. Even combat is only another, more ""interactive"" form of grinding in FoN.

[b]2.[/b]
The grind eventually reaches outrageous levels. Leveling up and crafting critical gear, become inevitably tied to low drop-rate resources like Gold Coins or Shards. These materials can only be dropped from specific enemies, at around 10% chance - dozens of them eventually are needed. Having to grind dozens then HUNDREDS of the same mobs over and over becomes the norm.

[b]3.[/b]
Despite its open-world nature, around 90% of the island is barred off initially and will remain so for a dozen hours at the very least. Cold, extreme heat and powerful enemies make only the starting area viable for a long time, until players grind enough to even set foot in a new biome. Leveling up is the only way of getting new blueprints and quests, and also raise the limit on structures that can be built in one's base. Quests are always about crafting or acquiring specific items.

[b]4.[/b]
Combat is nothing more than a DPS contest between players and whatever number of enemies they're against. Escaping combat is not even an option, as most enemies will be faster than the protagonist, so aggroing more foes than one can match will inevitably result in death, with permanent loss of some items as outcome. Ranged weapons have an hideous aiming system that makes them unreliable, clunky to use.

[b]5.[/b]
Even for an Indie, these visuals are terribly ancient, and look more like a PS2-era game than a 2016 release. Just look at it! Of course, gameplay is more important than visuals in a game, but also the eye wants its part. Despite the dismal graphics, a very close ""fog"" always permeates the environment, making long-distance view impossible. Just terrible.

[h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]

[b]Exploration[/b]
Is performed mostly on foot, and later on with the aid of Portals, which can be placed around the island to enable fast-travel between them. A global map will show explored areas, and highlight resources, enemies and other notable items with pixels of different colors - the lack of zoom on it is annoying, though. Generally, there is no point in exploring besides gathering the required resources of the current set of quests, as there is nothing special to find, ever.

[b]Crafting[/b]
Is performed at a series of facilities such as furnaces, anvils, bonfires, seed planters and more. Usually, crafting a specific material or item will require one or more resources to be combined together. All facilities work autonomously once their crafting is started, however the absence of any queue system, auto-stacking or any other automation will make players have to constantly run around, and manage dozens of crafting stations all the time. Assigning upgraded tools to each crafting station may improve its speed, or enable crafting new materials.

[b]Combat[/b]
Is a simple third-person exchange of blows without any significant mechanic to it. Bash the attacker until it either flees or dies. Some monsters or neutral animals can be tamed instead of killed, so they become allies or living harvest points to feed and generate organic materials from, such as eggs or wool from chicken and sheep. The taming mechanics prove annoying, as animals often run away in the middle of enemy group, and get attacked after being tamed sometimes. Being well stocked with food (HP or Stamina regen) and status-effect countering items is essential to not succumb to enemy numbers.

[b]Quests[/b]
Are always about crafting a specific item or acquiring a set number of something, which can range from tamed animals to herbs or whatever else. At no point they have even an hint of purpose, story, background or diversity. It's one fetch-quest after another, for the entire game.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is performed via a panel containing a rather generous inventory panel, other than equipment slots where to put clothes and armor. The ""Characteristics"" panel outlines the current stats, and the requirements to obtain the next level, which are always to complete the current quest set plus a significant number of hard-to-obtain materials, like Gold Bars, Shards and Gems. Leveling up is the only way to get new blueprints and stand a chance against foes.

[h1]The Judgment: Bad[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989090445]Complete Ratings List here[/url]
[i]I have played around 17 hours, before succumbing to the immense boredom of unending, one-sided grind this game becomes. Based on the exponential grind amounts required at each passing set of quests, I can safely predict it would take no less than 70-100 hours to complete FoN. Given the significant problems stated above, I strongly discourage anyone from buying this game at any point.[/i]

Gather trees to craft a base, later on you will use these to get other interesting stuff to aid you in your survival,
defeat enemies and hunt animals for different materials that will help you survive in different environments,
capture and build pens for your animals to get things like wool etcetera.

      Now a few things I find interesting;
- Wood/stone hates living and won't spawn back in the same place around the map after being cut/mined down, meaning you will eventually have a bare patch around your base.
- Goblins have the constant urge to destroy your fences 24/7, hints why you should use trees, bushes and sunflowers to block them out.
- Different Biomes every 5 seconds as you walk around/teleport around, meaning you have to switch to the appropriate crafted gear every time your character is too cold/hot. 
- The ""fog"" is annoying because I can barely see my home when I'm 2 feet away from it.
- ""Too far away, come closer."" *visible frustration as I walk 2 cm forwards to pick up a twig*
- Wheat decides giving you more seeds than the crop itself is a fair trade.
- Pine trees produce nearly no pine cones making replanting very difficult. 

    These are all minor issues that I wouldn't even think about too deeply, who's going to chop down every tree and mine every bit of rocks in their world? You should have enough to last all throughout but I recommend starting a tree farm anyways. I enjoy sitting in my base rather than running around killing (nearly dying) level 20 enemies every time I exchange my o2 for Co2. The multiplayer mode, although in beta, works fine. It's much better with people than solo imo. The only problem I have with it is the, ""You're too far away from your buddy."" sort of thing. It makes it much harder to do what each other wants when you're stuck bound by the tight 30ft rope tied around each others arms. The amount of goblins in this game is unhealthy and they only drop 1-4 coins but you gotta do what you gotta do I guess. The darkness at night is astonishing, you can't walk through the leaves/branches of trees or bushes so you just get stuck and spam M to try and figure out how the heck to get home.
      Is it an okay game? Yes and no, if you like survival games go for it.

Wie gewohnt erweitere ich das Review mit der Zeit.

[h1] Allgemein [/h1]

Als erstes muss ich sagen das ich befürchte dass das Spiel nach mittlerweile 5 Jahren nahezu tot ist. 
Zumindest was Patches oder Verbesserungen angeht. 

Warum ich das befürchte ? Weil es genau genommen ein zwar verbesserungswürdiges aber gutes Spiel ist. 
Die Grafik ist natürlich nach 5 Jahren nicht mehr aktuell. 
Doch wenn ich es realistisch betrachte ist die Grafik so wie sie hier vorhanden ist auch nicht hässlich und absolut ausreichend um eine Spiel entsprechende Atmosphäre aufbauen zu können.
Außerdem ist Grafik immer Ansichtssache. 

Man befindet sich nach der eher knappen Charakter Anpassung (Haare Haarfarbe Hosenfarbe und Hautfarbe) an einem Strand. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2436029922
Es gibt viel zu erkunden. Eine Karte die sich nach den besuchten bereichen automatisch erweitert.
Es gibt eine begleitende Mainquest die einem mit jedem Level aufgaben vorgibt. 
Zum Beispiel Fälle soundso viel Bäume , erbaue ein Lagerfeuer und Sammle dies und Das. 
Nach erfolgreichem abarbeiten bekommt man einen Haken als erfolg und natürlich die  Erfahrung dazu. Hat man die gesamte Liste abgearbeitet. 
Kann man sich per Klick in das nächste Level anheben, dadurch gibt es neue Rezepte und eine neue To Do Liste. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2436030063
Somit wird man immer Erfahrener , erhält immer mehr Rezepte und Möglichkeiten und baut sich natürlich nebenbei Parallel zu seinem Charakter ein Heim , Dorf oder was auch immer auf.

Was mir sehr gut gefällt ist das breite Spektrum an Rezepten und Aufbaumöglichkeiten. 
Alleine die Nahrungsmöglichkeiten die man findet und die Samen die man für den wieder anbau daraus erhält sind sehr umfassend. 

Hinzu kommt die Möglichkeit nicht aggressive Tiere wie Schweine, Hühner, Kühe, Ziegen und derartiges zu Zähmen um Milch, Eier, Fleisch und so weiter zu erhalten. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2436030162
Während man damit beschäftigt ist sich etwas aufzubauen gibt es natürlich bei der Erkundung der Spielwelt jede menge Aggressive Tiere wie Bären, Füchse oder Wildschweine. 
Dazu kommen auch noch richtige Gegner wie unterschiedliche Goblins die einen ebenfalls bei Sichtkontakt angreifen.

Wie gesagt das Grundprinzip und die Möglichkeiten sind gut, das was mich jedoch etwas nervt ist die Tatsache das in meinen Augen der Zeit beziehungsweise Aufwand zum Nutzenfaktor ausgewogener sein müssten und das gewisse Bedienungen einfach nur umständlich sind. 

Wenn ich zum Beispiel ein Zaun Element bauen möchte, brauche ich dazu Bretter und Nägel.
Für Nägel benötigt man einen Hochofen, Eisenerz und Kohle. Kohle erhält man durch Holz in einem Kohleofen, für den Benötigt man auch Glühende Asche aus dem Lagerfeuer. So greift eben eins ins andere. Bretter macht man aus Bäumen, die muss man fällen und die Baumstämme dann zu Bretter verarbeiten. Soweit für mich auch alles klar und vollkommen Ok 
 jedoch der Knackpunkt ist das die Mengen einfach nicht Stimmen. Ich brauche für ein einzelnes Zaun Element etwa 15 min Vorarbeit an Rohmaterialien abbau und Verarbeitung.

Leider bekommt man dadurch sehr schnell das Gefühl in ein ständiges Grinden zu fallen und das trübt leider die vielen positiven Dinge des Spiels. 

Fortsetzung folgt .....
Multiplayer Info folgt ......

サクサク進めたいならマイクラ、バンバンしたいなら７days、このゲームは2つのゲームの中間（マイクラ寄り）
グラフィックを見て期待をせずセールで購入した結果、グラフィックで判断して遊ぶのを止めるのは勿体ないので遊んでみる事をすすめる。
ただ、けっこう時間と手間が掛かるゲームなのでそれが嫌な人はマイクラをお勧めする。
ゲーム内容は、目標がありそれを進める為やる事はあるので飽きずにプレイできるはず、とは言え不満点は結構多い。
・作者の意図はわかるが明るさ調整とBGMのオンとオフ機能が無い（基本ＢＧＭが無い）
・鈍器は攻撃速度が遅いからスタン効果が付いても良かったと思う。
・動物一匹一匹に餌を与えるのはナンセンス、餌箱に餌を入れれば勝手に食べる方が自然。
・ポーション作りは調合割合をガイドどおりに作っても意味がない為調合割合を無くし成功率だけにした方が良かった
・環境音の範囲が広すぎる、動物の鳴き声や蜂の羽音や製粉所の音など。
・採取できる範囲が狭い
・自働収集系のスタック数が少ない
・任意のアイテム作成を選んで作成ウィンドウを閉じても通常画面に必要な材料の表示が欲しかった

Eu simplesmente amo esse jogo, antes de tudo, ele não é bom não tá kkk, porém depende

Comecei a jogar force of nature com minha namorada visto que era algo que rodaria no computador dela, eu já não esperava muito pra ser sincero por ser um jogo barato, mas FON me impressionou e muito.
+ Antes do mais deixando bem claro: o sistema de combate é muito zuado e travadão, mas para mim que jogou jogos da antiga geração fica num estilo oldschool bem legal e nada que eu não possa me acostumar, tem uma diversidade de monstros grande(tá que alguns so mudam de cor), alguns quando eu vi fiquei assustado e quando sem querer entrei numa área de nivel maior os mesmos me castigaram sem dó
+ A criação de bases apesar de não ter tantas opções quanto eu gostaria e de o número de edificações ser regrada por nível, é muito gratificante, principalmente pra mim jogando em conjunto, minha mulher queria pegar todos os bichos que via pela frente e quando fomos ver já estava entupido de animais ao redor, fica dificil manter construções em outros locais pois ao spawnar os montros já a atacam diretamente ao invés de focar em você
+ Grind desse jogo é absurdo, pra quem não entende, pra progredir no jogo você vai ter que fabricar itens e acessorios que ao começar você provavelmente vai ter disperdiçado e demorar pra pegar mais,você aprende novas receitas ao subir de nível que infelizmente não é matando monstros e sim cumprindo missões, pra alguns pode ser tedioso mas eu sempre gostei de algum grind, se jogar com amigos vocês tiram de letra, aqui, que encontrei uma das poucas coisas de ruim no game
- Limitação de multiplayer, os jogadores tem que ficar relativamente próximo pois se forem muito longe uma barreira invisivel limita de continuar juntamente com uma mensagem, isso é muito chato, pois um não pode gerenciar a base enquanto outro sai para buscar recursos mais longes, ou todos tem que se aventurar nas missoes juntos, por elas serem geralmente muito longe da base(creio que todos fazem base na primeira area), entendo que seja de alguma limitação da equipe na hora de programar o multiplayer então acho que isso até da para relevar porém ja aviso que vai causar chateação em alguns momentos
- velocidade de movimento, DEVAGAR DEMAIIIIIIIIIIS, mesmo quando você começa a ter acessorios pra velocidade parece que seu personagem vai ser devagar pra sempre, é muito gratificante chegar em níveis mais altos e construir estradas pra se movimentar melhor, para alguns isso talvez seja um incômodo e tanto, mas acho que pro tamanho do mundo do game, se encaixa muito bem

My net seems to break no matter how I try to aim/throw it so they seem very fragile and the animals do spook to easily. The easiest kill for skin is a bear because any other animal that sits and attacks you will run away at their last health bar and you aren't quick enough to chase it before more animals see you and attack you. So You might as well just let them run and focus on recovering your health.

1. ตัวเกมเป็นแนว เอาชีวิตรอด ติดเกาะ คราฟของ (เล่นคนเดียว)
เล่นช่วงแรกๆ จะสนุก เพราะต้องหาของ เพื่อเอาชีวิตรอด หลังๆแอบน่าเบื่อเพราะต้องทำเควส(บังคับ) เพื่อเพิ่มเลเวล 

2. การเดินเข้าป่าไปหาวัตถุดิบเป็นอะไรที่อันตรายมาก เพราะจะมีมอนสเตอร์ เช่น ก๊อบลิน หมี หมูป่า สุนัขจิ้งจอก คอยมารุมทึ้ง(หมาหมู่) พอเราตีมอนสเตอร์ใกล้ตาย มันจะวิ่งหนีเราอย่างไว (เปิดก่อน หนีตาย วิถีมอนสเตอร์เกมนี้)

3. การเดินของตัวละครช้ามากๆ วิ่งไม่ได้ วิ่งไล่ตัวอะไรไม่เคยทันเลย  
นอกเสียจาก สัตว์ที่เราวิ่งไล่ จะวิ่งติดกับพุ่มไม้เอง 

4. ระบบจับสัตว์เลี้ยง คือ ยากมาก ตัวละครเดินช้าอยู่แล้ว โยนเชือกไปจับ วัว หมู ไก่ แพะ แกะ ไม่ค่อยได้ในครั้งเดียว ต้องวิ่งไล่จับมัน จับได้คือฟลุก ส่วนมากจะจับไม่ค่อยได้ ไม่มีเกณฑ์อะไรในการจับ แค่โยนเชือกออกไปโง่ๆ พึ่งดวงเอาเอง

5. การต่อสู้ เป็นอะไรที่น่าเบื่อมาก สำหรับเกมนี้ เพราะการที่จะฟันใส่ศัตรูโดนแต่ละที ดีเลย์นานมาก ตีมอนสเตอร์ 1 ที เราโดนมอนสเตอร์ตี 3 ที 

6. แมพกว้างมาก อุปสรรคในการเปิดแมพเยอะ มีขวานคู่ใจ ฝ่าอุปสรรคไปได้ทุกที่ ภาพมีลายตาบ้าง ชวนปวดหัว

สรุป เป็นเกมที่เล่นง่าย ไม่เน้นภาพ เน้นรส เล่นไปชิวๆ สำหรับคนไม่มีอะไรจะเล่น แต่... ไม่เหมาะกับคนที่ชอบเล่นแบบจริงจัง ชอบความท้าทาย ชอบเอาชีวิตรอด ชอบการต่อสู้แบบมี วิ่ง หลบ สเต๊ลท์ จู๊ก เพราะในเกมทำไม่ได้ กว่าจะง้างดาบ /ธนูได้ ก็โดนตบไปแล้วหลายช็อต",1609970055,1609970055,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Auf einer sehr sehr großen Map mit unterschiedlichen Biomen muss man sich vielen unterschiedlichen Kreaturen stellen. Man kann gegen sie kämpfen oder sie zämen. Dabei findet man viele unterschiedliche Ressourcen, mit denen man neue Ausrüstung und Gebäude bauen kann. Die Grafik ist nicht die beste aber dennoch sehr ansprechend. Dank des Multiplayers kann man auch gemeinsam mit Freunden ein schönes zuhause kreieren. Im Spiel findet man wenige Fehler welche das Spielerlebnis beeinflussen. 

ABER,
im Multiplayer ist man sehr in der Umgebung eingeschränkt, da ab einer bestimmten Entfernung dein Mitspieler bei dir sein muss damit die Karte läd. Außerdem kann im MP nur der Spielhost Errungenschaften (von Steam) freischalten und die Voraussetzungen für das nächste lvl im Spiel sehen. Beim Teleportieren werden außerdem immer beide mitgerissen, was auch von Nachteil ist.
Es sollte auch eine Möglichkeit geben, dass Kreaturen nicht neuspawnen beim laden des Spielstandes oder beim schlafen. Diese spawnen scheinbar nur am Startpunkt nicht. Außerhalb kommen die Kreaturen wie Zb. Goblins immer wieder und können somit auch mitten in deinem Dorf erscheinen, woraufhin sie natürlich versuchen deine Gebäude zu zerstören.

Dennoch kann ich dieses Spiel empfehlen für RPG und Aufbausimulation begeisterte Spieler.
Ich hoffe ich habe allen, die noch über einen Kauf nachdenken, mit dieser Bewertung helfen können.

VERY linear progression,  All skills are locked behind level walls so that you literally must do X task and Y task to advance to level 2.  And then A task and Z task to advance to level 3.  Not based on experience or whatever. This makes progression completely predictable and  boring as hell.  The game is also slow and grindy.  As in general movements, production times, and progression.  Combat is abysmal.  You swing, they swing.  Hit bar shortens till one of you is dead.  Except mobs always get in more swings. Also sends bears after you before the introductory period is over and you havent a chance against them.  Cant even out run them.  This is purposely done, I believe to ""introduce"" you do death in the game.  There are FAR FAR better survival, construction games out there.  Glad I paid less than a buck for this else Id return it.  I dont often write such negative reviews but I feel that this game deserves it.

I got this game cheap, and honestly the UI looks cheap, but the gameplay is surprisingly solid. Think of it as old school. You can make a nice looking village base, take care of farm animals and crops, and then go out and beat up a bunch of monsters. There is a definite progression and end game that will keep you moving the entire time. It can be a bit grindy, but there's no rush to do anything, no calendar and no hunger meter, yet food becomes an important part of the game for healing and stamina. Creative use of terrain, plants and pathing adds a small bit of strategy to the game. The down side is that it's very guided with quest, resource and crafting requirements for each level. If that doesn't sound good then creative mode unlocks all the blueprints, but still makes you work for it. Hardcore mode unlocks once normal mode is complete. This game is not currently being updated, but the dev is working on a sequel. I'll probably buy that too when it comes out.

There was no need to reinvent this. Interacting with structures and crafting should not take so many clicks.

Also the software cursor can be painfully laggy, and I don't see an option to switch to hardware cursor. I hate when games do this.

As far as gameplay, the pacing and leveling seems decent, though the death penalty seems a bit steep. You might be surprised by 2 boars at level 4 near the starting area, and they'll charge you even underwater. Then you lose tons of stuff, and there doesn't seem to be a body to recover. Kiting is suggested but my character seems too slow for it.

The game is all right, but there's a dozen games that do it better. I'd rather play Ark or something.

☐ Это заменит тебе жизнь
☐ Запоминающийся
☐ Интересный
☐Не скучный
✓ Лучше иди поспи
☐ Сюжет?

Сюжета как такового и нет. Есть задания скрафтить то да сё, чтобы получить уровень, главная линейка как таковая отсутствует вообще.

---{Графика}---
☐ Реальность выглядит хуже
☐ Сочная
☐ Хорошая
✓ Приемлемо
☐ Плохая
☐ Там что-то есть?
☐ Опасно для глаз

Графика весьма посредственная для игры конца 2016 года, но в принципе за такую цену можно поиграть. Глаза не режет и слава богу ))

---{Геймплей}---
☐ Этим можно заниматься вечно
☐ Интересен
☐ Просто геймплей
✓ Ну такое
☐ Лучше просто сидеть на месте
☐ Похоже разрабы забыли, что делали игру

Геймплей прост как двери, менюшки как таковой и нету, кнопок по минимуму, разобраться во всём можно за 5-10 минут.

---{Аудио}---
☐ Экстаз
☐ Очень хороша
☐ Хороша
✓ Сойдет
☐ Ваш голос звучит лучше
☐ Играй без звука

Звуки середнячёк, иногда такие, что кажется как будто с бластера стреляют из звёздных войн. Набор звуков не богат, у каждого животного 1-2 звука. Музыкальное сопровождение посредственное.

---{Динамика}---
☐ ЧТО ЗДЕСЬ ПРОИСХОДИТ?!
☐ Очень динамично
☐ Интенсивно
✓ Умеренно
☐ Спокойно
☐ Можно даже заснуть
☐ Может она просто зависла?

Динамичны только бои, и то только с короткими мечами. С луками и булавами вы будете просто стоять на месте и протыкивать левую кнопку.

---{Сложность}---
☐ Продайте душу сатане
☐ Это будет тяжелый путь
☐ Просто научиться / стать мастером тяжело
✓ Средне
☐ Иногда нужно будет играть двумя руками
☐ Press ""X"" to win

Прошёл игру 2 раза. 1 на обычном и 1 на хардкоре. Супруга прошла на обычном. Я не умирал ни разу, а вот супруга разов эдак 10 ) Как раз на достижение

---{Аудитория}---
☐ Новорожденные
✓ Дети
✓ Взрослые
☐ Люди
☐ Точно НЕ люди

Я думаю подойдёт всем )

---{Требования к ПК}---
☐ Ждите квантовый компьютер
☐ Мощный
✓ Нормальный
☐ Первый компьютер пойдет
☐ Калькулятор сойдет
☐ Она запуститься, даже если вы просто подключите электричество

Настроек графики всего 4 пункта. Играл на максах на посредственном компе, не тормозило вообще.

---{Прокачка}---
☐ За одну жизнь не справишься
☐ Переизбыток гринда
☐ Иногда можно заскучать
☐ Это просто игровой процесс
☐ Только если вы хотите стать показушником
✓ Тут нечего прокачивать

Древа навыков нет, да и просто навыков нет как таковых. Единственное что можно прокачать это ачивки, да и их можно все кроме одной получить на хардкоре вообще особо не напрягаясь.

---{Время игры}---
☐ Бесконечность не предел!
☐ Довольно длинная
☐ Средняя
✓ Короткая
☐ Вы не успеете моргнуть

Первую партию прошёл за 44 часа, Супруга за 55. Вторую на харде прошёл за 32, но можно было и за 25 пройти.

---{Цена}---
☐ Тебе некуда девать деньги?
☐ Не стоит трат
☐ Можно подождать скидки (я бы даже сказал нужно)
✓ Цена оправдывает ожидания
☐ Бесплатна

Уже и не вспомню как я её покупал по распродаже или нет, но потратил на неё 70 украинских рублей, что в принципе для такой игры соответствует ожиданиям.

---{Баги}---
☐ ОСТОРОЖНО! ЗАПОВЕДНИК!
✓ Могут раздражать
☐ Иногда попадаются
☐Ты их видел?
☐ Тут просто нечему баговать

Больше всего бесит это вылеты, в принципе других багов не встречал. А вот при телепортах вылеты довольно частое явление и от них часто припекает...

----------------------------------------------------------
Подытожив вышесказанное могу отметить, что игра в принципе оправдывает свою цену. Для любителей крафтинга и эксплоринга подойдёт, хотя пройдя её один раз второй наверное и не захочется. Я второй раз проходил только ради ачивки хардкора, чтобы всё закрыть по достижениям. В целом за цену в 3$ рекомендую.",1605470120,1605470120,True,1,0,0.479094088077545166,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For the first half hour or so, I still wanted to like it.

First the positives: The UI is simple, it functions cleanly, building and crafting are straight-forward and do exactly what you want it to do. That's... honestly pretty much it.

Now the negatives. Before I get started, a quick disclaimer; all the complaints I have are not unusual for survival games. The problem lies not in [i]what's[/i] done, but in [i]how[/i] it's done.
 
1. The game's pacing is abysmal. Everything is done at a snail's pace from movement to crafting, and anything remotely resembling fun is hard-locked behind a truly asinine progression system. [u]Everything[/u] is locked behind levels, and you can only level by completing tutorial tasks that feel more like they're forcing you to use every item and mechanic out of spite rather than teaching you how they work.

2. The combat is some of the most boring I've ever seen in a game. Like everything else, your character's movements are slow and lethargic, while your enemies can just spam-attack you to death, getting in as many as three or four hits before you've even finished the swing animation. Just to make it worse, there's no appreciable feedback to a hit; there's just a generic hit sound and their health bar drops. Honestly the game would have been much improved by making combat entirely optional, or not putting it in at all.

3. Animal taming. Good. God. I don't know what sadistic person put this into the game, but I would sincerely like to have words with them. You have to use nets to catch animals, except all of the animals are twice or three times faster than you, spook easily, and the net either always fails on the first attempt or you have to click a second time or... I don't even know. Nobody seems able to agree exactly how it works, the game doesn't bother explaining it in any useful detail, and it's so un-intuitive that I can't be sure if I finally figured it out or the one catch I managed was just a fluke. If not for the fact you are absolutely required to do it just to progress it might not be that big a deal, but locking progression behind something so poorly designed is just inexcusable.",1604305649,1604730641,False,39,3,0.724953591823577881,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You are given a list of quests which you must do before you progress further into the levels. You have to do tasks in a certain order. You will find useful animals such as chickens and cows,goats,roosters,pigs,sheep once you have a weapon and also a trap(in which you can tame them in) Annoying but much required animals are boars,bears and foxes in abundance which run away with the last of its life if you aren't quick enough.. and take away your chance in getting that resource. There are many different food sources some edible others aren't. Such as mushrooms and toadstools for one example. Bananas and coconuts will be your 1st main nourishment for health and also stamina. As you craft items of use make up chests and barrels too to store them in. Only craft what you need as you cannot get rid of the extra items. With the forge and anvil you can craft better items as you will discover. I could go on and on but It is far better to discover the game experience for yourselves.

To err on the side of positivity, I will hit the 'yes' button, but this is a very, very lukewarm 'yes'.

It may look like I have a ton of time in the game at 28.4 hours, but this is really an illusion.  Whenever you restart the game, all enemies respawn.  So I tend to leave it open in the background while I play other games or do other things because I can't stand playing for more than an hour or two in one sitting--sometimes less.

I do plan to play more, but not because I love the game.  It is basically an interlude between other activities--just a way to pass a little time.  The game has a few enjoyable elements, but they are generally spaced out with lots of grindy drudgery in between.  For example, I think for my next level up, I need a bunch of emerald chips. These only seem to drop from an area that is very hot and has poisonous creatures.  So first I need to farm a TON of wool to process into fabric and burlap to make special clothes with no armor to let me tolerate the heat, which requires farming a bunch of wheat to feed the sheep.  Then I need to farm a bunch of materials to make a bunch of poison cures, since poison is super OP.  Then I still, as always, need to spend a bunch of time farming materials to make coffee since energy runs out super quick while doing anything.  And I still, as always, need to spend a bunch of time farming materials to make healing items since enemies hit hard and often.  And then there are my arrows.  And of course, I actually have to wait for the craftings to complete.  My healing items take 40 seconds each, and I generally need one after every encounter with a group of mobs.  So I will probably spend 2-3 hours just preparing for a 1 hour adventure to get the emerald chips.  At that point, I will probably be low on materials, and I will have to do the prep work over again to go back out and make it through the area.  If I restart the game without setting down a portal, I will have to do it all over again--with all the requisite prep work--because the mobs will respawn.  That's pretty much the game in a nutshell.  Farm and craft for hours to fuel short adventures you need to progress.

And the combat itself is pretty terrible.  It can be damn near impossible to hit anything with ranged items (nets, bows) if it is trying to run away, due to a combination of awful aiming mechanics, a long delay on firing, and the erratic movement of enemies.  This is super frustrating as many mobs will run away if they get to around 1/3 health, and you usually have to impotently watch and/or waste tons of arrows/nets without success.  It's a little easer to hit things trying to attack you, but they also have a lot more health and/or won't stay at range.  Melee combat is super super basic.  Basically, just click to attack, and... that's it.  There is not much skill involved except that with some enemies, it's best to attack from a certain distance while backing away so they either can't hit back or so they can only hit you once for each swing you take.  It's really not fulfilling.

It can be OK as a time waster, but it's not exactly fulfilling or exciting.  Fortunately, it's also pretty darn cheap.",1600961997,1600962660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2. С получением нового уровня ты бежишь открывать новые локации. А их не мало, что тоже хорошо. Но самое главное-они все разные не только по наполнению, но и по цветовой раскраске. Да и карта огромная!
3. Музыкальное сопровождение чудесно. Правда, я сначала испугалась, когда в новой локации зазвучала новая музыка))

Just too bad they forgot to add the house :/

With that I mean, the game is named Force of Nature, but should in fact be called Forced to Grind, as that's what struck me 42 hours into the game, that it was the only real thing that I'd done throughout the game. 
When you reach the last level before reaching the end, the game gives you a fat middle finger and chuckles: ""Oh, you thought you were done with all these meaningless tasks that you've already repeated more than 1000 times already? :P"" then tells you to outright grind double the materials you've already spent on previous levels, only for a final part which is obviously made to keep you playing the game and pump up the game's Steam stats, not to deliver on any real fun.

The only reason I bought this game was that I noticed the combat being kinda simple, yet entertaining, but the trailers lie about that. You will never pull groups like that, with or without friends, unless you're waaay above the mobs level as every time you level up, you're thrust into mobs that're usually a high enough level to make you go SPLAT within seconds, if not pulled in a cheating duck and cover tactic to separate them for one-on-one combat.
You can fight like they do, but it'll force you to spend five times longer potioning up again and getting out there for more.

There are other minor things, such a certain structures unlocking too late to be truly useful, but those can be explained by the creators of the game, trying to artificially inflate the game time and not provide the added entertainment to keep you wanting that last level, which is basically ""Welcome to grind Hell!"".

After I had gotten four whole diamonds and saw that that I needed 5 of each gem, I lost all will and want to finish up this ""game"". Why that's in quotation marks is, that the game feels like a bare bones project you'd pitch to a studio, so you could get the ressources to add content, story and otherwise expand on its possibilities.

Get mod support added to the game and let the players fill the void, that is the game's content besides grinding, with, just an idea, a mod that adds balance and content to the game, but until then...

Thanks, but no thanks. 
My will to keep existing in the game was killed after my 3000th tree and 5000th bush was cut down with 2500 coffees and god knows how much bread gulped down in the process, then only to be made aware of ""You need to grind a similar amount to all the previous levels to get the last one :D"".

Je vais vous laisser quelques conseils plus bas afin de vous aider à démarrer, sans quoi, le jeu est encore plus difficile.

Bien sûr il a des forces et des faiblesses alors les voici :

Les forces sont les suivantes :
Au niveau du gameplay, il se prend assez rapidement en main dans une ambiance assez relaxante pour un jeu de survie.
La survie est assez simple puisqu'il n'y a seulement 3 cadrans : vie, énergie et température (Merci pas d'eau et pas de bouffe qui sont parfois oppressants dans plusieurs autres jeux de survie)
Les différents biomes offres une belle diversité visuelle, tant en monstre qu'en environnement, tout en conservant les mêmes ressources récolter par ceux-ci.
Les objets de décoration permettre de faire un beau village. 
L'inventaire est très grand et évite de toujours aller se vider au village.

Les faiblesses sont les suivantes : 
Préparer-vous à farmer plusieurs heures pour les ressources et les objets/bâtiments qui sont nécessaires pour avancer en lv ou dans la map. (perso j'aime bien, mais je sais que certain non) 
En solo, les monstres peuvent vous tuer facilement lorsqu'ils sont en surnombre.
En coop, les monstres ont plus de points de vie et la mort d'un allié mène à la mort de toute l'équipe.

Voici les multiples conseils que je vous offre :
- La seule zone safe est la plage, alors construisez votre village à cet endroit et ne faite qu'une seule sortie vers la forest.
- Les objets jeter au sol ne disparaitrons jamais, cela permet de mettre moins de ressources pour construire des coffres et des barils pour le stockage.
- Les objets récoltés ne repoussent plus, alors garder plusieurs graines pour faire de l'agriculture.
- Remplir la plage de torche, la nuit est très noire.
- Toujours avoir les outils/armes les plus puissants disponibles avec vous.
- Prendre l'épée courte, elle permet d'esquiver certaines attaques puisque la vitesse n'est pas réduite lors des attaques.
- Pour farmer des pièces d'or, tuer des petits gobelins près de la plage et redémarrez le jeu, cela les fait réapparaître.
- Construisez vous le plus de portail de teleportation, cela permet de voyager rapidement dans l'immense map.
- Pour farmer des pierres précieuse, mettre un portail proche des zones où sont les fragments de force de la nature et faire comme pour les gobelin.
- Pour farmer des pierres précieuse, farmer beaucoup de rose de chaque biome, les transformer en élixir pour faire les pierres.

先說好玩的部分
1. 只要謹慎，動腦筋，就不太容易死(我的是故意拿10死成就才去故意自殺10次)
2. 完整的新手教學，只要看得懂上面的語言，相信你一定能上手
3. 溫度很真實(你玩過就知道)
4. 怪物攻擊，玩家攻擊，兩者的比例拿捏得很好(只要技術好可以無傷打怪，也可以站著互砍拼血)
5. 所有物品幾乎都有其用處，除了裝飾品類的，及極少數補品或食物
6. 多人模式所有新加入的人都是白板裝(不存在神級大佬帶你飛的情形，這會極大的破壞遊戲體驗，同時他在你世界獲得的物品也無法帶回去，你可以截留他的物品)

再來說說缺點
1. 多人遊戲下，傳送會全部人一起傳送，這樣就不能分開單獨冒險了(一個顧家，一個探險，這樣就不行)
2. 單人或多人遊戲下，極容易斷線，或者直接閃退遊戲(我猜可能是進入新地圖讀取地圖造成，多人遊戲常卡在過圖斷線，傳送斷線等問題)
3. 單人模式下，快速的退出單人世界到主選單，再進入同一個單人遊戲世界，有極大機率閃退遊戲(幾乎是98%以上)

我是特價15元買的遊戲
以15原來說
高於我的期待值
真的很好玩
但是遊戲穩定度希望能再優化

タスク消化型のサバイバル風作業ゲー、作るほとんどのアイテム・建造物はクエストや暑さ・寒さ等の環境で作成を求められるため自由度自体はあまりない。なんとな～く「かまどはこのへん、倉庫はこのへんで、祭壇の周りに松明を～」ぐらいの範囲で拠点を作る楽しみはある
今の所ボスを倒すような華々しい終わりはない　実績解除は合計60時間かかりました
そんな高くもないし返金もあるし買ってみよう

以下、折角60時間もややったのを無駄にしたくないのでちょっとしたアドバイス

・拠点になるであろう海辺の周りはヒマワリで囲まれているが、全部刈り取ると敵の拠点侵入を許してしまうため最小限の通り道に留めたほうがいい
・Eキーで「すべて取る」や「直近植えた植物を植える」、Ctrlで周りのアイテムを拾う、Altで植物を収穫する
・ハーブ系は毒を使う敵が出てくるまで、キノコは中～終盤までいらないので食べたり捨てたりしてOK
・木や葉っぱや石や鉄等はいくらでも手に入るのでケチる必要はない　畑が完成すると回復手段もわりと安定する
・そのへんにアイテムを捨て置いても自然消滅しないため無理に倉庫を作る必要はない
・クリア後は施設の制作上限がなくなるので幾つかの実績はそうなってからまとめてやったほうが早い

以下、バグやAIの穴的な挙動を利用したアドバイス
[spoiler]
・道具を切り替えるとモーションがキャンセルされるためツールバーに2本剣を装備し「1.2.1.2」と2本の武器を切り替えながら振ると攻撃速度が劇的に上がる　資源回収も2倍速
・木と木の間など細い道は大きいモンスターは入ってこれないので、そこに石の道等を引いて狩場にすると楽
・↑のようなモンスターが入れない場所から遠隔で攻撃するとモンスターはプレイヤーから離れる挙動を取るため、戦わず道を抜けたい時はスキマに入って石を投げる/弓を撃つ
・敵に囲まれたらセーブして終了で逃げることが出来る。毒も治る。ノーマルは死亡モーション中でもアイテムロストなく復活可能、ハードコアは死亡モーションが出るとメニューが開けないため余裕をもって逃げることを推奨する

- 1. Ce jeu est très lent : au niv 4, j'abats trois arbres et je n'ai plus d'endurance : à moins d'utiliser des soins d'endurance, ma journée (trop courte), hors artisanat, est finie;

- 2. Les ""coffrets"" dont on peut disposer au début - encore faut-il construire une hutte pour les abriter (2 par hutte - et la hutte, c'est pas donné en matières premières -) ! - n'ont qu'une contenance de 10 cases, chaque case pouvant contenir de 50 à 100 items seulement (par 50 bois, 50 pierres ou 100 brindilles, etc. c'est très/trop vite rempli) - en fait, on ne peut faire que deux huttes à ce niveau, donc 3 - peut-être 4 - coffrets, puisque la table d'artisanat doit également être sous abri;

- 3. Défi pour passer au niv 5, apprivoiser un animal - ok, mais ça sert à quoi si on n'a pas d'enclos et il en faut des planches et des clous pour construire un enclos... !?

- 4. Des items à foison plus ou moins inutiles - ou dont on ne sait s'ils seront un jour utiles -, qui encombrent perpétuellement l'inventaire; heureusement en montant de niveau on va pouvoir accéder aux tonneaux - de dix cases également -, mais qui peuvent être placés à l'extérieur...

- 5. Dans la barre d'action rapide, pour mes soins actuels : bananes-bolets-russules  = 3 cases; arme + 1; pioche, hache, bâton fouisseur (canne à pêche et vers restent dans l'inventaire) = 3 cases; 1 case libre pour les pièges, ou pour pouvoir donner des coups de pieds dans les arbres sans être obligé d'utiliser la hache, qui utilise pas mal d'endurance, et nous avons déjà rempli nos 8 cases d'actions rapides ! 

(Par ailleurs, les arbres - puisque je viens d'en parler - on peut aussi bien les abattre : y'a rien qui repousse après les bananes et noix de coco cueillies - N'ont pas envisagé la logique de la chose, les concepteurs - développeurs...).

Début trop gratuitement hard, en tout cas ! Je m'accroche pour avancer un peu, mais ça devient un peu trop pénible à mon goût... 

De plus, les contenus des contenants ne sont même pas pris en compte pour l'artisanat (comme c'est le cas pour un jeu, à peine plus récent, comme ""My Time in Portia"") : Il faut repasser tout l'utile dans l'inventaire, puis, après chaque fabrication, à nouveau ce qu'on peut dans les contenants avant départ en expédition ! - ça me rappelle ma jeunesse... -.

Hyper-hyper lourd et surtout mal pensé, mal organisé - Et ça, c'est un problème de dev' !!! -

Mais vrai que ce jeu est très prenant et que je continue malgré tout... Mais je ne compte pas persister : vraiment trop lourd ! Oui, il y a un artisanat fou, mais utile ? et surtout ...d'une lenteur ! tout comme pour l'évolution du perso'... Juste les cultures poussent vite.

Quant à ce piège / filet de capture, quelle horreur ! Je les fabrique par 100 et en suis venu à me demander si la capture d'un animal n'est elle aussi bridée en fonction du niveau du perso'...(?).
Après la poule, le coq et maintenant, au niv 6, je viens de ramener un cochon - vaches, chèvres, que dalle : le filet leur claque systématiquement sur la tête -.

C'est le jeu de toutes les limites : on prépare tous les composants pour la fabrication d'un item..., puis au moment où  on passe à la fabrication ...Ah non ! le nombre en est limité !
Je veux déplacer un coffre, histoire de voir si on ne peut pas en caser trois dans une hutte... Ah non, faut le vider ! 

Dites, c'est pas un jeu de 2016 ? ...de 2000 peut-être ?
Vrai qu'entre 2000 et 2010, je l'aurais peut-être trouvé bien...

Хороший игровой мир, Маленькие требования к ПК, Огромная карта, Хорошая графика, Доступная цена.. Можно заниматься фермерством, крафтом и строительством.

НЕДОСТАТКИ:
Находка некоторых предметов занимает долгое время. Гоблины и похожая дичь бьют больно.

Своеобразная интересная игра где мы с самого начала начинаем выживать и с нуля строить деревню. Мы занимаемся садоводством и также все время ищем предметы и сырье чтоб потом из них сделать чего нибудь нужнее для нам. Может и многих бесит то что в игре главный герой не может бегать и сделать все быстрее но не стоит так нервничать особенно если у вас нет времени. Если есть свободное время то можете попробовать. Графика игры хоть и не так уж красочная но это не самое важное ведь довольна неплохая графика. Рекомендовать можно игру особенно тем игрокам которые любят игры выживания и найти предметы крафтить их.

This game is not perfectly polished so probably avoid if you are on the picky side, that being said....I usually am for survival/crafting games.

You run slower than your average unfit person in real life but can eventually craft boots with run stats to make you faster! A point directed at those saying they hate that they have to pick up loot individually, it's ONE button to pick up a huge pile on the ground (L ctrl).....that's it! The biggest pros for me are that I got this game on sale, I can play it with a friend, there are multiple craft items to make, I can afk without dying to starvation (just like in real life!), there is still a purpose to food/cooking with a health and stamina system, progression level ups, achievements and trading cards.  Oh and you can build a home/base and a defense system against mobs, make portals/warps, farm vegetables and animals too! And for those who hate grind or want to play with kids, there is a creative mode where you don't have to quest and all recipes are unlocked. So despite it's few annoyances for me like the slow walking/running and certain terrains you can't quite easily get around sometimes due to choppyness, this game is pretty damn good! Wish there was a bit more colour customization for structures, items, and characters... and so far I can only play as a guy!

特價後區區15塊的遊戲
本來是抱著當丟水溝的心情跟其他遊戲一起加購物車的
但是遊戲本身卻出奇的豐富
雖然以畫面來講未必是某些人喜歡的類型
但是我覺得還算OK
視角有幾種選擇可以依個人習慣調整
但會選的應該也只有""自由""這一種吧
內建簡中算是還可以接受
總好過啃英文(字體大小也算清楚)
操作性與人物動作雖有些生硬
都還在可接受範圍內
在最重要的遊戲內容部分
雖然才剛開始玩半個多小時
但從初期新手導引以及可以看見的技能、建設等相關指令就已經可以發現這遊戲本身還蠻完整的
不過沒多少生存要素就是了(不用吃飯喝水也不會死)
基本上就是收集物品
做工具、裝備、蓋家然後可以打怪
能玩多久不知道
但以這價格來講我很確定是物超所值了
特價時極建議入手
看負評好像很多是在砲多人部份
單人無感


追加評論:
嗯...
又玩了一段時間
如果你能接受這畫面的話(遊戲實際畫面就如同影片一樣)
我覺得這個遊戲根本超CP值神作
除了步調較慢之外
真的算是個很棒的遊戲
生存要素很低這點算優劣各半
少了點緊張感卻可以很休閒
可以養家禽家畜
可以蓋房子
自己生產各種食材然後烹飪
野外有好幾種怪物能打(雖然打擊感差了點就是)
很推給喜歡休閒蓋家的人
以休閒小品的蓋家遊戲來評分的話

So far this is what I can say about the game. 1: the 90's called they want their character graphics and animations back. 2. On single player game play the loss of items upon death is way too high. I lost a total of 75 items (8 total types of items but they were stacked a fair amount) upon my first death. While I don't mind losing items upon death that seems a bit much more so since there is no way to recover said items. I also have a feeling given the aggressive NPC's attack speed and damage this game was never meant for solo play even though it says otherwise. I've played for a total of 5.5 hours and only made it to level 5 with no armor, and a weapon that is slow that does 22 damage, the faster weapon does far less and even then it's unbalanced at the start.  3. Taming is slightly annoying and there wasn't much to explain it, other than throw trap walk up to hit space...however that is unless the trap breaks within the first second giving you no time to even get close enough let alone hit space on it. 

Still it's not all bad, it's pretty automated where you don't have to babysit items as they craft, or do a lot of work to craft. The gird is odd, but normal for those used to the grid building from other games. The starting houses are super small, the small chests are smaller than their size would let you believe. For the 10 slots it holds I expected a smaller build but then again one item per grid square is logical.  Over all these things I've listed, I can say it's not bad so far, I've only faced goblins, boars, bears, and the foxes that tend to run when low health just like the boars. I have found the tamable cows, chickens(lots of those), and roosters, haven't found the others. To be honest where I started there are lots of rabbits, maybe having a snare or making them tamable would be interesting, a snare for easy beginner foods other than fruits from the ground or trees, or tamable for them to every so often drop fruits off for the player to eat. Even if it's a temp tame with a time limit it'd help a lot. 

Anyways I would say I'd recommend this, though it does need a bit more work and balancing, including more ores around the starting area, as my one death so far was me trying to find ore and getting stuck between a tree and a ledge while running from a bear, two boars and a goblin all the while trying to eat food to regain health. Even so I would say play it with friends if you are able or alone if you like the challenge of doing things solo.",1593455923,1593455923,True,1,0,0.486312389373779297,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Wanted to play it only until trading cards drop and that's it. Then I got into it and to my surprise got hooked. It is a great game, but not for everyone. I start with the contras:

Contras:
- Graphics and Controls feel like a timemachine; not state-of-the-art for sure, rather like it was around 2000
- Character Customization: ""Hair Color"" ""Body Color"" ""Pant Color"". That is it.
- Menus: Lots of clicking (however, auto-stack with E helps)
- Fights: Very simple. Stand there, click, hope your health is higher than the enemy's.
- Movement: Your char is clumsily moving, wiggles his behind when digging ^^ Also, at first he moves in snail pace. You need at least to get to level 7 (speed-boots) before that changes.

Pros:
- No time constraints whatsoever. You can relax at your base, go afk 3h, nothing happens, you won't starve or such. Be as slow or fast with progress as you like to. Plant a million sunflowers in between if you wish. It does not matter.
- In general it is a relaxing game. Explore the world, slowly, bit by bit, place portals to go further and further.
- Crafting. I liked it! It is the exact right amount between grinding for stuff/farming and getting it done, for me.
- The soundtracks when you enter a new biome are amazing!

Tipps:
- Gold coins: These are actually earned fast once you got the straw bed. Sleep for a night and low level goblins will respawn all around the base, these level 1s should drop plenty coins.
- Animals: Get a cow and chickens early to make proper food, exploring is way less painful with coffee to refill stamina and some cheese or strawberry dessert for health

So it's a survival exploration game where you need to find coins (yes, useless currency in a wilderness with no stores) to unlock what you can build with all the wide wilderness at your feet.

Most mobs also run away when low on health and the ranged weapon mechnics in this game are straight up trash. It's not difficult, punishing, or interesting, it's running around in the woods looking for goblins to kill so I can build a better house while getting mauled to death by gangs of foxes, boars, and bears.

The game held my attention for a bit, I had the curiosity itch of 'whats beyond my radar', I need to know but, the grind got to me, not bad mind you, I like games that grind out, this one I kind of got bored with fast. 
I'll come back to FoN again sometime soon and give a full review..

Fun little game, can't give a full review in just 3hrs of game play. but the 3hrs I did play was fun.. 
Definitely worth a buy on sale..

EDIT : tl;dr
Jumped back into FoN going on 24hrs now. So I feel I could give a more detail feedback.. 

- Right away I felt the grind of the game, I found myself being forced into a lot of crafting, as most of my time I spent (in my early levels) crafting a ton of Stam/Health Food. In order to craft such food/drink I had to venture out of my starting camp and harvest needed materials, which in turn I had to use said food/drink to stay alive to harvest enough mats to craft.. This is where I felt the grind kick in.. 

- Fighting style is pretty basic, as far as RPG's go.. Standard Melee toe 2 toe bash/slice. Then there is the Ranged fighting style, first you throw Rocks (which is a crafting Item), then upgrade to a bow much later on in levels. The Ranged Fighting is nice, pop the mobs in the head w/ a rock, or shoot them w/ an arrow, a few times as they run towards you, swap to melee and smack'um.. 
Don't expect to chase the mobs when they run away, practice your throwing/bow and you should be able to get the last hit on them as they turn n'burn.. They do run VERY fast.. 

- Building a Camp/Base is VERY slow going.. You'll need to build grass huts early on, in order to put a chest in there, which they HAVE to be in, can't place a chest outside near your make shift blacksmith area. Later on in levels you'll be able to make Barrels, which can be put outside, so you end up making a ton of them when they unlock.. Yes, more mat grinding.. 

FYI : When placing your first hut or two, make sure you want them in that position, as you can not move them once placed, you'll have to destroy all yer hard work and make a new hut. You can move a few things, and all yer blacksmith item are outdoors, so they can be moved around, just take out the tools and mats first.

- One of my biggest gripes about the game is Storage. You can only make 10-slot barrel(s)/chest(s).. I did find myself dropping a TON of mats on the ground near my crafting stations (they wont disappear, even if you log out), all while farming needed mats for storage. That took awhile, again a grind. 
Some mats do stack to 100, a few others stacked to 50 so that helps I guess.

I found the Armor a bit strange looking and I think its level 7 when you can actually make armor other than a crude cape and tarzan underwear. Once you do hit lvl-7 you cant even make a Leather top/shirt, only gloves/pants/shoes.. you still have to wear the cape, which now looks like your wearing your sisters hippy bra.. unless you make a shirt(which is more appealing) but.. gives no armor, so you end up wearing Tarzan Bra(called a cape) for the 3AC it gives.. its just off to me is all.. 

- The game as a whole is a fun/good time sink.. You'll spend all your time gathering required items for what the dev(s) call a Quest, meaning go gather X-Amount of mats, then make a certain something, then level. Rinse & Repeat.. Now, as far as I've gotten, you just pretty much chase level items to move on to the next level, aka.. Quest.. like most games..

FYI: All the pretty camps you see people have in the Screenshots/Videos.. They spent a lot of time getting there, as Everything is locked behind a level.. Which bummed me out, as I'm a base-builder kinda player, so I've got a few more GRINDING Levels to go before I can unlock the good things and make a decent base.. but I feel by the time I get to that level, the game end could be near, so I'm feeling just make the basics, grind out the next few levels and be done.. Not sure I'd want to grind for a pretty base then turn around and game be done.. FoN just doesn't make me feel like I want to stay around.. just get the levels and finish.. sad really as it had potential.

- For the price I paid on sale, a whopping $0.99c, and I think it's $0.79c now, was well worth it tbh..
It's a fun grind of a game with an odd qwerky undertone.. I'm for sure going to push on and see what the next 24hrs hold and fight to the finish..

Auch wenn man mit dem Spiel zu Ende ist - kann man weiterspielen und seine Basis verschönern.

Habe alle Errungenschaften erspielt - bis auf den Hardcore-Modus - habe ich probiert, bin dann in Level 6 draufgegangen, da ich von allen Seiten angegriffen worden bin - war ein satter Hinterhalt.

The game is incomplete and the mechanics are borked at best. The premise of the game is pretty standard to any survival game, build a house, and run deeper into the environment. However the game feels incredibly unrewarding. The level system is an embodyment of pay to win, requiring you to provide items and gold to level, rather than using an all too familiar EXP system, but it is also tied to all players in the game. So if one person initiates a level, everyone else gets it too. Which personally I do not like. That's not the only thing tied together in this game either. DEATH, is tied to everyone. Everybody gets a bomb strapped to their wrist, and if any one persons heart stops beating. That is it. End of the line for everyone else involved. So EVERYBODY loses whatever, depending on difficulty. The UI is very clunky and confusing at the beginning, making it kind of hard to learn how to do things, so if you are not particularly familiar with the survival genre, this is NOT where you want to start. The combat is a bit fruitless as well, many of the enemies you fight at the beginning already overpower you easily, and if you get lucky enough to get the edge on one of them, they run away when their health gets low, and they outrun you easily. Which is a whole other problem if you need to run. Lastly, once again, most critical, despite being incomplete and borky the developer has already abandoned this game to work on the 'second' game. Which looks a lot better, but what it really is,  is the 1.0 of this game. Don't waste your money on this, if his 'sequal' actually gets completed I would just wait for that.

I bought this game for $1 and I truly think its worth the price. I have played it for 10 hour now and i am on level 6 at the moment. The crafting system is quite nice, I must say. There is a lo o this game for just a dollar honestly. I like survival and crafting and management sort of games although I do play a vast genre of games. But there are some things that could make this game even better. I wonder if there is a way to move a little more faster or sprint I mean, and the fact that I cant delete the unused/unwanted items heightens my OCD. Also the way the levelling up system is could be made more better because at times i feel stuck just because I cant craft that item needed to level up....

Pros: 
Many Biomes
In-Depth Crafting 
Big/Huge Procedural Map
Needs a very minimal configuration to run
Variety of animals(some can be tamed)
Monsters can be tamed

Cons:
To Slow - Need a way to sprint
No way to delete unwanted items once you get upgraded items

I'm one of those people who love running around my camp making things because it gives me the illusion of being the productive and efficient human being that my real-life self is not. I am usually okay with waiting for crops to grow and waiting for animals to produce things while I methodically murder trees with a tool I slapped together with things I found on the beach.
I like the variety of audio options in the settings! Sometimes you want to hear one thing and not another. It's not comprehensive, but man was I happy to find that I didn't have to listen to my portal buzz 24/7 after placing it next to my house and learning I couldn't move it.
Items stay on the ground if you leave them there. Storage is optional. I can live as the filthy slob that I've always known I was, surrounded by piles of sticks and glowing embers. (Do you smell something burning..?)

Cons:
Combat is terrible, and yet is a key part of the game. Everything is faster than you, so neither chasing nearly dead things nor running away from stronger things work. They also tend to attack faster than you (except for goblins) and there's nothing you can do about it. The only way to survive a party of moose and rock people is to consume copious amounts of healing products beforehand so that their healing cool downs are stacked all up on top of one another, using up foods that took quite a long time to put together because of the cooking table's massive crafting times, and if you die anything you worked hard to collect could just vanish into the void of death, throwing all those wait times down the drain.
Navigating the landscape is just a bit awful. I can never tell if the land is too steep for my jelly-legged man to scale, and can never tell if trees are far enough apart for me to squeeze thick thighs through, not to mention the times when I turn around and my goblin compatriot or kidnapped animal companion is stuck nose-deep in the underbrush. (My chickens keep getting stuck inside bushes, which I then have to destroy, which takes time and stamina.)
Leveling up is an item sink. This doesn't even make any sense. Who are we giving these things to? Are we absorbing them into our flesh? Plus the level up isn't even satisfying because it just means the start of another section of waiting around waiting for things to be made while you go get slapped about by newer, meaner local wildlife.

I was genuinely enjoying the game up until I realized that an objective was surrounded by things that could turn me into paste and there was no reasonable way for me to make something to be stronger than them or kill them faster than they could kill me. A man made of rocks totally caved my skull in despite the fact that I was cramming delicious strawberry confections into my esophagus like Joey Chestnut inhales hot dogs.

Some improvements I'd love to see are some balancing of the combat mechanics and perhaps some tweaks in the crafting timers, particularly since the number of crafting stations is limited. I'd rather that crafting be a resource sink than a time sink. Why would I sit around chopping trees I don't need in a game I'm hardly playing (because all I'm doing is killing time!) when I could go, I don't know, play Solitaire in my computer's Start menu?

+En başta harika gözüken harita detayıyla başlamak istiyorum :D Piksel piksel :)
+Açlık,susuzluk,karanlıktan korkma,akıl sağlığı kaybetme,yağmurdan ıslanma gibi durumlar yok efor sarfedince dayanma gücü azalıyor,hasar yiyince sağlığı düşüyor.
+Crafting sistemi oldukça detaylı düşünülmüş.Daha hızlı craft yapabilmek için kullanılan aletlerin yükseltilmesi gerek.
+Kullanılan aletlerin,silahların durability si yok.
+Demir örs kullanabilmek için önce onu yapmak daha sonra aletlerini craftlamak gerekiyor.Çekiç ve maşa gibi.Pişirme masasında havan ya da tava gibi.
+Kullanmadığımız aletleri level 8de gelen çöp kutusuna atıp yok ediyoruz.
+Hayvanlar tamelenebiliyor.Domuz,keçi,inek,koyun,horoz,tavuk gibi.Goblin de tameleyerek sizin için savaşabiliyor.Azad ederseniz ölüyor.
Domuza elma verip solucan,keçiye ve ineğe saman verip süt,koyuna saman verip yün,horoz a yem verip ok için tüy,tavuğa yem verip yumurta elde edebiliyoruz.Hayvanların yiyecek ya da su ihtiyacı yok.Sadece ürün elde etmek istersek besliyoruz.
+Yemek olarak kıymalı börekten,meyve sularına bitki çayına kadar herşey yapılabiliyor.Meyvelerden kokteyller yapıp dayanıklılığımızı arttırabiliyoruz.Dipnot:Ayçiçeği tohumu seri şekilde tüketildiği için 200er adet toplayıp ard arda basıp dayanıklılık arttırmak daha mantıklı.
+Hayvan avlayıp etleri pişirebiliyoruz.Deniz kenarında balık avlanabiliyor.Yem olarak solucan gerekli.Onu da topraktan çıkarabiliyoruz ya da domuz besleyerek elde ediyoruz.
+Hayvan postları kıyafet yapımında kullanılıyor.Kıyafet için aynı zamanda koyunlardan yün elde edilip terzi makinesinde kumaş işlenebiliyor.Postlar için tilki,domuz ve ayı öldürmek gerekli.
+Düşen pençe ve azı dişlerini geçit yapımında kullanacağımız dişbudak için saklamak gerek.Geçit için;pençe,kemik ya da azı dişi gerekli.Geçiş kapısının kapsadığı bir alan var onun dışına ikinci geçit konulabiliyor.Geçit yapımında bir limit yok.
+Sebze ve meyve haricinde birçok çiçek ekilebiliyor,çabuk olgunlaşıp toplanabiliyor.İleriki leveller de ağaç,ayçiçeği de ekebilme şansınız var.
+Bitki ya da ağaç keserken tekme atarak ağacı yok etmiyoruz yine materyal düşüyor.
Ağaç ya da bitkileri base etrafinda fazla yok etmemek gerek uzakta materyal toplamak daha mantıklı.
Ağaçları kestiğimizde kütükler kalıyor onlarıda baltayla kesmeye devam edin yoksa etrafta kötü görüntü oluşuyor.Saç ekimi yapılmış kafa gibi diyeyim siz anlayın.
+Toprak eşilerek toprak,kil,kum elde edilebiliyor.İlk levellerde sopayla eşelerken daha sonra kürekle toplayabiliyoruz.Dekorasyonun yanı sıra geçit için de gerekli.
+Yere dökülen talaşlar ya da inşa edilen kaldırım daha hızlı hareket etmenizi sağlıyor.İleri ki levellerde çakıl taşı da mevcut.
+Bölgeden ayrılsanız bile basede devam eden işiniz bittiğinde ekranda uyarı çıkıyor.
+Soğuk ve sıcak iklimler var kıyafetler buna göre craftlanıyor.Kıyafetleriniz uygun değilse hasar almaya başlıyorsunuz.
Bazı yaratıklar zehirleyebiliyor bunun için bitki çayı içmek gerek.Menekşe,biberiye ve ateş çiçeği birleşimiyle elde ediliyor.
+Kuyudan su çekip bitki üretiminde kullanıyoruz ya da hayvanları beslemek için.6 kova su limiti var.
+Arı kovanlarından bal elde edilebiliyor.Oldukça uzağa koymanızı öneriririm.Çok sinir bozucu bir sesi var.
+Pusula craftladığımızda göreve yönlendiriyor ve arayüzde sabit duruyor.
+Uzun kılıcı tek elle tutabiliyor yiğido.
+Craftlanabilen bir çıngırak var.Kullandığınızda dans etmeye başlıyor.
+Level arttıkça,base i güçlendirdikçe yaratıklar daha fazla oluyor.Base e saldırabiliyor.Haritanın herhangi bir yerine diktiğiniz meşalelere saldırabiliyorlar.Siz base i düzenlemekle meşgulken sürekli goblinler gelip saldıracak.Bu kadar goblinin base e doğru sık aralıklarla saldırması sırf goblin başarımı için olmalı.En nihayetinde sinir bozuyor.
+Co-op oynarken biri kılıç kullanırken diğeri yay kullanırsa daha rahat kesiliyor.Biri ölürse kaldırma olayı yok.Tekrar başlayacaksınız.Level 8 den sonra oyun biraz daha zorluyor.Yaratıklar daha güçlü crafting için daha fazla materyal gerekli.

Daha iyi olabileceğini düşündüğüm hoşuma gitmeyen detayları paylaşacak olursam;
- Koşma,çömelme,zıplama,oturma gibi eylemler yok.Dans etme lüks sayılır onu saymadım bile.
- Bazen aralıklı bir ağacın arasından bile geçemiyorsunuz.
- Co op oynarken belli bir mesafe içinde hareket etmek gerekiyor.Birbirinizden çok fazla uzaklaşamıyorsunuz.Bu idare edilemeyecek bir detay değil.
- Envanter büyükken fıçı ve sandıkların slotu az.İleriki leveller de raf,daha büyük fıçılar,sandık bölmeleri yapılabiliyor.
-Çalı ev,kovuk gibi yapılar bizim için değil sırf yatak,sandık ya da masa koyabilmek için.Neyse ki ileride kendimiz için kulübe ve ev inşa etme şansımız var.Daha sonra çalı evi de kovuğu da yıkabilirsiniz.
-Etraftaki yapıların bı kısmı taşınmıyor.Taşınabilenleri ilerleterek taşıyoruz.Bırakıp tekrar alarak tek hamlede taşınmıyor. 
-Force of nature taşının olduğu noktalar her zaman kalabalık.Level arttıkça kalabalık yaratıkları öldürmek daha zor.Ölüp tekrar denemeye kalktığınızda güzergah boyunca yaratıkları temizlemiş olsanız bile yine yaratıklar çıkıyor.

***Son olarak;fiyatı indirimdeyken oldukça ucuz,boyutu düşük,co-op oldukça eğlendiren,iyi vakit geçirilebilecek güzel bir oyun.Bir yerden sonra sık öldüğümden solo devam edemeyeceğimi farkettim.Oyunun sonunu merak ediyorum.Sırf base i düzenleyerek bile çok keyif aldım.Bir ara goblinlerden sürü yapıp base i korumayı bile planlamıştık :P Yeri geldi karanlıkta korka korka sabah olmasını bekledim.Yeri geldi base de işimi bıraktım yağmurun sesini dinledim.Gayet başarılı bulduğum bir oyun.İyileştirilebilecek bir çok şeyi var.Oyunun tek eksiği kadın karakterle oynayamıyor olmak.
Oyunun ikincisi yolda.Artem'i blogundan takip ediyorum.İkincisi için sabırsızlanıyorum.***",1588168183,1588176323,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игру взял по скидке за 22р - свои деньги полностью оправдала. Отличное дополнение коллекции.

О важных особенностях

соло режим
- играть можно до 6-7 лвл - дальше просто устанете фармить ресурсы.
- некоторые важные вещи нигде не прописаны и придется самим разбираться (к примеру, я никак не мог понять, как найти осколок природы при помощи компаса, пока случайно не заметил на карте обозначение алмаза, сквозь туман войны)
- при рестарте вся фауна респавнится заново

мультиплеер

- к созданному серверу можно подключится ТОЛЬКО если у вас в стиме горит, что вы играете в эту игру. Это значит, что программы перед стартом (всякие чатики и виджеты (стримеры поймут)) надо закрывать, а также выходить из инвиза (ох уж эта популярность)
- к уже запущенному серваку подключится нельзя. Надо сохранять и перезапускать
- файлы подключаемым игрокам каждый раз по новой докачиваются от хоста (если один руинит этот процесс - все по новой)
- в саму игру может подключится максимум 4 человека (включая хоста)
- мир и правда огромный (это плюс), но фигня в том, что путешествовать в другие локации вы можете только всем табором, а кто же тогда будет варить кофе и овец пасти? - вся рабская система труда рушится
- не баг, а фича - все глобальные действия (сон, лвл ап и тп на портале) применяется для всех игроков. Так сном можно восстанавливать стамину работягам, и сейвить порталом их от гибели
- кол-во важных сооружений не меняется от кол-ва игроков - так вам нужно сразу распределять роли, кто повар, а кто руинер (воин)

No story, the leveling is weird (there need to be more levels with quests and tech unlocks more spread out to encourage more exploration and building), the crafting time/resources/unlock-level balance is really asymmetrical and unpredictable, and there is, in the final analysis, not actually that much content.

On the other hand it's relaxing, you can pace things however you want - even the campaign feels fairly sandboxy (which to be fair is as-advertised) - it's beautiful, and you're not bogged down by tech trees or resource chains so complicated you'd need an army of wiki-writers to disentangle it.

I'm not sure if this is a plus or a minus but I'd spend hours playing and feel, at the end, like I'd accomplished very little.

That said, after playing for 16 hours and giving it a real go, I cannot recommend unless you get the under $1 deal that I got on it and have a lot of patience.

The GAME ENGINE seems like it's pretty old, which is normally fine with me since I come from the heroes of might and magic era, but the UI is clunky and requires a lot of extra clicking, the movement so slow. QUESTS are okay, but once you hit about level 6 the game jumps in difficulty and some of them are poorly timed (it wants me to go into a zone with level 10 mobs in order to level up at level 6 or 7). Honestly FIGHTING is pretty hard / really easy to get 2-3 mobs and get rolled... and when I tried CO-OP, my friend died when I died, even though he was at the home base building stuff and nowhere near a mob. I also don't like that it's not practical to try to create a new safe zone anywhere else in the world, and that maintaining your own safe zone requires you to be really careful to open only one really narrow and safe path from where you land initially. STRUCTURES break easily, and they will aggro any nearby monsters that spawn whether you're there at the time or not. There's no way to restore a tree or bush blocking the path once you chop it down, and they don't grow back once cut down, so you have to think about pathing to monsters UPON STARTING in-game or risk them wandering in. It does give you starting materials to collect all within the safe zone, though, which will get you to about level 3 or so, so that's a place where the game is smart. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION adjustment is very simple (and hidden in the pause/settings menu), but at least present. You can't play a female, but you can customize the skin color (skin colors only, no fun colors like elvish purple), hair color (most colors), and shorts (most colors). 

I will say that I did enjoy TAMING farm animals, and building a pen for them that existing animals can't escape from while trying to place a new animal (because they will otherwise wander all around camp and sometimes scare you into thinking they're going to wander right into a mob eventually). A pen also makes it easier when farming things like wool, so you don't have to wander all over the place looking for each animal in camp. I also like that not feeding the animals doesn't cause them to run away, and I also like that I can't kill them by accident while tamed (I've accidentally taken a few swings at some while fighting).

WISH LIST: 
* I would like to play this game purely in creative mode with no monsters (only animals) and without requiring materials to be collected, which takes FOREVER. I have had some fun with not-so-great games in the past with that and it's really disappointing to go into creative mode and find out that you still have to collect all the materials by hand and probably fight mobs, etc. My idea of creative mode is like Raft, where they just let you build with unlimited mats.
* I'd also like to be able to move major structures like huts around and not have to build inside or outside of structures depending on what you're building.
* In regular mode, maybe double the run-speed and stamina bar. You run out way too quickly and nobody wants to wait 1 full minute or two for the food to work to replenish health, and then another minute or two for stamina because you can't eat stamina and health food at the same time unless you have special food items that do both (equally slowly, if not more slowly because two-for).",1587319216,1587319216,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You will spend 1/10th of your time exploring the map, and the rest of that 9/10ths jumping from work station to station, slowly grinding out tedious tasks like using a shovel to pick up piles of sand, waiting on slow timers for crafting and resource capping, and being unable to add different varieties of items to a crafting queue at once.  Each new area zone takes about 30-45 minutes to explore for the next objective, involving unwanted combat, annoying manual path-making via ax, and slow stamina recharge- over and over, so you can make it to the same type of linear goal per new area.  It also requires you to make new clothing every time you enter a new area, and doesn't want you reusing or re-purposing any previously made sets of clothes, which take hours of work to make in the early game!  So anytime you reach a new zone, you will not get to explore it for a few hours yet, because suddenly there is more hours of crafting to do.

To level up, you are required to craft all items from a preset list, and after doing all of those tasks, you need to collect a large amount of certain materials, which it will then eat upon turn-in, thus transforming your level ups into a frustrating resource sink.

So many missed opportunities here.  There is a weather system that gives you relaxing rainy days.  For some reason, however, it does literally nothing for your game experience.  Why not have it auto-water your crops?  Get rid of the need to feed water to your animals during rain?  Make your wells fill faster?  All kinds of creative rewards they could have offered to us and the game has none of this kind of exciting immersive variety.  Why not have potions that temporarily increase ax or pickaxe efficiency?  Why not make enemy or animal lures that can increase the spawn rate of certain things?  Give us more!!

I think if there was a bit more effort put into the little things, I wouldn't be as annoyed with it.  Small user-friendly features like a run button for greater travel speed, the ability to rotate your camera view while in a build prompt, the ability to move ALL of your constructions once built, etc, would have improved this experience for me.  As it is, it feels like a disorganized student project instead of a good quality game.  Also, majority of work stations will be required to be built indoors for some reason, however the huts you are allowed to build early on are not only tiny, but limited in number for how many you are able to make per level.   It forces you outside of a more sandbox experience into a very linear crafting path.  Pretty much the only sandbox feature of the game is getting to decide where to put your stations....that's it.  This is NOT a sandbox experience.

I could easily forgive the strange bitmap-looking MS Paint map and the early 2000's aesthetics if there was just more love put into this game overall.  I think it was worth the $0.79 USD I spent on it, at least.",1587318740,1588110423,False,3,0,0.526174068450927734,0,True,False,False,False,,,

생각보다 볼륨이 있는 게임이었고 2회차까지 해야 모든 도전과제를 완료할 수 있다.

다만 스팀 도전과제를 완료할때는 한세이브 파일을 기준으로 숫자를 세기때문에 업적달성에 상당한 노가다가 필요하다.

스팀 도전과제에서 가장 오래걸리는것은 고블린 1000마리 죽이기, 장미500송이 키우기 밀 1500개 키우기인데
밀은 말그대로 1500개를 키우면 되고 고블린은 1000마리를 죽이면 되는데 장미는 검은장미를 550개를 키웠는데도 불구하고 업적달성이 되지않았고 빨간장미를 500송이가량 키웠을때 업적달성이 되었던바 장미키우기는 수량이 제대로 체크가 되지 않거나 빨간장미만을 카운트하는 것으로 보인다.

참고로 침대표시의 도전과제는 잠을 10번자면되고, 토끼잡이는 20회 잡으면 된다.

이외에 게임진행상 팁으로는 음식의 경우에는 여러가지가 합쳐진다고 좋은것이 아니다. 예를 들어 청버섯 8개에 각종재료를 포함하는 잘만든 체력물약이 HP80을 채워주는반면 청버섯 8개가 HP80을 채워주므로 초반에는 체력회복수단을 그냥 버섯을 먹음으로서 해결하고 나중에 물약을 만들 수 있을때 만들어도 충분하다.

세이브마다 차이점이 있는 부분은 물약의배합율과 사막VS열대의 차이가 있다. 세이브파일마다 물약의 배합율이 다르므로 물약 조합법을 스스로 연구해야만 잘만든등급의 포션을 만들 수 있는데 생각보다 어렵지는 않다. 팁이라면 반드시 조합총량이 1일필요가 없다 0.1+0.3 조합법으로도 100%의 물약이 나온다.

사막과 열대는 세이브마다 초반에 향할 수 있는 구역이 사막지역이냐 열대지역이냐에 따라 갈린다.
사막지역은 노멀하게 몹도 적당히 약하고 지형지물도 적어서 탐험이나 파밍하기에도 수월한 반면
열대지역이 걸리면 초심자는 새로 하는게 날정도로 차이가 크다.
열대지역은 초반에 설탕 다수를 확보할 수 있는 갈대와 대나무를 대량으로 구할 수 있고
초반 기력관리를 매우 용이하게 해주는 바나나나무가 대량으로 스폰되기때문에 자원적인 측면에서는
더 나으나, 문제는 해당 몹들이  초반몹치고는 너무나도 세다는 것이다. 거기에 주는것도 별로 없다.
거기에 열대지역이니 당연히 울창한 수풀림이 함께 스폰되며 전진하기에 매우 빡세서 탐험하기에 매우 힘들다는점이 있다. 사실상 빠른진행은 힘들다.


음식의 경우에는 표시되지는 않으나 모든 효과가 '중복적용'된다.
예를들어 25초에 걸쳐서 체력회복이 되는 고기파이의 경우에는 파이를 쿨타임마다 계속해서 먹으면 체력회복버프가 중복이 되기때문에 체력이 차는 속도가 2배 3배 4배 이런식으로 증가하게 된다. 몹들이 강할수록 이런버프는 매우 유용하니 참고하기 바란다.
매우 합리적인 시스템으로 음식을 여러개 먹는다고 버프가 하나만 적용되거나 그런게 아니라 모든버프가 중복으로 적용된다. 물론 섭취한 음식당 총 회복량은 변함없으니 위급하지도 않은데 여러개를 동시에 먹어서 손해보는일이 없기를 바란다.

추천 음식으로는 초반에는 바나나 야자수 청or그물버섯으로 체력과 기력을 회복하고 이후에 조리대가 완성되면 커피와 딸기케이크로 갈아타자. 이쯤되면 몹들이 주는 데미지가 청버섯의 체력회복속도로는 감당하기 힘들기때문에 빠른 체력회복수단이 필요하다. 커피의 경우에는 가장 손쉽게 대량으로 구할 수 있고 모든재료가 물이 원료이기때문에 물만 잘 모은다면 충분한양의 커피를 확보할 수 있고 체력회복음식중 2차가공음식의 메인재료 중 대량으로 생산이 가능한것은 딸기밖에 없기때문에 두가지가 가장 추천되는 음식이다.
후에 사과나무를 재배해서 사과파이를 대량생산할 수 있지만 이때되면 같이 등장하는게 체력포션이라 등장타이밍이 애매해서 잘 쓰이지 않는다.
후반으로 넘어가면 체력수단은 잘만든체력포션으로 갈아타면되고 버섯을 키우는데 대량의 물이 들어가기때문에
체력포션에 필요한 청버섯이외에는 대량생산이 사실상 힘들어 지구력회복수단은 여전히 커피와 초콜릿으로 추천된다. 양봉장에서나오는 꿀이 아교를 만드는데 들어가기 때문에 중반까지는 꿀이 매우 부족하지만 아교가 소모되는 양이 그리 많은 것도 아니기때문에 점점 쌓이게 되고 이때 커피에서 초콜릿으로 넘어가면 된다.
같은 원두양으로 2배에 가까운 지구력 회복이 되기때문에 많이 추천된다.
물론이때 필요한 버터는 소를 몇마리 키우면 바로 해결되거나 해바라기농사를 짓거나 해바라기를 채집하면 금방 모이게 된다.

하드코어모드진행시에는 항상 esc를 생활화하자, 일순간의 방심으로 수십시간키워온 세이브파일이 그대로 날아갈 수 있기때문에 조금이라도 위험해보이면 그냥 esc저장후 종료버튼을 눌러 나가자. 항상 새로시작하는 시점은 첫시작했던 해변가이나, 포탈을 만든이후부터는 각포탈마다 스폰장소를 지정할 수 있기에 자원탐색이나 노가다에 매우 용이하다.

이외에 게임진행에 가장 효과적인 팁이 있다면 농사짓고 가축기르고 나무벨 시간 모두 아껴서 일단 레벨업이나 하는게 낫다. 레벨업을 하게 되면 해금되는 무기와 장비가 매우 좋아지는 것은 별개로 노가다에 필요한 건축물들의 수량제한이 완화되면서 레벨이 높아질수록 더 적은 시간을 투자해 더 높은 효율의 노가다를 할 수 있게 된다. 그러니 이것저것 신경쓸바에 그냥 나오는 아이템들 모으지말고 그냥 최대한 줏어먹고 집주변에 던져놓고 일단 빠르게 탐험 ㄱㄱ해서 레벨업을 하는게 가장 좋다. 상자도 필요없다. 어차피 땅바닥에 내려놓은 아이템은 사라지지 않으므로 상자만큼 쓸모가 없는게 없다. 필자는 모든도전과제를 마치면서 2개의 선반을 제외하고는 아이템은 전부 땅바닥에 던져놓았다.

그래서 2는 언제 나오냐. 꿀잼인정. 2에서는 돼지가 삭제된다고 한다. 고기의 대량생산을 위해서 돼지가 희생되는 것을 보고싶지 않으니 멧돼지나 열심히 잡으라는 개발자의 조언과 함께 삭제.",1587171348,1587172773,True,22,1,0.754577994346618652,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Bu ada da kendimize ait bir yaşam alanı yaratmaya başlıyoruz yavaş yavaş, önce kamp ateşi ondan sonra silah, zırh, dayanıklılık ve can iyileştirmeleri için tarla mantığı vs. Oyun size bu ada'da neler yapabileceğinizi görevler şeklinde öğreterek ilerletiyor, kendinizi savunmanızla ilgili, farklı buildlerle neler yapabileceklerinizle ilgili öğreterek ilerletiyor. Çok chill bir oyun, oyunun içerisinde her hangi bir optimizasyon sıkıntısı veya bug vs yok, gayet akıcı oynanıyor. 

Artıları ve Eksileri şeklinde değerlendirecek olursak;
+ Ses efektleri baya iyi, o ormanın dokusunu hissettiriyor size, kuş sesleriyle, rüzgar sesleriyle vs. bu yanı güzel. Yağmur yağdığında yağmur sesi veyahut gök gürlemesi sesleride bir hayli gerçekçi.

+ Oyunda farklı mevsimlerde var sanırım, ben yaz ayını görebildim henüz ama oyunda geceleri bir anda yağmur bastırıp yağmurlu bir sonbahar havasıymış esintisi veriyor. Oyunun Steam resimlerine baktığımda kış mevsimininde olduğunu görüyorum ki karakter penceresinde de karakterin sıcaklığı ve stabil olabilmesi için ortalama sıcaklık belirtilmiş. Bu ortalamayı kıyafetlerle sağlıyorsunuz zaten. Farklı mevsim döngülerinin olması güzel, çeşitlilik katıyor oyuna.

+ Oyunda bir çok hayvan mevcut, bu hayvanları ağ ile yakalayıp evcilleştirebiliyorsunuz. İnek, domuz, koyun, keçi, tavuk, horoz bunlar benim gördüğüm evcilleştirilebilir hayvanlar. Evcilleştirilebilir hayvanların olması güzel.

Size ada ortamını ve yerel yaşam hissiyatını güzel hissettiriyor, ekmek yapabilmek için una, un yapabilmek için buğdaya buğday için tarıma ihtiyacınız var mesela, ben ekmek istiyorum deyip ekmek yapamıyorsunuz gerçek hayatta nasıl işliyorsa öyle işliyor. Ada da bir yaşam kurmanın haricinde kendinizi de savunmanız gerekiyor, etrafta zombi vari orklar, vahşi ayılar, domuzlar ve tilkiler var bunlara karşı korunmanız gerekiyor. Ufak tefekte olsa bu zombi vari orkların gruplanıpta sizin buildlerinize saldırabildiğini gördüm. Esas yerleşkeye düzenli saldırılar yapıyorlarmı göremedim henüz, varsa keyifli hale getirir oyunu.

- Oyunun grafiği tatlı duruyor, ama oyunun fog'u ada manzarasını görmemizi engelliyor, fogu kapatıp manzarayı görebilmenin bir ihtimali yok baktığım kadarıyla. Manzara hissiyatını daha bir güzel aktarabilseymiş bize güzel olurmuş. Şahsen ben tavada et pişerken dönüp o manzaraya bakabilmeyi çok isterdim, ama yok.

- Emin olmamakla birlikte denizler arası açılma gibi bir genişlik sunmuyor oyun bize. Oyun sahilinde uyandığımız ada'dan ibaretmiş izlenimini veriyor, gördüğüm kadarıyla da öyle. Bütün adayı keşfedip, kendimize köy gibi bir yerleşke kurduktan sonra oyunda yapıcak bir şey kalmaz diye düşünüyorum. 

*Buradan yapımcı kişi veya kişilere sesleniyorum, denizler arası seyahat, farklı adalara gidebilme gibi çeşitlilikler eklerseniz oyun daha bir keyifli hale gelebilir. Fog kaldırılabilirse bu da ayrı bir hava katar.

? Oyundaki tüm yaratıkları görmediğim için buna eksi demek istemiyorum. Yaratıklarla savaş kısmıda çok basit, orkları ya da diğer vahşi hayvanları öldürmek zor olmuyor, oyunun başında yaptığınız gürzle bile. Ki oyunun ilerlemesiyle zehirli ve ateşli farklı materyallerden yapılabilen oklar ve yaylar var, onlar çok daha kolaylaştırır bu işi diye düşünüyorum, haliyle basitleşir iyice.

Oyun bana kalırsa 15,50 TL ikende alınabilir eğer gerçekten survival oyunları ve ada konseptini seviyorsanız, şuan 1,55 TL fiyata sahip bence bu fiyata güzel bir oynanış sunuyor, alın bir deneyin derim. 1,5 TL verip size en azından bi 15-20 saat gameplay sunan başka bir oyun yoktur diye düşünüyorum, varsa da çok azdır.",1587050382,1587050382,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Leveling is tied to quests not xp, but you can easily be blocked from completing a quest because you lack a crafting recipe that is locked to a level achievement.

Your character walks at a much slower pace than everything else in the game, which often runs from you once they're at low life. You spend the game chasing creatures you can't catch only to be ambushed my hordes of creatures you can't escape. Even after completing the quests needed to level up, you still require yet more resources to level up, sending you back out into a land filled with creatures you can't catch and hordes of monsters you can neither kill nor escape.

Imagine Stardew Valley, but in a hard core way LOL. Sure there are lots of gathering and takes time alot, but its rewarding after you figure it out how to play this game effectively.
The battle  system is fantastic. One must think at first that the movement is clunky and laggy. But once you mastered it, it will give you more and more adrenaline rush LOL.
I would recommend to play the quest chapter first and finish it. I must admit, first it was very frustrating to finish the chapter one by one, but actually it's the way of the developer to train players how to master this game in the creative mode later  hahaha no i'm serious !

Предметы никак не подсвечиваются, кнопки автоматического сбора урожая не работают, на предмет тыкать бестолку, тыкать надо на его название, которое видно только в режиме инвентаря, в котором мало того что половина экрана инвентарём закрыта, но и персонаж бегает только в одном положении. повернуть его нельзя ( в ролике видно )
https://youtu.be/bgTlC4RnNDM

Инвентарь забивается быстро, рецепты крафта и строительства открываются с уровнями, получить которые можно только выполнив соответствующие задания и накопив соответствующие предметы, что бы расплатиться за повышение. Выброшенный предмет в отличии от той же ""совместной неголодайки"" не лежит на земле, дожидаясь своей участи. а пропадает, что крайне неприятно.

Не понятно что делать что бы добыть тот или иной предмет. В обучении этого ничего нет. В энциклопедии тоже. Кто может догадаться, что что бы получить ветку надо дерево не топором рубить, а ногой пинать? А что бы получить пальмовые листья надо не пальму пинать, а куст рубить...

Немного мутная система производства. Можно было сделать всё куда проще чем с каждым предметом лезть то в одно то в другое место. К тому же срок изготовления предметов... К чему он здесь?  Какой смысл в том что бы ждать несколько минут, когда изготовится что-то там?

-Прохождение с другом длится 2 часа(каждый день).

Je l'ai pris à 79cts car en promo, mais même à ce prix là je regrette.

Ayant vu les images du jeu, je ne m'attendais pas à quelque chose d'extraordinaire, mais j'ai joué à beaucoup de jeux gratuits et j'arrive toujours à y trouver du fun même s'ils ne sont pas 100% opti, graphiquement moyens, avec des gameplays simplistes...
Mais Force of Nature je n'ai pas pu aller plus loin que 3/4h environ tant j'ai trouvé le jeu impraticable !
Rien ne va en ce qui concerne l'interface et les contrôles, voilà une partie des défauts que j'ai pu noter :
- Il y a au total 4 touches pour utiliser/interagir. Même si la plupart des jeux peuvent se contenter d'une touche pour les 2, en avoir simplement 2 aurait été plus simple. Ici on a 1 touche pour interagir, 1 touche pour utiliser, 1 touche pour récolter, et 1 touche pour ramasser (alors que récolter et ramasser sont strictement la même chose au bout du compte). Et comme dans ce jeu on passe beaucoup de temps à farmer, et bien on doit avoir les doigts en permanence sur ces 4 touches à la fois, en plus des touches habituelles de déplacement.
- Je n'en suis pas arrivée au stade d'avoir des structures avancées, mais rien que pour utiliser le feu, il faut appuyer sur espace et ensuite cliquer sur ""feu de camp"" alors qu'on pourrait y accéder d'une simple touche
- Les niveaux sont passés... manuellement ! C'est bien la première fois que je vois ça, et je dois dire que je n'en saisis pas du tout l'intérêt.
- Je n'ai pas trouvé comment se nourrir directement depuis l'inventaire, je ne crois même pas que ce soit possible, on est donc obligés de placer les aliments dans la barre d'accès rapide, manger puis les ranger dans l'inventaire...
- Dès qu'un menu est ouvert, on ne peut plus orienter la caméra, donc on ne peut plus se déplacer correctement tout en ayant les quêtes ou l'inventaire d'ouverts sur les côtés (mais bon ça c'est un des moindres défauts).

En gros, tout plein de petits défauts qui, mis les uns à côté des autres, rendent le jeu très pénible à jouer.

Lo que menos me gusta es la distancia de visión, es muy corta porque a pocos metros todo lo que se ve es niebla (a poca distancia del personaje) lo que no te permite ver muy lejos lo que hay.
El comportamiento de la IA en los enemigos (especialmente en animales agresivos) tampoco me ha gustado, mucho menos que el punto anterior. Es decir, atacas a los animales porque normalmente se acercan ellos a atacar agresivamente, y casi cuando les has quitado toda la barra de vida, se largan. Y no un poco y luego vuelven a seguir atacándote, NO. Se largan todo lo que el mapa les permite si no tienen obstáculos de por medio, y cuando vuelves a por él ves que se le ha regenerado toda la salud pero a ti te ha quitado bastante barra de vida sin servir para nada porque no has podido derrotarlo y lootearlo. Vamos que ese algoritmo que tienen en el comportamiento cabrea bastante cuando ya casi están muertos.

比較的動作は軽いのは好印象だったが、クラフトの自由度が低く、おすすめはしない。

さらに、その素材集めでも、設置物の建築数に上限があり、「素材はあるのに作業台が一台しか作れないから作業が進まない！」とイライラさせられた。

戦闘面でも自由度は低い。武器は種類が少なく、必殺技やスキル存在しないので、取れる戦術の選択肢が制限される。とにかく回復しつつ殴るくらいしか手段がない。
一定量のダメージを与えられると逃げる敵が出て来たが、止めを刺すのが難しい。逃げる敵に射撃武器を使ってみたが、威力が低い上に当たらない。もっと威力のあるの武器が欲しいがレベルが上がらないと解放されない。レベルを上げるには逃げる敵が落とすアイテムが必要だったので、急に気持ちが冷めた。

[h1] 토끼가 커여운 저렴이 생존겜 [/h1]
[strike]토끼 없으면 스크린샷 찍기 허전해서 토끼 가두는 맛에 함[/strike]

[b]0. 게임 개요 및 총평[/b]
보통 50%까지 세일이 진행되며, 멀티플레이어를 지원합니다.
""2020년 4월 7일에 90%까지 세일되는 기이한 모습을 보았습니다. ""
(최근에는 90% 세일이 자주 진행되는 것 같습니다.)

ARK 같은 느낌의 건축물이 많은, [u]노가다성[/u] 크래프팅 생존 게임입니다.
국내보다는 해외에 매니악한 유저들이 많습니다.

개인적으로는 플레이타임이 15시간 이상 뽑혀서 가성비 있다고 생각하며,
자잘자잘한 개선사항들이 보여도 가격값하다보니 무난하게 플레이했습니다.
조금 더 고퀄리티 멀티게임을 원한다면 다른 생존겜을 권합니다.


[b]1. 게임 설정 필수 요소 [/b][list]
[*] 매우 기초적인 캐릭터 커마 가능 [strike](근데 남캐밖에 없음)[/strike]
[*] 일반 설정에서 '최소화 될 때 게임 일시 중지 / 마우스 커서를 항상 중앙에 두기' OFF 권장
(Alt + Tab 을 눌러서 다른 활동을 같이 하다가 본 게임에 들어오면 겜이 멈춘거 같음.)
([strike]물론 멈춘 적은 없음.[/strike])
[*] 게임 켜자마자 마우스 들어가셔서 감도 조절 필수
[*] 생각보다 음악, 주변 환경 소리가 큰 편이므로 조절 필요.
( 본인은 음악 음량 0 / 게임 음량 15 / 가축과 건물 0 으로 설정했음 )
[/list]

[b]2. 만족요인 [/b][list]
[*] 50% 세일하면 4250원인데 생존겜이라 플레이타임이 짧지 않음.
[*] 일정 간격마다 자동 저장을 지원함.
[*] 건축물의 디자인이 투박해서 진짜 무인도 표류한 느낌.
[*] 허기를 관리할 필요 없이 [u]체력과 지구력(스테미나)만 관리하면 되어[/u] 난이도는 몹시 쉬움.
[*] 고블린이 건축물을 부수긴 하지만, 베이스 깊숙히까진 안들어온다.
[*] 밤눈이 어둡지는 않아서, 겁이 많으신 분들도 나름 무난히 할 수 있다.
[*] 수확하기(Alt) + 획득하기/줍기(Ctrl) 을 통해 파밍 자체는 상당히 편하게 할 수 있다.
[*] 8개의 퀵슬롯을 통해 상당히 빠르게 도구를 전환하거나, 포션을 먹을 수 있다.
[*] 레벨업하면 기본 방어도, 체젠 및 지구력젠 등의 스탯이 증가함
[*] 지도(M)에 적의 위치도 같이 표시된다.
[*] 텔레포트를 할 수 있는 '워프'라는 건축물이 있음.
[/list]

[b]3. 불만족요인 [/b]
몇몇 한계점이 눈에 보인다.
완성도가 극도로 낮은건 아닌데, 학생이 졸업 프로젝트로 만든 듯한 느낌 정도?..
[list]
[*] 도구를 사용하는 모션이 너무 투박하고 둔함.
[*] 레벨을 올려야만 건축물 레시피를 배우거나, 건축물의 최대 한도가 풀린다.
[*] 레벨링 조건이 레벨 7부터는 조금 많이 까다로워진다. 
[*] 레벨링을 위해선 무조건 퀘스트(Q)를 깨야한다. (I) -> 특성 에서 레벨업 가능. 
[*] 휴대용 등불을 설치하고 다니면서 어둠을 밝힐 수 있으나, 범위가 좁다.
(여담으로 나무 아래에는 가급적 필수적으로 설치하는 것을 권한다. 적이 안보임)
[*] 지도(M)의 퀄리티가 좋지는 않다. 집 방향만 참고하는 정도.
[*] 조작을 익히는 것이 생각보다 익숙하지 않을 수 있다. 
조작 방식의 다양성을 추구하지 않지만, 생각보다 보조해주는 단축키(가령 E버튼)가 있음.
[*] 나무, 수풀 등 구조물을 관통하지 못한다는 제약 사항이 있음.
[*] 특정 건축물은 무조건 집 안에 지어야 한다는 단점이 있음.
[*] [strike]멀티 하고 싶은데 똥겜같다고 같이 안해줌[/strike]
[/list]

[b]4. 게임 플레이 팁 [/b][list]
[*] Space 버튼을 누르면 아이템 명칭이 다 보입니다. 
특히, 건축물에서 제작시 무조건 Space 이후 해당 이름을 클릭해서 제작을 진행해주세요.
[*] 원거리 무기가 별로 좋지 않음. 무빙회피도 힘들어서 맞딜 권장합니다.
[*] 함정을 던져서 테이밍할때 [u]여러번 적중시켜야[/u] 테이밍이 됩니다.
[*] 음식을 먹을 땐 씹는 것보다는 마시는 종류가 대체로 쿨타임이 짧음.
[*] 게임을 재실행하거나, 침대에서 자고 일어나면 몬스터 리젠됨. [strike](횃불 깨짐 주의)[/strike]
[*] 레벨업 이후 뭘 배울 수 있는지 알고 싶으면 인벤토리(I) -> 백과사전 탭 이용하시면 됩니다.

[spoiler] <잔잔한 꿀팁들> 
- 무기 및 도구를 퀵슬롯에 두고 단축키를 이용해서 후딜레이를 제거할 수 있다. 
(특히 전투시 무기 후딜레이 캔슬, 곡괭이/삽(뒤지개)질에서 속도가 매우 빠름)
 - 전투 = 방어구 + 물약빨. 무기 후딜레이 캔슬이 익숙해진다면 피해량이 거의 30%는 감소.
 - 게임 '저장 후 종료' 를 누르고 다시 서버를 들어가면 무조건 스폰 장소에 도달함.
 - 커피 원두 농사 및 커피 제작을 배우기 시작하면, 지구력의 한계가 거의 사라짐.(Lv 5)
 - 생존겜 고인물들은 다 아는 상식같은건데, 템 바닥에 떨궈도 안 털림. 상자 불필요함[/spoiler]

'' diye haykıran oyunları incelemeyi seviyorum çünkü oynadığım zaman keyif aldığım da hakkını ödemem için bir şeyler yapmam gerekli gibi düşünüyorum, borcumu da anca birkaç satır düşerek  ödeyebiliyorum. Buna mecbur hissediyorum çünkü bunu hak ediyor  fazlasıyla kendisi.Peki,  nedir bu bana inceleme yazmam için vicdan yaptıran, isminin hakkını doya doya yansıtan oyunumuz Force of Nature ? 

Öncelikle Oyunumuz; hayatta kalma tarzı üzerine kurulu bir oyun. Oyun da çok sayı da loot ve craft yapmaya imkan tanıyan bir işleyiş söz konusu. Hem keşif yaparak göçebe bir düzen hem de yerleşik hayatla kendi yapılarınızı, yakalayıp evcilleştirdiğimiz hayvanlarımızı beslediğimiz bir düzen var. Oyunda ki en büyük güzellik ve oynanışa doğrudan etki yapmış özellik ise; iklimlerin olması yani  her bölgenin farklı bir iklim yapısı var; eğer çöle giderseniz çöl kıyafeti, eğer soğuk bir yere giderseniz kışlık kıyafet yapmak durumdasınız bunu da yakaladığınız hayvanlardan ve gezdiğimiz yerlerdeki canavarlardan elde ettiğimiz malzemeler ile sağlıyoruz. Bu durum da oyuna sürekli bir ilerleyiş ve keşif yapmak için amaç sağlıyor. Oyun bu bağlam da durağan bir oyun değil ama söylemem gerekir ki tek başına oynamak biraz uzun ve yorucu sürebilir çünkü asıl anlamda bu dünyanın içine belli bir level aldıktan sonra girmiş bulunuyoruz. Bu durumdan keyif alacak kişiler de olabilir ama tavsiyem bir arkadaşınız ile birlikte oynamanız. 

Eğer ''Lan'' üzerinden oynayabileceğiniz eşiniz,dostunuz var ise fıstık gibi bir serüvene dalış yapmış olursunuz. Bu arada maksimum iki kişi oynayabiliyoruz ve belli bir mesafe birbirimizden uzaklaşamıyoruz yani sen git keşfe ben evdeki inekleri, koyunları besleyeyim pek mümkün değil , yani oyunun bize;  anca beraber kanca beraber diye bir dayatma sunduğu doğrudur, bu biraz üzücü ama verdiği keyifle bunu tamamen artı bir özelliğe dönüştürebiliyor. Eğer,  bahsettiğim gibi bir oynanış istiyorsanız ve bunu yapabilecek bir durum mevcut ise mutlaka şans tanınması gereken bir oyun kendisi buradan sevgilerimi sunuyorum.

Not: Benim oynadığım zamanlar da, oyuna ilk başladığınız da denizin kıyısına yakın bir yerde parlayan bir taş parçası bulmanız gerek, onu almazsanız ileri seviyede biraz sıkıntıya giriyor ilerleyiş , bulmak için giriş kısmını izleyebilirsiniz. Oyun, sürekli güncelleme aldığı için değişmiş olabilir ama hala aynı ise aklınız da bulunsun diye bunu da buraya düşmüş olayım, iyi oyunlar!

This is basically the spiritual successor to an old shareware game called Stranded II (NOT the borefest one on Steam).  It was made by a Dutch(?) college kid, and it was raw and cheesy, but boy was it addictive.  This game has taken what Stranded II did, expanded on the crafting and combat system, and made a new world for it.  My favorite part of Force of Nature is the camp-building.  The only place you can't get attacked is the area around where you start, so that's where you set up.  As you progress, you can get new buildings, and new crafting stations, until, like in Minecraft, you have workstations and corrals and farm plots all around, and you run around constructing the things that will make you strong enough to kill the next level of enemies.  I consider the crafting to be relatively deep, but there is a tremendous amount of grinding:  weapons need metal, metal needs coal, coal needs wood and embers, embers need sticks.  You can see how long things take, but I see it as the relaxing part of the game.
Now the bad stuff.
The annoying top-down camera.  It's uncomfortable, but I'm now used to it.  Also, combat is not real exciting, and it's frustrating to get swarmed after making a dumb mistake.  But once you learn what you're up against, you can really plan for all situations.  That takes more grinding, though.  And the ending is beyond bad, it's almost a kick in the keyster.  None of this stuff bothers me enough to quit.  I feel like progressing is fun enough.
So if you can stick with it, I think you'll see this is a better-than-average survival game.",1578935290,1578935290,True,8,0,0.584753215312957764,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Пройти весь путь от палки-копалки и каменного ножа до золотой брони и алхимического стола? Легко!*
*почти.

Сам остров представляет из себя своего рода затерянный мир - всё давно заросло, причём настолько, что не осталось никаких следов цивилизации, кроме нежити и монет в их карманах. Путь в большинство мест приходится прорубать себе... в лучшем случае топором. Иногда киркой. Гоблины разной степени разложения, и более-менее живые тоже... каменные големы, убивающие при первой встрече с пары ударов - присутствуют.

Первая РПГ, в которой я встретил такое понятие как ""температура окружающей среды"" - правда, малюсенькая недоработка: в полном ""тёплом"" комплекте первого уровня герой спокойно выживает при температуре в +3 градуса (при той же температуре хорошо колосятся папортники и тропические растения. Как?!), но также в этой броне ему комфортно и в +30, будто он вообще голый!

Звери (а иногда и гоблины) обладают инстинктом самосохранения - и если их ждёт последний один-два удара, они могут сбежать от агрессивной несостоявшейся добычи... если их не нагонит стрела.

На острове огромное количество подсолнухов! Первое время восстановление энергии проходит в процессе лузгания семечек.

Небольшой совет для будущих игроков: если вам кажется, что какое-то сырьё бесполезно - лучше сделайте себе сарайчик, и скидывайте это всё туда! Например, из мяса можно приготовить не только стейк, но и пирог, на более позднем этапе.

That said, it has a decent base building mechanic to it, you can make your own little village, and if you beat the game you can try to kinda simcity it to make yourself a perfectly pleasant little homestead.

ゲームの操作性や進め方には少し古いDSのゲームみたいな癖が有るけど、慣れればあんまり気にならない！
マップロード範囲があるので二人以上でプレイする場合は一人で凄く離れて勝手に進める、と言ったことはできないみたいですが友達同士でプレイするならまぁ妥当かなとも思う。
マップロード範囲が変わる時にクラッシュはまぁまぁ有る･･･けどゲーム自体は信じらないくらいインストール速いし良いかぁと思えてしまう。
マルチは全員ロビーに揃ってからスタート、一人クラッシュで落ちてしまって戻ってきたいときや人が増える時はもう一度ロビーに集まってから開始という形になってしまいますが、人が居れば内部で放置できるのでそこまで苦にもなりません。
元はゲームエンジンを使用せず販売するつもりもなく一人で2011年から開発していた物と知り、なるほどだからかぁ～となる部分もありますが、友達とハマって徹夜したりしてますｗｗ

그러나 '특정 지역에서의 특정한 재료&특정한 장비' 라는 개념을 반복하며, 몬스터의 패턴 또한 정형화 되어 있다.

It's more of an RPG game, rather then yet another zombie survival game, thank God.

~Michael Scott (The Office)[/h1]

Seriously, though, I really wonder just how much of such games do we need. I mean, come on! It's like every second wannabe indie developer tries to make these. The open world sandbox survival games with nothing but grinding and crafting in them. You know the drill. You waste countless hours on cutting trees and collecting crap to craft some new crap and use it to collect even more crap. Repeat until you'll get just enough crap to begin feeling miserable and start rethinking your life choices. Guess what, guys? Here comes another one of those! Because we freakin' needed it in our lives! Just in case if you've got tired watching your poor looking character cutting trees in some other games, you can switch to this one! Why should you choose this one over tons of other games? Well, it's slower than some others (just because after watching your character cutting trees, you'll need to watch the crafting meter to [i]slo-o-owly[/i] move from one part of the screen to another, which is literally as fun as watching the paint dry), it looks especially bad (remember the very first [b]SIMS[/b]? That's the stuff we have here, guys, a very cute visuals... from a freakin' year [b]2000[/b]), you can tame cows (Ah, [b]Chauncey[/b]?! [i]How are you feeling today?[/i]) and then [i]eat mor chikin[/i]. God have mercy...

To give the developers some justice, though, I should mention the fact that, unlike many others, this game actually has a proper goal. That's right, folks! You can actually beat [b]Force of Nature[/b]! To do that, you'll need to collect some shards (of course, you'll need to do tons of slow, boring and unskippable crafting first, because developers hate you that much) and craft them into one epic shard of nature. Because, you know... the nature... it's cool... and stuff... But [i]anyway[/i], it's nice to have a goal. It really is. The problem is... well... guess what you'll get in the end of the game? No, not a cute little cutscene with our hero (who's always male, since you can't even choose the gender here) leaving the island with a beautiful lady (or man, I'm not here to judge). And no, not a long and mind-blowing text about all that being an illusion created by his broken mind after he discovered the fact that the Earth is actually flat and the entire space thing was a KGB conspiracy. Nothing like that, no. What you'll get in the end is a “congratulations” message. Congratu... freakin'... lations... After wasting hours and hours on cutting the freakin' trees and staring at your pet cow's ugly butt. F***k me and my whole pathetic life, this is some seriously depressive s***t we have here...

Anyway, sorry for the language in this angry little review, but honestly, guys, enough is enough. You see “survival, open world, crafting” in game's user tags, be careful. Be very, very careful. You see those tags with something that looks like [b]Force of Nature[/b]? With only a few enemy types and no variety whatsoever? You run for your freakin' life. As long as you are not the Time Lord and you don't have some extra lives to waste on all sorts of nonsense while eating fish fingers and custard. There are so many awesome things in this world... and yet, some a-holes want us to waste our lives on watching the crafting meter... Screw that. Now, excuse me, I've just suffered through a lot of stress and therefore need a drink. Or two. Or ten...",1571972994,1572724176,False,15,9,0.573421478271484375,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Embora a jogabilidade seja meio travada, ainda sim da para ter uma gameplay divertida.

Mas alguns pontos no jogo, não me agradaram.
-O solo não se deforma, se houvesse uma leve deformidade no solo, seria muito bom, daria um ar de realidade bem bacana. Se contar que, abriria espaço para os jogadores fazerem construções mais criativas.
-O jogo é meio cansativo. Pelo fato de que, para passar de nível, você é FORÇADO a completar tarefas e missões, ao invés de trabalhar duro para coletar XP. 
-Alguns itens exigem muitos materiais, alguns exigem quantidade absurdas, para serem fabricados.
-Alguns itens demoram demasiadamente para ficarem prontos.
-Os inimigos(mobs) não tem ""vida"", seguem apenas um caminho automático(como se para mostrar que eles tem animação) e sobem de nível no mesmo ambiente/cenário, algo sem explicação. E eles só te perseguem por uma curta distância.

Enfim, por achar o jogo cansativo, acabei não jogando/explorando mais.

It's very much a chill survivor-type game (at least in the beginning). I'm a casual gamer, so I don't particularly like having to fight my way through hordes of zombies; this game felt like the right amount of challenge between how easy it was to get the hang of it and the slight challenge of finding crafting materials and exploring the island. It even has a place where you can get hints if you can't find a material.

I had to completely redo the key controls. If renaming controls wasn't an option I would have returned this game. I can generally get the hang of most default key controls, but this one was so awkward to use.

The inventory/crafting boxes are clunky. Some buttons have shortcuts and some don't have the option. Equipping tools or weapons is weird, I spent a good chunk of in-game time just equipping stuff using the mouse. I don't mind the time sink since I only play for the crafting and the farming, but I can see how it would be frustrating to try and switch weapons quickly while fighting goblins or whatever.

I like that I can interact with nearly every single thing in the environment. It was a nice surprise when I accidentally kicked some reeds (what I thought were just world decoration) and some materials fell on the ground! I'm very impressed with the level of interaction in this game.

I like that my character doesn't die from exposure and that he doesn't need rest every night. It detracts from the 'realistic' experience, but I'm a very casual gamer so I like when I don't have to worry about my character running out of time before I get to craft something.

I wish there was an option to change the gender of the character. I'm a woman, and I like playing female characters in games; it adds to the immersion. Even if you were just to put a ponytail on the character I would be fine! It takes away from the immersion (for me) for my character to be male.

Very cool concept, great gameplay, clunky (almost frustrating) controls and menus.

The vegetation especially and its layout on the ground is very well designed and colorful, forming mysterious scenarios that call for exploration.
Mining, cooking, cooking, everything the supposed castaway has to produce to survive is terribly slow and costs a lot of real time. This is not good for a game to have, worse for the player. It is as if in the story of a movie, the character enters the bath; So whoever watches the movie would be waiting for the bath scene in real time, embittering the wait, until the character comes out, dries up, gets dressed for the story to continue ... so taking about 30 minutes of real time. Absurd a Gamedesigner to use real time as COST of manufacture or currency within the playing time. This is because it seems to provide some likelihood to the game. Slutty stealing your clients time isn't it?
It turns out that some Gamedesigners, seem to think that attaching the player to the product created, need to produce a mental micromanagement addiction. I do not agree with this as it harms young people in the matter of time spent on games. Spoils the fun.
However, I tried out of curiosity to play this ""force of nature"" all the way down to see what was going on. But I could not. I repeat, It was absurd to take real time to do everything I said and beyond, pick up the ingredients, cultivate or explore to get them.

The game has no plot. It is in the mystery. So far so good. The player may assume that they have sunk and arrived on the island.
I think the developers, and I'm writing this for others to really see and change their minds - were very shrewd and unfaithful to their clients. Have you forgotten where your money comes from? Rolling up the player takes a while to get to the end of the game and then you see that the game didn't have fun or teach anything. Just stole the time and some money. Very disappointing that.
Today I accidentally clicked on his link in my Steam library. I played for over a year. Steam reinstalled and restarted from scratch. Then I remembered how long this game was when I stopped playing. And uninstalled again.
I will speak in all sincerity, and look, I like games. Should games be accepted are super built around micromanagement? They do this to stick to your brain. Example: Real Time Demand for making and progressing items or characters; Interfaces whose actions require more than 3 steps (I've seen 5 to 10+) will gnaw the keyboard / mouse behind another increasingly subcategorized option. Not to say that I am exaggerating. Take the test ... Doesn't it addict your brain and you stand there unknowingly counting and sorting and checking ""little pebbles""? It's like knitting without producing the clothes. Instead of having fun it will frustrate you to the extreme, with a foolish face (that was polite ..) because you paid for it.
I don't want to hurt developers just by showing that we watch what you do and show what we don't like. Improve it, change this way of making your products enjoyable. Don't hurt your customers' time. Thanks.

Jogadores que gostam de exploração, talvez achem como eu, o jogo bonito, no geral. A vegetação especialmente e sua disposição no terreno é muito bem desenhada e colorida, formando cenários misteriosos que chamam à exploração. 
A mineração, confecção, cozimento, tudo que o suposto náufrago precisa produzir para sobreviver é terrívelmente lento e custa muito tempo real. Isso não é nada bom para um jogo ter, pior para o jogador. É como se na estória de um filme, o personagem entrasse no banho; Então, quem assiste o filme ficasse esperando a cena do banho em tempo real, amargando a espera, até o personagem sair, secar-se, vestir-se para a estória continuar... tomando assim uns 30 minutos do tempo real. Absurdo um Gamedesigner usar  o tempo real como CUSTO de fabricação ou moeda dentro do tempo de jogo. Isso por achar que fornece alguma verosimilhança ao jogo. Sacanagem roubar o tempo do seus clientes não é?
Acontece que alguns Gamedesigners, parecem achar que prender a o jogador no produto criado, precisam produzir um vício mental de microgerenciamento. Não concordo com isto, pois prejudica os jovens na questão do tempo gasto com jogos. Estraga a diversão.
Contudo, tentei por curiosidade, jogar este ""força da natureza"" até o fim para ver no que dava. Mas não consegui. Repito, Era absurdo demorar tempo real para fazer tudo que já disse e além, pegar os ingredientes, cultivar ou explorar para obtê-los.

O jogo não tem enredo. Fica no mistério. Até aí, tudo bem. O player pode assumir que naufragou e chegou na ilha.
Acho que os desenvolvedores, e estou escrevendo isso para que outros veja mesmo e mudem de mente - foram muito astutos e infieis com seus clientes. Será que esqueceram de onde vem seu dinheiro? Enrolar o player demorar chegar ao fim do jogo e então verem que o jogo não divertiu, nem ensinou nada. Só roubou o tempo e algum dinheiro. Muito decepcionante isso.
Hoje, acidentalmente, cliquei no link dele que está na minha biblioteca Steam. Joguei à mais de um ano. O Steam reinstalou e recomeçou do zero. Então me lembrei de quão ladrão de tempo este jogo foi quando parei de jogar. E desinstalei novamente.
Vou falar com toda sinceridade e olha que gosto de jogos. Será que se deve aceitar jogos são super construídos em torno de microgerenciamento? Fazem isto para colar no seu cérebro. p.exemplo: Demanda de Tempo real para confecção e progresso de itens ou personagens; interfaces cujas ações exigem a realização de mais de 3 passos (já vi 5 à 10+) farão roer o teclado/mouse atrás de outra opção cada vez mais sub-categorizada. Para não dizer que é estou exagerando. Faça o teste... Será que não vicia seu cérebro e você fica ali, sem perceber, contando, ordenando e  conferindo ""pequenas pedrinhas"". É como fazer tricô sem produzir a roupa. Ao invés de divertir vai te frustrar ao extremo, com cara de tolo (isso foi educado..) pois pagou por isso.
Não quero prejudicar os desenvolvedores só mostrar que observamos o que vocês fazem e mostramos o que não gostamos. Melhorem isso, mudem esta maneira de fazer seus produtos agradáveis. Não prejudique o tempo dos seus clientes. Obrigado.",1569196473,1569196906,False,2,0,0.490601241588592529,0,True,False,False,False,,,

セールで買いましたが結構長く遊ぶことが出来ましたのでオススメです。
このゲームは無人島に流れ着いた主人公が資材を集めながら生活圏を確保し、クエストを進めていくゲームです。

これから思いついた点に関して感じたことや不満点を書いていきます。

【クラフトに関して】
　作製出来るものはレベル依存で増えていきクエストをやってレベルを上げて行くので煩わしく思う所は有りますが、逆にそれが分かりやすい目標になっているので自由度が高すぎるゲームで何をしたら良いのか分からないって人には良いと思います。
最初から強いのを作って無双とかは出来ないので自由度やロマンは無いかもしれません。
　作製時間は長いものもありますが、作製している間はその場に居る必要がないので　　（誰が作ってるんだ・・・？？）
色々なものを同時に作ったり、作製時間中に狩りや資材集めをして時間を潰すと良い感じです。
途中、作製時間を短縮するアイテムも作れるようにもなります。


【戦闘に関して】
　最初は攻撃が遅く面倒でしたが、ショートカットキーを駆使し2本の剣をテンポよく使うと攻撃後の待ち時間が短縮されてかなり楽に戦うことが出来ました。
ですが戦闘は同格に対しては１対１が基本です。囲まれたら手数の多さで負けるので諦めるか安置に逃げ込んでください。
木を切ったり、環境を整えるとプレイヤーだけが入れて大きなモンスターが入れない安置が作れるのでヒットアンドアウェイを駆使すると何体いようが勝てます。これで敵の制圧がとても楽になります。
　ただ最後の方になっていくとドロップ品集めのために倒す敵が増えていくので大変でした。ゲームを再起動すれば敵は同じ場所に復活しますのでドロップ品集めをする際は近くの敵を倒して再起動すると時間短縮になります。

ちなみに序盤の敵は体力が減ると逃げ出す畜生なので逃げたら無視が一番です。（特に狐）
レベルが上がってそいつらをワンパンするのが一番爽快感ありましたｗ

【移動に関して】
　移動は最後までやって装備を揃えても対して早くないです。
ですが早い段階でポータルという瞬間移動装置を作れるようになるので長距離移動はそこまで不便には思いませんでした。
どちらかというと木々が多いので速度よりそれを切り開いていく方が大変でしたね。

【食事に関して】
　このゲームで一番大事なところです。
スタミナが無いと何もできないので常に食事を持っておきましょう。
中盤の方になるとポーションが作れるようになりますので食事の大変さからは開放されます。（キノコは貴重）

【環境に関して】
　バイオームが火山灰が降り積もる場所？（寒い）、砂漠、ジャングル、雪山、春？と存在し
寒い所ですと体力が徐々に減少し、熱い所ですと徐々にスタミナが減少します。
そのため序盤は寒さ対策の装備一式を要求されるので人によっては合わないかもしれません。
これも中盤からアミュレットが作れるようになるので緑のアミュレットを使えば特に気を使わなくて大丈夫になります。

【資材集め】
　大抵、この時間ですね。サバイバルゲーで資材集めは宿命みたいなものだと思います・・・.
特に序盤は装備が悪いので時間がかかります。必要分取って装備が良くなったら大量に集めると楽です。
一言いうなら鉱石集めるのが大変だった。
鉱石の重要度は鉄＞錫＞銅なので釘を作るなら銅で作るのが効率的です。（銅は敵から無限に取れます）

【不満に思ったこと】
敵を倒していくのですがドロップアイテムが少ないのが不満でした。
ドロップアイテムを集めて作る武器があっても良いんじゃないかな…
また敵はわりとファンタジー要素が強いのでこっちも魔法など使えたら面白くなると思いました。
遠距離武器が弓と終盤に取って付けたかのような爆弾だけなんですよね。
攻撃手段が増えれば戦闘も楽しくなりそうです。
敵モンスターを捕獲して仲間にできるのですがゴブリンだけしか出来ないのも思う所ありますね。
作業とか手伝ってくれるようになれば良いのに…

【総論】
それぞれに関して思ったことを書いたので良い所と悪い所が見えてくると思います。
悪い点を許容できそうなら充分遊べる内容があるゲームだと思いますのでやってみると良いですよ。
これからのアプデに期待です。",1568554749,1568554749,True,7,0,0.623762369155883789,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That said, this is an interesting rough-hewn gem that I would not have likely paid much attention to otherwise.

Force of Nature is a very simplistic basic survival game.  The mechanics are easy to pick up, the tutorials are packed in with the quests, and it is indeed somewhat addicting to play and work your way up.  However, I also would like to mention the fact that due to the developer being Russian, expect a few contextual English errors if you play this language.  Nothing unreadable, but certainly amusing if you enjoy that kind of thing.  The enemies are also somewhat monotonous and are used by the developer to pad the game out unnecessarily.  

Levels, which are how craftables are unlocked, are only gainable by doing the quests and spending some gold coins/ingots.  You will spend several hours beating goblins up for gold coins to make ingots with, and then refreshing the game, since the ingame monster refresher, the straw bed, does not work as advertised.  If you die, they will also come back.   If you die by the way, you also will outright lose some of your stuff with no chance to pick them back up.  Try not to die.  It hurts.

However, I do find myself enjoying this game rather more than disliking it.  If you keep in mind that this looks and seems to be programmed like a cheap but servicable Russian game, then you would be recommended to try this gem out.  For its full price of eight bucks?  Ehhhhh.... Ill let you figure that one out.  I personally would have skipped this one if I hadnt been given it, but I would probably recommend it on perhaps 4 or 5 bucks budget.

This game is very cool. It's rough around the edges, but it's still in development. Combat is simplistic and aiming arrows needs a LOT of work, but that's really the only criticisms. The quest line is great and walks you through most of what you need to do to advance the story. The tedium of gathering resources is not really tedium if you are a survival gamer. Need food? Put a heavy weight on a mouse button with enough worms and a fishing pole near the water and go do some chores. Come back and you have fish for days. Need 50 sand? same thing.  Farming for gold is the most tedious chore. I tried sleeping til morning for a mob reset, but to no avail. Restarting game works, though.

One suggestion to the dev, please let us build fences and gates. every reset I get animals attacked. It's annoying. If I could make a pen for them that would be helpful. Also a perimiter fence and a gate for my property would be handy, too. I definitely got my $0.78 worth out of this game!

[b] There is one major issue about the video resources this title used despite the small draw radius. The GPU usage is always at 100%. On my laptop with an old GT GPU where I've played games which require huge draw distances like Euro Truck Sim 2, ARMA 3 it never went till 100%. [/b]

1. The game is really slow paced. Crafting feels like you're downloading a 1 GB file with a 100 kb/s download speed. It's not actually that bad, but it feels that way sometimes. The same goes for cooking and trying to level up, it takes a while.

2. You don't have access to all the craft items from the start, you have to unlock them by leveling up.

3. You level up only by doing quests, which are mostly crafting items and some kill quests here and there. The requirements are usually ridiculous, crafting many things to craft into a bigger thing. You can imagine that takes forever.

For multiplayer:

1. Once the lobby is created and the game starts, no one else can join in until you restart the lobby. The max players that can join is 4.

2. Players must stay close together if they want to explore the map, an invisible wall will stop any player that goes too far from the rest. 

3. There are a lot of loading screens when exploring the map. These loading screens are not a problem on single player, but when it's multiplayer... it can take very long depending on the other player(s)'s download speed. And I mean, VERY long. And it's not a one-time only thing, it will keep happening on the same part of the map.

4. All achievements go to the host ONLY. There's a workaround which involves saving the file and backing up the world BEFORE getting the achievement, and then sharing it with your friend(s). 

That should be enough reason to not recommend this game, right? Well, not really, at least for me. It's actually a really enjoyable game for the price. And even better on sale. To me, it's all about the feeling of progression, and IMO, this game has that. While I don't really like how the quest requirements are, for the most part, completely absurd; it gives you a great incentive to keep playing. It's a good, cheap survival game with many faults, but if you can ignore these, you'll likely enjoy this.",1565585015,1566192757,True,14,2,0.684577584266662598,0,False,False,False,False,,,

私はマイクラなどの自由なゲームが好きですが、このクエスト方式は細かい達成感が得られるため別の良さがあると思います。

問題なのはクラフト部分が妙に面倒くさい。
施設を建ててアイテムを作成するのですが、その時間が妙に長い。そしてスタック上限が妙に少ない（井戸は水６個とか）為マメに回収する必要があります。
後半は井戸に張り付いて６個たまったら回収を延々と繰り返していました。後で自動化ができるようになるとかがあれば、この面倒くささも先に進めるモチベーションになったと思うんですが、自動化無いんですよね。

I recently reinstalled this game and now I'm stuck at lvl 6 waiting for 30 more coin peaces. I do remember having fences in the game, right now I have 6 or so animals just floating at the beach.  It seems they too want to drown in the ocean.

lets get to the grit of it
Pros 
- Its a slow pace game where you might not get epilepsy.
- The start of the game is like every start. beach surrounded by trees where you are in the bubble of safety.
- You learn how to dig with a stick. (it looks like a high moon dance.)
- And very minimal survival skills needed. (I wouldn't say I would trust my life with this game.)
- The index in the character inventory tells you where you need to find all the items.

Cons
- Sloppy camera angle, which would be good for a simcity kind of game.
- The amount of grinding you have to do to achieve the next lvl is overboard
- Advance items are only in the later part of the game. 
  - example;  to craft a bow you have to wait until lvl 5. I would expect it a lvl 3
- Enemy weapons are more advance then yours.
- You can't make a raft and float it for the ocean Screaming at you new found friend Wilson!
- There is only one gender 
- The map looks like mincraft and yellow soap. (good news is you can see how close you are to the nearest enemy.)

This part you  can do in two ways 1) Go back to kill monsters, and get random gems ( I don't  know how many percentages to get one chip), and 2) Plant hundreds of 6-color roses, make tubes by smelting sand to glass ingot and to glass tube, mix roses with the mill,  bring to Alchemist Desk to make chips, and  lastly combine 5 chip to one gem. These are no points to do all these processes.  If you are not prepared for this, just don't buy.

If you play in creative mode, there is no level cap on buildings or items. So its easy to skip 90% of the content without even getting to level 1. So basically you're stuck with impossibly hard (not challenging) or too easy to be fun.

Este juego salió de la greenlight en el 2016 y desearía que el creador trabajara mas en el, me agrada así como esta pero no estaría mal que agregara mas contenido. De momento el personaje solo puede ser masculino y no se puede personalizar mucho, solo puedes cambiarle el color de la piel, el de la ropa y el del cabello. La construcción no es tan libre como en otros juegos en los que haces tu casa cubo por cubo, pero aun así es agradable ver como se levanta sólita tu casa después de un tiempo ya que todo en force of nature se basa en el tiempo (todos los crafteos y construcciones que hagas tienen cierto tiempo predeterminado en terminar de construirse). No hay muchos estilos de combate, pero para mi es suficiente con espada, arco y molotovs (aun que hay gente que prefiere báculos y conjuros, dagas rápidas o escudos). El juego tiene varios biomas y para acceder a algunos necesitas cierto tipo de armadura o ropas ya que tienen distintas temperaturas, lamentablemente algunas de esas ropas no tiene mucha defensa y cualquier enemigo te parte en dos rápido. Estaría bien si agregara armaduras mejoradas (o alguna mesa para reforzarlas).

Force of nature es un juego de supervivencia y jugarlo con amigos es aun mas divertido (y te aceleraría y facilitaría mas las cosas  en caso de que seas alguien desesperado), es en un extenso mundo abierto con varios biomas, climas, enemigos diferentes pertenecientes a sus biomas (como puedes ver los vídeos), puedes domesticar animales como vacas, pollos, ovejas, etc y construir así tu granjita. También puedes tener tus campos de cultivos (aun que todo esto es realmente necesario si quieres sobrevivir, no es opcional...o si?...), al explorar encontraras distintas platas las cuales te soltaran algunas semillas que puedes usar para cultivarlas en tu terreno. Tiene algunas mesas de crafteo las cuales cada una tiene distinto propósito, esta la mesa para hacer armaduras, para cocinar, para pociones, etc. Como mencione anteriormente las cosas se basan en el tiempo y lo que me gusta es que puedes dejar tus cosas creandose mientras vas a por mas recursos, a cazar, matar enemigos o simplemente a explorar.

But now I made the move and got the game and I had not regret it. 


Everything as old as it's looks.. just fits perfectly in this game. It is a great survival experience and the ration of occupation due to working and getting something in reward from it, is very nice. -- I need to do something and after a short while I get something and it does not feel like grinding stupidly for hours. -- This is a very big plus for this kind of game!

The only thing that is a bit of a minor issue for me, that you cannot interact with 'E' e.g. Go to a Table and work on it. I need to Push 'I' or 'Space' and then 'click', and for me it would be very nice to just press 'E' and then get into the crafting Interface.. it is just one step less for interaction and would make the usability of things much smoother. But this is just my opinion :)

++++++++++++

If you like Survival and a good feeling than this game might be the right thing for you! 

PS* I like this game a lot! Thank you Dev! :)

I'd also add that the description is no better.

The controls are AWFUL.  The video shows someone moving around and mousing over items, but in the game I was playing, the mouse cursor isn't a thing.  The mouse is used purely for turning movment - ONLY when the HUD is off, mind you.  So here's how it works at the moment: do you want to look around?  You have to turn off the HUD.  Do you want to look at the HUD?  You have to sacrifice the ability to look around.  (Note: you can never look up.  Like, not even enough to see the tops of the trees you're chopping down.  Which is a really great way to make a game that is about being OUTDOORS feel super claustrophobic.) The HUD includes those labels showing up over items that show up that someone in the video gets by using a mouseover.  So your choices for gathering are: 1) run around with free movement but with no idea what you're looking at, or even what is and isn't an interactible item, spamming the left ctrl and alt keys in the hopes that you pick up anything and everything you might need, or 2) run around with the ability to spot what is and isn't an item, as well as which are items you need, but sacrifice the ability to turn around, or 3) a super annoying combo of turning the HUD on and off for a combo of 'best' of both worlds (the word 'best' is used veeeeeeery loosely).  I went looking in the controls sure there must be a way to customize this but no, the controls are very basic and you're stuck with it the way it is.

Now, about the description: in spite of the FIRST SENTENCE claiming this ""is a Sandbox game"" - it's NOT.  The leveling system is a tedious grind of nothing but fetch quests.  Except there's not even NPCs involved.  It's just you and a badly designed HUD telling you what you're going to do next if you want to play its game.  You can't even just go find and build stuff in your own order either, no, you have to follow the EXACT path the game has set for you if you want to level, and by leveling, get access to building anything other than the things it has decided you are allowed to build right now.  If you think ""well I'll just take a break from leveling and explore"" - TOO BAD!  You're also boxed in by plants that are magically impassible despite the fact that they're just giant ferns and aloe-looking plants, which should be super simple to push through.  It's tedious to find the ingredients, per my paragraph above.  It's tedious to find the ingredients in another way, too: figuring out WHAT provides WHICH ingredient.  You just have to run around with a VERY limited stamina bar that is VERY slow to rebuild, even with eating, and smack things over and over and over looking for what you need. And the logic is... questionable.  An example besides the one about not being able to walk through bushes: since you can get the exact same palm leaves from either palm trees or banana trees despite their having different leaves, you'd THINK you could turn some of those huge logs into sticks with your axe, yeah?  HA HA HA.  Silly survivalist.  No, you can't.  Go find sticks.  If you've used up the few on the ground, have fun chopping down everything trying to figure out where they come from.  Oh what's that, every tree should drop sticks?  HA HA HA.  Silly survivalist.

Also, note that the video only shows one swing of the axe or pick?  The reason for that is that it's a very slow process.  As is just moving, which I'm guessing is why they keep speeding up the video to avoid people noticing (and hey, in their defense, it worked on me). They also show things being taken down in 1 chop.  At level 1-3, at least, it takes you 3 swings to take down a fern.  6+ for a tree, not including trunk.  More tedium.

Crafting is also brushed over - in the video they're just slapping stuff down and BANG! It's there.  In the game, it's on a timer system, so you either stand there and stare at a timer counting down, or go gather some more... I guess... nothing else to do...

This game has both bored and irritated me - the worst combination.  I've spent just under an hour getting to level 3.  My hand is sore from holding down the mouse key to kick, or punch, or chop, or whatever variation on the left mouse click I'm supposed to be doing for the most recent quest.

It is a good game and it is fun. It looks really good, camera angles are not bad overall. The game has some cool building and the exploration is really nice. I am liking the crafting and stuff. 

Now for the but, but the stamina drain is just awful. The stamina is a little to in your face for me.  The stamina seems to really slow your progression a lot, I don't have a problem that you have to deal with stamina I just feel it drains way to fast and it turns the game into a eating simulator.  Swing a pick or axe a few times and your out of stamina so you have to eat eat and eat and eat and eat, swing your tools a few more times and it's back to eat eat eat and eat. 

I leveled up enough to start crafting higher tier tools. You would think that better tools are going to make your life better. I was not feeling that, I seemed to be losing the same amount of stamina per swing with the better tools as the stone tools. So it didn't seem to help with stamina so you would think you could break rocks or chopper trees with less swings, which would use less stamina overall but it didn't. If it was making a difference it was so minor of a change that you don't feel like your progressing, which I started to get bored and I quit. I will most likely go back and play it some time in the future and if some mods came out for it I would definitely revisit the game.

So the game has some really cool stuff in it and some good mechanics, I just feel the stamina drags down the whole game. I feel it could use a serious tweak but that's just my opinion. Even something like a slider option so you could adjust how fast or slow your stamina drains would be cool.",1561856926,1561856926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So then when you want to go out exploring you have to take out all the things you don't want the possibility of losing if you die. Then when you get back from exploring and have all that sweet loot but still need to start crafting again, you guessed it you have to play musical chairs with your inventory and a chest or two to take out the stuff you don't need and add the stuff you do need.

- Graphisme:
 Le jeu est propre, les graphismes sont jolis, bien détaillés, rien à redire à ce sujet.

- Gameplay:
 Il y a un but dans ce jeu, en soit nous ne sommes pas largué sur une île sans aucun objectif autre que la survie.
Mais pour découvrir ce qui nous attend, il faut un peu joué dessus. 
Le jeu ne cesse de me surprendre. Je suis un adepte de l'apprentissage par moi même. A ce niveau, le jeu nous guide parfaitement, chaque étape nous conduit à différents crafts et nouvelles fonctionnalité qui me réjouie toujours plus. 
Cependant sachez que le jeu est chronophage (qu'il prend du temps) et que pour avancer un temps soit peu il faut être patient, même si globalement on peut tout faire rapidement si l'on est organiser.

- Difficulté: 
Je suis mort plusieurs fois, la faune est hostile, alors prudence, surtout si vous avez un peu de loot ""précieux"", vous risquez des pertes.
La nécessité de manger n'est pas importante, en tout cas à l'heure actuelle.

Je n'ai pour l'heure rencontré aucun problème, ni crash, ni bug visuel. Ce jeu est une perle à acheter sans modération.

This game is incredibly painful to play and I wish I had never been lured into it. It looks like an absolutely wonderful game on the surface and it's arguably decent in-game at times as well, but when it comes to progressing in the game there's no excuse for how poorly executed it is. 

You first wake up on a beach and are prompted to go around collecting and harvesting your surroundings in order to level up your character. Note that your character can only level up upon completing certain tasks; there's no experience system and no way to level up your health or stamina other than by completing those tasks. This would be perfectly fine if the tasks they asked you to complete weren't as irritating and annoying as possible (and sometimes useless). One of the tasks has you capturing animals with a net, but the capture rate for these nets feels like 20% at best. In my experience, out of 15 nets thrown, 3 will ever capture the animal. Going further on the capture front, you are eventually granted the ability to catch goblins; however, these goblins are basically useless when it comes to combat and die within seconds of being attacked.

To be fair, I have never been able to capture level 20 goblins, only ever level 1-3 goblins; this brings me to my next point. If you want to explore an area that you're able to explore temperature-wise (there's a temperature system in the game that prevents you from exploring higher-level areas without the proper equipment) but if your level is lower than the enemies in the area, you are going to be annihilated. Some mobs will chase you to across the entire map to put axes to kneecaps, some mobs will hit you with a poison who's virulence would rival the most concentrated dose of potassium cyanide or hemlock, some mobs will stun lock you with their attacks and just melt your health away, some mobs have a melee attack with a radius to rival that of our planet, and some mobs just like to steal 2/3 of your health before running away from you at break-neck speeds once you get them close to death. With regards to the last mob, those are usually the creatures that you NEED to kill in order to get materials to progress in the game. Luckily for you though there's archery in the game so you could shoot an arrow into the mob before it runs away; however, the mobs have evidently acquired the ability to enter bullet-time and weave through your arrows like Gru weaves through missiles. 

So to recap, we have enemies that either destroy you within seconds of meeting them or run away from you after bringing you close to death, we have a progression system that is locked until you can complete whatever arbitrary tasks the game has set for you, we have a mob-capture system that is infuriating to work with, and we have the ability to turn enemies into piss-poor allies that are weaker than their enemy variants.

Aside from that, the game is ridiculously heavy on the farming front: if you don't farm then you will almost certainly never beat the game. Personally, I'm alright with a bit of farming, but when the entire game becomes almost unplayable without you having to farm thousands of stalks of wheat and coffee beans then I get a little peeved. 

I feel as though I should also address some of the things that brought me into this game, mainly the pictures and videos showcasing it. First of all, flint doesn't exist in this game so whatever version they're using is clearly not the one you're paying for. Second of all, building is in no way, shape, or form as easy as the first video makes it seem. If you want to build a base like you see in the video then you'll need to farm resources for around an hour or two in real time, not to mention that if you want the big mill that's showcased then you need to play the game until you're max level, which means dealing with all the irritating and unbalanced bullshit that I've made note of in this review. Also, catching all of those animals will require upwards of 100 nets and at least 45 minutes of your time scouring the island for an animal to catch (and when you finally find one and try to catch it, chances are the net will break and the animal will sprint into a horde of hostile mobs. Hooray.) Third of all, all of those goblins attacking the base were most likely spawned in by the developer because unless he built his base off of the shore and into the hostile woods, it is incredibly unlikely that that many goblins will ever attack you. You might get one or two that slip between the trees and attack your buildings, but never six or seven (not in my experience at least.) Fourth of all, the clothing you need to explore some of the temperature-locked zones often has no defense value, so you will be eaten alive by whatever mobs decide to target you in their absurdly large area of aggression. Additionally, kiting mobs is futile as they will always land one to two hits on you unless you hide behind obstacles or get supremely lucky. Your only viable option when facing a mob is to beat the hell out of it and hope you can kill it before it kills you. Keep in mind that the mob will be landing two hits on you constantly whilst your character can only land one whilst he swings his weapon with the speed of the bathroom troll from Harry Potter. Fifth of all, I just tried this myself and maracas do jack shit. The developer had to have been in creative mode to not be attacked by that fox because the maracas have no anti-aggression capabilities whatsoever. They are a completely useless cosmetic item that, if I heard correctly, make no noise at all (so basically, they aren't maracas). The in-game description says they deal damage but, unless I'm clicking the wrong left mouse button, that's pure fallacy.

With regards to the second video, playing this game with friends seems like the only way to not lose hair playing it; however, I have never seen an online multiplayer game open so, unless your friend has this game, there's no chance of you finding another person to play with.

As one final note of grievance, the terrain in this game is appalling. Have you ever wanted to get stuck between two trees that are at least 3 feet apart? Have you ever wanted to be backed into a corner by mobs because something that you thought would have obviously been a path, wasn't? Have you ever wanted to carve your way through the trees chopping 3-4 trees before your stamina bar depletes entirely and you have to either use items you've farmed to restore it or wait 1.5-2.5 in-game days to replenish it all? Have you ever wanted to jump into a game to take control of the character because the gap in the trees is big enough for a goddamn ogre to fit through but apparently your skinny ass can't manage it? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then by all means purchase this game and feed money into the hands of the developers who no longer care about this game. To be fair though, they could have just lost all the data for this game in a fire, been kidnapped by whatever mafia they angered with this game, had to surrender their dreams of developing games to support their families, or could have simply decided that the game was a waste of time and abandoned it (something I wish I did a long time ago).

In all honesty, this is a great game if you play it in creative mode. The ambiance and natural flora are beautiful and you can make some really nice compounds with the structures programmed into the game. However, if you want to play this game as an island survival RPG full of daring adventure and mystical whimsy, then run as fast as you possibly can away from this store page.

This game gets a 1.5/10 from me, and I hope you never get the chance to rate it because if you do then that means you fell for the same trap that I did. If that's the case, then welcome to Hell: you won't go gently into this good night.",1561784408,1561784473,False,18,4,0.614008426666259766,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a fun and enjoyable crafting/sandbox(ish)/RPG/survival game with plenty to do, a nice progression introducing you to new items and constructions to make and a story line which so far isn't too bad (although it may change when I get to the ending).
Controls actually work well with the gather key being CTRL and gather all ALT, which makes for some quick item picking. Graphics are just fine, nothing fancy but not outdated either (almost classic in a sense) and the AI is generally ok, although there have been moments of it getting stuck on some random bush here and there. The challenge in this game is there and you will be spending ages making the perfect little hamlet.

Despite this there are a few things which are either annoying or just strange. The stamina will be the bane of your life in this game. Countless times I go roaming around to mine for ores and I forget to pack lots of stamina recovery items (not that there are load mind you) and have to wait a while to get back to 100%. Just make sure you pack enough coffee. Also the UI is pretty clunky and takes a bit of getting used to. Progress is very slow in this game, so don't expect a breeze through at all which for some is off putting. I've not had the chance to try multiplayer (no one I know has this game) so I cannot comment on it other than to hear that it works somewhat and does make the game a lot easier to finish.

Force of Nature is a game.  I can't say it's a good game.  It's not a bad game, either, it's just another game.  It's another game about building a base, building small buildings, building buildings to allow you to make stuff to build more buildings, and building more buildings to let you make stuff you can use to kill stuff so you can get their stuff and use it to build more buildings.  Fascinating.

For a few hours.  Then you realize you've seen this all before.  In triple A games straight down to horrible and abandoned indie games you've seen variations on this theme.

It's a good theme.   It's a good formula.  It will entertain you long enough that you can't ask for a refund from Steam because your play time is over the limit.  It doesn't lend itself well for long term replay unless you add a whole lot more twists, character development, free flow research trees, tons of customization for players to allow variations in game play strategy and results... but this game has none of that.  It's a very linear tech tree... I'd call it a tech log...  there are no branches.  

The graphics are plain, the controls are usable, although unwieldy for certain tasks, the quests seem mainly put there as obstacles rather than fun things to accomplish.  It's not that this game isn't polished.  A lot of work went into it.  I love indie games, and I love builders and management games and fighting games... but this game just gets boring very quick and just isn't that good.  

If you get Force of Nature for a price that you consider super cheap, and want to blow 20 hours with it and then be prepared to move on, then go for it.  I would want  more from a software package that I've written, and perhaps the developers of this game have grandiose plans to make this a completely different end product when it's finished.  I hope they can do it.  For now, it's just not that good.

I got what I expected from it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I love indie's so I'm gonna recommend it.  But it's a recommendation with an *...",1556137029,1556137131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Especially the taming system is ... inferior.
- Monsters and animals respawn every time you load the game, but plants not. That for such could have been nice, but it is tiresome to clear again and again and again.... especially with the problem that you have always way more monsters than animals as already mentioned before

Les moins :
- Graphismes assez datés
- Quelques bug de chargement
- En multi : Si un joueur meurt, l'autre meurt aussi...
- Des gisements inaccessibles
- Les menus un peu chiants quand on veut enchaîner la même chose

Les plus :
- Addictif
- Simple et efficace
- Beaucoup de choses à construire
- Des maps super grandes à explorer

In den Neuigkeiten wurde seitens des Entwicklers das letzte Mal im April 2018 (also vor genau einem Jahr) ein Beitrag geschrieben. Man kann also davon ausgehen, dass das Spiel nicht weiterentwickelt wird.

Was mich am Gameplay stört:

- Der Charakter ist wirklich eine lahme Ente.
- Man kann nur selten zwischen Bäumen und Büschen durchlaufen. Alles muss niedergemäht werden.
- Die Crafting/Baumenüs sind zwar nicht wirklich umständlich, aber nervig, da man bspw am Amboss stets ""Leertaste"" drücken muss um den Amboss dann mit der Maus auszuwählen, dann den Reiter ""Rezepte"" wählen muss, sich dann ein Rezept raussucht, um dann festzustellen das noch etwas fehlt. Also alles wieder schließen, benötigten Gegenstand farmen oder craften, alle Menüs wieder öffnen um das Gewünschte herzustellen. Nervtötend für mich. Wenn es bspw wie bei Terraria wäre: Neben der Schmelze steht, Menü öffnen, sehen was man bauen kann, anklicken, fertig. Nein, nicht bei FoN. Hier braucht jeder Gegenstand mehrere Sekunden bis Minuten. Und eine Reihenfolge des zu craftenden wie bspw bei Rust kann man auch nicht anlegen. Alles muss nacheinander gemacht werden.
- Grinden, grinden, grinden, grinden, grinden, grinden.
- Für die einzelnen LevelUps braucht man Münzen oder Material oder sogar noch erfüllte Quests um weiterzukommen.

Wie es im späteren Spielverlauf ist, kann ich nicht sagen, da mir nach 90 Minuten bereits der Geduldsfaden mit diesem ewigen gegrinde gerissen ist.

Für Leute, die es wirklich lieber entspannter angehen und grinden über alles lieben mag dieser Titel ja eine Option sein. Aber nicht für mich.

Innanzi tutto è supportato da un sistema di costruzione e crafting davvero geniale, unico, chiaro e semplice da imparare. Si possono creare tantissime cose, ma quello che più diverte è la costruzione del proprio villaggio, personalizzabile in tutto e per tutto con edifici vari e moltissimi elementi decorativi (strade, sentieri, lampioni, fiori, recinti con gli animali ecc.). E' un gioco unico e molto originale, grazie alle dinamiche classiche di esplorazione e survival unite ad elementi fantasy.
L'esplorazione è un aspetto assolutamente affascinante di questo gioco, il quale presenta tante ambientazioni del tutto diverse tra loro, come il paesaggio tropicale, il deserto, la foresta, le montagne innevate, il mare, le paludi e molto altro ancora. L'aspetto che più mi ha affascinato del gioco è proprio la bellezza delle ambientazioni e dei paesaggi: chilometri di esplorazione immersi nella natura più incontaminata, con scenari suggestivi, idilliaci, meravigliosi e affascinanti. La natura in tutta la sua bellezza è resa davvero bene in questo gioco, nonostante la semplice grafica. Ho apprezzato molto gli scorci, come il ruscello, il laghetto col canneto, la radura con i fiori, la nebbia nella foresta, le fitte pinete e moltissimi altri elementi incantevoli.
Un altro punto di forza del gioco sono i nemici che si possono incontrare durante il viaggio, tutti molto vari e ben disegnati: ce ne sono di tantissimi tipi, sia realistici sia fantasy, e cambiano a seconda delle ambientazioni. Anche le armi e le armature meritano, sono molto varie e ben fatte con un tocco di fantasy e medievale. Peccato per il sistema di combattimento che considero l'unico difetto del gioco: è molto rudimentale ed è stato poco approfondito, legnoso e lento, ma vista la varietà e la bellezza del gioco ci si abitua e passa in secondo piano.
Il gioco presenta un'ottima longevità, circa 50 ore per essere completato e dopodichè si è liberi di continuare la propria avventura all'infinito, andando avanti ad esplorare, combattere e costruire.

J'ai trouvé mon jeu, du moins, un parmi le genre de jeu qui me rejoint.

Cela fait plusieurs jours déjà que j'y joue, je peux donc exprimer plus facilement s'il est ou non un bon jeu. En fait non pas si c'est un bon jeu, plutôt, si j'aime ou j'aime pas ce jeu, parce que tout est relatif, tout est personnel.

Alors donc, pour ce jeu, j'aime vraiment beaucoup!  Il est sensationnel.
Un jeu de type ""open-world"", dont on y joue ""hors-ligne""(ça c'était un de mes critères principales) et par le fait même, en solo(un autre de mes critères).

On débute, à ce qui me semble être, à l'âge de pierre.
On évolue, à notre rythme, en amassant diverses ressources  et minerais pour pouvoir ériger un petit domaine d'où construira les installations propres aux transformations des différents minerais en métaux utilisables, les produits de notre cueillette, les confections artisanales et d'outils ainsi que d'armes.

On rencontre des ""mods"" qui en les combattant, relativement aisément selon notre protection, nos armes ainsi que les consommables pour nous régénérer, nous donnerons des produits tout aussi utiles à créer d'autres utilitaires.

Il y a aussi différents ""biomes"" où il nous sera indispensables, selon la température, d'avoir préalablement conçu les vêtement de protection thermique adéquat, selon le cas.

Un point très agréable du jeu, qui se révèle assez vite d'une grande aide, est la création, entre autre, de ""Portails"".
Il conviendra d'an créer deux(2) au minimum pour pouvoir aller d'un point à un autre, sans refaire tout le trajet du retour pour gagner notre domaine.
À noter, que pour créer un autre portail, il faut être en dehors de la frontière de chaque portails, définit sous un grand cercle rose-pâle sur la carte que l'on fait apparaître.

J'adore tout simplement ce jeu, avec ses chants d'oiseaux et d'autres animaux d'élevages et sauvages.
C'est relaxant, tout aussi que créatif et de style ""survie"", vu que l'on doit découvrir différents secteurs de la carte et la rencontre de différents ""mod"" à combattre.

Bref, je le recommande fortement, à qui convient ce genre de jeu.
J'espère qu'il y aura des mis à jours et de nouvelles découvertes.

Merci et à bientôt.
Cordialement,
Carl-Dave

Когда я читал другие обзоры на эту игру, то меня смутило то, что большинство людей писали про гринд, и как только я зашёл в эту игру, то понял что все эти сказки про невменяемый гринд- правда.
Конечно, в самом начале он не так заметен, тебе нужно собирать буквально по паре веток и камней, но чем дальше ты развиваешься в игре, то больше времени тебе приходится возится в ""опасной зоне"" где количество гоблинов на квадратный метр превышает все допустимые нормы, да что тут говорить, в этой игре невозможно нормально собирать ресурсы, на твоей базе они рано или поздно кончатся, и тебе нужно будет выходить за её рамки, но там тебя будет ждать вся нечисть этой игры.

It has all i want from a survival game and it is probably one of the best survival games out there.

Here is a listing of pro's and con's from me for this game:

Pro's:
[list]
[*] pretty nice, and detailed bioms and graphs made with love while my graphic card is not overheating
[*] wonderfull birdsongs in high quality and great nature sounds
[*] this game made me feel relaxed
[*] no food for hunger but for healing
[*] working multiplayer even in beta
[*] living at the beach creates holiday feelings
[/list]
Everything worked pretty well till three days ago. I had three worlds. Two old softcore and one new hardcore. A week ago one old softcore world vanished. I should have been alerted and should have saved my world immediately but I didnt. Three days ago I switched the game off in the evening two hours before I reached the end of the game. I had no gamecrashes nor pc crashes. When I turned on my pc again the next morning I loaded the last save game and started in the new hardcore world I created a month ago but without any clothes, buildings, loot and weapons. Everything was gone but the raw world and the creation dates of the save game files were set to a date two years ago. 

That brings me to the con's:
[list]
[*] You can't rely on the savegames what makes a game unplayable.
[*] The developer stopped supporting this game.
[/list]
I cant recomment this game cause of the problem with save games even if I would give it a 8 of 10 otherwise.

If you already bought this game and you want to be sure that you lose no data just save the world youre playing with (C:\ProgramData\ForceOfNature\Worlds\W00*) to a different location. I used 3 locations and I alternately saved after every game session to one of those locations.

- Sistema de abrir caminho aonde quiser com machado, é muito bacana, auxilia no ponto do jogo ser mundo aberto e que há diversos caminhos a se seguir, sqn

Contras:
- Alguns Craft exigem muitos recursos, chega ser abusivo alguns
- Demora para conseguir tais tipos de recursos o que implica no piorar do item anterior
- Cenários de gelo, deserto e floresta são colados o que te força a voltar a base, se reprogramar para depois realizar o objetivo.
- Seguindo o tópico anterior, muita das vezes os inimigos saltam do level 4 para level 16, as vezes para level 20, te forçando a tentar outro caminho, o que te faz ter que reprogramar novamente para tentar outro caminho, indo por outro caminho acontece que há caminhos que não se pode passar, por conta de montanhas ou buracos, e acaba que você se desvia do caminho diversas vezes e não consegue chegar ao objetivo, nos ultimos objetivos tentei pelo menos uns 8 caminho diferentes e fui surpreendido por um dos dois problemas. Não importa os objetivos serem longe, o tenso e que temos que pegar o caminho especifico para conseguir passar... Isso retira toda sensação de mundo liberdade e de mundo aberto, sendo que o produtor nos obriga a passar pelo caminho específico.
- Sistema de defesa é complicado de se entender e de ser útil em combate.

Concluindo, posso dizer que o jogo não é ruim, é um jogo chato que o fato de ficar procurando caminhos para ir vai te cansar muito, não sendo prazerosa a aventura, pois quando você começar a aventura sempre vai ter um porém, e quando não tem... o caminho foi “fechado” por monstros de nível 16 a 20, sendo impossível passar....

However, Like so many of the dozens of indie survival games one finds on steam, nearly every aspect of it's core gameplay suffers from poor execution. Lets start with the basics:

-The game looks like it crawled out of a time warp leading 12+ years into the past. Unimpressive in literally every graphical regard except the water textures, even on ultra high (which by the why, there's no discernable difference between High and Ultra besides framerate dropping, at least that I could tell). I'm not usually one to care about graphics if the artistic style is consistent and/or the core gameplay is good, but well... read on.

-The soundtrack... I honestly don't think the game has one. For the life of me, I swear that every hour I've put into this thing, the only thing going in the background has been the various soundeffects. Not even a simple ambience track from what I could hear, nor combat music, nor anything. This is admittedly a minor thing, perhaps even a nitpick, but I feel that in hindsight, the lack of even such a basic element as this foreshadowed the quality of game overall.

-Some of the clunkiest controls I have seen in a long time. While yes, the scheme is functional on a technical level, it's awkward as hell to have to hold space and then click on the object to interact with [b]anything[/b] instead of say, just pressing E or something after getting close. Expect to take a good bit of time just getting used to the alien controls before you can start playing properly.

Now, into the meat and potatoes of the reveiw.

Whereas most indie survivals execute their gameplay poorly by requiring you to play metermaid for a character who can't go more than 10 in-game minutes without eating, drinking, sleeping, or taking a wee, Force of Nature's cardinal sin is of a different ilk, one that anyone who has played even a little bit of vanilla versions of Oblivion or older Elder Scrolls games will be quite familiar with: The Grind. The God. Damned. Grinding. Grinding not just for levels though, but for the basic resources you need to do pretty much [b]anything[/b] in this damn game too. Now, some might say ""well grinding for resources is part of any survival game"" and yeah, you're right. 

But the grind should never be this mind-numblingly boring. Boring because pretty much all of the actually interesting stuff is walled off by a level requirement until you've already invested several hours into the game; the trailers are somewhat misleading in this regard, given those bases and the boss raids they show are all *late game content*, and every moment of getting to that late game will be spent grinding your ass off.  For you see, there's actually quite a lot of things you can construct in this game, but if you play on ""General"" mode like the game suggests to new players, most of it will have to be unlocked by gaining levels. There are seven levels to my knowledge, each one unlocking a new teir of constructions and decorations, with the sixth to seventh levels being where the type of late game content in the trailers becomes available. To get a single level, you have to complete each quest associated with said level. And guess what these quests involve. Yes, grinding. You gotta grind stone deposits to get enough to make a blast furnace. Gotta grind trees and bushes to get enough wood and leaves to construct a straw hut. Grind sand and clay and dirt in order to construct Charcoal cookers, etc. Often, in order to finish a quest you'll need to make something using the new construction you just grinded to make. Well guess what, most of the crafting stations in the game require some form of tools in order to do anything on them, for added realism I suppose. In order to get those tools, you gotta grind some more, of course. There's nothing in most of the quest descriptions telling you ""oh, and go ahead and make this tool while you're at it too, you'll need it for this"". No, it just gets sprung on the player at the last minute once they realize they can't make anything at this damn construction they just spent the better part of an hour farming materials for, only to look under some of the recipes and see that doing anything at all requires another component to the crafting station that has to be made seperately from it. The vast majority of quests require you to do [i]some[/i] form of crafting in order to complete it, so you're going to run into this type of nonsense multiple times. 

The game does shake this frustrating monotny up a bit however, as some quests don't require you to farm resource nodes to complete them. They require you to farm mobs instead, whether by taming them, or by killing them. The former part is actually ok, but the latter part is where the second cardinal sin of the game comes in. It's half-assed combat system. [i]If one can even call it that[/i]. Really, it's nothing more than holding down the left or right mouse whilst vainly trying to plod your character side to side or backwards in order to dodge enemy attacks. Except your character moves so damn slowly, even after gaining several levels and increasing your speed with each one, that you might as well just save yourself the effort and stay stock still while you mindlessly wail away at the enemy. Just like you do while mining resource nodes... actually, know what? I lied earlier, it [i]doesn't[/i] shake things up by making you slay mobs, the monsters are all just destructable obstacles/resource nodes by another name, that happen to actually move and might hit you back. That goblin is really just an angry tree, take an axe to it as you would any other. But be forewarned, since all the mobs are also massive damage sponges- even a god damn rabbit, big as they may be in this game, will take numerous hits from a stone knife, the most basic tool/weapon, before they drop dead. Every other mob just gets worse from there. You'd never think that sheep, foxes, chickens, etc could take a lot of punishment, but you'd be surprised how much health this game sees fit to give them. Gods help you if you decide to take on a bear, especially below at least level 5-6.

And well, thats basically the game, if you play it as recommended. you could of course, always go into creative mode in a new world, but that only eliminates the level walling you'd get. The infinite grinding and the horridly lazy combat will still be prominent. Grind resources, craft items, build buildings, grind more resources, kill some mobs for their resources, rinse and repeat, maybe in a new order. There's nothing of substance until you've already poured so much of your time into it. But by the time you even get close to that point, will you really want to go any further? Even knowing there's going to be even more grinding and even more combat as a nessacary part of completing the main story (and I don't even know if it can be called a story, it all boils down to you hunting magical mcguffins with no readily apparent rhyme or reason)?

Final Verdict:
At around $8.00 normal price, it's not worth the money for most people looking for fun in a single-player, procedurally generated survival game. I got it dirt cheap during the winter sale, 75% off brought it down to 2 dollars and change, less than a cup of coffee. I think that price is more reflective of the game's merits. Those who are interested in teaming up with friends via the multiplayer may find some value, but even then, you could probably find much better experiences gaming with friends in other titles.",1546743321,1546743321,False,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Force of nature APPEARS open world sandbox, but it is so so SO linear, should you go into an area you haven't progressed to yet, you're going to be annihilated by super strong enemies, while if you go into a previously visited area (which you'll have to do frequently to grind for the gems needed to build certain items) you're going to annihilate all who stand in your path. Even the buildings and objects you can craft are limited by player level, so they have sort of doubled down on the linear progression locking. 

On the grinding, if you play this, prepare to grind! You'll clear an entire area out of enemies for gems, you'll save the game, quit, and load (which re-spawns the enemies) and grind again. I played through this ones at an early access stage, and then again once it was released. 

In early access, once you assemble the force of nature, it just gave a 'u win' message which was a little disappointing. Unfortunately, while more buildings, items, enemies, etc were added when I played it through after release, the ending was the same! A 'u win' message!

- Occasional crashes
- Collision-check prevention is kind've insane (i.e. certain hills you definitely should be able to run up, you can't -- you have to run around. Certain areas of trees you should be able to run between, you can't.)
- Run speed is pretty bad. Plan on making tons of teleporters
- Getting the next level costs resources... what?
... and some (type of, and quantity) of those resources are kind've rediculous.
- Chopping trees takes -forever- which means clearing a path through much of anything is just sheer painful and torturous
- You can't zoom in or out on the map
- Clipping plane is so pretty damn short and you can't adjust it either :/
- Development seems to have stopped?
- No swimming, despite lots of areas where there is water
- No jumping
- No terrain deformation, despite the ability to dig in the ground to get sand, soil, and clay

Now the good:
+ In depth crafting system (not quite as detailed as Wurm with temperatures of intermediary ingredients, and variations on existing recipees creating different items etc. but still decently in depth)
+ Framerates seem pretty good (though that could be because the clipping plane is so damn short)
+ Has multiplayer
+ Supports creation of a new world and saves (meaning multiple worlds -- 1 at a time)
+ Signs you create can have their text appear on the map
+ Portals show up on the map
+ Has a temperature system -- affected primarily (only?) by biome
+ Has day / night cycle

無人島に漂着した主人公がサバイバル生活を送りながらネイチャーストーンを手に入れるのが目的のゲームだ。
一見するとサバイバルゲームに見えるが空腹や渇きなどのステータスはなく、素材を集めてクラフトしていくのがメインとなっている。また、このゲームはレベル制の成長要素があり、クエストをこなしていくことでレベルアップする。

[クエスト]
ゲーム進行はクエストをこなすことで進行する。クエストをこなさないことにはレベルが上がらず、新しいクラフトがアンロックされない。また、レベルに応じて設置数などの制限がある。

[クラフト]
クラフトできる物は多い。建物そのもの形をデザインすることはできないが、設備や建築物が意外と充実しており花壇などを作ってデコレーションしたり空き地に自由に建築していくことができる。クラフトはゲーム後半に行くほど大量の素材を必要とする傾向があり、特に石炭(木炭？)を作るための丸太と、栽培と畜産、料理に使うための水は常時集めておかないと厳しい。

[戦闘]
戦闘は移動して攻撃するだけの極めてシンプルなもので、ヒットアンドウェイすらろくにできない。ゲーム後半で移動速度アップのアクセサリーを装備して移動速度の遅い敵相手ならヒットアンドウェイができなくもないが、結局は敵をできるだけ1体ずつ引き付けて地形に引っ掛けて攻撃するだけになると思う。
ゲーム終盤の敵は強くまともに殴り合ったら回復アイテムがいくらあっても足りないくらいで、弓矢で削りつつ地形に引っ掛けることが必要になってくると思う。おまけに毒攻撃してくるサソリが厄介で攻撃を食らうと高確率で毒状態になり、さらに毒針を飛ばしてレンジ攻撃してくる。ハーブティーかパン以上の回復効果のアイテムが手持ちにないときつい。

[防衛]
拠点の近くに敵がいるとたまに襲撃してくることがあり、襲撃を放置すると設備や建物が破壊される。防壁をクラフトして設置することもできるがあまり頑丈とは言えないので、拠点の周りの木はあまり伐採しないことを推奨する。最初から生えている木や茂みを越えて敵が来ることはない。
このため、最初の拠点エリア以外に第二拠点を作ったりして遊ぶには少し厳しい仕様だと思う。敵の襲撃を受けないようにするには敵の沸きポイントのエリアを遮るような木や茂みに囲まれた場所が必要でありどうしても狭くなる。

[バイオーム]
バイオームは10種類くらいあり、快適な温度状態になるように服装を変えないと気力(場合によっては体力も)が減少していく。バイオームに適した温度状態はキャラのステータスと服装で決まり、実質的にバイオームはゲーム進行上の壁となっている。例えば、新しいバイオームを探索するには、レベルを上げてキャラの快適温度ステータスを上げて適切な服をクラフトして装備して、やっと探索ができるといった具合だ。

意外とクラフトできるものが多く徐々に拠点が発展していく様子は楽しい。しかし、このゲームはレベルによる制限があり、あまり楽しくない戦闘を強いられるのが残念だ。特に設備の設置数制限があり、特に序盤ではアイテムを入れる箱や畑があまり設置できないこともあり行動できることが非常に限られてしまう。中盤以降で鉄製の道具をクラフトできるようになるあたりからは行動できることに幅が出て面白くなってくるのだが、敵が強くなってくることもあり回復アイテムの量産に追われることになる。クエストによる一本道なストーリー展開は賛否両論はあるだろうが、チュートリアルを兼ねており自由度が高いゲームで何をすればいいか分からないプレイヤーにとってはプレイしやすい仕様かもしれない。
前述した通りにクラフト部分は良いものだが、レベルによる制限と成長要素による無駄に多い戦闘のために、クラフトをさせたいのかRPGをさせたいのか全体としては中途半端さを感じるのが惜しい。価格相応とも言える。レベル性による制限を許容出来てクラフトゲームが好きというプレイヤーなら、セールで買うならオススメだと思う。",1545906355,1547067682,True,4,0,0.56603771448135376,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a survival game (you start with nothing, you get guided with quests and you have to build your tools and your weapons to ""finish"" the game). Every labour task you do (getting ressources, fighting, etc.) uses up stamina which either generates slowly by itself over time or can be replenished by eating food (which at some point you seem to be able to produce yourself other than just farm what is there).

I consider it on the lower end of graphics.

Personally the stamina system feels forced. It's there to slow things down (which might be the intention, but I simply don't like it). So everything takes a lot longer than it could and it feels unnatural.
I am inclined to compare it with Graveyard Keeper (has the same issue) and with Minecraft (where ""stamina"" is not an issue, but hunger - however, that one doesn't really stop you from doing things at the same speed).

The inventory is clunky, the same is with the menu. Especially considering that things you craft on your person need to be taken out of the crafting menu into your puch (that does not happen automatically). And when you do so, and press the shortcut key, it always presents you with the menu to do more stuff (greying out the possibilty to grab the stuff you just made - its one more click only, but...annyoing IMHO).

You appear to lose your stuff when you die (as in -> its in your corpse which you need to find) and sometimes you lose stuff for real (seems as the corpse doesn't have all if it). With this I might be wrong, it happend to me twice, but I never really tried it several times (as I am trying NOT to die :)).
The possibilites to store stuff (especially at the start) are...limited...which I consider annoying.

Multiplayer works...however, awkwardly. If a player goes too far away, all other players are being beamed/transported to that player.
This makes multiyplayer very hard to play, at least in my opinion. 
The whole team levels the same (so not everyone needs to do their quests), so leveling up is easy when in a team (that might be considered a plus).

There wasn't an update for about 8 month. So I do guess it is considered finished.
However, it has a low price. So go ahead and try for yourself.",1545848651,1545848651,False,2,0,0.489264041185379028,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра на любителя, но что до меня - я в полнейшем восторге =) 

Игра понравится любому человеку, получающему удовольствие от сандбоксов, строительства, фарминга и элементов фермы. Но вряд ли понравится юным игрокам, которых может отпугнуть капелька гринда и непростой на первый взгляд крафт. 

Плюсы перечислять бессмысленно - вся игра, на мой взгляд, состоит из сплошных плюсов. 
Из минусов - только одно. Саундтрек. Не могу сказать, что разработчик выбрал плохую музыку. Я бы сказала, что он выбрал неподходящее музыкальное сопровождение данному сеттингу. Если музыка бралась со стоков, скорее всего разработчик использовал первую попавшуюся более-менеее симпатичную сборку мелодий. Если же был нанят композитор, который писал музыку непосредственно для игры, то тогда больше вопросов к музыканту. Ощущение, что композитор не запускал игру, не видел картинку и не в курсе, для чего вообще он написал композиции. Повторюсь - я не считаю, что эта музыка плохая. Я бы даже выдернула ее из игры, чтобы слушать в свободное время в плеере, но во время игры музыкальное сопровождение  немного разрушает атмосферу самой игры. В принципе, эта проблема легко решается отключением музыки. 
Что до эмбиента (звуки природы, треск костра, нестройный, но очаровательный хор нашего домашнего скота) - он великолепен. 

Мой вердикт - брать, играть, получать удовольствие. Игра определенно стоит своих денег, ведь в ней можно провести не 10 и не 20 часов. На момент написания отзыва у меня наигранно 42 часа, а я еще не наигралась ^_^ К тому же, поддержать инди-разработчика - это хорошее дело =)

Am I please I did. Loved it from start to finish. 

Ignore the negative comments that state you have to pick each and every item up singularly, becuase you don't, there is a multi gather button and it's not that hard to spot. I think the grind level is just about spot on compared with other games I have played in the genre. 

Again, ignore the negatives that state you have to grind, then wait, grind, then wait. It's all about time management, why craft something and then wait there until it's finished? Go and craft something else, or collect more resources whilst you wait, or go and beat up on a few Goblins. All good fun. 

If you're also going to run in to a battle with multiple enemies and have little to no protection, or sufficient Weapons, then yes, expect to die. That again is the same in most games I play. It is possible in this game to sneak up on and isolate single enemies. It's also easy to work out how to gain hits on enemies and not get hit back.This is where a good strategy comes in. 

To me, it seems that the negative reviews are simply from people who are used to having Weapons and Armour which means  you one hit every enemy and never get hit in return. This is where this game differs, good steady tactics win the day. 

Just finished my first run through and yes I will say the ending is a bit anti-climatic, however that said, I did achieve the objective that was stated right at the start of the game. A little more fanfare would have been nice. 

Overall, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10 and would recommend it to mates who have the guile and patience to play it.

也是時候來評價了

十分推薦這款遊戲
雖然前期很困難
但是如果是""二個人""一起玩的話
樂趣會比較高 戰鬥方面也會比較容易!

這款唯一的缺點就是 礦產十分稀少 以致於 ""箭矢"" 最多只能用石制

[其實也是因為後面的箭矢太過於昂貴]

舉例最好的鋼錠箭矢[遊戲最強的箭矢]

需要燒製 1組鋼錠 則需要50錫碇 鐵碇[相當於 各100個原礦] 

你還需要去準備 煤塊燒製[一組需要1000顆煤(相當於200個原木+400個火種) + 500個火種]  

火種又是 樹枝 1:3在燒製   然後1組50個鋼 卻只能製造 4組不到的鋼碇箭矢 [一組二百根] ....

然而這遊戲玩了足足40多個鐘頭 你倉庫裡[兩人 一起玩的時間]  僅有3組鐵 錫  花了二個鐘頭才燒了一組鋼 ......

[礦產真的很稀少連石頭都少!! 石頭用完=沒有箭矢] 沒有箭矢 這遊戲的怪物 根本教你如何乖乖的龜在家裡才不會受傷

另一個缺點則是 水資源太少!! 水井最多六個 這是很大的缺點 二分就滿了 真希望可以改60 120 不然出門回來 只有六個很難受

最後一個缺點則是 建築物都有限制數量!!  這是很大的弊端阿.... 

這遊戲雖然支持四個玩家一起玩 但是其實二個人就很吃力了 [建築物方面] 

優點則是 這遊戲 在有足夠的水資源下 食物 補品 藥劑 是完全不會缺乏的[二人分工合作 一人食物 一人打鐵鑄造]

This game advertises itself as a mashup of survival/resource management/RPG genres, but it's a pretty run of the mill survival game. There's absolutely nothing customizable about your character, and the ""quests"" are essentially just there as gates to unlock higher recipes by crafting all the more basic items first. 

Everything about the menus and interface is fairly annoying. There are no shortcut keys for some of the menus (??) or actions, and often times you have to click a silly number of times or navigate in and back out of a menu to accomplish what you want. You can't actually click on anything in game to pick up or use unless you either open the inventory or hold spacebar, and while you have the inventory open your character can move but is locked facing one direction.

As far as the actual gameplay, it's decent but more tedious than other survival games I've played. Mining ore with the stone pickaxe is an extreme chore, you want to upgrade that ASAP. Low level animals do fairly heft damage even with the first armor set, and they never leave you alone. Farm animals stray a good distance from where you leave them and farming mats for fences is slow. The screen fuzziness at low HP is super unnecessary and annoying. The portals you can build make an extremely unpleasent sound (you can mute it which also mutes some other things, unfortunately),

首先是资源采集机制，前期获得资源实在是太困难，难度大数目少，而需要的资源也很多，到了后期不需要资源了反而是资源滚滚来。

其次是战斗机制，真的可以改改，这是我玩过战斗机制最差劲的沙盒游戏

最后是建筑，为啥不能整个屋子一起移动？为啥还要等建筑时间？为啥砖屋就算是空的不能移动？

好了，吐槽完了，接下来说说心得攻略：

1.战斗中保持冷静
这是一个沉不住气就注定要死的游戏，你必须一个一个引怪，尽可能少引怪，多作战
不要着急做事就嗑食物嗑药，如果你残血了就一定要挂机等血回满，不残但是还能做事的时候可以嗑一下
[spoiler]如果你实在憋不住就去开修改器吧，网上的修改器能用[/spoiler]

2.前期要处处小心
尽量利用地形做天然屏障，只打通一条探索的道路就可以了，千万不要把三个方向都挖开[spoiler]【别问为什么不是4个，海边出生的有本事你给我把海填了】[/spoiler]
如果打怪打不过濒死了，有一招可以用：Esc，保存并退出，继续游戏【你会在出生点或者标记“从此处开始游戏”的传送阵上，并且保留一切其他数据，血量、战利品等等】

It is a frustrating mess.  There is a very specific progression chain that you MUST follow in order to level.  You do not accrue XP for gathering, crafting or combat.  Once you finish several quests, you get the opportunity to level, which requires more gathering/crafting/combat.

Graphics are crude and the camera angle doesn't help when you are trying to use a ranged weapon.

Crafting is at least interesting but time-consuming.  Best starter advice I read is upgrade your tools/weapons as soon as the upgrades are available.  And make sure your have lots of places to stash your items (a bit more on this later).

Taming is a joke.  Throw a net on a critter, press the space bar and click 'tame'.  That's it, done.  Also, each tame produces only one resource and you cannot tame combat pets, which would increase your survivability.  Tames also have to be fed to produces resources.

Combat (ranged and HTH) is awful and if you aggro more than one enemy you stand a good chance of dying, which then randomly removes items from your inventory.  Items that you have spent the last several hours gathering and/or crafting.  Items that you need to do anything, like survive.

Не смотрите на очень частое упоминание о типичности, это не значит, что данная игра не способна заинтересовать.

[b]О среде обитания[/b]
В нашем распоряжении будет процедурно генерируемый мир немалых таких размеров с различными биомами и с соответствующей флорой и пассивной и агрессивной фауной, в котором обитают как обычные, так и фантастические твари. Мир здесь сделан так, что за него можно добавить сразу несколько баллов к общей оценке.

[b]Чем заняться[/b]
Суть игры - типичная типичность:
Сбор и производство ресурсов, постройка зданий и сооружений, фермерство, приручение/одомашнивание животных, битвы с агрессивными НПС в виде сказочных существ и диких зверей и еще раз крафт, крафт, крафт… Одна единственная цель, которой можно заняться – пройти по сюжетно-обучающей линии, но и она приведет ни к какой-то там мегазахватывающей развязке, а просто к прокачке Вашего персонажа до предельного уровня.
Что же тут еще такого «типичного» для подобных игр? Ах, да! В лучших традициях жанра, нам позволят создать своего персонажа (вернее, отредактировать цвет волос, кожи и шорт у одной доступной модельки), после чего предстоит очнуться на берегу сказочного острова с амнезией на всю голову. Дополнением к приятному на глаз миру станет незамысловатый интерфейс с очень удобными подсказками, изучить и разобраться с которым хватит не более получаса. Вот, собственно, и все! Что тут еще сказать? Разумеется, рецептов крафта – крафтить не перекрафтить. 
В отличии от многих похожих игр тут нету показателей голода/жажды/температуры и прочих. Ваш персонаж не может быстро бегать и прыгать. 
Боевая система тоже оставляет желать лучшего, но это и не критично, ведь игра нацелена не на слешер от слова «совсем». Тут есть оружие ближнего и дальнего боя. 
Как и во многих подобных играх имеется прокачка персонажа по уровням, правда, она тоже примитивна как палка, но имеем, что имеем. В зависимости от уровня, будет увеличиваться выносливость и запас здоровья персонажа, а также увеличится количество доступных для крафта рецептов (выше уровень – больше доступных рецептов. О-оригинальность).
На удивление, в игре нет мультиплеера! Есть только игра по сети, как я полагаю, с друзьями (если они у Вас, конечно же есть, ухахахаха!) и то она находится в состоянии бета-версии. Правда, ни в коем разе не запишу этот аспект в минусы, ибо захотим почувствовать запах горящей обивки стула от пригоревшей пятой точки из-за постоянных рейдов базы, то можно зайти в другие более популярные игры – законодатели жанра.

[b]Теперь о минусах. [/b]
Самым слабым местом в игре я бы назвал систему приручения домашних животных, которая оставляет желать лучшего. Это, кстати самый большой косяк в игре - чтобы поймать пета, необходимо накинуть на него сеть, но от первой брошенной сети, в любом случае, он освободится и Вам предстоит еще носиться за какой-нибудь курицей по полному врагов лесу, дабы накинуть на нее «контрольную» сеть.
Вторым, чуть менее значимым недостатком, как мне кажется, является карта, на которой отображаются враги только в пределах радиуса видимости персонажа и вообще НЕ отображаются к примеру, залежи руды – одного из основных и редких ресурсов. А, учитывая, что мир является процедурно генерируемым, отсутствие возможности видеть врагов и, хотя бы возможность делать на ней свои пометки, геймплей становится не самым удобным.
Ну и третьим минусом можно назвать отсутствие сандтрека – фоновой музыки! Ее нет совсем и от этого страдает атмосфера! А ведь, насколько был бы прекрасен этот фантастический отлично прорисованный красочный мир, где бегают кролики размером чуть больше собаки, смотри мы на него под какие-нибудь тонкие звучания инструментальной или электронной музыки (можно даже с психоделическим уклоном).
[b]И небольшое предложение[/b] о приручении животных, хотелось бы чтобы появилась возможность приручения животных – компаньонов, быть может, каких-нить волков, которые могли бы оказывать помощь в схватке с противниками или лошадок для более боле быстрого перемещения по миру.

[b]Итог:[/b] Несмотря на  аркадность, какую-то примитивность, схожесть игры с другими проектами конкурентов, в Force of Nature есть что-то притягивающее и отличительное – и тот же, казалось бы типичный крафт, ну чем он может отличаться от крафта в другой игре? А здесь, вроде даже логичный. То же уже упомянутое удобство интерфейса, с которым сможет разобраться любой от новичка до профи и система обучения - настолько плавная, что Вы попросту не заметите, как производство следующего предмета усложнится в разы.  

[b]Вердикт: [/b]Выживалка... Нет, песочница для начинающих. Идеальна для тех, кто захочет начать знакомство с миром крафта и понять суть таких игр. 
Игру рекомендую к покупке в период скидки любителям жанра.

Upon starting the game it immediately directs you to the main menu which I thought its odd since other games usually have other kinds of interlude screen before directing you to the main menu but that's really not the matter anyway since I'm still interested to try out this game. Once the game begun, seeing that my character woke up half naked on a beach so I thought that this must be where the survival aspect stars. As I play on, I find myself playing and waiting and playing and waiting which is really not what I wanted so I'm gonna start listing down the pros and cons of the game.

Pros:
1. Crafting system. The progress of the crafting system here is in % and you can craft different items from different objects like the bonfire.

I tried to think of more positive things about this game but there's just none I can come up with.

Cons:
1. Animation. The animation of the character does not look very lively. If anything it feels like I'm controlling a puppet.
2. Despite the genre says survival, I did not see any survival aspect here. There's no hunger, thirst, etc.
3. Game feels extremely grindy. Especially the leveling system. The concept of the leveling system is actually not that bad but because you're just grinding the same stuff you used to craft objects in order to level up, game feels extremely slow.
4. Combat. Combat in this game is very bad. You're basically trading damage with your enemies which means you got no way to dodge or block. You will get hit if you attack and that is the only way to attack the enemy. If you're up against multiple enemies, you're likely dead because there's no way to avoid damage.
5. The pace of the game feels extremely slow due to it being grindy.
6. You can't sprint also another reason why the game feels slow.
7. Confusing aesthetic environment. At first I actually thought that the world is just like our real life era until I see the goblin.
8. Picking up items in this game feels extremely tedious. You have to hold down spacebar and left click a particular item every single time to pick them up. 

All in all I just can't bear myself to continue playing this game. After I quit the game, I looked back at the gameplay images and what I see from that image is so much better than when I started playing the game. Yes I know that if I wanted to reach there, I need to continue playing the game but because the game feels boring I just can't. What I really wanted out of this game is just like the ones shown on the images but unfortunately it is way too grindy.

Зато на YouTube канале разраба веселые видео где он с бесконечными ресами бегает и убивает толпы мобов, но увы обычным игрокам с таким крафтом и постройками это не светит. А гриндить в сингловой игре месяцами никто не будет. Контента в игре реально на 30ч игры, но разраб с помощью гринда наверно хотел его растянуть на 300ч. Очень плохое решение. Сам он видимо развиваться с нуля не желал и не играл в свое творение - времени не было.
UI, его удобство и логичность - забудьте об этом, все сделано чтобы впустую тратить время.
Через растения, траву и прочие мелочи нельзя проходить, сюда он добавил коллизии, в 2018, ога =)

I began with the general game mode that went through a tutorial type of system. The only issue I had initially was the sensitivity of the mouse and after playing with the slider for a bit i eventually gave up and started to play the game. About half way through the tutorial I decided to have a look at the creative mode. This I found to be good as it gave you access to all the items in the sense of you didnt have to unlock them but you still had to collect the resources. This isnt a game for those who dont have patience. The graphics are ok but dont expect anything spectacular. My only problem is the way the screen goes when your health starts to decrease.

(Multiplayer Beta is omitted)

After 108 hours of gameplay, I leave this game with an strong aftertaste of incompletion and frowned eyebrows.

It starts with the shifting mechanics and the camera toggling: You can't jump or crouch. Why tho'? These mechanics exist in nearly every game. If the camera allows you a 360° horizontal view, the vertical view is restricted to 90°. I mean, I can't see the sky. I can't even see the mill I build in its whole size. Why would the developpers do that?
Now to the game content - the main of this game is to collect shards of Force of Nature and to reassemble it to one piece. To come to this, you have to build your base level by level (there are 13 levels). That's it. There's no lore and in spite of the relatively big map, there are no secret places, buildings etc. or whatsoever to discover. Where does the Force of Nature comes from? Why do I have to reassemble it? Why do I start from a specific spot? Is there any background information about my character? Why are there hostile goblins and what not around you? What is their relation to all this? All these questions will not be answered and the ending (the reassembling of Force of Nature) will be rather disappointing. Why would you omit that? Why is there no lore? Basicly, you're wasting your frickin' time in trying to explore the whole map. And that's what I did: In fact, you can beat the game in 60-70 hours. 
Which brings me to my next point - for its mediocre content, you waste a lot of time (and money - 10 bucks in my case). And the most of this time goes into farming. It is a very intense farming game.  If you're not into that, don't buy this game. The only positive things in this game are the portals which allow you to teleport from one place to another, the hot key assignins which allow you to assign weapons and items like healing potions to a hot key and the concept of different bioms that forces you to adapt your gear. If these mechanics would not be present, the game would be really unpleasant. 

However, the negative things don't stop there: The building menu is too restrictive. If I could chose between this game or Minecraft - it would be clearly Minecraft. Furthermore, the stamina consumption in this game is ridiculuous. It needs a ""trillion"" years to refill completly and if you use items to refill it, you need a ton of them. I can't tell you how many coffee cups I used in my entire gameplay to refill constantly my stamina bar. 
The maximum level you can reach is 13. You enemies will be from level 1 to 20 and higher. Why though? Never attract a bunch of them or you're dead. Btw - dying 10 times doesn't make you a bad player even if there's a Steam achievement for that. You just have bad luck or the game is cheatin'. Last but not least: The map has dark spots - steep places you can't reach. If it doesn't have any purpose - why do you integrate it in the game? 
 
If you are a minimalist, this game is for you. If not, don't buy it. 
As a man who plays games mostly for lore and more ambitious mechanics, I can't recommend this game.",1533235835,1533235835,False,69,5,0.706004679203033447,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The singleplayer mode is where I've spent most my time and thus to which I refer in the paragraphs above.

I'd complain about the fact that if any of the other players die, everyone dies, which is strange and perhaps, stupid.

This game is ""yet another survival game"". (I personally love those, they're my favorite. If you don't, take that into consideration.)

This game, however, is *far more linear* in nature, although it opens up in subtle ways. You are given quests to accomplish. ""Craft a stone axe."" ""Craft a stone pickaxe."" Etc. When you knock of a few quests, you get the next step in the progression. It takes a while before it's more generalized, like, ""Build [a crafting station of some kind]"". It's at this point where the game expects you to realize you may need more of a certain metal to make a certain other crafting element or station before you can make the final goal.

In this way, the game is highly structured, always giving you a goal. At the same time, you do reach a point where your creative beast is unleashed. How much effort you choose to put into creating a base, and decorating it, and doing all the necessary work is up to you. The game will never say, ""Make you base protected by a pallisade, lay down sett (paving) and line it with street lights"". You have to choose to do so. Will you? That depends.... 

This game is ""grindy"", in terms of traditional crafting games. You will constantly need to go out, cut down trees, mine, hunt monsters, harvest, craft, etc. to keep your supplies up. The things you start at first- creating some burning hot embers- is something you will continue to do, as you add more to your plate. More embers, more coal, more water from the well, more farming, more cooking.... you will have a list of tasks you run around your base every minute topping off. 

Do you have to? No, unless you are in dire need of that thing. But part of the fun is getting ahead of the curve. It's great fun when you finish a batch of 100 ""cups"" of coffee, and know you're not going ot be out of energy anytime soon- but it's rewarding because you did a decent amount of work, and waited for the crafting to finish, for that coffee. On the other hand, as you use it, you'll be thinking, ""Do I really need this? I'm gonna need to craft another huge batch soon, and that'll take a while."" In other words, your resources are valuable.

The combat is fine, nothing amazing, but it works. There is challenge, mostly in the form of getting overhwelming by 4-5 mobs at once, so you have to pull some critters with your bow and use the terrain to funnel them toward you sometimes. Other times you can just walk around killing lower level things without much worry. There's always progression, where difficult scenarios will become easy in time due to progress.

For less than $10 or so, last I checked, you will get at least 60-80 hours, if not several hundred.

It's a very, very high quality game that is fun. A bit chill, a bit meditative and lonely, but also goal oriented. If you enjoy survival games, pick this up. And do me a favor, don't get disturbed by the DO X quest method. You will have plenty of creative freedom while accomplishing your quests.

If you like building, crafting, farming, managing, fighting monsters and collecting loot then I suggest you have a look at this. The graphics are beautiful and there is plenty to do to keep you busy for many hours. Unfortunetaly this game also has some flaws, which could potentially ruin the experience for some players.

PROS:

- Beautiful world with day and night cycle. The graphics are not high end but more than enough for such a game! Flora and fauna look very pretty. A lot of fun just to walk around, explore and kick bananas and apples from the trees.
- Lots of different items to craft, mine, gather and catch including wood and stone, ores, food, weapons, clothing, plants, animals and more.
- RPG elements. You will be fighting a lot of monsters, level up your health and stamina and craft weapons.
- Although only a beta at the moment, there is a simple multiplayer co-op option for up to 4 players.

CONS:

- The controls, camera and UI could be better. Takes a bit of time to get used to.
- Overall the gameplay is a bit slow and feels linear. Less resources for structures would help to keep the game flow better. Gathering wood and ores can feel like a chore.
- There are some poor game design choices that seem odd and can be annoying, such as the walking speed, breathing under water, catching animals (did the developers try this?) or limiting players to a certain number of structures in story mode.

Overall still an enjoyable game. Played over 40 hours solo and now trying the multiplayer mode.

It's the skeleton of a perfectly decent game, but the development seems to be on hiatus. So whether its many issues will ever be resolved is anybody's guess. As it stands in its current state, it's not a good game, and you should stay away.

The core issue is time. Everything takes a long time, and mechanical skill at the game doesn't make it any faster. It's just designed to take a long time. Gathering is slow, crafting is slow, combat is slow, healing is slow, regaining stamina is slow... Even using the interface is slow thanks to bad UI design that requires multiple clicks to accomplish frequent tasks.

Even setting aside the slowness of the game, one of the many questionable design decisions in Force of Nature is its linearity. It's a survival-crafting game that isn't a sandbox. That's not necessarily bad, but the way FoN does it is simply used to make progress take arbitrarily longer. The things you can craft are not only limited by your available resources, they're also gated by levels. The initial stone mace, the first available proper weapon, guarantees that you're going to get hit about half a dozen times in every single combat. That means that each fight requires at least a minute of slowly consuming healing items and watching your health slowly refill, and lord help you if you aggro two enemies at once. (Three enemies is a guaranteed death.) And because better weapons are gated behind levels, you'll be using that initial stone mace for at least an hour, maybe more. You're compelled to use it until you're allowed access to better weapons. You'll also be naked for a long time, because clothing and armor are comparatively deep in the progression.

I've never actually gotten past the stone mace. In order to level, you have to obtain specific items and complete specific quests. The quests are nothing to write home about, but the items quickly become terrible. Specifically, to advance beyond the level where you first obtain the stone mace, you need to collect a certain number of gold coins and a certain number of copper coins.

Those coins are dropped by goblins, which are by far the least dangerous enemies on the island. So far, so good. The problem is that goblins are dramatically outnumbered by animal enemies. Animals don't drop coins, do far more damage than goblins, and love to run away before you can kill them, virtually guaranteeing that you'll get nothing for fighting them. The next problem is that there are two kinds of goblins, and only the rarer kind has a reasonable chance of dropping copper coins. In both my attempts at playing this game, I have spent well over an hour wandering the island looking for copper coins, all the while having to chew my way through unproductive fights with animals who mostly just cost healing items without any reward. And then, both times, I wound up aggroing something far too powerful (which will happen when enemies have levels that you can't see until they're already chewing on you), and finding that the game had decided to change the rules on me - instead of being able to run away until it dropped aggro, it kept chasing me for ten minutes of slow loops around a section of the island, very slowly biting down my health just barely faster than I could slowly eat healing items. So I died.

The death penalty in FoN is straightforward: you permanently lose a random selection of things from your inventory. Not that big a deal, really. Until one of the things you lose is nearly all of the copper coins you just spent over an hour beating your head against.

So yeah. With further development and reworking of certain mechanics, FoN could be quite enjoyable. It's the skeleton of a decent game. But right now, it's quite bad. Stay away.",1531403120,1531403120,False,5,0,0.575141251087188721,0,True,False,False,False,,,

=FORCE OF NATURE- aka- taking a dump= When nature calls yo!

This is one of those games I seen on steam for a long time, in my maybe pile... finally I decided to bite when the sale price was low enough... Why a maybe? It looked kinda janke from the promo video, pretty low production value. But every now n then, you buy a game like this that looks pretty janke n stanke, but then has this magical gameplay, such as empyrion. You never know where a gem can turn up!
After playing for 40+ hours, and finally beat the game I gotta say---


It's no gem, or even ""survival"", but it is still a pretty fun game.




========SLOOOOOOOOOOW MOTION=========

Indeed as expected, as I expect from all good janke games... it started very slow... REALLY SLOWLY... You move about as fast as a turtle, and your stamina drains to 0 after cutting down just a few trees... Most negative reviews seem to be about this, and that's a shame. It's still more then playable! If you stick with it, it gets a little better.
I personally like slow weak characters at the start of any game that features progression. I don't want to start out super strong with nothing to work towards. However, you never do get moving very fast unless you pave the world in roads, which you probably won't care or need to do. 

Another problem with speed is how overgrown the world is, no matter what biome you are in. You have to hack your way through the thick vegetation to get around which is fun at first, but gets old later on. You and the monsters can't just squeeze through trees and brush even though visually there might appear to be enough space... so techically all the monsters are actually trapped in the world, and you are rescuing them so you can slay them for the precious gem shard drops. 
The landscape is pretty bad too, and your char can't jump, or even slide down slopes, a slight incline can stop you from moving forward. Yep... The ugly terrain random gen ensures you will constantly find hills that impeede your movement.

Cutting down trees, and bushes is also slow, with a slow animation, and quick drain of your stamina... The player char ends up being the ultimate coffee junkie, as you will need to slam down hundreds\thousands of coffee to get through this game.

Your view distance is turok 1 level of fog... You cannot see very far, and there is no option to change this. So expect to take a bad path through zones, and have to backtrack to find a better route to where you are going.

All of that contributes to what is a pretty slow moving experience in the game.... 


====EXPLORATION====

You only go to new biomes to farm the next force of nature shard (need them all to win the game, and level up), and to get new gem chips which are also needed to level up. You might also go there for the next type of rose you'll need to mass farm later perhaps, and to find more minerals to mine. But for the most part exploration isn't that big a feature here. The world is so overgrown and open fields so rare, the exploration honestly is pretty bad. There is no special places, or ruins, or loot to find, just generic overgrown wilderness. OH LOOK A HUGE GOLEM!!>.. oh it just drops stone\1ore\gemchip?... \yawn...

There is various biomes, but it all ends up being the same experience. And the same 3-4 types of mobs that can appear in any given biome are spammed every so far in spacing from one another. It's pretty repetitive and lazy. Scorpions.... everywhere...

To even explore most biomes you have to sacrifice the GOOD ARMOR you'd like to wear, to instead have to wear tempurature resist gear, hot and cold sets.
SO WHY EVEN HAVE ARMOR FOCUSED GEAR!?
You know it's bad when they have to make a ridiculously named ""amulet of comfort"". So either you sacrifice wearing armor with good protection, or amulets with good stats.




COMBAT---

The combat is as barebones basic as you can about get, and is so janke you can even exploit a glitch. Swap melee weapons to interupt the swing animation to effectively double your dps!

Bows exist, but using metal arrows is too expensive to bother with, so most of the game you'll just use burning stone arrows. In real life-  arrows are retrievable- especially metal ones.


CRAFTING---

The game might have exploration and combat but crafting is the real heart and soul of this one. You will do a LOT of it. Sadly most of that crafting is the micromanage type.
It starts out fun but by later game you will be sick of the fact that wells fill over time to hold so little max water, only 6...
How tedious it is, to collect the 6 water, every other minute- which in this world is not very much water.

Then to collect\replant the crops which yes... fully grow in only about 2 minutes
then to collect the mushrooms that yes, fully grow in 2 minutes
water and feed the animals every 2 minutes (not required but they only make eggs\milk if you feed them)
then roses which fully grow in about 3-4
then the coal is done about every 15 minutes
the burning embers (who holds those in their backpack in real life lol?) every 30 minutes
then manage your crafting tables of other types, workbench\altar\alchemy\tailor\stove

What you get is the most busy work I've seen in a crafting game in a very long time...
Which is really fun at first... indeed the first 20 hours I had fun doing it, but this ends up being 90% of your played time in the game sadly. The game definitely needed a way to upgrade all your constructions, so a well can hold 50 water, crops should take MUUUUUCH longer to grow, but have more at harvest time, same with animals, and everything really... More automation, less tedium clicks, and just make it take longer!

nope...
All this busy work is there to hide the fact that the combat and exploration sides of the game are extremely lacking. It's the only way the game can keep you busy for long. 

You can craft an epic city, with defensive walls... but mobs only attack you if they happen to wander into them... what's the point then? Unless you build in a dangerous biome, but why would you? What benefit is there? The game doesn't give a reason to build an epic base. Just build the various craft stations and call it a day.



=====CONCLUSIONS OF JANKE=====

I liked this game far more then other crafting games like stardew, or starbound *anything named star really lol*.

The game ended up being way more fun then it deserves to be. Despite all my points against it, I had a pretty good time with a friend, even though the multiplayer is pretty badly done. You can't go far from each other, AND the hideous long loading times you have to deal with when travelling about 300 meters in any direction. See? I can't help it, so much is wrong here... But it was still a pretty good time! It was fun to live and work in a world together and achieve every new structure and level up. Even bad crafting survival games often end up fun. A testement to this genre being better then most others imo. 



===EARLY ACCESS===
The engine is so bad I don't expect the dev can work miracles with this game, and I do not expect it to grow much with time. He will probably just add a few more biomes of the same repeating gameplay, a new craft station or 2, and call it a day. It's not like he can completely revamp the graphics, ai, and other broad systems... doing so would pretty much call for just starting over and making FORCE OF NATURE 2: FORCIER!

Each world as far as I can tell, is like Minecraft, it generates a new randomated world for each new game started, placing different things in different places different spaces away from the player.  Great, I thught, unpredictability and different world each time could be interesting exploration wise.  

However...

If you think this is going to be like minecraft, think again.  

So you start the game stranded on a beach with nothing as a male with no clothes except a pair of trousers.  You have to gather materials to build things.  The minute you start gathering, your stamina goes down and regenerates slowly, so you're in a constant bind to find food.  You unlock certain crafting stations, great...but some things take a minute to make one food ingredient  (like minecraft's furnaces).  If you have to make a food item with several ingredients this is painfully slow as guess what?  They CAP how many things you can have at once.  I'm level 8, I can two have two food stations.  I need Butter and and Flour...they take AGES to craft.  It takes me an hour to get enough of the two ingredients I need to make one thing that won't get me very far either.

Your levels are capped until you pass certain requiremnts and quests like ""find a force of nature"", an element that can be at one end of the bloody map too far to get to.  You spend three hours getting enough materials and food together to make the journey a quarter of the way which takes maybe half an hour to forty five mins depending (as you'll spend more time trying to find a way through badly designed terrain or cutting your way through forest which are blocking the path).  You can spend nights and nights just getting half the way to one level.  You do less hunting,exploring and gathering resources outside of your base.  What do you spend 95% of the time doing?  FARMING, because you need those farm resources to crafft the food to survive the wilderness.  Unfortunately three hours of constant crafting can get you about half an hour's worth of adventuring, which is a pain in the bloody backside.  Everything hits much harder than you do.  You're level 8, a bear is level 3, bear is wrecking you in three or four hits you're nearly half dead.  Foxes and boars constantly attack you, and OH FUN, they effing run away when their health gets low and they run WAY faster than you and the bow and arrow are rubbish (they can't fire up hill for example)  so you can't even kill them.  You get no experience for the trouble either.

I think the worst part is really that they cap everything.  You need tons of water to feed the animals AND to water crops you need - you need tons of crops to make one small food item, but you can only have a few wells so it's a case of feed animals, or water crops, make food and survive past the farm.  You can't do both most of the time.  Even with three wells, it's particularly hard when a cow takes two buckets of water a time but your farm takes one bucket per seed - you get three wells at lvl 8, so that's 12 buckets.  You have six chickens that ned a bucket each, two cows that need two each, etc...they make it far too hard to truly feel free and enjoy the farm or building anything,   You have to get higher up in level to unlock the right to build another item or farm, etc, which just really stunts being able to freely build and have fun.  I've played nearly 30 hurs, my character is level 8 and can't get any further because the map is so poorly designed, rivers i can't cross, hills that can't be climbed or descended, it's just bad design entirely.

If you want a game that you'll spend weeks grinding in a farm for a couple of hours of adventuring, go for it.  If you want a game that you do a lot of other things beside farming, get Conan or Ark.

TLDR:
The early game's building and crafting is fun and engaging
The combat is very mediocre
The end game turns combat into a frusturating grind.
The game could benefit from way more building options, including more cosmetic options. 
[spoiler] The payoff for all the work you put into the Force of Nature is quite disapointing.[/spoiler]

I liked the building at first. You start off with basic tools, basic huts etc. The progression feels good at the start. I was fine with the limited amount you could build at the start because there was the expectation that the cool stuff would be unlocked the end. However the end game just does not reward you with enough payoff in the customization you can unlock. 

As for the base functionality, I like that you can queue up crafting in your base at every workstation. 

The focus on the game is the Force of Nature. As such, you will be after Force of Nature Shards for the majority of the game. This will force you into the wilderness, where you will be fighting in a combat system that gets stale quickly. It essentially consists of spamming the attack button and your food hotkey to heal. After the first two areas, the combat for me felt like a chore to get to what I really wanted to do: build. 

And then there was the Force of Nature itself.
[spoiler] For all of the work and grinding it takes to construct this artifact, I would expect it to do something cool.
It took:
7 Forces of nature 
4500-4000 Roses
16,000-18,000 Water for each of the roses 
2250 Sand
4500 Glowing Embers (1500 sticks)
225 Coins
930 logs

And yet there was zero payoff. It did not do anything cool like I would expect. You can place it if you want. It looks alright. But otherwise it's only interaction is to be consumed to level you from level 12 to level 13. I was fully disapointed.
[/spoiler]

Perhaps I was expecting too much out of the game. However the game could have done better in many areas. The game is fun for what it is. I suggest playing in creative mode to bypass the tedium and get straight into the game's limited strength: the base building. 
If base building was added to the end game, Force of Nature would have been a much more satisfying game. It is a shame because in my opinion, the base interactions was it's strongest point. 

I had fun with the game. And it was SO close to being a more satisfying game. But it just misses the mark on so many points, and this saddens me. 

It's fun enough for something to do if you buy it during a sale, but in my opinion there are much better games for both the combat and the building.",1530916423,1530916644,False,2,0,0.531494021415710449,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Combat is forced, boring and clunky. Early on there is no way to stop a running enemy until the bad path finding does it for you. Not enjoyable. 

-Game doesn't like to alt-tab. Every graphic change requires a relaunch. Exit from main menu likes to crash. 


I liked the lootables laying everywhere. Graphics were ok. General concept needs work, but overall it was a good start. Maybe my map gen just sucked, but all the metals I needed were hard to find making everything stupid boring.

¿recomienzo este juego? solo a cierto perfil, si eres de esos que disfrutan con la exploracion de supervivencia, si eres de aquellos que aman la construccion primitiva y que buscan ese seudo-realismo: ES TU JUEGO.

Graficamente no es perfecto pero se juega fluido que da gusto, tiene sus parones MUY puntuales pero no es nada que dañe o merme la experiencia.

El combate es; mediocre, es tosco y poco practico aunque es a doc, agradececia que a posterior añadieran, bastones, lanzas, ballestas y javalinas le daria al juego un aire mas primitivo. El uso del arco esta bien me falta profundisar su uso para decir si esta bien o no pero desde ya comento que puede ser perfeccionado. Solo que si agregan el chanse de recuperar municion o partes de este se llevaria el 10.

Los recursos, hay que entender en que si hay cuevas en todos lados como bien pasa en Minecraft generaria un uso de recursos enorme, Donde si brilla la ausencia es en que los recursos como manzanas, cocos, platanos, ramas, troncos o hojas de palmera; NO SON RENOVABLES, si la mecanica de juego fuera lenta aceptaria ese hecho pero hay recursos que son acelerados como la comida asi que este factor puede ayudar el incorporar la forma de renovar recursos como arboles, arbustos y que elementos como las palmeras o manzanos puedan regenerar frutas o recursos adicionales siendo el manzano un elemento fundamental en unas mecanicas.

La exploracion es comoda no le veo mayores problemas o defectos, el uso de portales es muy a acertado facilitado el traslado.

Mis mayores quejas serian:
-el uso de adoquines da mucha velocidad de movimiento si la reducen sentaria mucho mejor.
-la obtencion de oro es a mediano plazo FACIL, es saber grindear y tendras mucho oro. Puede evitarse reduciendo el drop de este y añadiendo recursos como puede ser pepitas de hierro, cuero, carne, cuerda o semillas del bioma

donde pueden mejorar:
-añadir bastones, lanzas, javalinas, ballestas y ondas al arsenal.
-en las armas de municion esta pueda recuperarse o parte de estas en un chanse.
-funciones a las capturas como puede ser que las cabras puedan transportar algunos elementos o los goblins que atrapas sean un burrito de carga.
-poderle añadir funciones al goblin como puede ser recojer agua, plantar puede dar mucho juego pero lo dejo mas como una fantacia que como un elemento que pueda ser mejorado.

Sin mas que a la aventura que este juego es MUY bueno que me tiene enviciado y mi mas grande felicitaciones a los desarrolladores por esta obra mi mas grande satisfaccion con este titulo.",1530807536,1530807536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First you will notice a majority of the reviews say the game is slow. The game isnt slow, the game feels slow because it is poorly designed. Force of nature uses a leveling system which is implimented to be more of a tutorial of sorts in which content is locked behind levels. This would be fine if you didnt have to make literally every new unlocked item in a level to progress to the next level. This makes the game feel boring because there is no free choice, you feel like you are just checking off boxes on a never ending list. It takes far too long to get to the good part of the game to make the game worth purchasing and even if you hit the good part you feel no pride because you got to that point because the game forced you to that point through a disgustingly poorly designed leveling system.

The game plays a lot like an early access/early beta game unfortunately (and indeed, I've played some early access titles that were significantly smoother than this one). The UI and controls are very clunky and a lot of the gameplay just isn't as smooth/optimal as it could be.
However the incredible time sinks and grindy feeling just wore me down. Waiting 20+ real minutes between doing things in the game, just waiting for your stamina to regen was frustrating. Especially when that full stamina bar, only let you chop down 2-3 trees which might give you enough logs to make enough coal, to make 2-3 bars of metal to make 1 item which is a component then for something else. 
Then there's the fact that upon death you lose literally hours and hours of time worth of items that you made (even just simple food takes an incredible amount of time to make in this game) and how much you lose goes up with each death. Oh, by the way there's no way to tell a mobs level before it attacks you either, so death isn't uncommon. 

So for those TLDR: It's a very pretty game, that would have had a lot of promise, but it just feels like an abandoned early access title that was never finished. Not even worth the sale price for the frustration.",1530022793,1530022793,False,19,2,0.638765931129455566,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I bought the game for the world exploration and to mess around in the sandbox, which in this game just isn't my cup of tea. The biggest draw away for me though is the two button system for collecting. I just can't get used to it and so probably won't get far in the game.

Is the first time i request a refund of my money.

The game controls are awful. 

If you want to harvest something you have 2 choices, press the Q key and click the item you want to harvest or press the L.Alt key. But if you want to loot something, you need to press the L.Ctrl key or press Q and click.

To interract with things, you need to press the E key.

That makes it impossible to loot around and harvest things because you need to press 3 diferent keys to do things that you can do with just 1 key in any other survival game. Why couldnt they just make the E key do the 3 things? Harvest, interract and loot.  You can change the controls because wen you try to change it, you get a message that says ""That key is already in use"" and you cant set the E key for the 3 actions. 

That was the stronger reason for me to give up on the game. Maybe for others thats not a good reason, but i hope this helps other people in the future to choose if they are up for that or not.

I decided to play something new last night instead of letting my depression win, go to bed, all that good stuff.

All in all, I don’t think this is a bad game, per se, but I don’t think it’s a great one either. I would say it was a nice change of pace, playing a different game in a genre that I sort of enjoy, and it certainly gave me what I had been needing at the time. But while I am rating this a positive experience, I think it is only necessary to provide why this wasn’t the best experience in the hopes of giving your team necessary feedback for your game.

When I first started the game up, it automatically opened the player menu for me so that it could give me my first quests. This was all well and good; it gave me the chance to hover my mouse over things and see what hotkey opens what, and I found that I could move my camera by holding space (on accident). I could pick stuff up off the ground, and walk. I had no reason to really play without my inventory open, so I was organizing as I went along gathering resources. This only became a problem when I got my first knife. The instructions provided said to place it in a number slot to use it, which I did, but found I could not use it for some reason. I wasn’t entirely sure what the system for using tools was as it was my first tool, so I tried hitting 1. Nothing happened. Tried left clicking. Nothing happened. Right click? Still nothing. I spent about five minutes trying to get close enough to things to find out if I needed to be near something, smashing my face into trees and bushes, desperately attempting to cut everything in my path. All was for naught. Finally, I decided to close out the game and come back in, since sometimes my computer is the problem and that tends to fix things. Whoop-tee-doo, I could suddenly use my knife! Then I re-opened the player menu to organize things, briefly thought the game broke again, and then realized what the problem was. It was not my computer, it was the player inventory that I could do everything but use tools in apparently. I felt like such a fool. Granted, most players probably don’t play with their inventories open, but I still feel like this situation would’ve been avoided had the game told me that.
After that bout of confusion, I then proceeded to go back to relatively enjoying the game. I had a nice little campsite that was quite literally already closed off from the rest of the world, so I had nothing to attack me too early into the game. I wasn’t even 100% sure there were monsters at all yet, but I had a big pile of rocks and lots of trees surrounding my camp. I honestly couldn’t even see far enough to see if monsters existed since the game exists in permanent, apparently un-changeable fog. I found the ocean to be rather pretty with the overall game scenery to be lacking, but as it’s an indie game it could have been worse, and it actually looks pretty decent.

Then came the quest to kill goblins. After wasting a lot of resources to clear the brush, axing my way through trees, bushes, and sunflowers, I finally created a path. My introduction to the combat system was not pleasantly smooth, although I did kill my first goblin just fine. I had just hopped into a Discord call as I was discovering this part of the game and my language about it was pretty foul. Needless to say, I didn’t enjoy it. It felt like a shot in the foot after enjoying the gathering mechanics well enough and left me feeling quite sour. Monsters spotting you seems slightly random. I was up on a cliff mining stone and a bear noticed me from below, ran all the way around, and started beating me up. I felt glorious in managing to kill the bear, but I was almost dead and the ratio of healing items to how much you get hurt just is not enough. I also got spotted by a goblin that wasn’t facing me on that same sprint for resources out of my camp, which was unfair and ultimately ended in my untimely demise (and losing half of the resources I left my camp for).
Even worse are the Goddamn animals. Bears, foxes, and boars give literally no fucks in hell about each other. You can be attempting to run from any one of those and another will just run up and join the assault. And by attempt I mean, you really can’t outrun them. You really. Really. Can’t. Your player just isn’t fast enough, because they randomly pick up speed, don’t really seem to have a cut off point of just how far they’ll chase you, and your hope of losing them lies in escaping through a spot just barely wide enough for the player to fit through and hoping the animals get stuck. If you can get out of their line of sight after doing that, you are home free. But it’s still just so unnecessary. You don’t want to make unsurvivable situations for low level players. Yes, you want to make a challenge so the game doesn’t get boring, but if an experience isn’t enjoyable then it’s just not enjoyable. The predatory animals really need to be updated. Maybe make it so foxes will run away if Goblins, bears, or boars start charging at the player. Boars and bears fight each other. Something. A system where players can get crafty to survive encounters rather then being unable to escape death is much more enjoyable.

And last but not least, please explain how to use tools and weapons more thoroughly. I have wasted over thirty nets trying to catch and tame one animal. The net explains what it can catch, but not how to use it, leading to so many of them just being plain old wasted. I even googled how to do it, because the game explained nothing. It did not even give tips on how to catch something. And I’m still struggling! Trying to tame things so far has been a complete waste of time and I am required to do it just to level up enough to be able to craft a bed. And I need the bed so I stop wasting the resources I really don’t have! Please don’t get me wrong, to an extent the “figure things out yourself” method is more fun than games that baby you through everything. But there’s a point where you’re not explaining enough and this is most certainly it.

Despite all my qualms, though, I do like the game. I enjoy that it gives us the basics and then encourages us to do things on our own rather then step-by-stepping each mission. However, I think it takes not explaining things too far, and I feel like the ability to cook food from the get-go would really help making the time it takes to finally create a bed much more worth it, much less grueling. Maybe allow us to make a starter bed? An elevated bow of palm leaves roped to a stick like a makeshift tent or a handful of palm leaves tied together and plopped on the ground. All in all, it’s a nice game for what it is and I really do look forward to seeing how this game may grow over time.

I appreciate all the hard work your team has been putting in to make this and look forward to roping a friend into playing multiplayer with me sometime. Thank you for making Force of Nature.",1525720762,1525720762,True,8,1,0.590062081813812256,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2.按键操作机制非常非主流，改了键位也要重新习惯，收货跟拾取就不能用同一个键么，打开设施面板也要按两个键：锁定视角调出名字+鼠标点击，E键在箱子里是快速储存在工作台是打开合成表在生产设施又变成收货，操作体验极差。

While its pretty much like the other where to go gather resources and build up your base and farm and whatnot it has some slight differences i enjoy. The main difference is that everything is locked behind your character level and the character level increased after you complete the mandatory quests. I really enjoy this aspect of it because it keeps the game interest. It makes t so you cant just sit there and farm resources and in fives hour have the best gear. You have to do the quest then your able to level which cost something of its own. Then you unlock new things which help you complete the next set of quests and so on.

Gather water.
Plant/Gather coffee beans.
Gather water
Make Coffee.

Gather water.
Plant/gather wheat.
Feed animals to get needed eggs/wool. (which also requires water to feed the animals and water is VERY slow to come by)

Turn wheat into flour.

I HIGHLY recommend farming for wool for your equipment every other tier. You will spend way too many hours gathering wheat and wool. Kiting monsters with arrows saves you from taking too many hits once they are in range, so you don't need to rely on having the best armor at all times even if solo.

My biggest complaint is that the wells that generate water have a max capacity of 6 which is way too low.

When i saw the intro video i bought the game straight away and it turned out to be a good thing to do and because i can.
And even before i actually start writting a review on this i will state that there is NO WAY i would ever ask for refund on this game, just to clarify that and here is the reason why. (Also this is a review on Creative mode of the game that i play right now, i want to try everything before starting survival and getting them achievements rolling in).

1. Graphics are good.
2. Controls are easy, in fact they are laid out the same way as you would play an fps game, 
3. Combat system is a bit crappy but tolerable, as long as you dont give the enemy a chance to run away.
4. crafting system is actually better than the one you have in games like minecraft. 
5. A VERY GRINDY GAME, thats right...there is no easy way in this game. Either its leveling up or building a mill, the items required are sometimes hard to come by. (Actually not, mill and brick house are easy to build, as long as you have supplies laying around in your chests. 
6. As mentioned above leveling is quite tricky, for example, to reach level 9 you need 10 honey and 15 onyx chips. At first you might think *ah man, thats BS, i will never get it* but there is actually a trick on how to bypass this if you have correct materials, altar and alchemical lab built....plus a dozen of roses of any colour.
7. The hardest in this game has to be the gold ingots. The thing is that its tough and i mean VERY TOUGH to get your hands on gold coins, which are dropped by certain monsters in different areas. Goblins drop most of the time copper coins but sometimes 1-3 gold coins as well. You might feel that its not fair to kill 10 goblins and only 2 of them dropped 2 gold coins each, but then again there is always another way. Go ahead and enter desert map, kill off a couple of devils, because they only drop gold coins not copper anymore, and as a bonus they tend to drop topaz chips. 
8. There is an alternative for getting gem chips, if you happen to have yellow or white roses laying around somewhere, get them in seedbeds and constantly grow them, build mill and get that elixir rolling in, because as soon as you got that and hundreds of stacks of roses, there should be no problem with chips anymore.
9. Building something in this game is actually as easy as making coffee....for experienced players there should be no problem gathering certain resources and building stuff, but seems to me other people think otherwise.

Overall this game has a bright future and i absolutely love it. Keep up the good work devs, dont forget to add more stuff to the game in near future. Say an enchantment table would be nice, to enchant armor or weapons using gems or chips.

All the haters out there can piss their pants trying to get their refund on 2 hours play time, seriously....2-3 hours and you already writting a negative review. How about spending more time on the game? You will like it eventually...

The payoff for the amount of work you have to do is non existant.

When you finally reach the last level, if you ever keep playing long enough, the amount of work involved is overwhelming and the developers created the perfect storm to ensure your frustration and that you absolutely hate this game before it's over. To reach level ""13"" where there's no incentive as far as new upgrades, you need to create 5 of each gem, which means you need to dig 2250 sand blocks to create 450 glass bars then make 450 test tubes, you need to fill the test tubes with 10 flowers each for a total of 4500 flowers to make the elixIirs, the developers put a cap of 6 wells so you have to wait minutes for them to fill up with 6 water each that's 36 water every 3-4 minutes. To make 5 flowers takes 16 water so the most you can make is around 2 per 3-4 minutes unless you stalkpile water which takes time in itself, then you have to wait 3-4 minutes for them to grow................ were talking hours upon hours, then wait for the elixirs to become chips then wait for the chips to become gems..........

Yes, it's true that the pace is a bit slower than many games.
And of course it would get boring if you start to craft something and then stand around to look at the progress bar.
I have found that I always have plenty of things to do, and by the time they are done so is the crafting.
To me this is relaxing, and a good contrast to stressful RTS or FPS games.

The main skill in this game, in my opinion, is to be able to aggro one enemy at a time. The further you get in the game the more important this gets. This could take a bit of patience in some circumstances, as you might have to wait for enemies to wander apart. But it's also quite fun to circle an area and look for opportunities to pull an enemy away from the bunch.

Of course there are things that could be improved, getting a little bit of story into the game would be one thing. But considering the low price, and the fact that this is a one man show I must say this game is remarkably good. With the right mindset you will have a lot of fun.

Easy to play and I didn't encounter any bugs.

I was a little bummed on the limitations. for example you could only build a certain amount of huts based on your level.
I found that you definitely do not want to be a packrate in this game. carry what you need and store what you feel you may need.  You are even limited to a certain amount of storage boxes based on your level.  (why??)
I recommend getting a good weapon early on in the game so you can explore farther without needing to run back to base and heal.
Game Mechanics are a little clunky in the movement, but it makes up for it with crafting dynamics in my opinion.

8€ pour choper un cancer c'est un peu chère à mon gout. 

Tout d'abord parlons du multijoueur qui est totalement flinguer.
Un allié meurt, tout le monde meurt.

Donc quand vous aurez fini de souffrir après des heures de tuerie visuel, 75% de l'équipe l'aura fais juste pour le fun.
Sois dis en passans, le fun est mort après le lvl2, quand tu commence a comprendre a quel point tu va devoir refouler tes pulsion suicidaire.
Je sais pas pour le solo, mais a plusieurs quand tu passe presque 2h uniquement en craft pour t'équiper et ainsi pouvoir explorer une zone froide, ou chaude, les envie de meurtre se font omniprésente.

Le seul point positif c'est la musique.
A mon avis tout le budget a du y passer et c'est pour sa que le reste est vide.
Le temps de jeu se comble par l'attente et uniquement l'attente du repop de monstre et le craft d'objet.
Après l'attente c'est uniquement du bourrinage de débile.

Les gnome que l'on capture sont tellement bête qu'ils attaquent pas les ennemi.

- excellent challange w/o being too easy  or too hard

- employs a fetch/gather resource based system that is balanced well (not too grindy, not just given either. Items must be earned and it feels very rewarding)
- beautifl envrionment that does not at all feel bland or repetitive. Very fun to explore
- many resources such as ores are limited in their quanitity and location. Must be wise about how you spend resources
- many decorations make crafting and personalizing your ""base"" very fun and unique
- environmental sounds are fantastic and make sense based on the types of critters near you
- excellent leveling system and items to craft to suit your play style
- excellent tutorial and menu system
- price to get this EA game is outstanding

Cons:
- for some folks - they may prefer a soundtrack vs envrinmental sounds 
- the combat is clunky and awkward but nevertheless it is functional
- no controller support as of the time of this writing
- obviously the game is in EA, neverhteless could use more items to craft and npc merchants or quests
- could use some recurring quest lines to keep things interesting for endgame (ex go fetch, go kill, defend the base, protect an ally, escourt an ally etc)

Worth it for the price ($7.99 USD as I type this)

I tried really hard to like this game, and made sure to give it a solid 8 hours of focused gameplay over a period of about a week. The videos on the store page show a rather dynamic camera movement which I could not recreate and it left me struggling to be able to see some of the world immediately around my character and made combat a bit cumbersome. There is also not much of a tutorial or guide available in-game.  What is there is actually really nice, but I found myself having to occassionally pause everything and sit back trying to figure out how to do something.  

On the positive side, I've run this on multiple computers of varying abilities and had no problems crop up.  The world is beautifully generated, and I felt a bit drawn in to wondering what the story behind the world was. (I didn't find any real storyline, but I don't feel that that takes away from this game).  Most of the game makes sense right from the top if you've played similar games before.

Ultimately this is the type of game I play when I want something a little less intense and can afford to just relax without feeling like I need to rush to get things done in-game.

I have reached level 7 and currently progressing very slowly towards level 8.

I say very slowly, but the devs have made it such a struggle to progress quickly.  While this could be a good thing they appear to have done it purely to extended your gameplay.  I see no other reason.

It's grindy, very grindy.  You farm to make something, using all your resources, to discover you now need to make something else, which requires some resources you have just used up plus others you have to grind away the hours for.  I personally don't mind grindy games, I actually quite enjoy it, but this game does really push me to my absolute limit.

With each level you have a number of objectives to complete, which can be tricky on it's own, but you also have to pay to move to the next level.  This payment is in gold/copper/resources or anything else they choose.  This is my 1st issue with the game.  There is no reason at all to justify this 'payment' other than to make you farm/grind for much longer than is necessary.  The game very quickly switches focus from survival and exploring to all about levelling-up.

When I reached level 6 and seeing the new stuff I could make, I did then see that more exploration would be possible.  The objectives were straightforward, albeit grindy, but the thing that made me scream out in pain was the payment of 5 gold bars (75 gold coins), plus some other stuff.  You only get coins from killing goblins, and they drop either gold but mostly copper coins, meaning I needed to kill a shed load to reach the next level, only to have them taken away from me when I did.  Again, the 'payment' system is unforgiving and unforgivable.

Combat!!  It's not really combat, more just hitting out until your enemy is dead.  I eventually found the best thing to do is to walk hit whilst walking backwards to try to avoid enemy hits.  If you attack one, every enemy around you will also attack.  If you get outnumbered, you're as good as dead, unless it's goblins as they are fairly easy.  You can't turn and run, because everything runs faster than you - I found this out when attacked by 2 boars - I ran butt they continued to attack me, and a fox joined in for the gits and shiggles.  No way to defined yourself.  This is the second issue with the game.

There are other niggles and dislikes, but the above 2 points really make the game frustrating and unenjoyable to play.  I bought the game at 50% off, and while it's very good for the value I believe the price should be ignored when reviewing a game.  I can't recommend the game.  If they sort it out by removing the level payments and improving the combat, I'll give it a thumbs up :)",1524000270,1524000965,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I’m level 9 and I still think this is a very slow game…just to gather things…sloooowwww 
chopping wood even with the iron axe is still slow. I hope you make them better so you can feel a different. 
The quests I like a lot except the gather things to level up. a little different quests would be nice, its alot of build this make that.  Why gather tings to level up? Make more “you must do this before you can lv up” quests or an xp bar. I just skipped a lot of enemies just by chopping through the woods avoiding enemies and strait to the stone thing just to save health food and stamina for the gathering of gems (lv 8 to 9). 
And it would be nice if you can play with others trough internet….I think that’s is a must nowadays to have with this kind of game. 

I hoped to see like a goblin house or something, goblinchests? The game feels abit stiff and lonely...maybe some random npc to save or intreact with?

缺点：添加进制作时间应该纯粹是为了杀玩家时间，强行拖游戏时间，收集要素太过繁多和冗长，。

本来之前就有所耳闻，手感跟SHI一样，我想习惯一下应该还行，

(Keep in mind, this is based off of the questing mode, not creative).

Pros:
- I really like that there are quests.
- The graphics are nice. 
- It's harder than minecraft.
- Co-op is easy! I started a world and my husband was easily able to join me in a world I had started in single player.

Cons:
- You cannot move forward without completing the quests, you cannot level up and crafting is unavailable (besides the basics) until you level up (which in some way I do like, but some items would be nice earlier than when they are available to you).
- Combat isn't the best. You basically click until the enemy is dead or you're dead.
- It's a grinder. While, my favorite games are survival, open world, crafting games, this game takes a little more time than a lot of other games. Grinding seems necessary in these types of games but it's a little more than my, personal, liking.
- Crafting time, some items take an excessive amount of time, it seems. I don't mind that crafting takes time, but there were a few times I was just watching for a while because I was waiting for things to complete.
- For me, I want to be able to be efficient and by this I mean I want to be able to gather, build, or explore, while waiting for something to craft or build. Because of the points I made above, it felt like I was only focusing on one task at a time. I would gather one item, then another until I had everything for a crafting item or to complete a quest. I couldn't really deviate from the quests because in order to move forward you had to complete them.


So, I guess this game easily lost my interest. As you can see, I don't have very many hours in, I really wanted to like the game and I did enjoy it, but not enough for me to put more time in (it felt like work). Like someone else said, I wish there was a neutral option because I know this game could be enjoyable for people who don't mind the things I mentioned above, but if you're like me and you like seeing progress in a timely manner, it probably won't do it for you.",1522962518,1522962518,False,19,1,0.720293223857879639,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 ¿porque dicen es un juego lento?:
-las construcciones necesitan muchos recursos, algunos hay que craftearlos y estos pueden tardar ""mucho"" en crearse.

Ce jeu n'est pas du bashing !! tu dois évaluer tes chances et devoir kitter les mobs un par un si possible !!
La gestion de ton camp est de surtout créer des labyrinthes de sortie afin qu'aucune bestioles de l'exterieur ne puisse y entrer.et mettre des lampes portables pour reperer les coins les plus surs !façon Petit poucet ! ^^
tous les mobs que tu as éliminés ne respawn que lorsque tu quittes le jeu DONC Dès que tu as la quête de recherche du premier fragment et donc les portails de téléportation;
Tu dois prendre le temps de faire ton parcours pour poser ton portail le plus près possible du lieu , ne pas hésiter à contourner et ca prend un temps fou!! donc une foutue patience est de mise !
je n'ai mis que 7 portails en mode HC.
L'interface n'est pas vraiment tip top mais tu peux configurer les touches ..heureusement
Finalement pour gagner tu dois soit continuer a farmer des mobs voir memes des hard pour chopper hasardement des fragments de pierres précieuses.
Soit et c'est la l'astuce ultime et la beauté du  jeu !! faire pousser des roses !!!!
Ce n'est pas un jeu pour kikitoutdur car tu dois gerer ton equipement pour etre optimum selon les climats que tu traverses et la moindre erreur peut etre fatale!
La première partie t'apprend les règles et la découverte du jeu , Hélas tu dois refaire celle ci en mode hardcore sinon le succès n'est pas validé..Confirmation après réception d'un mail des Dev.
Le seul truc négatif pour ma part est l'alchimie qui intervient quasiment trop tard et donc inutile quand tu connais tes possibilités. ca aurait pu etre un must mais au début..

This game is so time consuming and the rewards are not that great. It would be nice if you could plant the trees and they would grow back. I have been through every map and I have got almost all the Stone.
It would be nice if the Stone came back like from a earth quake or some FORCE OF NATURE.
As you play you see that all the monsters re-spawn and in bigger numbers as you level up.
The end reward for the game is by far the worst I have ever seen in a video game.
But if you have NOTHING to do in your life then this game will keep you busy right up to the end. 
I hate how the things you fight just run away I did find away around this and it works every time because you can not chase them down. The trick is to know how much your main weapon will do with one swing. then hit the bad guy with a hit from the pick or the axe then switch to the main weapon and one hit kill. 
Most people say you get what you pay for and that is very much so for this game.
It most defiantly needs some updates that will make it a better game.
I do recommend this game because it is fun to play
I have to say playing the game 4 times at over 100 hrs of game play each game has severely retarded my life. This word just means slow and everything you have to do in the game is slower than a heard of turtles. I have found that playing the game in the Sandbox mode with no restrictions has it's rewards. Like in the quest part of the game you get only one ally in the sandbox mode you can have as many as you want.
However I have not been able to trap anything but Goblins for alleys.
but you get 20 of them and nothing will last very long LOL.
It would be nice if there was more gold and more use for gold in the game
I would like to see you to be able to go to the lake and pan for gold and then melt it into bars. If they ever get an expansion out for this game it would need to have about 10 more levels. Because topping out at level 13 and having to kill 22ed level bad guys
is really hard. some golden arrows would be nice.
You really don't need to cheat in this game just use the bushes and trees to your advantage if you build stuff the monster will hack on it and you just hit him with the arrow. the monsters hate your buildings and will do anything to kill it. Use this to time to kill them OR run. 
In the sandbox mode I have about 18 of every animal and 30 wells it makes the game very easy. well hope this helps all of you see yea",1521364854,1523189533,True,24,13,0.674014806747436523,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pretty easy to get yourself pretty involved in it. What I learnt is that certain areas are better for certain resources than others. Like the winter deadland is best for sticks.

The only thing that really annoyed me was the fact that if you saved and exited, you wouldn't load back to where you were before you exited. You have a specific save point, which would either be where you started, or a portal you set. I have used this to my advantage (agroed like 3 bears, 3 goblins, several boars and foxes - long story), so I just exited and viola! I am back at camp. But when you are trying to streamline to a ""Force of Nature"" shard and you run out of time and you don't want to plop a portal down yet, it can be such a pain. 

I also like to pick on location with a neutral temp (so I can wear anything there without issues) and just build everything there. All my portals are placed right where I destroy and collect the ""Force of Nature"" shard. I just use those portals to get to different biomes for resources faster and to have a headstart toward the next shard.

I can handle the grinding of gathering materials, making stuff, repetitive, boring combat.  I simply CANNOT tolerate losing a ton of stuff every time you die.  Trust me on this one.  if it irritates you to lose items on death, then this game will royally piss you off.  I am talking about losing hours worth of effort that it took to gather items and craft them and such.

Do not buy this game if that bothers you.  It is VERY easy to die.  All it takes is one of your tamed animals that you didn't manage to get to follow you back to your safe area to get attacked, and collect a big train, and then run close to you, and you are screwed.  You drop hundreds of items.

Yes, you can just run around with minimal resources in your pack, but at some point, you're going to need to carry stuff such as portal materials.  Dying and losing it sucks.  They need to let a corpse drop so you can go retrieve it.  Still a risk involved, but not so punishing as to make the game unfun.

tldr: If you have a NetFlix account, then you can find some joy in a game where stamina regen is terrible.  Just alt tab out and watch some flix, and come back and do 2 more fights, then rinse repeat. :p

If you feel like you can tolerate the ""features"" of the game I document below, then buy it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't.

[u]Update 1:[/u]

Run speed is a bit slow.  Glad there is fast travel, but even quick travel is a joke.  You cannot put portals too close to each other, so you still end up slooooow jogging a lot.  I can't imagine how bad it would be if you have to slow foot it all over the place every single time.

[u]Update 2:[/u]

Stamina regen is a bad joke.  I spend 90% of my time waiting on it.  Even eating food like bananas doesn't help that much.  This is a very negative aspect of this game, and I can see it causing me to stop playing.

Update -> To be fair, coffee helps with this, but you gotta grind up the materials to keep stocked up on coffee.  Early game is brutal, but the grind is always there.

[u]Tip 1:[/u]

[spoiler]Fight animals that flee near thick vegetation.  They'll often get stuck in the vegetation so you can catch them and finish them off.  I did that to two foxes so far.  VERY satisfying.[/spoiler]

[u]Tip 2:[/u]

[spoiler]Running into the middle of vegetation will sometimes make it so animals do not follow.  It's saved me a few times.[/spoiler]

[u]You gotta be kidding me #1:[/u]

1 strawberry = 7 hp in 10 seconds
1 strrawberry juice which requires 2 strawberries is 12 hp in 10 seconds.

You're better off eating two strawberries unless you are in a tough fight and the few extra hp might help.

[u]You gotta be kidding me #2:[/u]

The well can only hold 6 water at a time.  Yes, that's right boys and girls, you have to micromanage the collection of water.  Everything in the game is a grind.  I'm pretty much ok with that, but having to micromanage gathering water out of the well?  Nah, that's not cool.

[u]You gotta be kidding me #3:[/u]

You drop a crap ton of stuff EVERY death.  I had 13 cooked meat.  Lost 7 of them and literally about 30 other items in my inventory.  I should have read up more on this game.  Never would have bought it.  Death penalty is too severe considering how easy it is to die early on.

[u]You gotta be kidding me #4:[/u]

The sheer volume of materials needed to do anything in the game is pretty much over the top.  15 gold coins to get one gold ingot... [spoiler]It takes killing a lot of goblins to get 15 gold coins.[/spoiler]

[u]You gotta be kidding me #5:[/u]

Here is a good example of how ridiculous crafting is.

To make leather gloves, you need 14 pelts and 10 ropes with 2 burlap.  14 pelts shuld be enough to make 14 pairs of gloves.  You could hang 10 people with 10 ropes at the same time.  Utterly ridiculous.

Suggestions:

1-Increase movement speed.  An 80 year old man can move faster than my avatar.

2-Make it so when you die, you have a chance to recover your stuff.  Put a timer on it, but if you get back in time, you can get your stuff back.

3-Lower the resource requirements for things like armor and weapons.  14 hides for a pair of gloves is frankly stupid.

4-I spend way too much time alt tabbed watching netflx or surfing the web.  A game should not be so tedious as to make you feel like you have to to do this to prevent boredom.",1520274716,1520720058,False,3,0,0.495364248752593994,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I got this on sale for 50% off, so for me this feels like a real bargain. If you've got the survival/builder itch, give this a try. It *is* a slower paced game however, so keep that in mind.
 
Update: This game has gotten a little hate lately, so I want to give my 2 cents on a couple points: 

1: Chunkiness: I despise clunkers, like, I cannot play them for very long before getting disgusted and consider them bad games. This game is not what I'd call clunky. It's no Japanese fighter, sure, but if you compare it to say, Mass Effect 4 (or even a Bethesda game), it ain't got nothin' on that clunk. 
2: Graphics, honestly, despite the basic graphics, it still offers a lot of beauty. Flowery forests, sunset beaches, etc. I really enjoy the scenery in the game.
3: Content/play time: I have 51 h ours in this game, between 2 worlds I started. There is *plenty* to do, collect, and build for a very long time. That being said, yes, I really would have really loved to see some updates and new content, but you'll get your money's worth out of this. 

Pros: 
-Fun mix of a little combat, farming, building, crafting and exploration. 
-Despite the basic graphics, the game can still be very pretty

Cons: 
-Spacing/spawning of enemies can be a bit silly at times. You can be running around with no monsters in sight and all the sudden you come across 3 bears, 2 goblins and a boar all at once and you don't have a chance of fighting them. 
-I have to restart the game every 30 minutes because at about that time, it starts lagging big time, like, Kenshi bad lagging. But once I restart the game, it's fine again for another 30 minutes.

Other notes: 
-As I mentioned before, it would have been nice if they added updates and new, fun stuff to build, but they didn't really do that. The game does feel finished, but a few more touches would have been nice. 
-I honestly think the interface/controls are fine. You do need to take a moment to get used to it, but once you do it makes sense for this type of game (you can harvest/keep track of your farm pretty efficiently) and I'm all for developers trying new things. The camera angle won't let you look directly up, and this is annoying though. 
-There isn't exactly a story. You do have quests, which is nice, but it's just telling you what you should build next.",1519892336,1580859250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I only just picked up this game about an hour ago, I like it but here are some Pros & Cons! 

Pros:
- Has great potential as a Game.
- Easy to Pick up.
- Crafting in the game does really deep and only just at the entry crafting!
- It's worth the Price! (Paid: £5.79 GBP)

Cons:
- Graphics are not the best in the world, but are perfectly fine.
- No Music, really needs some sort of music
- A.I. has bugs, plus unfair towards player (eg. animals and goblins will work together to gang up on you).
- Player can get stuck in certain places with no way out.
- SFX need more some work, as comes from the other direction of Animal/Goblin so will end up running into them instead of away from them.
- Needs more work, as it's lagging for my Heavy Gaming PC Rig. 

Misc:
- Has a grind, you either hate it or like it.
- Story is 50/50 so not sure what to say about it.
- World gets genterated and makes some good and bad areas to work with.


Overall, it's a good game but does need a TON of work to make it better in a number of areas. 
So for my score for the game, I give it a ""6/10""

I am going to keep on playing this, but will give another review in 6 months to see if it's any better.",1519826281,1519828252,True,4,0,0.489223450422286987,0,True,False,False,False,,,

一般的な自キャラのケツを追うTPS視点にもできるサバイバルっぽいゲーム
サバイバルといっても空腹や渇水などの要素はなく、HPと気力(スタミナ)、
それから気温くらいしか自己管理の必要はない
HPの方はともかくこの気力の方はかなりのストレスとなる
まず木を切る、岩を砕くなどそういった大体の行動で気力は消費されるのだが
自然回復はかなり遅く、また回復アイテムは作成がかなり面倒である
とにかくリアルタイムを食うゲームであり、アイテム１つ作るのに平気で１分などかかる
（アイテムはレベルでレシピ開放。序盤はしょぼいものばっかり）
地形の起伏なども合わせてとにかくすべての調整がまるでなってない
これを量産しようと思うと６０個作るだけでもう１時間なわけだが(放置はできる)
（６０個なんて１回遠征に行ったらもうなくなるから冒険行くたびに数時間の待ち。
マルチしてたら×人数分の作成待ち）
それ以前に素材をかき集める必要があるので実際にはもっとかかる

後半になると井戸などの水を汲める施設(水はこれでしか手に入らない)などは増やせる
井戸は自動で水を６個まで組みためてくれる　何故６個だけなのでしょう
苗床に植物を植えるのにも、家畜に餌をやるのにも、回復アイテム（料理）をつくるのにも水がいるのに
時間経過でしかたまらない水を必要分集めるには一体何時間待ったらいいのでしょうか
その工程を何度繰り返すのでしょう
私はキノコを何千個集めさせられたのだろうか

武器はショートとロングのソード、そしてメイス　モーション同じ　メイスだと振りながら歩けない　威力高。後は弓くらい
防具は鉄製の防御力の高いものもあるが、前述の通り気温の概念があり、
寒い場所では暖かい服、寒い場所ではその逆といったような格好を要するので（適さない格好だとHP、気力が減る）
装備できる機会はほぼない
施設の建築などはマイクラなどのように１つずつブロックなどを組んでいくものではなく
最初から出来上がったものを任意の場所に設置するという形式
設置をミスると破壊しないと移動できない　作るのにはかなりのコストがかかるので私は諦めた



ここからネタバレ


クエストの最後には敵が低めの確率で落とす”宝石の欠片”５つで作成できる
”欠片ではない宝石”を６種類作れと言われる
５こずつね
欠片２５個を６種類分なので９９９９９９９９個くらい集めればいいんじゃないですかね
それからそのへんのゴブリンとかいうザコがたまに落とす金のコイン１５で作成できる
金の延べ棒も１５個必要
(ちなみに金属を焼くのには光る琥珀と石炭が必要。石炭を作るのには光る琥珀が必要。琥珀いくつ作ればいいんですか
石炭は作成するための施設の最大設置可能数が少なく、また時間もかかる。なのに必要とされる数がかなり多い。
金属類はもはや何をするのにも必要となってくるのだが、マップ上で鉱石岩を見つけられるまでひたすら歩き、
血を吐きながら作った気力回復アイテムをがぶ飲みしながら鼻くそみたいな量の鉱石を取って帰らないといけない）
それらの素材をなんとかかき集めていざフォース・オブ・ネイチャーという題を冠したアイテムを作成すると
なんと感動のエンディング、SSをあげたあれである
「おめでとうございます！」

感情で書くもんじゃないけどほんとにこのゲーム嫌いなので低評価押したくて書きました
この文を見て購入を踏みとどま方がいれば人助けになったと思います

マルチだとプレイヤーがはなれられる距離に制限があって
アプデ前は視野内とかそんなレベルでひどかったのが
今はマップロードされない程度であればはなれられるようになってる
１バイオーム内で３回くらいはロードされるから何とも言えない距離　まあまあ不便
あと天候があって雨降ったり霧がかりまくったりして昼でもとにかく見にくい
天候は見にくいだけで特に何か影響があるわけでもないと思う
夜とかなんも見えないけど光源設置すると敵が壊しに来る
設置する系のものはだいたい敵の攻撃対象になっていて
家守るために壁とか置いてるとそれをわざわざ壊しに来てくれるから逆効果になって

Crafting, survival, open world, and sandboxy.

Pros:
The game has a decent environment for protecting you from harm in the early game which helps to minimize pointless frustration.  The level system accurately and efficiently guides the player through the tech tree, and each level's build requirements force the user to stretch their skills and knowledge and force exploration of the map outside of the player's comfort zone.  

Building caps per level (e.g. - you can only have 2 wells until you level up further) keep you focused on the next construction project needed to level up and minimize the tendency of some players (me) to build bases that sprawl endlessly.  Portals are built into the vanilla tech tree and dying sets the player back a reasonable amount without brutally punishing them.

Cons:
The controls work efficiently but the overall usability could use a 15-20% improvement before I would call it intuitive and frictionless.  The map is large but the biomes are lacking in features and unique areas that would encourage exploration for the sake of exploration.  The main menu has a humorous combination of being both confusing and easy to use.  For example, 1) a friend can't join my world if I started a single player session but if I exit and load the same game as multiplayer (by clicking ""Start a new game"" for some reason), they're automatically alerted that I've created a lobby if the game is open.

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons by a significant margin and this is a pretty great buy for the price, especially for lower-end computers that might struggle to keep up with modern crafting games.",1519436672,1519436672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've been enjoying aspects of the game, and I'm probably going to persist with it for a bit longer - it isn't a total disaster, and there's a lot of potential here to make a great game - but there are too many things which are frustrating or annoying or just plain stupid to be able to give this a recommend.

Firstly, the controls.

The controls are the absolute worst I have ever encountered in a first person game. 
You will be constantly, every few seconds throughout the game, flicking between two completely different interfaces with different controls, and this is the biggest most fundamental flaw this game has.

It's a first person game with standard WASD movement and mouse look, but only while all you want to do is move around or attack something. This is the first of the two control interfaces, and one that any gamer will be familiar with.

As soon as you need to interact in any other way, with any other aspect of the game (even as simple as picking up items from the floor) you have to flick to the other control method, which is still WASD movement, but you now have a mouse pointer you can use to click on items to pick them up or interact with - which are invariably too far away, prompting an error message telling you to move closer - or to use the many menus which appear onscreen as well for crafting, construction, etc. Crucially, as your mouselook has been replaced with a pointer for interfacing with, you now cannot turn or rotate your character whatsoever - you're stuck strafing, facing in whatever direction you were looking in when you switched to it, until you subsequently decide to switch back. If you get attacked or sudddenly need to turn around for whatever reason, while you're trying to craft something or pick up items, the first thing you will have to do is switch back to the other control method before you can even think of doing the simple basic task of facing your opponent.

What makes it worse is that items on screen that you can interact with (be it things to pick up, things to harvest, or crafting stations) are only highlighted when you are in ""mouse pointer"" mode so if you're running about looking for stuff, you will need to perpetually switch in and out of ""mouse pointer"" mode just to see the items highlighted on screen. 

On the plus side, this double control interface thing is actually reasonably seamless - you can switch from one to the other by tapping ""Q"" (although if you have any menus open when switching out of ""mouse pointer"" mode, you will need to double tap ""Q"" as the first tap will only close the menus - another annoyance). And if you just need to quickly dip in to the other control interface, you can hold spacebar to do so, and releasing it will switch back. 

But for all this complexity, forcing you to spend 50% of the game unable to turn your character, and the relentless error messages when you try to click on an item that you're not standing pretty much on top of ""please move closer!"", you can't help but feel that it could have been made infinitely more slick by simply highlighting objects you can interact with when you move close to them, and then having a keypress to interact with the nearest one. It seems a LOT of effort to give you a point-and-click interface for interaction, when you still have to move your character right next to the thing anyway, negating any need to have moved a mouse pointer over to it in the first place.

Next, combat

Combat is just DULL. It's the worst. You have one attack (whatever weapon you have currently crafted) and you just stand next to a gremlin and click the button. You do an attack and then wait around 1 second to recover before you can do it again. You will get hit one time while recovering, then you repeat. There's no skill, or tactic. You just stand there and click a bit. They can't see you from very far away, so if there's a bunch of them in one place you can walk towards them until the nearest one spots you and runs over to fight you (its friends won't bother), you can deal with that one by itself then repeat to pick off the others one by one. It's so tedious that when the game quests demand that I collect gold coins (only obtained from killing gremlins) I find myself shutting the game down until I can be bothered tomorrow. The game only really started to get fun once I'd cleared a decent area of the map out from enemies, so I could actually run around undisturbed - now the game is telling me (in my latest quest) that I have to build a bed for sleeping on, and that if I sleep  on it then enemies will respawn. This may be the thing that makes me abandon the game, forcing me to grind through this most tedious of tasks over and over.

Right - graphics.
The graphics are basic but functional, at least everything is clear, but it all looks a bit 2005. The render horizon is so close it's ridiculous, things fade into view from approximately 10m away, and the solution for keeping things visible when you're walking near trees is to simply cut those trees down temporarily (they literally just turn into tree stumps if they would obscure your view)

You can't zoom in or out at all, and you can't even look up. 

Also the boundary clipping around objects that stops you walking past them is just ridiculous. Plenty of gaps that look like you can walk through them, turns out that bit of twig poking out at knee height means nope you really cannot go that way. 

I haven't even really started on the game itself yet. The crafting is a real grind. There's only so many ""oh so I need to collect 50 of those to make 20 of those to make 10 of these to make this new weapon that will improve my attack speed by slightly less than 2%"" before you just say sod it and walk away. Everything is just so slow, and marred by more annoying ""features"". You can do basic crafting from a menu in the interface, more complicated crafting requires you to go to a crafting station. Things crafted at a crafting station will remain at the station until you collect it (some of them take several minutes so you will run off and come back when it's finished). Fair enough. But the basic items you craft in your crafting menu, which you can do anywhere at any time, will remain *stuck in your crafting menu until you go back into it to collect them*. Literally, the first time you craft something you'll be thinking ""great, now where is it"". It's not in your inventory. No. It's in your crafting menu, waiting for you to click ""take"" on it. Despite several hours in, this still trips me up. I'll be at a crafting station trying to make a thing I need ""oh I need 20 rope, ok cool I can make that in my menu, I just need to collect some leaves first"". Go and collect leaves. Craft 20 rope. Go back to crafting station to make the thing ""not enough rope"". WHAT? Oh yeah. Have to go back into my crafting menu, collect the rope, put it in my inventory, now I can go back into the crafting station menu and craft the thing. The game is literally holding me up because it requires me to move an item from one part of my inventory to another before it will recognise it. Oh and you can't queue items for production anywhere, not in your basic crafting nor in the crafting stations. You have to wait for current production to finish before you can start a new one.

Bored yet? You're probably beginning to get an idea of what the game is like. ""Oh these items need 45x soil to craft them, I'll just go and get that"". Stands character over soil, and holds mouse button for literally three solid minutes. That's the standard of grinding in this. Endless ""go here and hold your mouse button for at least 75 seconds"".

From the preview videos it looks pretty slick, but be aware that almost all of the clips shown of gameplay have been sped up significantly.

Я так никогда еще не ошибался.

Повелся на жанр и графику. Графика в самой игре оказалась хуже, чем на скринах в магазине. 
Управление и туман вокруг - убийцы этой игры. 
Не ведитесь на приятные скрины, в самой игре при ином ракурсе, вы не увидите ничего, кроме серого сплошного тумана без намека на какой-либо фон. Просто серые текстуры вокруг.
Управление - отдельная тема. Зачем было выдумывать одноколесный велосипед без педаль, если можно сделать нормально, привычное всем, управление?

Переход на новый уровень.. Не вижу смысла в системе ""побегай пофарми квесты, а потом еще побегай и пофарми на лвл"". Это ""выживание, песочника, крафтинг, симулятор"", или RPG? Да я столько фармил разве что в World of Warcraft'е, и то это сопровождалось миром, имеюим нормальную карту, а персонаж не жил в серых текстурах ""тумана"".
И все бы ничего, но ведь у вас еще и энергия заканчивается от ОДНОГО срубленного дерева, в то время как на лвл вам нужно не только его срубить, но и подолбить камни, и прочее. В общем, особый вид мазохизма, а не ""переход на новый уровень"".
Да и в целом эта скоропостижная полоска ""энергии"" требует изменений. Ну слишком быстро она улетучивается, не реально, еды даже столько не найдешь, что бы ее восстановить и нормально пофармить (то есть поделать то, зачем я в эту игру и приходил).

Я не буду ничего говорить про косметические шероховатости (огромные такие бугры) этой игрушки. Возможно их доработают. Но пока что выглядит не очень. Будто скачал на каком-то левом сайте бесплатную инди rpg.

Не смотря на то, что купил по скидке, и честно пытался найти в игре хоть что-то, что способно затмить все ее косяки, деньги вернул. Очень их жалко за подобное отдавать.

Pros
Easy streamlined interaction with world objects
Tons of crafting & building
Farming, fishing, adventuring alone or with your trusty chicken (or friends I guess)
When confronted with a choice between realism and game experience, the game seems to opt for the latter - initially I thought that being unable to walk through the bushes was stupid. Then I realized the goblin things and bears couldn't get through either. Then it occurred to me that I wouldn't walk through a damn bush in the woods IRL without an axe or something either.

Cons
No female player model - even something basic would be much appreciated!
Fog is depressing - the draw distance is short (I understand why, but it is almost oppressive)

The combat and resource gathering can be frustrating. Heavy stamina drain, dodge consisting of walking backwards (which usually just makes you miss more often and still end up getting hit quite a bit by the enemy) isn't much use. Would kill for a roll-dodge or even a block or something other than just watching that three-second-swing over and over. A slow cumbersome weapon (cudgel) when we can craft metal axes and picks early on but get stuck with a slow haymaker weapon is frustrating. Rough aiming with the bow with arrows that seem to get blocked by everything including the terrain and the far edges of pine trees.

Leveling up is a bit annoying. You gain levels not by actions but by doing quests. Some quests, such as getting 5 gold, are unecessarily painful, and require that you get lucky on drops from mobs as they often drop copper rather than gold coins. So it takes 15 gold coins to make one bar, and you need to get 75, and thats just to get to level 7. Did i mention combat is frustrating. ^^ (mainly this is annoying because it's not just holding you back from gaining some quest reward, it's holding you back from reducing the frustrations involved in crafting that comes with leveling up and gaining either more things to do while the items slowly craft themselves out, or by giving you more of the crafting buildings to do more stacks at once, or work on multiple items that that particular crafting building type is required to create).

There is no way to fast transfer from your inventory into storage (such as shift/alt/ctrl-click to move stacks) though there is an option to quickly fill a box with like items which is handy but not as much as a quick stack transfer.

Resource gathering, combat, and everything in general is made less enjoyable by an overly demanding stamina system. The stamina drains so fast that the only way to mine, fight, chop trees, hack bushes, etc is by rapidly spamming sunflower seeds, or eating other things that have longer delays before your allowed to eat more. I like a stamina system normally, it represents cost for action which adds a degree of realism, but in this case it's overkill and just punishes the player for wanting to try to do anything in the game.

Animals need to be hand fed food/water to produce a single cycle and provide a resource. There should be a way to just supply stacks to the animal and let it produce while you wander off and do something else. Instead, you feed it, wait for a slow timer to cycle through after a few seconds, then feed it again. Make it like a crafting table where you put in stacks and get stacks slowly back instead of having to hang around and feed them this way. Too monotonous even with a bunch of the same animal.

Limitations on number of crafting buildings means that you can't just put down five forges to quickly spam out a bunch of bars, or put down five cooking tables to quickly make a bunch of foods. Nope, instead you have to sit and wait or wander off and do something else while items slowly craft themselves out. Did I mention combat and resource gathering are frustrating? To add to this limitation, the buildings have a set number of slots for tools, some different tool sets are required to craft different items. SO either you have a building devoted to one type of crafting and another building to another type of crafting (since the number of those crafting buildings you can have are limited by level), or you have to swap tools and store those unneeded tools somewhere to spam craft stuff while you wander off to do something else, since crafting items can take quite a bit of time.

Anyway enough frustrations... the game is pretty well put together for all. I haven't come across any bugs while playing. The sounds and visuals are decent. There looks to be plenty of content.

Играть одному достаточно трудоёмко и скучновато, так как ресурсов надо очень много. А вот по коопу с близким человеком играется отлично.

Сотни рецептов для крафта, одно делается из другого. Огромный открытый мир. Охота, фермерство, крафтинг, собирательство, рубка леса, бамбука, выбивание всяких ресурсов для крафта - в общем, время только так улетает за ней. А как только берёшь очередной уровень, открывается ещё больше плюшек, и твой лагерь начинает выглядеть не как аборигенский, а уже похож на средневековый городок.

・クラフトをメインにするなら、UI操作の設計には気を使うべき
（一番見る回数、操作する回数が多い箇所なのでここで小さなストレスが発生する作りだと、

・視覚的に通れそうで通れない地形

・足の遅いプレイキャラ。気力が少ない状態や装備によってはさらに遅くなる

・そこのでかい水たまりから水を汲ませろ
（プレイ中の待ち時間がほぼ井戸の水が溜まるの待ち）

・戦闘がノーガード殴り合いなので、体力と気力回復アイテムの生産が必須で、アイテム生産で待ち時間が発生する

Could hardly stop long enough to write this review.

Overview:
You start out on the shores of who knows where and how you got there... well that doesn't matter. As you need to scavenge for your suvival.

From beach torn shorts to blazing glory you can hunt, craft, and tame things around you. As you work your way through quest after quest you grow stronger and the monsters you venture across become not only more dangerous but bigger and more blood thirsty.

Gameplay:
I would have to say for a game that has only been out for a little under 2 months. This is already a great game with hours and hours of fun for you and your friends. The fact that Multiplayer is easy as saving and switching worlds makes this fun for everyone.

Crafting, Building, Farming, Taming, Fishing, Fighting, and more... this game has it all. I can't wait to see what updates come out in the future. I hope they add more things to tame and more of a free roam feel with out the quests being the main progression.

Pros:
Great game play, a lot of things to do and a lot of different places to explore.

Easy if you want, excruciatinly difficult if you want as well.

Graphics are fairly decent and several different times I found myself just looking around... at what I built, at the wild, and at the beaches.

Multiplayer really is awesome, easy as switching a previously saved world to the multiplayer mode.

Random Generated worlds.... differnt every time. Gotta love that.

Cons:
Grind grind grind grind.... Takes a lot of time to advance to the next phase/crafting/equipment 

The only thing you can tame that helps you fight is the goblin... kinda boring and not very useful.

I paid less than $4 for it!  How can this be??

There's a bit of a fanatasy element to the game as well - you'll be combating goblins, skeletons, as well as natural predators.  

Can be a little on the grindy side, with slower pace.  But it's not too bad and is adding a harsh survival aspect to the early game.  Better tools and some neat devices will help speed things along as you progress.

If you're looking for story it isn't here. That does not mean it is a bad game. It runs on my potato of a laptop VERY well. As far as I can understand, most resources are finite and it pushes you to progress. 

If you are looking for a relaxed casual survival game with freedom to explore slowly, this is probably not for you.

Good:
- Pretty graphics
- Nice sounds
- Crafting recipies are easy and available in the menu, so you don't have to look up a guide
- I think the worlds are randomly generated but don't quote me on that
- Very bingable
- Very easy for beginners, the quest system basically holds your hand the whole way but you can do things at your own pace
- Controls are easy to get used to and use
- Very polished

Bad:
- Building things indoors is a complete pain because you can barely fit anything into 1 building. As for solutions to this maybe they can make it so 2 of the same houses being next to each other can connect or generally increasing the capacity of a house. (By houses i mean all of the indoor buildings)
- Questionable replay value. The game takes so long to do a lot of things
- Missing the value of all the ore shards and force of nature pieces we collect, idk if a story will be added at some point but either than gaining access to the next level, they are kind of pointless.
- Those palm leaves are such a pain to get. Make sure you don't die when you collect them because they seem to be very limited in supply. (Not sure if jungle trees drop them)
- I don't really like the force of nature pieces being a requirement to level up, they're really hard to get to let alone collect. It does push you to advance but I'm not entirely sure of their value or why I should collect them.
- Quest system holds you're hand a bit too much, but if you don't want a complicated questing system then ignore this point.
- Minions are too underpowered to be useful as anything more than body and damage shields. I often find myself throwing myself in front of them as a shield because if the enemy aggros on the minion it's almost gaurenteed death for them. A goblin minion can't face anything higher than another goblin and it certainly can't kill anything without help from the player.

I like it though. Nice to come back after a tough day and just relax, farming, cutting trees, listening to nature. The Devs I think are rush-ian (ha, because they rush to give updates to satisfy their consumers gettit) and update the game by a monthly basis. Pretty awesome, considering the satured kickstarter stuff that comes out often.

Unlike most open-world games, there's an objective. Levelling-up means achieving experience and resources, not constantly standing in an open field farming goblins and wild animals. It's a good feeling to have a farm set up within walls and gates to protect from the monsters. Goblins are nasty little buggers that'll swarm you and take you down, and your farms, if they catch you off guard.

Imagine my surprise when I found out you can tame one. A little disappointed you only can tame literally one, but to watch a level 7 gobbo kick his cousins level 1 ass is fun. Now I want to open up a gladiator arena where I leave my gobbo and aggro a bunch of monsters and lead them into the death cage. Whoever wins gets to be my second-in-command, with their own little hovel.

To say this game is accesible would be incorrect as many people like action and drama. But I like this peaceful world. At least, peaceful until you bump into a biome you never seen and run, watching your second-in-command get beat the crap out of from a glowing golem monster four times it's size. 

Then you come, make a portal, kick ass, and get a shard of nature. The whole objective, as far as I can tell, is that you're a wizard that teleports and wants to grow your magic power through the shard things. 

I got a couple complaints. One is that I can't name any one of my animals or gobbo, which sucks. Two is that I just want to pet them. Who is a good little gobbo? Yes you are! You are!. Three is that I should be able to command an army of the green suckers. Maybe see them change textures or weapons as their level gets higher would be neat too. 

Bottom line: Don't buy this game unless you are willing to invest time. If you're expecting minecraft, this might not be for you. Since you can refund, give the game an hour and see if you're willing to sit and dig dirt for seven minutes straight. (or just *pretend* you bought it, like I did)

Having to craft things that take way too long to collect and craft for something simple then having to do that about 5 times for each resource just to get to the next step of crafting just to build something as simple as a small chest takes wayyy too long. There is no customizability when it comes to building either. There is one set model for each thing which is boring because you are not able to actually build a base or a home for maximum efficiency.

Steady character progression, crystal clear quests, nicely challenging with a smooth difficulty curve, fascinatingly different mechanics from any other game I've ever seen, and a gigantic world to explore, fight, and loot; Force of Nature will hold your attention far longer than you'd ever expect.

Difficile d'en décrocher !!!! (je me suis même fait toute une journée dessus du matin jusqu'au lendemain matin 5h non stop !!!! un truc de malade !!!!).

Beaucoup le comparent à ""don't starve"", je ne crois pas, don't starve a ses mécaniques et un style graphique qui lui sont propres, mais dans l'idée il y a quelques légères similitudes...

Je ne pense pas avoir vu de craft aussi développé et réaliste dans d'autres jeux jusqu'ici. Un petit exemple sans vouloir trop spoiler : pour fabriquer un cocktail (style smoothie ou milk shake fruité) il vous faudra d'abord récolter des pommes en chemin, puis cultiver des fraises, mais pour celà il faudra d'abord vous fabriquer des planches de semi, y mettre de la terre que vous derez pelleter à la force de vos bras mais sans outils impossible, puis vous aurez besoin d'accessoires de cuisine et même d'une cuisine, d'une forge pour les outils, d'une ferme pour y élever des vaches à lait et autres animaux qu'il vous faudra capturer, apprivoiser et aussi nourrir.

Il y a un tas de choses à faire dans ce jeu, construire une base rudimentaire au départ qui évoluera au fil des niveaux acquis. Pour augmenter les niveaux de votre personnage vous aurez des petites quêtes à réaliser. Doucement mais surement vous allez faire évoluer votre campement de fortune en un véritable petit village dans lequel vous serez le seul habitant, vous pourrez même y ajouter des décorations.

Entre la popote, la culture, la nourriture de vos animaux, la pêche, la confection de vêtements, d'outils, d'armes diverses vous risquez de passer un long moment dans votre petit chez vous. Mais rester sédentaire n'est pas le meilleur des choix.
Après vous être paré comme il faut il vous faudra partir en exploration, affronter les ennemis, trouver de nouvelles matières premières et je suppose trouver un moyen de rentrer chez vous.

Oui rentrer chez vous car vous vous réveillez là un matin échoué sur cette plage au milieu de cocotiers, sans savoir ce qui a bien pu vous arriver, ni ce que vous foutez là.

Il y a différents biomes sur la carte, heureusement vous pourrez fabriquer des portails de téléportation pour voyager plus rapidement. 
Mais attention ces biomes n'ont jamais été explorés vous allez vous enfoncer dans une jungle dense qu'il faudra défricher pour vous frayer un chemin. 

C'est un des points négatifs du jeu, cette phase de défrichage pourra en rebuter plus d'un, car vous perdez vite en endurance, ce qui ralentira votre avancée. Si vous n'avez pas prévu et emporté assez de nourriture, vous devrez retourner dans vos quartiers pour vous concocter des recettes afin de vous retaper en énergie, et cela va vous prendre réellement beaucoup de temps.

Dans certains biomes il fait très chaud, dans d'autres très froid, vous aurez besoin de certains types de vêtements pour y entrer au risque de voir baisser rapidement votre santé ou votre endurance.

Votre but principal est d'explorer ces différents biomes (7 au total je crois) dans l'espoir d'y trouver une pierre spéciale qui vous servira à .... euh je ne sais pas encore lol

A l'heure actuelle j'ai exploré 5 biomes, c'est long, très long (personnellement ça ne m'a pas gênée) mais les impatients vont surement se lasser avant la fin du jeu. 
Il va falloir pas mal d'heures et de patience, il vous faudra aussi apprendre à bien gérer et vous préparer avant de partir en combat, car les ennemis ne sont pas simples, et  si à votre grand malheur vous veniez à décéder en combat vous respawnez sur la plage près de votre base mais vous perdrez une grande quantité d'objets de votre inventaire.

Le jeu fait souvent des sauvegardes et aucun soucis de ce côté là.
Je n'ai rencontré aucun bug, les graphismes peuvent paraitre pas terrible au premier abord mais au final on s'y habitue et tout compte fait ce n'est pas si mal, les animaux et ennemis sont plutôt bien réalisés, les gobelins (vous pourrez en apprivoiser un pour combattre à vos côtés) sont tous mignons je trouve.

La gestion de la caméra peu vous paraitre assez hasardeuse et même vous agacer, mais tout est question de prise en main, une fois qu'on a pris l'habitude ça passe...

Pour la musique de fond, je n'ai pas trop compris, il n'y en a pas, à part le bruit des petits oiseaux et différents bruitages, mais parfois à certains endroits vous l'entendrez (rarement et pas longtemps) alors que dans les options il me semble y avoir vu une case permettant de  choisir de jouer les mêmes en boucle ou tout le répertoire.

Les succès steam ne se débloqueront que si vous jouez en solo. Je ne peux vous parler de l'option multi qui ne m'a pas intéressée pour ce jeu et que je n'ai donc pas testée.

J'ai modifié un peu mon évaluation ce jour (15/05/2018) suite à une critique dans les commentaires, il est vrai que j'ai peut être insisté un peu trop les côtés positifs sans appuyer sur les côtés qui peuvent fâcher. 
Mais mon avis reste inchangé, même si je me dois de souligner que ce jeu n'est pas fait pour tout les amateurs de survie, ceux qui ne jurent que par le multi, le PVP et la possibilité de crafter des armes de guerre de malade pour dégommer tout ce qui bouge seront déçus.
Mais pour ceux qui aiment le solo, qui aiment se poser tranquillement et prendre leur temps, réfléchir, gérer, s'organiser et choisir les bonnes tactiques d'approche lors des combats, ce petit jeu est un vrai régal.

You can fight, farm, build n craft n forage n explore - it ain't amazing but it's fairly fun and enjoyable, at least for me. If you don't like grinding, this won't be the game for you though - you do a lot of it in this game. It's also a lot about resource and work management with all the different crafting stations, hrowing herbs and harvesting goods from animals. 
If you enjoy games like minecraft, this should be a fun time for ya.
I only have a single complaint. I wish there was a way to pet my animals. Even if it's just a button that makes my lill chicken cluck happily with no other use. Let me pet my cow. Let me pet my piggy! LET ME PET MY GOBLIN! HE'S A GOOD BOY!!!

There isn't a lot of stress involved in this game.  You can't starve or die of thirst, but you can run out of Stamina.  When that happens you just stand there and do nothing until you recover enough Stamina to move.  The only way to die in this game is to be killed by other critters.

You only have the one avatar, a male.  You can change the color of his cut-off pants, and his hair, and nothing else.  The only view you will ever have is from behind your avatar, so it really doesn't matter.  The combat is extremely simple - click to hit, with no manuvering or complex animations.  The graphics are also simple, but nice.

Part of the fun of these types of games is figuring them out, so I will not give anything away.  I will say one thing about the game mechanics.  While you are playing the game the critters you kill never respawn.  However, when you save and exit the game the next time you reload the saved game to play, you always start at the beginning (no matter where you were when you saved your game) and all the critters will have respawned.  

If you are looking for a casual, laid back survivalist/crafting/farming type games, then for $7.99 you can't beat this game.  The developers are still adding content to this game, so I would certainly recommend it.  I've spent more at the movies and have been entertained far less.  After 45 hours of playing the game, this is my first impression.

Não achei bugs, unica coisa que me deixava louco no inicio eram as lutas em que o inimigo saia fugido, a velocidade de movimento deles em fuga é maior que a do Flash reverso! mas depois se poder craftar o arco é só tacar flechada quando eles fogem que ta tudo sussa...

*Tem elementos de craft;
*Tem lutas;
*Tem que farmar item com chance de drop;
*Não é um jogo de sobrevivencia;
*Craft demora, e muito (criar 'chocolate' para recuperar Stamina e poder correr, atacar e coletar, cada unidade demora cerca de 1 min, você gasta tranquilamente 100 unidades em uma incursão em busca das pedras da natureza);
*Água, tem que coletar água do 'poço' porem no nivel atual que estou só posso ter 3 poço e eles travam em 6 unidades, poderia poder anexar o 'barril' ao poço e coletar mais unidades de água porem não... Demora um pouco para gerar a água e em receitas do meu nivel atual pedem muitas unidades oque causa uma 'demora' na sequencia da historia do jogo;
*Eu juntei recursos por horas para fazer uma 'base' e quando for atacado ficar de boa... Esperei, esperei, esperei o tal do ataque e nada kkkk aparentemente não precisa perder tempo construindo 'base' nada vem te atacar... Unico ataque que recebo são dos monstros que dão respawn quando eu inicio o jogo que estão proximos ao ponto de nascimento original (os mesmos do tutorial inicial) é só matar eles e pronto não tem razão pra ter uma fortaleza (da solidão).
*Você joga com o que parece ser uma criança entre 13 e 16 anos, assim sendo sua velocidade de movimento é baixa.
*Você podera domesticar galinhas para ter 'ovos', galos para 'penas', cabra e vaca para 'leite', ovelha para 'lã' e porcos para 'minhocas' ? hm ta né...;
*Se tiver algum amigo meio doido das ideia vocês podem jogar juntos;
*Ainda não achei servidores do jogo abertos ao publico em geral, seria interessante criar um mundo interativo coop ou pvp;
*Vale o valor dele em real? Eu achei que sim, tem jogos bem piores e mais caro...


Nota final de 0 a 10, ""7"".

Recomendo! se conseguir comprar com desconto melhor ainda! e se tiver um amigo pra jogar junto, fica ainda melhor!

Weakest point might be the graphical fidelity which is servicable but resembles more a mobile game than anything on PC. It is realistic but less detailed with flatter lighting. Sound is decent, some of the samples are worse, some of them create a pretty good atmosphere. My favourite place so far is the jungle which feels quite mystical at night with the look and sound provided. Some of the landscapes still look gorgeous despite the lack of detail. The world is really open, you have to reach certain points but you can pretty much go across forests, bamboo fields, etc by cutting them down. Had that kind of feeling when I tried to get my bearings back in the first Dark Souls, always on the lookout for enemies and ways to get around them. The goal is to reach a location and avoiding foes is an option. Of course you will need equipment for different circumstances so you have to gather resources, build stuff, accomplish tasks and level up which would let you build more stuff and create better equipment. This provides a simple but reliable sense of progression. It might be a little slow and might become boring after some time but it is rather fun for quite a while. Combat is pretty simplistic which gets in the way in later game especially. Other thing which is a mixed bag is the huge, box-like collision meshes which prevent you from walking through bushes or between close trees for example. Once you get used to this it can be used to create pathways and lure enemies away, other times it could potentially kill you. I died a few times due to being stuck between foliage while I was being chased.
Overall, I was generally surprised how well-made Force of Nature is. While some of the design choices might not be the best I barely had any glitch during the couple dozen hours I played. Updates are also coming out every now and then. At this price FoN is definitely a title that everyone who likes exploration based survival games should consider trying out at some point if for nothing else just for the sake of it being so different.

Takes huge amounts of time for anything. Generally slow and calm. If you're looking for action or quick fun, this is clearly not for you. I'm lovingly calling this a work simulator because you'll spend a lot of time watching your character chop down trees and rocks while keeping the left mouse button pressed.

However, from beginning to approximately mid-game (cannot talk about late-game), I love it. There is no pressure. Time is on your side and an investment you make. Everything is controlled. Quests are designed to ease you into the game, with the learning curve being pretty much perfect. Resources are abundant, practically unlimited for all intents and purposes, and as long as you're not in a rush, you can just farm to your heart's content, killing time building your village. There is a lot of depth in the crafting system with almost no redundant resources. Most things can be used up in some way. Level progression is also interesting in that it is tied to your crafts and quests instead of character experience. Progress is saved per map and you can hop back in whenever you like.

The game has weak graphics and animation, sounds are average at best and UI management is slightly clunky, but it has an appealing feel to it. I wouldn't have bought the game had it not been recommended by a friend. Short sight range with no backdrop. You'll never stop and marvel at nature's beauty.

Multiplayer is good. Playing with a friend worked from the get-go and it was a lot of fun because everything becomes more efficient. Multiplayer is unorthodox, though:

- You cannot join mid-game. Your friend will have to stop his game and invite you to start together with him. Progress is saved though, but it can be annoying when you're in the process of doing something and someone wants to join.
- You cannot move too far away from the host. There is no splitting up like in Minecraft or Terraria, where you'll explore different areas of the map or stay at base while the other guy roams around. You're tied together with a magic rope.

Some game mechanics are questionable. Combat isn't fleshed out. Do not buy this game if you don't like chill farming and grinding games (Minecraft Survival style). If you do, this is highly recommended.

Pros
+ Ultra-chill
+ Very good crafting tree
+ Nice balance of farming, looting, harvesting and crafting
+ Multiplayer with a friend is dope
+ Automatic saves and permanent items without despawns
+ Perfect learning curve
+ Quests are just right

Cons
- Visual appeal
- Combat is weak
- Ranged combat is even worse
- UI is simple but blocky
- Multiplayer lacks freedom",1515443810,1517416010,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Tényleg ajánlom a játékot, mert nagyon jól kikapcsolja az embert, de a túlélés terén vannak hiányosságok. Első szembetűnő problémám hogy az élelem egyetlen dologra alkalmas: életerő visszatöltésére. Bár rengeteg recept van, sok féle étel, teljesen feleslegesen, mert ezek nincsenek kellően kiegyensúlyozva, így elegendő kenyéren élned.... a kiartás visszatöltésére pedig napraforgó magot szoktam ropogtatni. 

A harc is elég problémás, gyakorlatilag az állatvilág veszedelmesebb bármelyik szörnynél, legalábbis még alacsony, kezdő szinteken. Másból sem áll a játék mint kattintásokból, körbe-körbe rohangálásból, és a harc végén kenyér zabálásból... 

Mindezen túl vélhetően sokat fognak még rajta csiszolni, én nagyszerű ötletnek látom a koncepciót és a megvalósítás eddigi formáját, de a harcrendszer pocsék, a craftolás pedig értékét veszti jelenleg, azt leszámítva amit egy feladat miatt kell craftolnod.

2- но многие вещи делать просто утомительно (для персонажа особенно) из-за огромного количества необходимых ингридиентов и времени их приготовления (видимо сложность заменили временем);
3- некоторые локации без топора просто не пройти: а это энергия, приходится готовить кучу еды-""энергетиков"";

Le jeu ne propose pas une construction libre, il faudra vous contenter des recettes d'objets et de les positionner sur le terrain, c'est le cas pour les différentes cabanes qui permettra d'avoir un abri intérieur.

L'aspect survie du personnage se résume surtout à maintenir sa santé et si besoin l'endurance. Les notions de faim et soif n'existant pas, manger sert uniquement pour remonter santé et endurance. Il n'y a également pas de notion d'usure des objets ou de pourrissement des denrées.

La survie s'oriente surtout dans la collecte des ressources et l'évolution du personnage et de sa base. Vous pourrez faire de la culture, de l'élevage, de la cuisine, le système est basé sur l'imbrication des ressources.

Edit : courant janvier 2018, évolution du mode multijoueur jusqu'à 4 simultanément et augmentation de la limitation d'éloignement entre les joueurs.

首先让我说说我为什么会玩自然之力的吧。大概是3个月前的一天，我看到朋友在直播这个游戏。第一感觉就是有点像MC，看朋友玩的好像很欢乐的样子。我就同意了他的安利，加入了愿望清单。没想到第二天就打折了23333。既然打折了，那我就果断的买了。然后我一看，嗯，这个游戏有中文，就跑去问朋友。“XX君，自然之力有中文啊，你怎么用英文在直播？莫非你是连锻炼英文水平”然后他回答到“什么？这个游戏尽然有中文！”。就这件事情，我嘲笑了他一个月。

下面让我来说说这个游戏吧，首先是这个游戏适合养老。嗯，如果你性子急躁，那我的建议是不要玩这个游戏。因为这个游戏的怎么说，应该是节奏很慢。尤其是在一个人玩的时候。其次是这个游戏的翻译有点像机译，有些东西第一眼看到这个名字你可能会误解它的用途。比如说陷阱，这个陷阱不是放在地上的陷阱，而是扔出去，抓住动物的网（顺便在这里友情提示一下，至少第二次扔中才会网住）。还有就是创建的时候一个叫生存模式，一个叫创造模式。尤其是我这样的MC玩家肯定会误解创造模式。其实这个创造就是没有任务来限制你这个阶段可以制造等一系列可以用的东西的模拟，但是你得不到材料，即使没有限制也弄不来。第三点就是操作稍微有点不顺手，习惯了还好。一开始没注意有按键可以一次性收割，一次性拾取，种田重复上一部的时候，玩起来要累好多。

下面我来分享一下初期的一点经验吧。首先是可以升级就升级，不要在意体力什么的。一开始我为了节约体力，每次到体力用完才升级，浪费很多时间啊。工具、食物放在快捷栏，按数字可以快速使用、挖土的话，在对应颜色的土地上出率是100%的，出生地附近肯定有。做了鱼竿之后钓鱼，要把蚯蚓放在弹药栏。东西在地上不会消失，把没用的都丢在地上，省做箱子的材料。每次重进游戏，人会出现在出生地，怪物和动物会重置（驯服的家畜不会受到影响消失）但是植物、矿石等资源不会重置。怪我会破坏我们制造的建筑，所以不要建的和森林太近，不然怪物会直接跑过来拆家，嗯，拆你家。但是放在地上的，和个提灯那样的怪我不会拆。另外，怪物不会攻击动物，但是当我们驯服为家畜的时候，怪物会攻击家畜。房子不要乱建，虽然一些小东西可以之间搬起来换个位置，但是家只能拆掉，一想起这个就心痛。现在也就只能想到这一些，有其他的晚点我再补充吧。

自然之力这个游戏我还是挺喜欢的，每次玩都像入迷了一样，一玩就停不下来了。吓得的都不敢碰了（滑稽）。不过因为我严重的强迫症，虽然玩了这么些时间，但是我还只到第一块碎片那里。

PS：我写这一偏评论的时候已经有两个月没有玩了（天知道为什么我今天过来话这么长时间写了个测评），如果因为更新导致了和事实不服的话，请大家一定要留言说明一免误导别人。至于多人模式，我玩的时候好像刚出，我和朋友死活没有连上，所以我也不清楚多人玩会怎么样。体验过的朋友请一定要告诉我啊。",1514720331,1514720331,True,9,11,0.638717174530029297,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Clunky, boring, tedious, and meh. I will never play this game again, however, I can't refund at this point due to the 2 hour limit and meh, it was less than a dollar really so no point. Its designed in a very low quality way, everything just feels like extreme basics, doing the bare minimum to make a game. I'm not even sure they are working on anything at all. Only one update in the last 2 years, and it was a bug fix update (going based on the public update posts).

Creative mode in fact, is fake. It unlocks all structures and such, but you still have to play survival mode to get materials to craft or build anything. Its not -really- creative.

Old Review:
This is so boring, I'm contemplating refunding it and I haven't even tried it the full 2 hour limit.  There's no way to really fully try out much of this within two hours, but its just ridiculously boring and a bit clunky.  It even froze up on me when I changed a single graphic setting which shouldn't have frozen to begin with, right in the main menu with no graphics even loaded yet.  Had to task manager kill the process to get the game back.  I gota say, this feels like Early Access, but not labeled Early Access because of how games get a bad reputation of Early Access.

I tried creative mode just so I could try some of the later game things, only to find out Creative Mode is just no quests, but not actually creative.",1514704500,1635768653,False,1,0,0.434867024421691895,0,True,False,False,False,,,

45 hours later - eh, i guess i can't complain too much - i got my farming urges satisfied for a full year.

This is not Don't Starve. Although it's a lot like Don't Starve, except without the starving part, without stylish artwork, and without changing seasons. On the other hand it has much more micro-managed crafting, more sophisticated equipment, and slightly more involved combat (mainly because the game is 3d and your arrows actually fly in 3d space).

Basically if you're into the whole thing of having to feed the cows to get milk, using cooking table to turn milk into butter, then using the butter to create chocolate - you'll love this. Or if you're into having to burn sticks to get ember, then using ember with logs to create coal, then using coal and ore to create ingots, then  using ingots to create weapons/armor and better tools - you'll love this too. It's farm upon farm upon farm. Then you go farm the goblins for the gold coins that you can turn into gold ingots which you can use to build better weapons to farm the goblins faster.

The world was surprisingly large too, AND you can build teleporters which helps you optimize your farming.

1：好好的一个生存游戏竟然玩出了RPG的感觉，各种任务一开始就让我感觉到毒意十足，并且升级需要完成对应任务，在生存游戏中，体验不太好，尽管如此，如果处理到位也是可以接受的，显然这款游戏处理得并不是很到位。
2：等级限制，升级不但需要完成对应任务，还需要自然碎片，这个东西又极难获取，目前我也就升到9级，后面地图不但需要保暖，还需要大量解毒汤，许多灌木丛挡路，每走一步几乎都要挥动斧头，即便是找到自然碎片，你也必须十分小心，因为周围的守卫可是有点多的，而且许多建筑也被等级限制不能制造，这一点完全可以给差评了。
3：显然这款游戏在许多方面做得还不是很到位，你可能会经常被两株灌木丛挡住，而他们之中的缝隙又明显可以容纳下一个人穿过，各种不合理的设定，比如棕榈叶，后期你居然可以在一坨红色的花上面获取，有些植物看起来很柔软，实际它是一个实体，你必须挥动你那残疾一样的双手去劈砍，拿啥都不行，必须拿斧头，或许是我要求太高，毕竟这就只有几百兆的大小。
4：驯服动物，这个东西其实很简单，比如你要驯服一只母鸡，你需要走到母鸡身边，让它奔跑起来，在它迈着两只凤爪飞奔的时候丢出你手中的陷阱，如果丢中了，那么它会短暂的停留几秒钟，你需要赶紧跑过去点击驯服，而在你做这些事情的时候，千万记住，一定要将周围的怪物清理干净，否则你会和你的母鸡同伴一样被群殴，点击母鸡，你可以让它跟着你，但你需要用围栏将它们圈起来，否则它乱跑吸引来怪物，你可能需要重新造一座很小很小的房子。如果抛开那些个烦人的怪物，这或许是这个游戏为数不多的亮点，值得一提的是，后面你可以驯服这些怪物，哥布林，用链条陷阱。

暂时就先搞这么多，顺便说一句，创造模式升级还是需要自然碎片，你还是需要收集材料，只不过是建造东西没有了等级限制而已【十几块钱我都买了个什么玩意儿】。",1514317952,1514317952,False,3,4,0.5378151535987854,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1) Начну с крафта - крафт весьма скудный и однообразный - все рецепты известны заранее, но открываются при достижении уровня - никакой загадки и чувства ""неизведанности"".
2) Система уровней, которая в подобных играх на мой взгляд себя изжила уже давно. Уровни качаются тем, что выполняешь задания по типу ""скрафтить меч"", ""собрать 10 золотых монет"" - что-нибудь более скучное трудно придумать.
3) Бой с нпс. Боёвка нереально однообразна и уныла, нпс очень примитивные, весь бой сводится к обмену ударами, в которых вы ВСЕГДА победите 1х1. При этом устроить бой 1х1 очень легко - нпс выманиваются по одному крайне просто.
4) Строительство - очень плохая реализация строительства сооружений. Есть готовый набор - ""хижина"", ""землянка"", ""шалаш"" и подобное. Всё строительство сводится к тому, чтобы выбрать в каком месте поставить сооружение, ну и собрать ресурсов. Наличие или отсуствие дома никак не влияет на игру, дом нужен только чтобы поставить туда какие-то предметы, которые можно ставить только в помещении. 
5) Генерация мира - мир сгенерирован неплохо, красивые ландшафты, леса, цветочные поляны. Однако, физика всего этого процесса так же уныла. Видно что авторы не хотели заморачиваться и просто сделали, что персонаж не может пройти ни через кусты, ни через ветки деревьев, а еще и прыгать не умеет. В итоге чтобы куда-то дойти надо махать топором, рубя каждый куст на своём пути. Даже поле подсолнухов предстает для персонажа непроходимой стеной. Если пройтись по миру чуть больше быстро становится понятно, что он однообразный и никакого желания что-либо исследовать или искать - нет. Все нпс, которые вам нужны будут в радиусе 100 метров от вашего места возрождения. Единственное, что может заставить вас пойти по миру дальше - квест ""найдите артефакт"" для получения следующего уровня. Для того, чтобы этот артефакт найти надо скрафтить компас, который появляется в интерфейса и стрелкой показывает направление до артефакта. Я сначала обрадовался, что можно по стрелке идти и какой-то хоть интерес будет. Но потом открыл карту и разочаровался - артефакт явно отмечен на карте ) Задаешься вопросом а нафиг ты вообще тратил 20 минут жизни на этот ""компас"", если он абсолютно никак не используется.
6) Туман - в мире какой-то странный туман, через 30 метров уже ничего не видно, не видно неба и облаков, обзорность низкая и это портит атмосферу игры.
7) Интерфейс - возникает ощущение, что разработчики этой игры в своей жизни никогда не играли в другие игры подобного типа. Неудобно перетаскивать предметы, взаимодействие с разными верстаками, печками т.д. тоже не удобное.

Force of Nature est un super jeu de survie et de gestion pour qui aime le farming intensif. On débute en slip sur une plage et il va falloir bosser dur pour construire sa ""base"" et s'équiper convenablement. La nature environnante est composé d'éléments naturels exploitables, d'ennemis agressifs (gobelins, ours, renards...) et d'animaux apprivoisables.

Il n'y a pas de système d'XP. Pour monter d'un niveau, il faut réussir des quêtes qui permettent de découvrir certains aspects du jeu. Le gameplay est agréable bien que forcément répétitif, les décors sont plutôt cools et la map a l'air assez grande pour offrir de nombreuses heures de jeu. Bref, même si je n'ai pas encore découvert toutes les possibilités, le côté bac à sable et open world est franchement réussi, et font oublier les quelques défauts du jeu.

Quelques remarques :

- On aimerait vraiment pouvoir choisir le sexe de son personnage, à défaut de pouvoir personnaliser le skin.
- Quand tu aggro un ou plusieurs ennemis, rien ne sert de courir puisque les mobs te poursuivent jusqu'en enfer !

■ Usa poucos recursos (CPU,RAM,etc...)
■ Facil de jogar.
■ Chega parecer interessante no iníco

Contras:
■ Interface dura; não aceita comandos do mouse, enviados pelo x-mouse button por xemplo, não te permite customizar seu mouse para agiliar a jogabilidade.
■ Interface cheia de clicks para simples craft;
■ Há craft básico, que vai pelo lado da fantasia e não pela realidade; fazer uma fogueira, bastaria um punhado de gravetos, folhas secas e duas lascas de pedras para produzir faíscas e acender, invez disso tem que pegar um fragmento de gema (jóia) na praia. Não tenta seguia a realidade quando é um game de sobrevivencia.
■ Gráficos são muito fracos em relação ao design;
■ Alguns Craft exige quantidade de materias absurdas;
■ Cenarios de gelo, deserto e floresta se misturam, mudança de temperatura te força a desistir do objetivo, voltar à base, se reprogramar para tentar conquistar o objeto;
■ Complexidade de defesa ruim, envolve muitos items de forma confusa;
■ Seres (seus inimmigos) saltam de level 3, para level 20 no mesmo ambiente.
■ Demanda muito tempo fazendo craft e construções, coletando items para isso;

Resumo:
■ O jogo não é rum, mas é chato, e logo você se sentirá enjoado dele; se torna monótono bem facil;
■ Depois de concluir o final da estória, vai dar aquela senssação de tipo: ""só isso?"", 'tanto trabalho para achar esse pedra? e agora? acabou?"", ""parece que está faltando algo?""

I stopped playing this game because I lost my save file due to developer hide save file somewhere over my drive then I format my drive without knowing this and it gone (I already backed up my game via steam) and no such cloud system for save file that was how I lost my 21 hrs save file. Another problem about this game is control system that is not so friendly you have to play over an hour to figure out how to control your character, you even have to press spacebar before gap things and smash ctrl like crazy.

Good points: The crafting system is nice, there are a lot items to be crafted and use it in the journey. The world field can be manually manipulated. If you’re finding a game for exploration world and love building the base, this game is the one you can enjoy with.

当你进入游戏生成地图时就已经奠定了你能玩到多少级，没错。因为你需要在之后的升级中获得自然之力碎片但是这个天大的BUG就这么出现了，在你8级时，指南针在地图上给你标注了一个10级的自然之力碎片。你乐的屁颠的拿着你的小铁镐一路披荆斩棘，遇神杀神，遇佛杀佛。历经千辛万苦来到了这个10级的地图时。扛起你的小锄头准备收货。特么的你就敲吧一辈子都敲不下来这块自然之力碎片。它提示你“当前等级才不能够获得自然之力碎片‘是的，你特么才8级它让你敲10级的石头，并且游戏设定里你并不能越级敲自然之力碎片。就是这么任性，就是这么认真。你无奈挣扎，通过传送门走过你一路奔波的每个角落。然后默默按下重新开始，抱着侥幸心理希望这次能够顺利点，但是当你来到第三颗自然之力碎片时，你又特么绝望了，这怪物脑瓜子上明晃晃的10级让你一下子就慌了。尼玛的老子不玩了，但是老子来不及退款。只能等作者更新。你特么倒是赶紧修复BUG啊。给我出个小花池子是特么什么意思?老子的自然之力碎片猴年马月能够敲下来？？老子精心布置的小镇就特么这么毁了。我要这铁镐有何用？

并且我能带的小弟比我等级低也就算了，为啥就能带一个？你可知道我一个人在这荒岛上有多么寂寞。？不限制小弟数量出去打架后面一群小弟那是多么惬意，多么威武？并且小弟不能够升级这一点实在是太木讷了。还有自己圈养的动物能不能一次多喂点儿？能不能出个喂食槽子？稻草人有啥用？？？能不能出一个帮助收庄稼和种庄稼的东东？老子能不能有个衣柜。你觉得我把衣服放在木桶子里不打辙吗？还有那砍不完的小草堆咋就那么烦？什么时候加入交通工具？给个自行车骑一骑也行啊。不是已经有车链子这个物件了吗？ 还有游戏中的光源能不能照远一点？我能不能有个火把带着？那夜视药水怎么就带点巫术色彩呢？传送门也很科幻啊？

好的消息是作者一直在不断更新，出更多的新建筑，中文支持也是全游戏内容，只不过刚才举例的：“当前等级才不能够获得自然之力碎片“。以及一些游戏内物品名称，确实有待更改。极有可能作者合作的中文翻译是特么个湾湾。

It's a simple thing and many games of the same genre might have done it, but there are also quite many that don't.

Other than that, the game's progression is good, more advanced stuffs are accessible after leveling up, and each level feels like a big achievement with all the new stuffs that always bring more advantage for progressing further, even though some people say that it's grindy, it is grindy in a good way, and it gets a lot easier than before because of the new accessible stuffs. 

I like how the animals behave in this game, especially when being hunted, when their HP is low, most of the time they will run, it reminds me of hunting animals in Zelda BoTW where they run after being hit, it's similar here so we have to use bow after meleeing them. We might kill them and pick up the loots or we might lose them and lose some stamina and arrows. 

The combat mechanic needs a bit more explanation  like when using a trap, first hit will never catch them, but the second time shooting a trap to the same animal even though they already ran afar will trap them. It's quite fun so we'll have to be prepared to chase and aim. The aiming system is also confusing at first but will get used to it with more time spent.

The alchemy table is interesting with added mini experiment mechanic using ingredient dosage for getting the highest quality potions. I think that's really clever and original, never played any game with that kind of mechanic as far as I remember. 

This is a great game, small and cheap, nothing to lose having it in your steam library and the system requirement is also low, so it can be played on alt pc, maybe even on a tablet. 

I hope there will be an expansion for this game or more quests because once I've completed the game I will have no more reason to come back to it. It's a waste on the crafting system with the many recipes for stuffs, because there is no more incentive to keep crafting those stuffs if the game doesn't have any more content once we finished it.

The crafting system is also very clever, there is no wasted stuffs, everything can be used for other things. The developer is a genius. Also there is no respawn for resources, once it's chopped or gathered it's gone forever, but the whole map is full of resources, it's plenty enough to keep us stocked until beating the game.",1512290339,1512529642,True,8,0,0.612613141536712646,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ingredientes:

150 gramas de manteiga sem sal em temperatura ambiente
2/3 xícara (chá) de açúcar
2 colheres (chá) de essência de baunilha
Raspas de meia laranja (ou mais se quiser)
2 xícaras (chá) de farinha de trigo peneirada
1 pitada de sal
1/3 colher (chá) de fermento químico em pó (uma pontinha de colher)
2 colheres (sopa) de leite ou suco de laranja (só se precisar)

Preparo:

1. Misture a manteiga com o açúcar até formar uma pastinha, eu usei uma colher mesmo.
2. Acrescente o sal, as raspas, a baunilha e misture.
3. Acrescente a farinha de trigo, o fermento e misture com a mão, se sentir que a massa não está bem unida, adicione o leite ou suco.
4. A massa não pode grudar nas mãos e também não pode ficar seca.
5. Envolva em um plástico e deixe descansar uns 15 minutos na geladeira se estiver calor.
6. Abra a massa em uma bancada bem enfarinhada com espessura de mais ou menos meio centímetro. Não pode ficar muito grossa porque cresce um pouquinho.
7. Corte os biscoitos e coloque-os com um espaço de 2 cm na assadeira forrada com papel manteiga, não precisa untar.
8. Asse em forno pré aquecido a 180 graus, por mais ou menos 10 minutos, fique de olho quando o biscoito dourar nas bordas, está pronto.

На данный момент я  уже наиграл почти 14 часов и могу сформировать определенную оценку.
Плюсы:
Игра на типе The Forest для экономных компов.
Основная часть в добыче ресурсов и файтинге.
Присутствуют определенные задания, которые мотивируют тебя продвигаться в крафтинге, и добыче ресов.
Как уже ранне было отмечено другими комментаторами - звуки природы реально погружают в атмосферу.
Игра действительно стоит своих денег - если будет скидка, то считайте, что повезло.
Минусы:
Система боев хоть и простая, но нудная.
Основной сюжет, как таковой отсутствует, лишь присутствуют задания, которые непонятно из какого события вытекают. Например: собери компас и тот сразу укажет куда нужно идти.
Отсутствует логика (Пример с компасом)

Таким образом, я составлю вывод следующий.
Если вам надоели игры с красивой графикой, захватывающими сюжетами или же игры, в которые играете постоянно (Dota 2 CS Go), то ради расслабона и небольшого убивания времени можете поиграть в эту игру. 

Я сам студент 2 курса и у меня стало мало времени для игр, но после жестких пар, написания курсача (определенной страницы), я довольствуюсь парой часов, отдыхай за этой игрой.

- If you like crafting, and you're the type of gamer that usually indulges in MMORPGs' crafting systems, this is the game for you!
The CONS: 
- The combat system is a little bit too simplistic, but I'm sure it can and possibly will be improved with time and support. Do keep in mind, though, that battling creatures is more of a means for acquiring materials for crafting rather than a scope/rewarding experience by itself; also, it is quite challenging, and you will definitely need to gear up and skillfully consume ""potions"" (cocktails and bananas, that is) during combat in order to avoid death.
The PROS:
- In a way its core concept kind of reminds me of those simple puzzle games for mobile phones where you had to find all the combinations of elements and derivatives in order to create refined objects and such, with the great improvement that you have an avatar with RPG elements within this very nice precedurally generated environment of a delightful deserted island all at your disposal. A real treat for any wonna-be-stranded-on-deserted-island-self-sufficient-adventurer type of person! :)
- Since the crafting system is the core aspect of the game, let me assure you that it is well balanced and rewarding. You will find yourself running to and from the water well while you wait for sheep and cows to produce wool and milk, meanwhile trying to plant and harvest as much wheat and whatnot as fast as you can while the campfire produces coal for the foundry which itself is running at full speed and still in need of more coal, and this, and that, and all the numerous other things you have to bear in mind in order to keep production running steady.
- shooting those lame foxes while they're running away from you after a few hits is extremely satisfying, also

That being said, there are SO many things that just hold this game back from being truly enjoyable.

1. Why.does.everything.take.FOREVER.to craft? I realize its a survival game, but I also realize that no one wants to wait 20 minutes for just enough coal to be finished to craft ONE ingot of metal. especially if you need like 5.

2. Basic combat is fine, but only if theres a sense of danger left. even with hordes of enemys attacking there is little to no chance of you being defeated, so mostly, combat only distracts you from walking from A to B.

3. Standard things like crates to store Items should NEVER require high tier materials like nails and metal ingots. Imagine playing Minecraft and having to find Iron bevor you can craft a simple chest (that then holds like a quarter of what your character inventory holds)

4. It is very unintuitive and makes you feel claustrophobic at times that you are not able to look higher than the horizon. This also influences not being able to aim higher while using bow and arrow to compensate the drop which goes against EVERY normal gamers instincts.

5. Having Stamina instead of tool decay is a fresh of breath air. It doesnt help though if your constantly run out of it because your fighting unnescecery hoards of mobs that pose no danger and only resutls in you having to wait for your stamina to refill to continue travelling.

6. Obvious stretchers and fillers resourcewise (e.g. one piece of burlap needs 3 wool to craft. a sheep wields 2 wool per shearing. one cup of coffee needs 5 coffeebeans. a plant yields 4 beans per harvest and so on)

7. Inabillity to get to far away from each other in multiplayer. Good times when you could split up and multitask (one player looting, one staying in base crafting) but have to sit arround in the base together waiting 30 minutes for 15 steaks to be cooked.

Sadly, it's implemented too poorly to earn it a spot on my list of favorites.

There are far too many unpolished mechanics that make the game too frustrating to play, all of which could be over looked if it weren't for the primary flaw of the title and the ultimate reason I choose to not recommend this game - 

It's a resource based game with incredibly scarce resources. Everything requires a metal, and a lot of it, and metal is no where to be found.

Normally, this isn't a problem. A game that forces you out of your base and forces expansion is good except that monsters are super dangerous and drain your stats pretty heavily. This requires you to put an extrodinarily high effort into domestic efforts for fighting fuel and those efforts, while enabling you to explore and gather, don't yield particularly bountiful results. For every 5 mins you plan to spend outside of your ""base"" you have to spend 15 preparing consumables.

Which brings us to the scarces resource of all - your time. 

Instead of EXP, you're given a honey-do list for leveling up. Once the honey-do list is done, you're given a list of materials/resources you'll need to actually gain the level that you've already earned. This list is almost always entirely too long. 

Perhaps the biggest problem with that concept is how early it's implemented. Before you can even wear a full suit of basic leather/fur armor, you're hit with a leveling wall that will require an hour or more of gameplay. Before you can even shuck the stone tools you're using, you have to learn how to forge a bronze sword which is surprisingly not much more effective than the piece of wood you've been pounding your enemies to a pulp with at a rate that could rival only the velocity of a glacier.

Plain and simple, this game does not respect your time. With a few tweaks, it could be one of the most amazing sandbox survival titles on the steam store. Sadly, I'm not sure we'll ever see those tweaks made.",1509698667,1509698778,False,50,6,0.777315258979797363,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- combat multiples: les ennemis sont attroupés et s'appellent les uns les autres pour augmenter la foule... déjà qu'à un monstre c'est la misère...
- endurance: vous en manquerez plus que vos points de vie, et il faudra manger sans arrêt pour la faire remonter;
- système de level up: en plus des quêtes, vous devrez remplir certaines conditions dont entre autre obtenir des cristaux (drops sur les montres à 10% de chance...)

ソロで3時間ほど、フレンドと３時間ほどやって二人で思ったのが
「サバイバルキッズ感あるよな」
でした。
道具を作り作物を育て家畜から食品加工やら色々サバイバルキッズ感あってフレンドと自分は好感触でした。

グラフィックに関しては粗い感じですが低スぺPCでもできることを考えればかなりいい点だと思われます（グラよくても面白さは変わらないので）


それからマルチの使用に関して
本来ソロでクエストを進める場合全部自分でアイテムを採取して加工して～...という流れですが
マルチでは誰かがアイテムもって入れば全員分のクエスト完了します（施設関係も同様に）

これに関しては個人的にはありかなと思いますが、別々に分けてレベルを個人個人で分けてもよかったかな？

悪い点について一つ
行動範囲ですが、二人が離れすぎているとそれ以上遠くにいけなくなります、ですので遠出する際には必ず一緒に行かなければ行動できないのが困った仕様でした
それに伴い、どちらかが死亡するとフレンドも一緒に初期リスに戻されます。

Some people talk about it being tedious to grind resources, but I dont want to be spoon-fed progress. It can take whatever time it takes. 

Overall pretty ok game. 

Movement is ok, but would be better if you could move a bit faster. Swinging your weapon while moving would be an improvement. The creatures/monsters/whatever are faster than you. Meaning, if they decide to flee, which some do, you're not gonna catch em. 

Shooting with a bow is a joke, melee is the way to go in this game right now. A bit silly that you cant move through some fauna, but interesting at the same time, wouldn't say I like it, but wouldn't say I dislike it either. 

I refunded the game, but would not have, if there was a proper multiplayer. No multiplayer games available, and if you want to host your own, its for 2 people. so you and one friend. If this was like 50+ people on a server with a couple of servers to choose from, I'd have kept the game. Because lets face it, Sandbox games are not fun on singleplayer. 

A bit more work on movement/combat, and implementing proper multiplayer, and I'll def give this game a go again. Until then, hold on to your wallets, and go spend 8 Euro's on icecream for your kids or something. 

Also worth mentioning, If the game had a proper multiplayer, I would have no problem with the pricetag being 30 Euro's instead of the 8 it is right now. A price tag is irrelevant when it comes to a great game, which I do believe this has the potential to become.

Firstly lets talk about the negative points. 

It took me 54 hours to complete. Although I didn't hurry, I didn't waste time as well. And around 70% of that time was spent to harvest raw materials and convert them to what I need. The game IS tedious, as many people mentioned. If you dont have alot of time to burn, stay away from this game

It was also very annoying to harvest until lvl 9, where you get iron pickaxe and axe. Too much material is needed, and axe swings too slow. Although harvesting gets faster after lvl 9, I was already sick of it by then. 

You cant Run! And it is maddening. Everything in the game is faster than you from bears to goblins to chickens. There is stamina, and you spend it for almost everything, why no run?

It is not realistic. Now this what people likes to talk about alot, for a survival game it is too unrealistic and unbalanced (not only combat, but also things like growing plants). HOWEVER, this is not a survival game.  Yeah I though so as well before re-checking. As mentioned its more like a management game. And you manage...your time...your off game time. Its like ""I should do this to finish the game faster"".

Then why like the game?

1. I had alot of time.
2. The game requires very little PC specs. It is good for old machines as well.
3. After 20th hour our so you get used to the slow axe and slow walk speed. That is, what was a problem back then you get used to it, and focus other things. Like gathering your water in time so it won't go waste.
4. It is fun to build a village size settlement from the scratch.
5. Realism demand was forsaken fast enough (This one is important!).
6. The keeps 650 MB or so in hard disk. For such a small area, it provides a huge map (less than 40% was explored) and alot of play time.
7. Most flora, from trees to stones, from palm to bushes, can be broken and harvested.
8. Very reasonable price. Price/PlayTime ratio is very good.",1508080758,1508080758,True,57,2,0.837556540966033936,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have payed two or three times the amount for games that provided less enjoyment. Even most of those giving the game a negative review got more than their money's worth when you look at the number of hours they played.

Keep in mind this is an indie game, but the graphics are very well done. The multiplayer is very limited but it has been a blast to play with a single friend. It is an open world management survival game. Kind of a hybrid of world or warcraft and rust (minus the multiplayer aspect). It is a grind, which I loved. If you prefer a game with high volume action and immediate gratification, then this may not be for you. On the other hand, if you prefer the games where you grind to build up your level/status, inventory, and abilities, then this game is perfect. As you improve your tools you will be able to upgrade the layout of your base and make material generation more productive. There are PLENTY of resources in the world so getting materials has not been an issue. Most of the important materials you can eventualy manufacture in your base, or are in abundant supply through out the world. Use of portals allows you to setup quick travels to points in the world you deem important. If any of this sounds interesting, you can not go wrong at the price point for this game.

15 hours later I am writing a review of this game that has had me playing every available moment the last 2 days. Most of it has been quite enjoyable, with a few hicups in design that keep me from giving it a 10/10.

The game opens with you wearing nothing but the clothes on your body at the time, and what you have is in tatters. Collecting local resources you are able to build basic tools with the help of a nice quest/turtorial system. Within a couple of hours you have your first building and crafting structures. The level of satisfaction I had with each level unlocked and each new tool or building was palpable. The pacing is just that good. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes surival games with rpg elements. I have been glued to it for the last few days and I have yet to get bored. WELL worth the money.

Overall Score: 9/10

Pros - 

Ability to destroy nearly every environment object in game

Ability to move placed objects easily, streamlining build fuctions and removing resource penalties for mistakes in settlement design

Well balanced game progression. Every new tool, weapon, and armor feels significant and affects the experience.

DEEP crafting system, so many things can be created and the progression is very logical and thought out.

Player determined teleports!


Cons - 

Tool usage could be greatly improved with a tool box kept in your settlement that allows all tools to be shared vs needless tool management that slows down crafting

Bien que le démmarage du jeu puisse être problématique (voir note plus bas) le jeu n'en reste pas moin très plaisant, beaucoup de travail (de beau travail) à été fait et une bonne complexité de fabrication est introduite au jeu,

Je n'ai vu aucun ""lags"" durant mes essaie, l'aide en jeu est excellent, graphiquement bien aussi et tout est bien expliquer..., (très beau travail des traducteur aussi qui ont donner de leur temps et, qui graçe à eux nous permettent de jouer en français..., sinon je ne l'aurais jamais acheté)

les constructions ne sont pas tout à fait comme je le pensais, par exemple pour les maisons, on ne peut pas bâtir les murs et tout, c'est du pré-construit, et les maisons sont très petite, mais à part ça, il est possible de faire un beau petit village pour nous même avec de belle décoration,

un excellent jeu pour ceux qui aime la fabrication de choses, les combats ne sont pas complexe et l'inventaire est très bien fait, bien sûr je n'ai pas tout tester le jeu au complet, mais le concept du jeu nous donne le choix de commencer le jeu avec ou sans aide, mieux vaut suivre l'aide si on ne connaît pas le jeu..., car si on commence directement avec le niveau sans aide, les achèvements Steam semble être désactiver aussi (de ce que j'ai vu), car je n'ai testé le mode sans aide que quelque temps avant de revenir au mode avec aide pour accomplir les achèvements Steam...

Le jeu n'est pas complexe car il ne tient pas en compte la faim, la soit ou le besoin de repos, la nourriture (très diversifier), et le lit ne servent que de source de regain d'énergie qui elle est dépensé durant les actions faite, tout est graphiquement bien représenté, les bananier ont l'allure de bananier, et les cocotier aussi, ect..., les lapins aussi sont très jolie à regarder, les attraper sans toujours manger que leur poussière seulement est une autre histoire par contre ha ha ha

Il n'y à pas de monstre dans le secteur du départ et vous pouvez y construire votre base sans problème, mais si vous vous éloigné un peu vous y verrai des goblins et autre animaux qui vivre tous ensemble dans le seul but de vous détruire... (tous des jaloux de mon beautiful body ha ha ha)

le jeu m'a surpris quelque fois durant mes recherche d'élément, comme par exemple en fouillant le sol pour prendre de la terre noir, j'y ai déterrer des vers de terre, ce qui m'a fait voir qu'il y avait de la pêche dans le jeu (pas tester), mais on peut prendre du poissons, ect, bien pensé, car je ne suis pas amateur de soupe aux vers de terre ha ha ha

pour les constructions, une fois faites, il est possible de les changer de plaçe sans les détruire, ect.., le positionnement des batiments est excellent, on nous donne une grille autour de notre avatar et on choisi l'endroit et on peut changé l'orientation du bâtiment, système très bient fait... 

Ha!, avant de l'oublier, plusieur semble se questionner à savoir comment capturer un goblin pour le faire combattre à nos côté, et bien j'ai fait quelque recherche et la réponse est la suivante :

quand vous voyez un goblin, faite baisser sa santé de moitié environs, ensuite utilisé l'outil (genre de fillet) pour capturer les animaux, mais n'abandonner pas, vous devrez lui envoyer environs six fois le filet correctement dessus avant qu'il ne cesse de le cassé et ensuite vous faite comme avec les animaux une fois qu'il sont dans le piège, et voilà, vous avez un nouvel ami très laid...

[b][u]Problème possible lors du lancement du jeu :[/u][/b]

Pour commencer, cette partie n'est pas une évaluation du jeu, mais plus un resultat de petit test effectuer vite fait avec le démarage du jeu qui peut être problématique...,

les notes que j'inscrit ici ne sont que pour m'aider à me souvenir de tout les problèmes que j'ai pu rencontré avec le jeu (et une petite évaluation du début du jeu), et ainsi me souvenir des problèmes si je veut re-tester le jeu plus tard...

pour ceux qui lisent ceci, il n'y à rien de positif où négatif, seulement des évaluations de problèmes rencontré lors du lancement du jeu et/où des solutions trouvé aux problèmes,

je n'ai rien vu de majeur en tant que problème au départ mais plusieurs petit problèmes de départ qui finnissent par faire un casse-tête..., étant donné qu'il faut ce cassé la tête déja pour faire démmarrer le jeu et enrayé les problèmes mineur, je donnerais une note négative au jeu, mais vu le bon travail en jeu qu'il ont fait, le jeu mérite une bonne notes mais reste un problème qui je l'espère sera corrigé dans le futur par le créateur du jeu...

encore une fois, cette partie n'est pas une évalution du jeu mais une évaluation de testeur ha ha ha..., pour me rappeller qu'avec ce jeu je doit faire çi et ça pour qu'il fonctionne bien...

[b][u]Problème # 1 :[/u][/b]
La souris n'est pas configurable pour modifier les touche du jeu, seul les commande de la souris inscrit par le créateur sont autorisé, donc même si on veut configurer une souris à 5 boutons, c'est impossible, et comme les commandes de la souris n'y sont pas (sauf pour la vitesse de mouvement de l'écran), diffiçile de connaître les commandes utilisé dans le codage en dur..., (j'aurais aimé pouvoir ajouté mes propre commandes à la souris, plutôt que d'utiliser le clavier pour certaine action...)

[b][u]Problème # 2 :[/u][/b]
Pour ceux qui joue en version français, les écritures dans le jeu sont parfait, avec les accents et tout, mais quand vient le temp d'écrire quelque chose dans le jeu, il est impossible d'utilisé les accent dans le jeu , (note : ceci est souvent du à un codage unique pour clavier anglais seulement (America first, fuck the other, comme dirais Trump), puisque les fichiers de langues sont indépendant du fichier jeux pour les traduction...)

[b][u]Problème # 3 :[/u][/b]
Si vous démmarer le jeu avec le raccourci que Steam installe sur le bureau, il est fort probable que beaucoup de gens soit incapable de voir l'eau dans le jeu, ou que l'écran passe sont temps à s'intiller...,

ceci est du à cause du ""Direct X 9"", la solution est d'aller dans notre liste de jeu et de démarrer le jeu en ""Direct X 11"" à chaque fois..., (Il devrait mettre cette option du choix du ""Direct X"" dans les option du jeu et non seulement sous le menu des commande Steam avant de lancé le jeu...)

Donc, je continue..., mais mettre le jeu en ""Direct X 11"" cause une autre erreur pour ceux qui veulent jouer en format ""Plein écran"", le jeu crash à sa sortie la première fois à cause de cette erreur du ""log file""... :

""You may not release a swap chain in full-screen mode because doing so may create thread contention (which will cause DXGI to raise a non-continuable exception). Before releasing a 
swap chain, first switch to windowed mode.""

donc la solution est d'aller dans les options d'écran du jeu et de mettre le format d'écran à ""lancer le jeu en mode fenêtré plein écran"", ceci corrigera le problème de plantage où de gel temporaire de l'ordinateur quand on essaie de quitter le jeu...,

Le jeu semble vraiement plaisant mais comme il n'est pas en ""Early acces"", ce genre de problème ne devrait même pas exister,

pour le clavier sans accent où la souris non configurable, on peut vivre avec, mais pour les problèmes de directX et en plus qui nous oblige de charger le jeu autre que par l'îcone Steam sur le bureau, ça fait non professionnel...,

Ha oui!, j'allait oublier, n'essayez pas de faire un racourci de la version de démmarage du fichier du jeu ""ForceOfNatureDX11.exe"", cela ne fonctionne pas car Steam vous bloque lors du lancement du jeu, vous devez absolument passer par Steam aller dans votre liste de jeu, choisir le jeu faire un clique droit et choisir ""démmarer avec directX11..., maintenant vous pourrez voir l'eau et vous pourrez quitter le jeu sans ""crash"" où gel de l'ordinateur, avec dirrectX11.",1507514826,1507526576,True,25,3,0.682786643505096436,4,True,False,False,False,,,

I do think that the game should have a running mechanic, but if you keep yout stamina and health high you should be fine.

- Медведя можно убить настучав ему дубиной по башке.
- Реген здоровья происходит путём обжирания грибами и ягодами по-Довакиновски.
- ГРЁБАНЫЙ УГОЛЬ. Чтобы насобирать угля нужно КАМЕННЫМ топором прорубить поляны 3 с соснами. Потом его ещё и обжегать кучу времени. На 2 части руды 5 частей угля, я калёную сталь чтоль делаю?

An sich bin ich äußerst leicht zu beeindrucken, weshalb ich mir trotz relativ negativer Resonanz dieses Spiel kaufte.
Da es sich lediglich um 16 Minuten handelt,kann ich keine sonderlich Handfeste Review verfassen, möchte euch aber dennoch gerne meine Meinung mitteilen.

[b] Grafik [/b]
Die Grafik eines Spieles, dürfte niemals ein Kaufargument sein, jedoch sieht dieses Spiel schlechter aus als einige der ersten PlayStation 1-Titel, was nicht verwerflich wäre, wenn die eingeschränkte Sichtweite nicht so verdammt nervig wäre.
Ich fühlte mich seit Beginn des Spieles so, als würde ich eine billige, nicht gruselige Silent Hill Mod des ersten Teiles spielen.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Das Gameplay basiert überwiegend auf dem typischen ""sammeln und craften""-System, wie es derzeit in jedem zweiten Spiel zu finden ist. Allerdings hat das in diesem Spiel auch nur bedingt geklappt.
Eine kleine, aber auch schwerwiegende Sache, die dafür sorgte, dass ""flüssiges Gameplay"" hier kein Stück vorhanden ist, ist dass man nach öffnen des Inventares nicht mehr in der Lage ist, seine Kamera zu bewegen. Vielleicht stört das aber auch nur mich.

[b] Fazit [/b]
Kriegt dieses Spiel meine Kaufempfehlung?
 - Auf keinen Fall
Habe ich viel Spielerfahrung sammeln können?
 - Nicht wirklich.

- Brak możliwości sprintu, lub skoku. Poruszanie się przypomina hybrydę Morrowinda i Gothica. 
- Ślamazarne animacje, przypominające te same tytuły co wymieniłem.
- Niezbalansowana walka, która sprawia, że przetrwanie jest zbyt proste.
- Grafika wygląda dobrze tylko z rzutu od góry. Po przełączeniu na standardową widzimy mgłe i nie wiele więcej. Widać pod względem grafiki twórcy bardzo inspirowali się... początkiem 2000s. 

Za 20 zl jakość lepsza niż gry z biedry, a bobawić się na coopie zawsze fajnie. Głównym plusem gry jest to, że zaciekawia a nie irytuje. Jeżeli twórcy zdecydują się na jej dynamiczne usprawnianie to może wyjść z niej jedna z najlepszych opcji w tym przedziale cenowym.

sorry if my english is broken

- animation still need to be rework, 
- i think stamina sucks, please remove it from the game. but if stamin for running, i think it still ok. (then add running for the character) 
- add other need, like comfortness/sleep (can use tent), hunger, fear of night it will raise the intense, and more fun in mutiplayer :D
- instead preparing for battle at beginning of game, i think prepare the character for the settle the home first instead. 
- fuel for the bon fire, add small realistic for fun :D
- and for crafting, i think we dont need to wait the process, come on, just skip it
- pay with resourcer for level up? hm, i think better add leveling up for strengh, agility, logic and these point gain trhough the game, like chopping trees, walking. and these point  will effect of crafting option, open new area, braveness, accuracy. 
- camera view make people dizzy, (motion sickness), add more option to the camera, 
- cant use item while seeing inventory, i wanna see my item while digging stuff
- dont need small quest, make it more interesting like (prepare for defending your self from the beast, or conquer this temple, bla bla) i dont need to be taught to make some rope, let me find my way. 
- really? coin? 

i know it still under develop, i hope your game will getting better and better :D

Le"" leveling"" du personnage est beaucoup trop rigide, trop linéaire et au final un peu inutile puisqu'il permet seulement de dévérouiller de nouveaux crafts, dispensable en bref.
Les différents biomes sont donc très répétitifs et on ne les explorera que contraint et forcé puisque toutes les resources nécessaires (sauf les gemmes et les roses) se trouve dans l'environnement de départ. L'exploration est donc le gros point noir du jeu.

While I DO recommend this game, as it does have ALOT of potential, I do still have to give it a pretty poor rating.

First off: Survival game... NO RUN FUNCTION!... What? In any survival game sprinting is a must. Why? Are you really gonna walk when something or somebody is trying to murder you? No, if your life is on the line you're going to downright haul ass. If you're out hunting and your, now wounded, prey runs off are you going to walk after it? No. It'll get away. As it ALWAYS DOES in this game as of right now.

Second: Tedious as fuck! Now to be fair, you can start a craft and walk away. But the material farming is dredgingly slow and the count of materials from each source will have you pulling down on the sides of your face making your eyes bulge out. Sticks and Palm tree leaves should be explosively abundant. But, compared to any build costs, they are a tedious grind to gather as many as you need. A good, quick fix for this is simply to up the amount dropped from each source. Instead of a single tree only giving 6 sticks have it give 12 to 15 and take 2 to 4 fewer sqings to bring the tree down. Instead of 7 palm leaves, 10 and it takes 1 swing to bring the bush down. Unless the Dev meant this game only for children, most adults usually have full time jobs, sometimes multiple jobs, and thus don't have the time for a slow ass grind. I've been playing for almost 4 hours and have only managed to get as far as building my first hut.

Third: Swinging like a... I dunno, even the girliest of girls can swing an axe faster than that. I mean, do I really need to elaborate on this one? The player character hits really damn hard but swings soooo frickin slow, while you, the Dev, have the enemies swinging at a believable speed but hitting for much less damage and with weapons that are clearly superior to my Cudgel. Goblin with a war axe anyone? And the frickin bear!? I'm sorry, I would NOT fight a bear with a stick off the ground! The bear should hit ALOT harder. It's a fucking bear! 600+ pounds of ""I'MMA EATCH YUH!"" Easy fix you say? Sure, speed the player characters attack up and bring the damage down a bit, then make that bear into a proper beast. Honestly, for a naked guy with a stick the bear should kill the player in 2 hits. It's a fuckin bear!

After only 4 hours, that's really all I have found to complain about, though I'm looking forward to a female model. Just saying. But anyway, the game is really pretty, so far I love the designs and graphics and I am already in love with the simpler elements of the crafting system. The grid assisted placement is very nice, my OCD approves. The fact that most everything is breakable is nice. I can build wherever the hell I bloody well please.

That being said, I DO recomment this game as I have high hopes for it.

A few things I'd like to see added in are:

Sprinting, faster character movements, quicker material farming to reduce the tediousness, female models, modding support(modding support only helps), and maybe set it up so two or more of the same building piece will join together to form 1 big building piece(but still count as multiple building pieces). This way we can have a bigger home if we want, instead of just a bunch of smaller homes. ( I'm gonna feel dumb is that's already a thing and I just hadn't played long enough to see it yet )

Is the game worth $7.99 as it sits now? Yeah, I think 8 bucks is a fair price for it in it's current state. But with the 3 issues I listed above down right killing the game play, I do have to rate the game about a 6 out of 10 as they badly drag the immersion and enjoyability way down. Hopefully the Dev reads the reviews and takes people's input to heart as I AM enjoying this game and hope to see some of the improvements I've recommended.

17 hour review update:

So I've been playinmg for 17 hours now and can no longer recommend this game. Good looks is about all it has going for it. Material harvesting is still a slow as hell grind that doesn't leave you feeling accomplished at all. Enemy balance is beyond laughable, a goblin warrior with an axe is less of a threat than a naked man with a club AND A FOX! Yes, a tiny fox is more of a threat to the player than a goblin and a bear is barely more of a threat than a fox, dealing the same damage but taking a whole 3 more hits to kill. The painfully slow movement speed has me falling asleep just trying to run from one side of my base to the other, and my base is pretty cramped up tight mind you. The collision boxes for trees create ALOT of invisible walls between tree trunks and small bushes can not be ""pushed aside"" by the player. You run up to a shrubbery and can not pass through it, which makes moving across the map a HUGE pain in the ass as you constantly have to switch between your sword, which is barely more useful than your club, and your axe to chop down small bushes and shrubbery. OH, and let's not mention the fact that a sword CAN NOT cut through shrubberies and sunflower seed stalks.... What?

I don't know what is wrong with this developer's head, but this game is NOT worth money. It has great potential, but at this point I can only see it reaching that potential if the current developer steps away and allows some one else to take over. Take your money somewhere else.",1506656987,1508079064,False,45,7,0.709403693675994873,6,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't even mind how simplistic combat is... but where this game lost me, is traps.
To begin with, a net that you have throw at a moving target is in no way ""a trap"", but changing the name of the object to ""net"" still wouldn't have helped when you need to use it to capture animals with required materials (eggs, milk, wool) and it literally always fails the first time, even the people who talk in the forum about how they've got it all figured out, say it always takes them at least 2 traps to catch anything... and to do so, they use one, then have to chase down the animal that is now fleeing and hit it with a trap while it is running, then run over to it and get it tamed before it breaks free again...
After repeatedly playing up to the point I needed to trap something (both in the general mode (linear progression) and creative (almost open progression)) and going through 30-60 traps Not catching a single animal, I am ready to give up on this game entirely. If they fix this aspect of the game I might give it another shot, I like solo survival crafting games, but right now...

Warning don't buy the 2nd game Force of Nature 2, From its key changes and almost everything is even worse than this game!  CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECT ARMOR, such a weird idea.
 Another game fixed with the Stamina cheat used in \The Wild Eight that for sure. 
 MAJOR COMPLAINT IS CO-OP BROKEN because if we had Co-Op at lest it will help in the poor balanced issue helping each other! ""Not Fun or No replay value to this game.""
#2:No reason for night to be so long at all in games other than wasting our time and if they had a sleeping bag to sleep and speed it up night but no we another poor game idea.
#3: No other reason for not allowing us to build or set a light when enemy is near, other then to instill aggression and anger in the player another corrupt idea.

I read another review that said it got boring very quickly. I thought I didn't mind the complex survival/build/strategy type games so I could overcome a degree of 'boring'... but ouch. It gets boring very quickly.

VERY nice looking game. Love the free look, movement and graphics. The GUI is clean and friendly enough (Although why I have to 'take all' for items i built with my own hands.. I have to take them off myself before I can use them? Really?) however the system for finding and obtaining recipes seems long winded. Multiple clicks to get to what you need just helps make the game boring quicker. I found that the fog of war some people are complaining about to be pefectly fine, could be stretched out a bt further but meh.

The heirachy system of building items is very good and very complex so if you like a good depth of options and different constructions this is a pretty sweet little time waster.

Unfortunately for me it just felt like that, a time waster. The tedious amount of work required to get to the higher levels of the construction heirachy are painfully laborious. I didn't even get to the first palm leaf hut before I was wondering how I could put up with the collection of the resources required to build a proper wood or brick house! For example the first basic hut requires something like 20 logs, 40 sticks (I think?), 50 palm leafs... among other things like nails (which I can't even be bothered to explain the process to get to them!). To put this in perspective, to obtain palm leaves you either kick a palm tree or chop one down. Going with kicking seems sensible so you don't kill your resource. Kicking ten times gives about 1-4 leaves. So walking around to every palm tree, kicking, collecting, move, repeat, it takes some time to get that basic resource... you see where I'm going.

I imagine once you get your systems in place it would work out streamlined but I could see by the scarce rocky outcrops and the little metals they yeilded meant that travelling far and wide to collect higher end resources was going to grind me down. That was when I pulled the pin.

Combat.... is just awkward and pointless. There should be an option to switch of foes (maybe there is I didn't go that far into it)

I wanted to like the game and I certainly do like aspects of it but it is just too tedious. It's more like a job than a game.",1506151119,1506151119,False,36,2,0.721655845642089844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Finally, if this were a $30 game, then I would expect a lot more from it. But it only costs $7.99! This isn't the type of game where you grind for a month straight.

Crafting is excessively grindy and tedius, even for a game in this genre. The most basic materials like coal or nails need an excessive amount of time and resources to make, resulting in an excessive amount of time spent grinding for materials with very little payoff.

Combat seems to be a massive afterthought, which wouldnt be a problem if it didnt happen so often. can't take five steps without getting swarmed by goblins you have to fight off with in depth ""hold the left mouse button"" gameplay.

Dying results in you losing a massive amount of supplies from your inventory, which again, could have taken you hours to accumilate.

The leveling system is by far the worst offender, not being able to craft things even though you have all the supplies to do so is incredibly frustrating, and not being able to level up without completeing a list of arbitrary tasks which require even more grindingfor supplies and materials just adds to that.

Для меня это один из важнейших показателей. Ну, помимо этого понравилось:
- красивые пейзажи
- отменная озвучка окружающего мира
- возможность построить так называемую ферму на острове практически с нуля, почувствовать себя Робинзоном.
- игра развивается, добавляется что-то новенькое постоянно.
- обилие всякой живности на острове от кроликов и курочек до каких-то огненных големов и смертей с косами мало кого оставит равнодушным.
Не понравилось:
- для повышения уровня персонажа нужно собирать определенные ресурсы. К примеру, для перехода на новый уровень нужно 10 золотых монет. И пошел лупешить гоблинов, а с них как назло одна медь сыпется. Иногда бесит.
- сюжетная линия не ахти. Какой-то мужик, который ничего не помнит, оказывается на непонятном острове, и малость остепенившись, бросается делать компас, который видит местонахождение неких элементов, которые ему необходимо собрать. Откуда он узнал про эти элементы неясно. И почему это стало его основной целью, а не, скажем, разработка планов того, как выбраться с этого острова.
- Не нравится то, что герой умирает, потом возрождается с небольшой потерей ресурсов, и ведется коллекция его смертей. Это основная причина того, почему я не прошел эту игру до конца. Накоплю  5-10 смертей и начинаю сначала. Я бы предпочел, чтоб герой на какое-то время терял сознание, а потом спустя пару дней восстанавливался на том же месте. Да, не совсем реалистично, но более реалистично, чем копить смерти.
Кого-то возможно напряжет, что герой только и может, что бегать, драться, рубить деревья, добывать руду, копать, стрелять из лука, ловить рыбу, а остальную работу(готовить на кухне, ковать в кузнице, шить, и т.п.) за него делают какие-то невидимки, ну, на мой взгляд, это мелочи.

日本語対応なんですが、エキサイト翻訳につっこんだ様な具合ですので、気になる人は購入は避けるべし。

ゲームとしては良くあるサバイバルもの。

良い点。
Lv制、クエストありなので、次の目標が立てやすい。
そこそこのグラフィックのため、あまり重くない。

悪い点。
敵はリポップするが、資源の再生システムはなし。
栽培可能な一部の植物、食べ物は畑で栽培できるものの、建築に必用な木材、石材は不可。
その為、初期エリアから敵のうろつく外部へと開けた穴は塞げず、死ぬもしくは寝るなどリポップ条件を満たすたびに敵の襲撃にあう。
建築物には強度があるため、襲撃も受け続けると壊れるのですが、破壊されてしまった物を修復するには+αの資材が必用という理不尽な流れが出来上がります。
穴を開ける場所は、よく考えたほうがよさそうです。

建築も資材を揃えて置き場を決めると、時間経過で自動で出来上がります。
自由度はマイクラに比べるとかなり落ちますね。

敵はソコソコの強さ。タイマンならこなせますが、複数にかこまれると防御ができないので厳しい。
デスペナとしてランダムで持参しているアイテムをロストしますので、敵と戦うときはご注意を。

自由に色々やりたいと思ってやると、ストレスがたまります。

Playing in “General Mode” limits the items you can craft based on your character’s current level. This make early game play challenging, but not in a good way. The items you can craft at the beginning are simply underpowered, and it’s not like you can farm materials to make stronger weapons and faster tools early on. You’ll encounter enemies that are not hard, but take a lot of swings to kill because of the weak weapons. Farming will become very redundant due to the slowness of the tools. You have to advance in a very linear way; it’s very anti-sandbox. The game does offer a creative mode that supposedly unlocks all building/items. 

Leveling is a little weird, you have to complete quests, which is fine. But you also have to collect resources (the same that you use to build things) are part of the requirements. Said resources are consumed when you level up. You have stats, and the only way to gain higher stats is to complete the quests and burn through resources. 

Draw / View distance. This game has a very limited draw and view distance; hiding un-rendered areas with fog. This makes the world feel very small.

This game has a weird handle on menus. submenus prevent access from their main menus; even when both menus are visible. You have to do a lot of menu juggling to get between menus. It's very clumsy, frustrating, and inconvenient.

All crafting benches require additional tools; and later on upgraded tools. It’s neat, but also requires a lot of busy work to collect the items necessary to build the tools, then the resources to build the benches.

You cannot personalize or change your character.

The English translation is a little rough; there are some grammar syntax errors that require you to read through a tool tip or quest multiple times to understand what it actually means. Some of the word usage is awkward, such as “Splinters”. You’ll actually collect some in the very first quest, and you’ll be like “Those aren’t really splinters… technically they are, but…”

Building is a little clumsy, you can’t rotate your view of the area, and camera control doesn’t feel natural. 

Camrea control in general is very clumsy.

Be prepared for a lot of walking around, micro management for item crafting, redundant and boring framing. Slightly overpowered, but not difficult to defeat enemies that are time sinks.",1504581135,1504581659,False,32,0,0.722688019275665283,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Being able to Destroy/Move old/garbage huts and replace them with better ones: I placed a trash hut at the beginning of the game in a good spot and was hoping I could replace it with a better one, I really hope this is changed in the future!

*THE NEXT FEW PROBLEMS I MENTION ARE ABOUT MULTIPLAYER WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN BETA, MY REVIEW WILL CHANGE WHEN NECESSARY*

Distance Limit from Other players: Currently you can only go a certain distance away from your fellow players in Multiplayer, I understand that rendering so much could be a problem, but I hope that the dev can find a way around this problem. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED IN A RECENT UPDATE!!! :D

Player limit in Multiplayer: Currently, you can have a max of 2 (its 4 now) Players in General Mode (Regular Survival with Quests) and 4 Players in Creative (Survival with all recepies, and no Quests). While again, this helps prevent preformance issues, I hope the dev can find a way to fix this.

But I do not consider this a standard crafting-survival game, so you need to think if it matches what you are looking for.

There are atamina and health meters, but they regenerate if you rest or eat.
There is food, but no hunger meter.
There are enemies, but your base is basically a safe place to rest and farm resources while you heal.

So if you are looking for a difficult survival game where everything attacks you when it gets dark, this game is not for you.
However, if like me, you are looking for a relaxing crafting game when YOU are the one that dictates the pace and progress speed, this is a great game to pass the time, and worth it even in development stages.

I do want some features that will help make this game more fun:
- The compass points to the relic, and that's fine, but it should also point to the north. Shouldn't be too hard to implement two needles.
- Minimap can be useful in navigation
- Better marking on the map to know where resources like iron are located, or an ability to mark places on the map and add notes to it.",1504381164,1504381164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

一日の長さの割には移動速度が遅いので、この辺も切り替えができるといいのではないかと個人的な主観です。

これからのアプデでアイテムが増えたり操作性の改善や誤訳直訳改善を期待します。
スタート画面から雑で誤訳満載なので、手探りからのクエスト感ですｗｗ

マルチのやり方が分からなすぎです。どうやったらマルチで遊べるのかそこがクエスト状態。
半日要してフレンドとマルチできましたがクラフト制限が解除されててお邪魔させてもらったプレイヤーがデフォルトになるようです。
同時にログイン、ログアウトで待ち合わせしないとマルチできません。
他プレイヤーと一定距離離れると移動不可能になり警告が出ますが、距離感が狭すぎてマルチでありつつも役割分担してのプレイはなかなか難しいところなのがとても残念です。
チャットもかなり不便で日本語対応していない、チャット画面をまるっとだしてからチャットをしますが、チャット画面でかすぎでした。＾＾；

- You can't move very far away from each other in multiplayer
- There's way too much grinding to get the materials you need to craft

Being just £6 i thought it was worth it as i love the genre. I like survival and craft games but i was not sure whether this would live up to the quality you'd except as some survival games nowadays are just following a trend and are'nt very great once you've played them but after playing this game when i should of been going to bed as i thought id try it out well lets just say 4 hours later in the early hours of the morning i was glad i brought this game. Ive only played it a total of 6 hours so far but i feel this game lives up to its genre.

You start being stranded on a beach and wonder how you got there then it literally throws you into survival mode, giving you quests and level ups along the way. Its quite fun if you like this type of game and i like how you can keep and farm animals but a word of warning never tame a sheep (any animal) near goblins....lets just say i had attack alerts going off constantly while i chased a group of goblins round who were chasing my sheep round, then the boars decided to join in....it did'nt end well and looked like something you'd watch while listening to the benny hill theme. My sheep however did survive and after a few attempts recused and brought back to my hut! 

The only negative thing i can say is that my worst enemy of the game is copper ingots! Omg they are annoying to make.
Other then that if you like survival crafting games, give this game a try, you should'nt be dissappointed!

My opinion: 8/10.

i made and equip all anti-environment equippment, but that's not enough,

It does have it's pros and con's 

Pro's
Easy Combat 
Good Controls 
Crafting will keep you busy for hours
Keeps you Entertained 
Nice rain Affects
Armor and weapons are nice
Weather affect is a nice touch



Con's
Constant Farming for materials can become boring and tedious
Aggro on emeies is out of Range they will swarm you half a mile away
To many trees in the forest areas you will spend hours whacking away trees and branches 
Animal run away to much causing aggro issues that can get you killed easily
Magic doesn't need to be here Altars etc
Needs more cooking recipies 
Needs more Armor to fight off cold weather
The map is pure shit but will help you
Poision remedy needs to be easier to obtain
Ending of game is shit

Now even with more nitpicking than positive I recommend this game it is very fun and can keep you entertained for hours on end. What would make this game a solid thumbs up I would get rid of the magic elements and turn this into a solid Castaway type game IT IS A VERY FUN GAME just a few things need tweaking.

This has got the right balance between crafting,building and bad stuff. In fact, it immediately pulled me in and kept me going until the early morning hours!  You can spend your time building, crafting, exploring without risking dying every 10 minutes. You don't have to die of thirst by refilling yourself with water every second or eating every minute. Your stamina is tied to how much work you do. More work, more stamina required. The nourishment then doesn't become some ridiculous kabuki theatre like certain other survivor games like Stranded Deep.

The game is truly progressive in that the more you engage and want to grow your base and character it will allow you to make the move. This will then allow you to craft more complex things including buildings, weapons, armour, farming. Capture sheep and start the important job of cultivating wool an important ingredient in armour and clothes. Increase the quality of your wearables and increase your character's armour rating. A very smart gentle nudging to move to bigger and better things. 

Graphics are just fine maybe understated but not pretentious. Brings back to mind the Ultima top down  series but more complex  and involved. Primarily survival but allows you to move to RPG areas without being in your face. 

It  then cleverly ties to character development and advancement  qua role playing. Playability is off the charts. Winner!",1502091812,1502303241,True,26,1,0.770655691623687744,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is grindy, monotonous, slow paced, graphics are meh, sound is basic as hell but for some strange reason it is very addictive.  Its got that... civilisation-one-more-turn feel to it.  What keep you going is all the cool stuff that opens up to you to craft once you level up.  The new gear means you can push further into the wilderness and see more biomes, loot and monsters.   

The interface is okay, could do with some more hotkeys here and there, but nothing too essential missing.  The sound is passable, at least its not too annoying.  one tip:  put the portal away from your main area, it has an annoying loud hum that made me turn down the game's volume and it can't be moved once placed.  The graphics are passable, its not cute, charming or beautiful, but does the job ok.  The movement of the player is a little slow, wish he can run faster.  You can't out run any of the creatures in the game really.  

NO, despite what other reviewers have said... no this game doesn't lend itself to roleplaying, its mechanics are too predictable, ""mechanical"" and linear for any meaningful roleplaying.  

Another complaint:  The pacing is haphazard, Thing were slow but steady until level 6 to level 7, it got super slow to level up with a bunch of hard to do quests and what is most annoying is the RNG required to get the 5 gold bars to levelup,  (To get gold bars you need gold coins drop randomly from goblins, this took absolutely forever at this stage.  Once you grind pass level 7, the RNG for getting gold is mitigated somewhat by the much better weapons you get at level 7 and so you are killing stuff much quicker.  I haven't done the level 7 quests yet, but they seem to have returned to reasonable again.   Hope it doesn't slow down again, its a slow going game that can feel like a glacial slog if it slows down any further, I was tempted to quit for the night during level 6.

The good:  Its a solid game, very tight, even though the level questing is linear there is room for variety in terms of the efficiency engine you want to create for yourself.  Not quite open-world variety, but what little there is makes your decisions feel important.  The loot is well thought out and nothing is obsolete and everything seems consequential.  The price is definitely a bonus.  Played this alone and probably wouldn't be a good multiplayer game with adult gamers (at least my gaming buddies, the pace is way too slow.  As a single player that is exceptable, I could be listening to music or something), but I could see this work with young kids though.  

Yes, I would recommend this game to those that enjoy an old school slow-paced linear leveling survival game that is well designed and tight and have a real addictive quality to it, then go for it, the price is fair.  If you want adrenaline pumping action, hair-pulling difficulty, or a game that is difficult to master, you are going to be disappointed.

normal mode its avatar gets tired, eating is required. 
like: food, combat
dislike: gamma being big issue. its too dark even with light mechanics.  Bomfire is brightest light resource in the game. 
Dislike 2: embers don't burn avatar which is question mark for me, ember storage is in your inventory? 
If there dose of real life you die.

 Personal opinion : your lucky there are saves, I seen games are unavailable. You have restart from beginning. So this game has saves functional and they load decently.

Habe sehr viele EInschätzungen und Bewertungen gelesen.
Diese haben mich inspiriert es auch zu kaufen und zu testen.

1.) Grafik ist nicht die beste ,,, daher für alle Grafikfetischisten FINGER weg:) Für mich i.O.  !
2.) Handling Steuerung ist sehr Gewöhnungsbedürftig , aber der Mensch ist ja ein .....lassen wir das , man kommt zurecht,            
      gewöhnt sich daran. Hoffe aber dennoch das sich die Kamara irgendwann mal noch ein wenig verändern lässt:)
3.) Story ( falls man es so bezeichnen kann) ist okay und motviert weiter zu machen bin jetzt lvl 7 kurz vor 8 hab mir da    
     echt  jetzt zeit gelassen, da es ab da natural Teile zu finden gibt , die bewacht werden...:-)
4. Kämpfe sind etwas stupide aber O.K. man muss halt auf passen und immer gut dabei haben, ich habe derzeit Brot  
     dabei gibt 40 Gesundheit in 20sec oder so plus meinem Kaffee der das selbe in Ausdauer macht. Also ""Stupides"" 
     ist zwar möglich, aber nur mit einem Gewissen Equip und genüged Vorbereitung. Dennoch muss man aufpassen, da
     weglaufen meist nicht hilft , ausser man kennt einige Tricks, was aber nich immer hilft. Mir machts spass!!!
5. Sound Kulisse Hindergrund sind okay , für mich passt es , da ich oft ne 12std. Schicht habe und danach einfach entspannen will sei es craften oder sammeln oder auch etwas fighten um an Gold zu kommen.:)
6.) Multiplayer ist in Vorbereitung, d.h. theoretisch funzt es  schon....muss das aber leider noch antesten mit nem Kumpel.

KLEINES GELD ..... GROSSER SUCHTFAKTOR!!!!   Erwische mich oft noch dabei  wo ich mir sage , ach nur noch die Bretter hertsellten die Hühner nochmals Füttern und nen Sprung zu den Kühen gehen . Ach etwas Holz fehlt noch  das mache ich  noch usw usw usw,
Für Zwischen durch und auch für länger durchaus geeignet meine Empfehlung bei einer skala von 1-10 (10 beste) wäre ich hier auf eine gute 7plus oder auch 8.
Klar gibt es  ""Conan"" ""ARK""! usw..... wer kennt das nicht. Aber das hier ist entspanned , wenn man will und es macht spasssss!

Survival? Nope!
Ein Survival würde implizieren, dass man reagieren muss, um sein Ableben zu verhindern ... also die Handlung des ""Überlebens"" tätigen ... 
Bei ""Force of Nature"" gibt es dafür weder die essentielle ""Hunger"", noch die ""Durst"" Anzeige ... sprich, man kann den ganzen Tag, gemütlich im Garten herum chillen ...

Und dort wo man beginnt, lauern auch keine Gefahren ... man könnte einfach da bleiben, wo man anfängt und es würde nichts passieren ...  diesen Ort zu verlassen, birgt nur das unnötige Risiko sich Gefahren auszusetzen ... warum sollte man sich das antun?

Ja, wären da nicht die sogenannten ""Quests"" ... und der Drang nach Belohnungen ...
Denn diese Quests sind der Grund, der uns nötigt, die Startlocation zu verlassen ...
Sie funktionieren ungefähr so:
1. Baue X
Um X zu bauen, musst du Y finden
2. Baue Z
Um Z  zu bauen, brauchst du 2 X

Und so weiter ... also begebt man sich quasi immer freiwillig in Gefahr, um seine Quests abzuschließen ...

Im Grunde genommen ist das für mich kein Survival, sondern ein Aufbauspiel ... mit Schwerpunkt auf

Etwas unfair, ein nachgereichtes Multiplayer-System, welches sich in der Bethaphase befindet, zu beurteilen, aber so ist der Stand der Dinge:

- Ein Spieler hostet die Welt, die er vorher alleine erstellt hat
(sprich, der beigetretene Spieler, kann diese Welt nicht alleine weiter spielen, sollte der Host off sein, umgekehrtes ist natürlich der Fall)

- Die Spieler dürfen sich nicht zu weit von einander entfernen, bzw. immer in Sichtweite bleiben, sonst ist da einfach eine undurchdringliche, unsichtbare Barriere.
Das bedeutet, man kann nicht sagen ""Du gehst Erz holen, ich baue hier weiter"" ... sondern nur ""Los, wir gehen Erz holen"" oder ""Wir bauen hier weiter""

- Programmiertechnisch spielt man eine Person, auf zwei Personen aufgeteilt.
Steigt Spieler 1 eine Stufe auf, steigt auch Spieler 2 eine Stufe auf
Stirbt Spieler 1, stirbt auch Spieler 2 ...

- Es gibt 2 Modi, einmal den ""Quest""-Modus, wo man alle Konstruktionen die man bauen kann, durch das abschließen von Quests freischalten muss, sprich ""Man hat Aufgaben"" ... und den ""Kreativ""-Modus, wo es weder Aufgaben, noch einschränkungen gibt, hierbei werden allerdings auch keine ""Errungenschaften"" freigeschaltet.
Allerdings kann man den ""Quest""-Modus nur alleine oder zu zweit spielen.

+ Sehr tiefes Craftsystem, hier kann man wirklich viele Dinge herstellen, bin ich von anderen Spielen nicht gewohnt

+ Für eine Zufällig-Generierte Welt, sieht das alles sehr gut aus. Wird für langanhaltenden spaß sorgen

+ Einzigartige, kreative Ideen ... Graben nach Ton, Zinn, Kupfer, Palmwedeln, Kokosnüsse, Sonnenblumenkerne, Kaffeebohnen, so viele Blumen und Pilzsorten ... und dazu noch ein Bauernhof Simulator ... alles in einem Spiel, für schlappe 8 Euro ... hier wurde vieles richtig gemacht

+ Alle Gegenstände die man fallen lässt, werden grafisch als auf dem Boden liegende, 3 Dimensionale Gegenstände als das dargestellt, was sie tatsächlich sind. Wird man ein Ei auf dem Boden, ist auf dem Boden also ein Ei zu sehen.
Sowas simples, bekommen selbst Entwickler mit Millionen Budget (The Elder Scrolls Online) nicht hin, ist man ganz einfach nicht gewohnt. Finde ich Klasse, dass sich dieser Aufwand hier gemacht wurde. Sieht nicht nur schick aus, man kann ""sehen"" was da liegt, ohne irgendwie da reingucken zu müssen ... !

- Die Grafik ist ""Naja""

- Kein Charakter Editor, man spielt immer diesen hässlichen Jungen, und wenn man, so wie ich, das Spiel mit einer Freundin zusammen spielt, spielen wir zwei hässliche Jungs, da es nicht Mal möglich ist, ein hässliches Mädchen zu spielen

- Das Kampfsystem ist so primitiv und schlecht gemacht, dass ich seine Funktionsweise gar nicht erst erklären möchte.
Stellt euch einfach das primitivste Kampfsystem vor, dass man sich für ein Third Person Adventure vorstellen kann

FAZIT

Ja, dass Kampfsystem ist beschissen, die Grafik ist Banane, es gibt keinen Charakter Editor, der Multiplayermodus ist eine Zumutung und es ist kein Survival ...

[strike]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[/strike]
[h1]Theme of the game[/h1]
You're washed ashore of some land. You've got some boldly ripped shorts on you and... that's all. Goal: survive against wildlife, and build youself some roof over your head (or over your things). Good luck!

[h1]Execution of the idea[/h1]
Someone sat down, and actually thought trough the whole thing. Progression from digging stick to first class shovel is nicely implemented - all tools have great impact on your gameplay, and you feel, that there is really need to push forward.

[h1]Gameplay feel[/h1]
After every discovery, of what you can build, smelt or make, there is an influx of 'oh darn, this is sooo repetitive! And yes - it is and it is intended this way. If you actually landed with nothing on you on a foreign land, you won't build brickhouse from day 1 - you'd have to really make your tools, gather materials and so on. Yet from time to time you discover ways game is making some tasks easier for you - you just have to work your way to them!

The game lacks proper story, and I don't think there is a need for one. But in return nothing stops you from some roleplaying.

[h1]Audiovisual experience[/h1]
Music is virtually non-existent in the game - it plays every time you discover and visit new biome (you can force in the options to play it when you visit it again, after some time), and honestly I wouldn't mind it playing more often. It's catchy and good. But the real background is really the true sound of nature - cicadas in the night, birds singing, ocean waves washing the shore, sounds of insects buzzing around you, delicate noise of leaves in the wind, bubbling of a swamp, ice breaking in the frozen desert, or creepy silence of the cold wasteland... It really can relax!

The graphics are nice - nothing much else you can say about them. They are pleasing, but not super-highly detailed, they blur a little. This has nice side effect of the game having quite low hardware requiariments, while it still looks good. There are a couple of ingenious tricks, that make the game more immersive - like vision going out of sharpness, like your avatar is shivering from the cold, or bloody noise and occasional blackouts when you're hurt badly. Small visual cues, that make the game feel more natural.

There are no errors I could spot (except flower pot just floating in the air), and in over 40 hours I've spent in this game, I haven't got a crash or error.

Protagonist's movement are absolutely great - not disrtacting, natural (he has to actually turn around, and not just swirls in place as you move your mouse).

[h1]Interface and playability[/h1]
Coming from other crafting/sandbox games, UI is surprisingly polished. It feels natural, and consequential, but is poorly documented. I feel like some more actions need extra buttons (like 'Take all' should have its own hotkey, or when clicking an item in the chest with i.e. shift all items of this kind could get transfered), but in the end it serves its purpose - you're not limited by it, most of the time. WHERE IS MY MAP ZOOM!?

One thing that needs to be mentioned is the camera - first thing you need is to set it to 'free' in the options, or else you'll end up in that strange overhead view.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
While most of the game is collecting stuff, combat is unaviodable. It doesn't require lighting fast reflexes, but rather feeling into it and good timing, and you'll get out of most of the fights unscathed, just keep number of enemies you're fighting low. You won't drown, fall to your death or otherwise croak, so until you wander into pack of bears while backpedalling shooting your bow at goblins, you'll be fine. In short - remember your surroundings.

[h1]Target audience[/h1]
That's hard question. It's both engaging game, and a relaxing one. It has potential, is pleasing to eyes and ears, and transfers very well the difficulty of making your way in the wilderness. I'd say, if you've enjoy watching [i]Primitive Technology[/i] on Youtube, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's building blocks and mechanics are very simple, so I'd say the age bracket is very wide.

[b]I clearly enjoyed this game, and I do not regret spending money on it, It's something different, just not in the same way as jumping from Minecraft to Goat Simulator. There are downsides - like repetitiveness of some tasks and the fact you have to progress from biome to biome in a sequence, or you'll end up with enemies way above your level, but in return you get to immerse into experience you're probably not going to experience (unless you go to field trip in Australia and get lost in the bush).[/b]

The fact that you can move everything you have built around without any penalty is brilliant so when I get bored with my homestead or come up with a better idea i can just move things around.

Some improvement on the combat would be welcome and some small quality of life improvements would be great like being able to shift click stacks between inventory and storage, being able to queue crafting recipies wouldnt go a miss either.

50 hours in and my thoughts are as follows.  Not played sandbox yet so this is only for levelling and currently level 10.  Initially I found the crafting clunky and it took a while to get used to.   The hard caps to stop you levelling are annoying, Early levels you have to go kill goblins to get your gold coins and later levels have to kill stuff to get your gem chips.  Having to kill stuff to level annoyed me but i can see why the dev did it this way.   At the start I found the goblins a bit of a weird addition to a crafting/exploration game but you get used to it and some of the later monsters I found quite fun.

Annoying to have to craft a set of clothing for basically a new area and to level.  I can see the rationale behind it but going from a tropical +35 to a -5 area in a matter of a few strides seems a bit weird.   Not sure why the dev capped certain buildings in the levelling mode to me if I want to build 10 wells to sort my water problem out I should be able to.  I am hoping sandbox mode allows this.

That aside the game is laid back for the most part and is well balanced and I have had fun playing it.  Grindy in places it still gives a sense of achivement and I am hopeful that the dev keeps up his great work.  As a left hander who never got to grip with WASD great to see controls can be changed and you can run it in windows mode just remember to use the escape key before going out to windows.  This could turn into a classic game.  Once I finish the main game I am looking forward to see how sandbox goes.

Spoilers: I returned the game for a full refund.

First of all... the game plays slowly. Not a relaxing kind of slow, it's a boring kind of slow. ...and that's if your stamina (which runs out entirely too quickly) hasn't packed up too much, in which case it becomes mind-numbingly slow. There are foods you can eat to restore stamina... but they don't restore much. You're better off just leaving your character sitting there, browsing the internet in the background and coming back in a minute or two when it's back up to a reasonable level.

The camera is absolutely atrocious. Typically when you play something you expect to be able to WASD and the camera follows you nicely, or use the mouse as camera control. Not with this game. The vast majority of the time if you want to control the camera you have to move your mouse whilst holding Space. ...why not hold right click or, y'know, actually switch to a good FPS view so WASD + Mouse was an option?

The menus are a pain in the ass. Inventory is something I like to keep open in games. In this game though it restricts your movement and camera control of course because... why wouldn't it..? There are multiple crafting menus rather than having a single one with different categories in it. This of course means more screen space and control is taken away from you.

Nothing is obvious. Either you need it spelled out for you or have to somehow stumble upon a solution by blind luck. I needed palm leaves for rope. Sure, you find some laying around. I used that for a knife (and you HAVE to make everything in order or you can't move on to the next step). No palm leaves for rope, how do I make a hatchet to progress? Turns out you have to kick the palm tree. Because of coouurse.

Combat is ridiculous. For rabbits you have to trap them in a corner. This is very difficult because they are faster than you and even when you have them trapped chances are they'll STILL get away. It's easier with goblins because they don't run. Aaand neither can you. You get two weapons early game to beat goblins with (which, of course, is necessary for game progression). One does less damage but allows you to dodge, one does higher damage but you need more of a swing so you're more likely to take a hit. This is a lie though, as you cannot dodge at all. Doesn't matter how much you side-step or back off, they will keep hitting you, so the only real option is the higher damage weapon, and you're still going to get hurt. You only have these two weapons, no armour, and of course no ability to make the odds better in your favour by preparing.

Levelup is the most awkward thing about the game though. You have to complete certain tasks in order to level up, and thus y'know, actually play the game. The entire game ends up an extended tutorial, and as much as I really tried to give this game a chance to get better... it just... continuously got worse. At no point did I ever have an ounce of fun. It was just a chore to get to the ""real gameplay"" which I eventually realised would never come. In most games you expect to be in a good position within maybe half an hour at most. It took me over an hour to get... essentially nowhere. For the majority of the time I kept thinking ""I wish I was playing something else.""

This game could've been so much more. I think that's the worst part. The ideas are there but implemented so badly that you have to wonder what in the flying fiddlesticks were they thinking when designing this game? If they changed the camera to FPS that alone would fix a shit tonne of what is wrong with this game. Remove levelup via tutorial and just give it an exp-based system. Make combat optional, like... you can choose to go to areas that enemies are in, or choose to play it safe. Also make combat less like a pointless slapfight too.

This whole game feels like that one friend you don't really like who is dragging you to every clothes shop in town and making you look at every item of clothing in the store whilst you're hungry and tired and just want to go home.

Ultimately I'd give this game a 1/10. That 1 is only for the ideas they have, wasted on the horrendousness of their execution.",1499046108,1499046108,False,8,2,0.518885552883148193,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Collect this, build that, hunt, farm, explore. But, that quickly changed to disappointment. See bottom for TL:DR

I reached level 6 before I started to plateau. There doesn't seem to be a lot of levels, but compared to the first 5, I was in level 6 for what seemed like twice or three times the amount of time it took me to reach level 5.

At level 6, you're fighting a lot more mobs. As you explore and fight more, you'll quickly realize how lacking the combat system is.

Major issues include: When you die, you lose a random amount of items in your inventory. All that wood you just spent a ton of time and stamina replenishing items on to collect, kiss it all goodbye. You can lose anything ranging from dumb items like logs, to more valuable stuff. I admit I probably should have made more chests to hold my gear back at base, but having to make a hut, just to hold a chest, is mind-numbing. I don't want to have to make three huts and 10 chests to hold all my stuff; it would take days. Real-life days.

You can't pick up what you lost on death. Don't want to lose it? Don't carry it. -Big flaw imho.

The combat mechanic is poorly executed, unexciting, and unrewarding. Animals run away from you when they have 2 hp's left, and you can't chase after them unless you want to aggro another half-dozen mobs. All the health/stamina replenishment items you used to survive combat is all wasted on an enemy that is now surrounded by his friends. This issue is mentioned in their discussion threads often. It's easier, and more exciting to fight a bear who wont run, then some pipsquak fox who'll sprint away, after gnawing half your HP down. -This is another major flaw.

You can make teleport pads before you can make simple clothes or armor? Have fun going 7 levels before you can put a shirt or shoes on. -Most major flaw of them all

The graphics are pretty good, but are wasted on the rest of the game, which needs to play catch-up. The only saving grace this game has is, it has triple monitor support out of the box. Who knew a game this unsophisticated could support triple monitors?!

Updated review as of 7/7/2017
 
I've tripled my hours since my review and felt it only fair to add some information.

[b]Pro's	[/b]
-Graphics while not state of the art are more then acceptable, surely much more pleasant than the damn voxel torture other more expensive games have.
-Surprising amount of content and anyone can see definate replay value. 
-Multiplayer with friends is a great and unexpected feature for such an inexpensive game!
-Dev's are very responsive to posts
-I'm never a big fan of game music but I admit this was a good effort.
-Nice assortment of creatures, flora, fauna and bio's.
-Leveling system isn't mind boggling but I personally enjoyed that it's item collect of things as you work towards what you need for building your place up. Nice change from kill = level, rinse and repeat.
-Dev is HIGHLY responsive to people with issues, was answered in under 24 hours, dev spent real time on my bug issues with real fixes and 1 work around as only I experienced the issue.
-New content added and planned.
-A good challenge.

Con's.

-SOLVED in a week by Dev personally. Found 5 consistant bugs myself but I AM hopeful (not an optimist in general) that progress will be made to sort out at least some if not all given time. 
-Don't love the controls, I live for right click>menu, left click sellect. With that said I am highly uncoordinated for a gamer and I think some reviews are blowing this out of porportion. 

Yup short con list. A damn good deal for under $9.",1498631623,1499475114,True,23,0,0.723703861236572266,1,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1] Review [/h1]
Third person surivival indie game. You start on a beach and have to progress your way up. Has an old school nostaligic feel to it in the way it handles leveling and general playing. There is a wide range of construction and decorations to build a village. 

The tutorial to the game are the quests. They introduce all the new items, buildings and creatures to the game whether indirectly or directly. These unlockables are behind level teir requirements that occur by completely the quests and spending resources gathered. 

It is a grindy game, similar to what other reviewers say. However I do not mind it as of such as the reward of gathering resources and making something that took time is in my opinion fun. It is not a game that gives you every recipe at the start and you are able to build everything in an hour. I am currently on my first playthrough with a friend and we are approximately 10 hours in and I think we've unlocked 2/3rds of the buildings. 

Multiplayer was added recently and what encouraged me to pick it up for myself and a friend. There is a few teething bugs with it but it not's unplayable (just don't hit windows key!!). The game loads/runs quick.

Update: Emailed the developer regarding with some bugs and recommendations and was replied to within a few days and was interested in hearing my suggestions. It seems the devs behind this are interested in our feedback and suggestions for change.",1498494517,1498675217,True,50,3,0.822706401348114014,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Если надумаете брать ее то , не покупайте этот шлак, пожалуйста если только скидка будет не 90% иначе это того не стоит

Игра ужас какая отвратительная , вот причины :

1. В игре отсутствует баланс

2. Добыча ресурсов просто убивает все время и желание играть ! И создание предметов ужс !

3. Фарм мяса просто ужас,так как за животными приходиться носиться по всей карте как придурок надеясь что животное застрянет где-то или в кустах или в тестурах 

4.Боевка очень кривовата сыровата и однотипна,

5. Застревание в кустах,деревьях в горе , вроде бы ровная поверхность с маленьким наклоном и уже все ты не спустишься и не подымишься приходиться бродить в поисках как выбраться

6. Дерево иследований это просто треш ты не можешь лучше надеть экипировку зато с?ка телепорт пожалуйста строй и пользуйся XD

7. Квесты просто ужасны и не интересны и они того не стоят как и повышение уровня как по мне должен быть опыт сделал что-то убил кого-то или еще что-то то без проблем получил повысил и как в ARK решил что именно ты хочешь !

8.Так-же скудлый выбор брони оружия зданий и тд

My opinion about this game! If you decide to take it , do not buy this app, please if the discount is not 90% otherwise it's not worth it

Horror game what a disgusting , here's why :

1. The game is not balance

2. Resource extraction is just killing all the time and the desire to play ! And create items for it !

3. Farm meat just like the animals have to run around across the map like a moron hoping that the animal will get stuck somewhere or in the bushes or in testorf 

4.Boevka very crooked damp and uniform,

5. Getting stuck in bushes,and trees in the mountain , seemingly smooth surface with a small slope and have all you come down and not raising have to wander in search of a way out

6. Tree research is just trash you can't wear the outfit but?ka teleport please order and enjoy it XD

7. The quests are just horrible and not interesting and they're not worth as increase the level as I should be experience did something to kill someone or something then no problem got increased and as in the ARK decided what you want !

A lot to be worked on but months ago (been following this for half a year or more) it looked awful, the recent update persuaded me to buy it on sale.
Only cons: 
Some weapons/items force you to stand completely still while swinging.
Not too fond of the leveling system, making you gain items and then you consume them upon leveling up, feel like it should be more experience-wise leveling. Maybe keep the items required to level up, but not consume them, sort of like a requirement to mine/obtain to level.

Only put little over an hour into it and I haven't even experienced combat yet (too terrified to break the bush between me and 8+ goblins eyeing me over the bushes that cannot be crossed).
I like the building mechanics too, straightforward, simple. The limit of buildings that can be made is fair, not sure if they have it but maybe the higher the level you are, it increases the amount of buildings you can make?
I also had no idea how to find sticks besides the ones you find on the ground, then I discovered there are ""stick bushes"" that give you a lot of sticks upon breaking them, very nice to find that out :D

Suggestions: Make crafting have a queue, so in a bonfire, queue like 21 embers that takes a few minutes as the first item crafted to be worked on, then instantly add like, cooked meat, behind it so it'll craft that once the embers are done. That'd be more convenient.
The screen/top down is tolerable, I don't mind it, reminds me of the old classic ""Dungeon Siege"" from many years ago. 

For the tl/dr: I am overall impressed with the game, it looked terrible half a year ago but now it looks much better so I bought it. A lot of work to be done still but it's definitely playable and time consuming. My biggest pet peeve would be the leveling system!",1498392273,1498392273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The camera is extremely tedious, and when you are in the menu you have to click to pick up items, and hold space to turn the camera. When not in a menu the camera turns normaly but you have to click ctrl to pick up items. In addition the camera is stuck at a really annoying angle, but that is something you can change with a hidden button in the settings menu. 

The crafting system is so tedious and instead of placing items in your inventory when it's done crafting you have to lug your way back to the crafting menu to pick up the item. 
If you are crafting in your inventory it should go to your inventory automatically when finished so you dont have to go back over and over again. 

This game is not even marked early access, when it so clearly needs a better crafting/inventory menu and a less tedious camera system. Things I consider so basic I would complain about it on an early access title as well. 

These are all things that can be fixed. And if they do, it might warrant me having another go at the game. But as it stands, it's a hard resounding no.

Camera and movement is tedious and restricted. EVERYTHING is an obstacle. Sunflowers and bushes block everything, and you have to slowly dig through it all.

Menus and inventory is a hassle. Every menu has to be opened by its own button, and they'll constantly open and close other windows you may want to keep up/down. They'res no way to easily navigate anything.

Progression is not enjoyable or satisfactory due to the worst forced tutorial I've seen. It forces you to grind for materials in order to advance the game. Only to be greeted by more fetchquests and grinding. And if it doesn't teach you, then you'll have a hard time figuring something out. Hell I didn't even know you could break bushes until 30 minutes in.

So yes, a game so dissapointing to me I wrote an extremely long rant about it.
tl:dr, Idea is great, game isn't.

My advice for the devs? Take more from similar games, like Don't Starve and Haven and Hearth. They have fluid movement, easy to use menus, and the combat/progression is difficult, but satisfying.",1497145395,1497145395,False,231,11,0.772994458675384521,10,True,False,False,False,,,

Starting out, I did not like a few elements of it  as I did not get it.  For example, running in and pulling a whole bunch of mobs then dying and resuming.  Do this a few times and you get the 'Bad Player' achievement; haha.  During this stage, the game was okay, but my fault of playing it wrong.

Then I recognised the game as survival an the point is to make it to the end without dying.  Hardcore mode is just that, make it to end without dying.  This means you have to play carefully, plan and learn.  This adds a whole new challenge to the game when you play and know it is about survival.  In hardcore, you die and the game is over and everything lost;  no saved games to recover to.  Knowing this, makes the game a challenge.

There are restrictions to the number of constructions, but this is a good thing as it keeps the game challenging.  Without these restrictions it would be far too easy.  At times the game is a bit grindy and you have to wait for crafting.  A small reduction will make it more enjoyable.

I have completed hardcore a few times, each time sligly different due the the random map.  So there is a level of replayability.  Part of the fun is to figure out the mechanics/rules of the game and use them to your advantage.

There are a few bugs.  The good thing is the developers do listen to the community and have made changes based on recommendations.  Their response time on bugs is quick.  As the developers continue to improve the game, hopefully more recipes. weapons will emerge.

If you don't like a bit of a grind and miss the point of 'SURVIVAL' i.e. not dying; then the game may not be for you.   It is not a passive game, you need to go out and kill some mobs.  

Good.  Ambient sound and music great.  Graphics are good,  Game plays smoothly.  Challenge is moderate.  Replayability is fair.

Character customisation does not exist.  Camera angle needs improvement.  A little grindy at the end of the game, can be toned down a bit.  Some achievements are too easy and others ridiculous.

easy survival, you just have to read
no impossible resources per your level ups
linear level up system
monsters to bash around
bunnies that tempt you with mouth watering fresh meat that you cant catch

-Music (heard it the first time I played and I enjoyed it,  but never heard it again lol)

-Bunch of things to do and discover
-Having to cut through objects to move passed them (a cool thing, and a frustrating thing)
-I like that you can continue to use items with zero durability loss
-Building mechanics
-Relaxing game

Cons
-Music stopped working after first play
-You can't walk down a hill or a sharp edge, you have to literally run around to try to find even ground
-Animals/Monsters can run from you with ease
-STAMINAAAA.  Man, you don't recover stamina at all.  Yes, I've carried around coffee and constantly eat sunflower seeds, but damn, the loss of stamina is crazy.
-Some items can't be built in a house while other items can, and these items are pretty similar
-Not Multiplayer.

Хрен с ним что в игре нужно долбить тысячи деревьев и откалывать по грамму руду. Раньше я не имел значимого опыта в подобных проектах, но теперь думаю все изменится. Мне лично понравилось все, ну или почти все. Иногда раздражают убегающие мобы (в частности лисы и зайцы (ненавижу этих сучар)). А так в целом играть приятно, главное настроить себя на то что придется много бегать, добывать ресы и просто скашивать сотни кабанов и медведей что бы сшить себе одежду. Но это не сколько меня не напрягает, ведь после тяжелого рабочего дня именно это мне и нужно. В игре представлен интересный крафт вещей, кулинария, различные постройки и декор. Так же есть вспомогательные всякие штуки типа амулетов, без них к слову не пройти дальше за очередным гребанным осколком. Нравится фермерство, сеешь пшеницу, сажаешь розы и ты в шоколаде. Можно заарканить всяких домашних животных. В частности полезными оказались : овцы, пара коров, несколько куриц и естественно петухи, без них не обойтись. В общей сложности процесс игры иногда может наскучить, но если есть немного выдержки и желание все таки дойти до логического заключения этой приключенчиской - выживалки, то можно потратить пару десятков часов и забыть все это как страшный сон.

These are all things the game doesn't currently have that would complete it. Hell, I'll even take on the development myself if it means these get done:

More use of buildings and defences, such as adding:
- Wooden Palisade Gate (the current two gates don't work with the only wall type available: a palisade).
- Wooden Turret. This would be craftable with a bow as an ingredient, and would allow you to walk inside and shoot over your base's external defence wall.

More use of stone in the game other than for just stone borders. I have about 500 stone just sitting in barrels because there's nothing else to do with it. Perhaps: 
- Stone Wall, stronger than Palisade.
- Fortified Stone Wall, stronger than Stone Wall
- Stone Gate, stronger than Wooden Palisade Gate.
- Fortified Stone Gate, stronger than Stone Gate
- Stone Turret, stronger than Wooden Turret. Allows use of bow built-into turret.

A HUGE improvement: If a large structure is empty, ALLOW THE PLAYER TO MOVE IT like you can with everything else once empty! This is a HUUUUUUGGGGGEEEEEE problem if you build your town thinking you can move the structures (because you can move everything else after it's placed so this makes sense), only to discover you can't move a building once built. If you want it three squares to the right, for example, you have to dismantle it completely and waste resources or move your entire base around to suit it. Please just make it moveable. It would be SO easy to fix and the result would be so much better for the player.

And my expectations weren't very high to begin with.
The progress is locked behind quests and levels (that require the quests to be completed anyway, seems like a pointless complexity)
The game feels like an extended tutorial, and kills any desire to explore beyond what the quest tells you to (since if you find something interesting it's just going to clog your inventory until the game deigns to let you make something out of it)

Because of the progress being locked behind quests, it's even more important to make that progress feel meaningful. Sadly, it's not the case here. For example, the game introduces you to a new crafting station (anvil) but only lets you create a couple items (nails), which you can only use for a different crafting station (crafting table). The next quest then jumps to taming animals (which is similarly a frustating experience as there's no proper feedback on why you failed)

I'm a glutton for material grinds in games, but this game manages to make even that feel like a cynical chore, with the stamina limits being a cherry on top.
The stamina ends up feeling like you're playing a bizarre mobile game with timers you could pay to bypass. Not the best feeling.

Такой сырой игры в жанре выживания я ешё никогда не видел.

Что-же, сейчас я разберу каждую часть этой игры.

1. Геймплей.
Геймплей по началу довольно интересный, есть желание проходить игру. Но, очень большое но. Геймплей просто напросто растянут до нельзя. Игру можно было бы пройти за пол недели, если бы не фарм ресурсов, дорогой крафт, но об этом расскажу далее

2. Фарм ресурсов.
Фармить ресы в этой игре - это вечное мучение! Я чёрт возьми медь фармил пол часа! На фарм ресов отчасти уходит 40% всего геймплея, и это очень бесит. Я бы предложил ускорить все крафты, снизить кол-во требуемых материалов, повысить кол-во выпадаемого с врагов лута. Ах, нет, разработчикам лень читать отзывы, ведь их игра и так ""идеальна!"". Но чего это вам стоит? Явно не жизни. Вам всего то стоит изменить пару числовых значений, чтобы сделать игру лучше

3. Система боя.
О системе боя я бы целую книгу посветил. Тут боёвки на столько плохо сделаны, что за это я ставлю самый большой минус. Как бы ты не двигался, ты всё равно словишь маслину от любого врага, каким бы медленным он ни был, и тут даже твоя скорость не поможет. Тот же самый кабан, постоянно вплотную подходит и моментально наносит урон. НУ КАК ТУТ ВООБЩЕ МОЖНО УКЛОНИТЬСЯ ОТ ЕГО АТАКИ?! Это же полнейшая белеберда. Так же я заметил, что 70% всех врагов бъют дальше, чем видят. Голем блин бьет за два метра дальше, чем надо. Ух, у меня аж пригорело от этой темы. Какой же дикий дисбаланс в этой системе.

4. Система строительста
Ну а теперь о хорошем. У игры очень хорошая система строительста, и за это разработчикам большой респектос. Игра имеет в своём арсинале строительста очень мало объектов, но и при этом малом кол-ве получаются очень красивые в визуальном плане города/базы. Именно эта великолепная хрень привлекла меня.

5. Генерация
Без сомнения, игра скорее всего больше расчитывалась на визуальный план, и у них это по сути получилось. Получаются по истине живописные места, и биомы сами по себе очень красивые в игре. Но всё же в генерации есть один минус - генерируется очень мало руд. Именно это и тормозит фарминг в игре. В остальном очень годно проработана генерация мира.

6. Анимации
Так, как я имею опыт в плане анимирования, то я бы хотел придраться и к ним))))). В принципе анимации тут хороши, но всё же есть пару моментов. У жнецов очень, очень, ну очень резкая анимация, и она по сути не вписывается в игру. Тоже самое с гориллами, или чё это ещё за кичман. Ну в остальном разраб очень хорошо анимирует. Респект +

7. Модели
Модели врагов и ГГ (главного героя) очень хорошо проработаны, ну а вот остальное... Остальные модели очень примитивны и легки. Да, я понимаю, всё ради ФПС, но всё же можно было ещё пару полигонов добавить, это ведь никак не помешает игре. Это касается построек и выкинутых предметов. Нет, серьёзно, над этим ещё стоит поработать.

8. Оптимизация
Оптимизация тут божественна, на моём худшем ноуте фпс держится ровно на 60 при средних настройках, и это очень хороший результат. Так же другу подарил игру, а у него компец в 7 раз мощнее моего ноута, и у него при максимальных настройках выдавало 267 фпс. Очень хороший результат.

9. Интерфейс
Не знаю, кто там говорил, что интерфейс до жути неудобный, как раз наоборот, тут интерфейс упрощен до мелочей, и тебе не надо совершать много действий за раз, чтобы сделать хотябы одну хижину. И так же горячие клавиши упрощают всю работу в разы.

10. Цена крафта
По началу крафт простых предметов не приносил каких либо неудобств, но после пятого уровня кол-ва ресурсов для крафтов на столько крышесносные, что реально проще какую нибудь программу для взлома игр и выдать себе нужные для крафта предметы, но упаси меня бог, я не стал этого делать, я ещё в здравом уме. И там вроде чувачек говорил испольховать ArtMoney. Чувак, это не круто, тебя за такое на кол анусом надо посадить, ведь читерить, это плохо.


Умозаключение: игра очень сырая, и всё ещё лежит на дне. Я проиграл очень много часов, и я не рекомендую вам покупать эту игру... Ну, пока что. Лучше пойдите, да поиграйте в The forest, Dust, Terraria, и ещё какие нибудь игры жанра песочница, приключение и выживание.

Это чисто моё мнение, и оно может отличаться от вашего. Я не призываю никого соглашаться с ним, это ваше право.
Ну вот и всё ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",1493845938,1493846633,False,145,19,0.718445181846618652,19,True,False,False,False,,1564414286.0,"Спасибо за честный, пусть и отрицательный для меня обзор.
Согласен, что для игрока должно быть совершенно не важно кто и в каком количестве делал игру. Согласен, что баланса достичь не удалось. Не соглашусь с тем, что исправить его легко, поменяв пару цифр в настройках. Весь баланс начинает плыть с 7го уровня, когда игрок отправляется в другие биомы. Вот тогда для меня и настал ад балансировки ресурсов, учитывая случайность порядка биомов.
Боевая система не такая тупая, как кажется. Есть, например, короткие мечи и ножи. С их помощью я могу убить почти любого противника в чистом поле не потратив ни одной жизни. Изначально даже думал снять ролик, в котором показать как сражаться против каждого вида противников. Но руки так и не дошли.
Да, наверно можно было бы допилить. Сам я воспринимаю эту игру как первый блин комом. Но это самое допиливание будет очень нерациональным расходованием времени. Гораздо продуктивнее мне показалось собрать все ошибки, недочеты, пожелания, и сделать новую игру.
Эта игра сырая, но и стоит она, как мне кажется, не так уж и много. К тому же я стараюсь постоянно ставить на нее скидки.
Может кто-то с моими решениями и не согласится. Может кто-то сочтет их отмазками или ленью. Но тут уж сколько людей столько и мнений."

Whether I would recommend this game is more about what kind of experience you are looking for.  Games like Terraria and Starbound allow you to use everything you find, quickly, and flex some creative muscle in building yourself grand structures.  They also have a fantastical element and a wide crafting tree.

Force of Nature has less of that.  Crafting things requires care and time.  To forge a single ingot of metal you need the ore, and coal.  Coal requires you to put wood and burning embers into the coal smoker.  Burning embers come from a bonfire and sticks.  And these things take time.  It's a more immersive experience, especially with the 3D third person perspective.  But it can cause things to drag slightly.

The game mechanics and graphics are good.  Music and sound effects can be decent.  Like most sandbox games it can take a bit to figure some things out.  To get rid of items permanently in this game you have to build a trashcan, which is listed under ""decorations"" and not ""constructions"".  Combat so far(44 hours in) has been relatively simple.

There's a few quirky things that make me laugh about this game too.  Lilke the fact you're able to craft a magical portal before you can craft yourself pants.  It's nothing that detracts from the game overall, but just silly.  There's also no castle building like terraria or Starbound.  You build small structures in one piece.  

If you like a more realisitc exploration, sandbox, adventure game, this can be for you.  If you're looking for another game closer to the fantasy and ease of Terraria, maybe look elsewhere.",1492451303,1492451303,True,18,0,0.708737790584564209,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's slow paced, single person, and you get your own satisfaction of doing your own thing.

  Это игра про выживание одного человека на острове полном разнообразных чудовищ. Начинаете вы, как водится, без единого предмета и в лучших традициях жанра надо всё создать самому, дом, инструменты, оружие, броню, а в конце некий артефакт.
  Кстати про крафт, тут он выполнен очень логично, в игре стройная система что, как и из каких ресурсов создается. Тут мы подходим к первой проблеме игры: Крафтить придется много, нет, _очень_ много. Это не проблема и не удивительно для игр данного жанра, но выясняется, что нельзя создавать несколько предметов, только один тип за раз, очередь Крафта попросту отсутствует.
  Это половина проблемы, вторая - добыча ресурсов. Конечно, большую часть ингредиентов вы будете получать прорубаясь через лес и сражаясь с монстрами, но что делать если требуется руда или глина? Правильно, добывать! И вот это занятие является самым утомительным. На махание киркой или лопатой требуется энергия, поэтому не получится зажать клавишу мыши и оставить персонажа копать. А избежать этого скучного занятия не получится, для прохождения игры требуется построить дом, который строится из кирпичей, для которых нужна глина... Вобщем, смотри выше написанное.
  Вторая проблема игры - это интерфейс, он не очень удобен и интуитивное не понятен, даже пройдя игру я до конца не смог к нему привыкнуть. Подойти к сундуку и открыть его - это было бы слишком просто. Надо нажать клавишу чтобы высветилось ""сундук"" и только после этого его можно будет открыть. Тоже самое надо делать с каждым верстаком/хранилищем/предметом. К счастью есть кнопка ""поднять все"" и сбор трофеев проходит гораздо быстрее.
Так же в 2017 году странно смотрится фиксированная камера, к ней привыкаешь и не чувствуешь неудобств, но первое впечатление все равно странное. Нельзя не отметить и боевую систему, тут она очень простая, у оружия есть урон и скорость нанесения ударов, а доспехи поглощают часть получаемого урона. Каких-то тактических приемов просто нет. Подбегаем - бьем - отбегаем. Ситуация улучшается с появлением лука, но и он не меняет ситуацию.
  Но вот вы получили максимальный уровень, собрали все осколки артефакта, и... Прочитайте фразу с которой я начал этот обзор. В конце игры нет ничего, ни финального ролика, ни супер-способностей открывающихся у игрока, ничего. Только выбор: продолжать игру или выйти в меню.
  Поэтому рекомендовать эту игру можно только фанатам этого жанра, всем остальным - нет.

The camera angle takes a bit of getting used to but it's all fun after that. 
 I likethe progression of levels.  Every piece of equipment, clothing, food recipes, weapons, buildings etc. get better as you level but you must supply the resources.  You need to save everything, yes, even the poisonous mushrooms.  If you can’t build storage containers (barrels and chests) fast enough to accommodate your resources, you can pile them in neat stacks anywhere on the ground and no one will disturb them. The scenery is fantastic, the terrain is great.  Here are some highlights:

1.) All animals are wild, you catch them with net traps, tame them and tell them to follow you.  Make sure you have fenced in areas to lead and keep the animals securely inside.  Cows will give milk, chickens, eggs, etc. etc. But you need to feed them.

2.) You need to gather plants, seeds and fruit but after that you can grow most of them in planting beds at home.

3.) Mining for ore, building a smelter and an anvil is all part of the game.

3.) Hunting for meat, pelts and other animal resources is fun as well.

4.) You can make your own trails through the thick brush by cutting trees and bushes and saving the logs and sticks.

5.) You can build Portals to teleport from one place to another anywhere on the map and it is huge.

I could go on and on.  Just watch out for the goblins, they will attack anything but they do drop gold coins, the only resource you have for making gold ingots, which you will need later in the game.  These ugly little creatures are everywhere and they are a pain, until you reach the level where you can actually trap one and he becomes your sidekick.  He will be the funniest thing in the game as you both go on adventures. Only thing is that he dies if he’s killed, unlike you, who resurrects at home, minus some inventory items, sometimes,  valuable stuff.  So, you make more chain traps and catch another one!!!!

My hats off to the developers, now for the extension package and multiplayer ability.

Она не вызвала бы у меня никаких вопросов, если бы версия игры была не 1.019, а 0.019, но поскольку это уже релиз... Впрочем, наверно она может понравиться детям, для которых она, возможно, и делается. А я могу сказать следующее:
1. Интерфейс. 
В двух словах - он ужасен. Его нужно сносить и переделывать с нуля. Чтобы крафтить, выращивать растения, кормить животных и прочее, нужно совершать просто дикое количество движений мышкой из одного конца экрана до другого, чтобы кликнуть то там, то сям. Просто прикрутите побольше хоткеев хотя бы, черт возьми.
2. Развитие.
Как я вычитал в одном обзоре: ""В этой игре долго и кропотливое развитие"". Я бы добавил ""ужасно"". Ужасно долгое и кропотливое развитие. Во многом это из-за уже упомянутого мною недружелюбного интерфейса, который съедает огромное количество времени, но также еще и из-за растянутых анимаций, необходимости гриндить мобье, невозможности автоматизировать крафт или хотя бы выставить очередь крафта, а также еды. Да, еда тоже ужасна. Простейшие кокосы восстанавливают стамины на 2-3 удара топором за 10 секунд. И нельзя съесть сразу несколько, надо ждать пока пройдет действие. И нельзя съесть по хоткею.
3. Боевая система.
Боевая система в зачаточном состоянии, её практически нет. Лично мне она напомнила боевую систему Готики 2 (которая вышла в 2002 году), только недоработанную. Иными словами, в игре 15-ти летней давности боевка была лучше.
4. БОЛЬШЕ ГРИНДА ДЛЯ БОГА ГРИНДА!!1
Чтобы развиваться, драться, прогрессировать по квестам и прочее, нужно совершать просто ужасное количество одинаковых манипуляций. Поймите меня правильно, я прекрасно знаю, что это в большистве своем специфика игр на выживание, я в Майнкрафт наиграл больше 2000 часов на различных серверах, но там этот гринд интересен. А тут нет. Опять же, это заслуга, во многом, ужасно неудобного интерфейса, но факт остается фактом. Всё в этой игре сделано для того, чтобы сожрать как можно больше вашего времени.
5. Простота.
И наконец-то, положительный момент. Игра действительно простая, почти во всех аспектах, а главное, о чем часто забывается в таких играх, она проста для освоения. Достаточно подробные квесты, подсказки по ресурсам, всё присутсвует. Единственный сложный момент - приручение животных, но, как оказалось, если загнать животное в непроходимые текстуры то поймать его становится просто.
Итого:
Неплохая простенькая выживалка для детей(наверно?). Недорого стоит. Неплохой рекламный ролик.
И да, для тех кто будет говорить ""ты поиграл 2 часа, еще ниче не видел, вот на 999 часу там тааааааак интересна!!1"". Ну, возможно это и так. Вполне возможно, что лэйт-гейм контент в этой игре и хорош, да только вот тратить еще 997 часов на то, чтобы дойти до него и дописать к обзору пункт ""6.

One of my Favorites is the build and replace system thats missing in a lot of survival games, also the fights there are sometimes hard to win and but simply, you got a lot of weapons and they are not easy to get so it makes it a game with more hours to spend. the traping feels wierd but if you catch something its satisfying after all your hard Net throwing.

thats the good part now the bad things:

after some hours spend in the game the are things that i personaly miss, so theres no multiplayer i hope it is in sight for the next months. the next thing is many other games get a Mac support cause its obvious that are some players on mac aswell this combind with a multiplayer and you got a lot more options to do in the game

[h1]Knackiger Grinder![/h1] [i](Mir persönlich wäre es die paar Euronen jederzeit wieder wert)[/i]

Bin aktuell lvl 8 (~ 26h Spielzeit) -> kurz vor 9 (max. level 13, glaub ich)

Die Quest-Reihe ist sinnvoll gestaltet und sorgt immer wieder für spannende Momente.

Da ich mir nebenher gern nen Stream ansehe, ist auch der ""Farm-Faktor"" sehr entspannt. (bissl in der Base idlen um an die benötigten Ressourcen zu kommen um dann auf die Jagd nach den FON-Splittern zu gehen)

Einfache Kampf-Mechaniken, jedoch nicht zu verachten. Die Umgebung ist dein Freund!

Die unterschiedlichen Biome find' ich relativ gut gebalanced. Weiterentwicklung + Vorbereitung ist Pflicht. (ohne Richtiges Equip/Ressourcen ist's ""Essig"")

---

[h1]Primär gibt es 3 unterschiedliche Spiel-Stadien in JEDEM LEVEL.[/h1]

[b]ERSTENS: (Base-Idlen)[/b]

Vorweg, die Anzahl der Felder/Brunnen etc. sind limitiert. Mit jedem neuen Level kommen jedoch zusätzliche ""Slots"" dazu. (komische Formulierung, sorry hierfür)

a) Ackerbau für: Koch-Zutaten/Alchemie-Zutaten (hab' ich noch nicht freigeschaltet)/Handwerks-Zutaten...
b) Viehhaltung für: Koch-Zutaten/Handwerks-Zutaten... etc. (Taming-System ist gewöhnungsbedürftig)
c) Wasser-Management (Tipp anbei: Immer die maximale Anzahl an Brunnen haben, eine der Limitierungen)
d) Neue Ausrüstung/Waffen/Nahrungsmittel/Tränke(bin da noch nicht) auf den AKTUELLEN Stand bringen (vorbereiten)
e) Altar/Werkbank/Amboss/Schneider-Tisch/Hochöfen... inkl. der neu freigeschalteten Objekte bauen.
f) Grundsätzliches Base Management (man kann, bis auf Portale alles verschieben, was sehr angenehm ist, wenn man neue Inhalte zusätzlich platzieren möchte)

[b]ZWEITENS: (Ressourcen-Farmen)[/b]

Durch die Möglichkeit, (sehr früh und sehr günstige) Portale platzieren zu können, erspart dieser Punkt eine ordentliche Strecke an Laufarbeit.

Standart-Farmarbeit: Wildtiere/Gegner (für Pelze/Münzen/Klauen... usw.) sowie Stein/unterschiedliche Erze/Holz/Ton/Sand... (das Übliche) + Samen usw...

Auch hier gibt es eine Limitierung. Die Ausdauer! (welche man aber mittels Nahrungsmittel eig. relativ gut in den Griff bekommt)

[b]DRITTENS: (Force-of-Nature: Bruchstücke)[/b]

Vorweg: Man levelt NICHT durch ein Erfahrungs-System, sondern muss Aufgaben erfüllen um ein Level-Up zu erhalten. Ab (ich glaube lvl 6) benötigt man jeweils ein [neues] Bruchstück des FON und einige zusätzliche Dinge.

Wenn man die Zeit klug investiert und ein wenig mitdenkt schafft man sich mit oben genannten ""Punkten"" die Grundlage für ein Abenteuer!

Die Jagd nach den Bruchstücken und den fehlenden ""Materialien"" für das nächste Level-Up.

Erstes und 2tes Bruchstück, sind, mit guter Vorbereitung, sehr ""anfänger-freundlich"" platziert und gehalten. Ab dem 3ten geht es richtig ab. (Mal schnell hinlaufen und das Ding holen ist nicht! Gräben/Wasserflächen/Gegner/Temperaturen... Haufen Faktoren die hier mitspielen und das Unternehmen sehr knackig gestalten)

---

[h1]FAZIT[/h1]

[b]Im Großen und Ganzen sehr gelungen, wenn man kein Problem mit ""Grindern"" hat. Das progressive und durchaus auch interessante Crafting-System in Kombination mit den Gegnern ist top.

WICHTIG: Wenn ihr keinen Bock auf ""Farmen"" habt und eher der Spieler seid, der auf ""End-Game-Equip"" upgradet und dann brainless in Gegner läuft, würde ich davon abraten. (no offense!)[/b]

Handling ist anfangs nicht intuitiv aber nichts, was mich persönlich abgeschreckt hat. (nach ner Zeit hat man es im Muskelgedächtnis)

But it does combine aspects of survival and farming sims. The quest system is pretty good at leading you along the road to building things with a nice progression, and once you get to a certain point it looks like you can be pretty self sustaining.

Скажу следующее - Не покупайте данный продукт! Он не достоин траты на него Ваших средств и более того -  Вашего Времени.

«Концепция не нова, но есть зачатки интересных идей, пусть и не реализованных на данный момент.»
«Есть надежда на захватывающий геймплей, интересный контент и сбалансированный и разнообразный крафт.»
Все эти мысли не покидали меня в течении первых 30 часов…

После я стал смотреть на игру с точки зрения не наивного потребителя, а Игрока с огромным стажем. И начал обращать внимание на те моменты игрового процесса, которые должны создавать атмосферу, а именно:
- Сюжет,
- Проработка мира,
- Внимание к деталям,
- Баланс.
И что же мы видим? Ничего из вышеперечисленного здесь — НЕТ!

Очень хочеться высказать в деталях, моё отношение к каждому аспекту этой игры... но лимит символов в обзоре, не умещает 4 с хвостиком страницы текста. Более подробно можете прочитать, здесь: http://steamcommunity.com/app/568570/discussions/0/135512625244938950/ - если разработчики в очередной раз не проявят свою детскую натуру и не подчистят отрицательный отзыв.

Да, это Инди-игра и разработчики — скорее всего впервые взялись за изучение всех аспектов игростроя. Хотелось бы верить, что они будут плотно работать с комьюнити и прислушиваться к тому, что этому комьюнити интересно увидеть в ИХ игре… но всё это заканчивается на моменте, когда после многочисленных однотипных просьб - «Введите новый контент!!», на протяжении нескольких патчей — Ты подытоживаешь всю ту массу воплей на разных языках — Конструктивной критикой и одним единственным вопросом «Когда?» в Официальном сообществе — в разделе «Вопросы и предложения разработчикам»… Вам сначала говорят о том, что - «Вы вообще отдалённо не представляете о чём говорите», - и с гордостью отправляют в Чёрный список сообщества с пометкой - «Сообщения не по теме»… Вопрос разработчикам «Когда?» с Конструктивной критикой их действий — в разделе «ВОПРОСЫ и предложения разработчикам». Кроме как «Детской обидой» - лично я, назвать не могу.

В итоге осталось смешанное впечатление — что у проекта есть потенциал, но судя из слов Разработчиков этого проекта — они этот потенциал развивать не собираются => Тратить Ваши нервы и средства на эту «Потешную поделку» считаю не целесообразным… Перед тем как читать и оставлять положительные отзывы — задумайтесь, зачем Вам нужен очередной тайм-киллер в котором из более чем 100 часов проведенных в игре, только от силы 12-15 часов — потрачены на интересный геймплей.",1490476607,1490476984,False,14,3,0.558951139450073242,2,True,False,False,False,,,

PUNTOS POSITIOS
el precio 7,99 para un juego tan amplio y con tantas opciones es una gozada
el sistema de subida de nivel es otro punto a favor
no todo es construir también tienes que talar minear escavar etc
cooperativo para jugar con tu amigo (max 2 jugadores partida)
esta en castellano y es algo muy importante ya que el juego lo a creado todo 1 persona 

PUNTOS NEGATIVOS
los graficos no estan muy buenos

Zuerst war ich bei dem Preis von 8€ skeptisch, auch noch nach den ersten Minuten im Spiel. Aber wenn man sich erst mal hineigefunden hat, macht es doch ziemlich Spaß.  Es verbindet alle Elemente, die ein solches Spiel, meiner Meinung nach, haben muss. 

Man startet einsam am Strand, mit nichts außer einer Badehose und muss durch sammeln und farmen von Rohstoffen, mit der Zeit, ein Funktionelles Lager errichteten. Angefangen mit Stein und Tonwerkzeugen, die man im laufe des Spiels gegen bessere aus Eisen, Stahl Bronze etc. tauschen kann und auch muss, wenn man schneller vorankommen will.

Es gibt bisher 3 Biome, die ich entdeckt habe. Das gemäßigte Waldgebiet zum Start und eine besonders Warme bzw. Kalte Region, in denen man auch spezielle Kleidung tragen muss(muss mühsam zusammengefarmt werden) um 
nicht zu sterben.

Wenn ich es richtig deute, ist Map jedes mal zufallsgeneriert und sehr weitläufig. Je weiter man sich vom Stadtgebiet entfernt umso schwieriger wird es auch, aber damit man sich nicht jedes mal die Pixel wund läuft, kann man Portale bauen und sich somit ein eigenes bequemes Netz aus Wegpunkten bauen, von denen man beliebig zu allen anderen Punkten hin und her porten kann.

Fazit : Sehr gelungen und kurzweilig für den Preis, auch wenn es mit survivalgiganten wie 7 days to die, natürlich nicht mithalten kann.

But it's crippled by several KEY factors.

1. Camera, Movement, Inventory/Menus - They are not intuitive. There's nothing wrong with using a control scheme that everyone is familiar with guys...

2. The game in it's ENTIRETY is very restrictive. You MUST unlock things by leveling up, and completing quests. I know if I was personally stranded on an island, I wouldnt waste my time doing most of that nonsense, besides building a shelter, and making sure I had a fresh water supply. - Suggestion - Remove leveling, unlock all stuff from the beginning. That simple.

3. Creative Mode... I dont even know where to start with this. First of all, you can't call it creative mode, if the player doesnt have unlimited supplies. Creative mode refers to a game mode, in which the player has the power to inspect every part about the game. Creative mode should have its own separate menu. To give players access to a creative mode without any of this, you have effectively fixed #2, BUT YOU STILL MAKE US LEVEL UP, AND COLLECT ALL RESOURCES. - Suggestion - Change the name of this mode to normal mode, and change normal games to be hard mode. Add unlimited resources, and separate creative menus.

4. Movement - Movement is overly complicated to begin with, coupled with your run speed being just barely faster than your walk speed, makes it abhorrent. Stamina recharges too slow, and the character should move faster overall.

5. Shards - These are relatively easy to get, however, it takes FOREVER to get to a place where you are ready to go after these. Not to mention, they spawn SO FAR APART, that by the time you reach your 3rd one, you're ready to quit the game.

6. Chests - They dont hold enough. Nuff said. - Suggestion - Just double it. Then it would be perfect.

7. Replayability - Once you have played for a couple days, everything gets ridiculously repetitive. As a progressive gaming generation, there should be new content every few weeks, to let your players know, you are listening, and actually adding things to the game. Even if it's just a single item every week or so.

8. Bugs - I dont have the time in the day to list the bugs that I have encountered thus far. There are some horrible crashes the player can encounter. They always seem to happen when you havent saved the game after a large accomplishment, thus severely diminishing the replay value...

9. Enemies - Enemies arent spawned properly. I started a brand new game to test. The minute you leave your starting area, there is a chance to encounter level 20+ enemies. This is a death sentence, even to an somewhat experienced player.

10. Heat/Cold - They drain your stamina WAY TOO FAST.

There are a lot more that I could list, but I don't have all day.
If you are interested in this type of game, you are better off spending your money on something else. I got this game on a sale, when it was much cheaper, so it's not a TOTAL loss. It only started being a loss after the initial excitement wore off, and I started encountering features (not even bugs) that are game ruining.

Хотя данная игра на выживалку не тянет от слова совсем, меня она таки  зацепила.
Что пришлось по душе
1. Все просто, 
Нинадо ломать голову как и что скрафтить, все продуманно и описанно в квестах и мануале
2. Прикольно,
Порадовали гоблины и лисички, а так же другие мобы.Расположение вполне логичное исходя из биомов обитания
3. Система крафта
Не стали изобретать велосипед, сделали все просто и лаконично, а главное без заморочек. Выбор крафта конечно не самый большой НО он в тему и продуман, нет абсолютно не нужных построек, всем приходится пользоваться.
4. Карта местности
Достаточно большая для данной игры с разными биомами, что заставляет тебя под нее подстраиваться и крафтить необходимый эквип
5. Графа/работоспособность
Для данного бюджета  вполне норм, хотя игра не про это. Лагов глюков, провалов в текстуры, просадок и прочего замечено мною не было и это огромнейший плюс. Все грузится работает как часы.
6. Обновления
Тут без комментариев, они есть и это 10

Косяки/придирки
1. Камера, ужасно не удобная
2. Отсутвие какого никакого сюжета. Его нет от слова совсем. Есть вводные квесты которые помогают сориентироваться в игре но этого мало.
3. Отсутсвие возможности автоматизации каких либо игровых процессов.
Постоянно приходится отвлекаться на рутину с крфтом (забор воды, кормежка скота, сбор растений с грядки)
4. Отсутвие возможности сортировать сумку 
5. Пустая карта Кроме как собирать квестовые итомы делать на ней нечего 
6. Нет возможности разбирать ненужный эквип и к середине игры у тебя образуется свалака
7. Ночью вообще ничего не видно и приходится тупо ждать.

Итого.
Не смотря, что косяков/придирок у меня получилось больше. Я склонен рекомендовать данную игру. Она поможет потратить время, в случае исправление вышеуказанного разрабами в нее захочется возвращаться.

Also, i cannot move the camera when the inventory screen is open, so when I'm looking for an ingredient or food or something, I have to shuffle back and fourth, since the game only lets you pick stuff up when the inventory window is open. however, i do like the progression of the game - you're free to kind of do whatever, but there are quest goals if you want to advance your skill level etc. I'm just getting to the part where I learn to trap and tame the wild chickens.",1488785066,1488785066,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Do I think it's worth the $8 price tag?  Absolutely.  Do I think it stacks up to other similar-ish titles like Starbound or Subnautica?  No.

Here's the best way of describing it: do you want a crafting game that's a bit on the ""rails""?  Because this game is definitely on ""rails"" - you've got an extremely linear progression of what you have to do, with little room for variation.  In Minecraft survival, for instance, you can within the first 2 minutes be doing any number of completely different things: sailing on an ocean, beginning a farm, mining deep under the soil, starting a ranch, etc.  This game basically requires you do all aspects before you can proceed onward.  Want to build an epic farm?  Too bad - you can't have any more seedbeds until you level up, and that level-up requires you to defeat enough monsters to get 30 gold coins and to build a cooking table.

If you're up for a crafting game that's less open-ended?  You'll probably like this, especially for an extremely reasonable price tag ($8 is an awesome price for the game, which easily makes up for its gameplay irks.)

If what you love in crafting games is absolute freedom?  Then this might not be what you're looking for (still, for a price tag of only $8, it might still be worth a try.)

Очутился на пляже. В рваных штанах - шортах. 
Насобирал всё, что не приколочено. 
Напинал пальмовых кустов.
Построил костёр.. немного обжился. 
Пришла пора расширять область деятельности.
Смотрю какие-то чёртики бегают. 

Уже расстроился, думаю - вот весь сюжет игры построили на плоской шутке про пьянство.
Ан нет. Оказалось - тролли. Ну очень похожи на, в моем ,воображаемом, представлении, чёртиков.

В общем то, чего давно не хватало.
Есть база, относительно безопасная, где можно построить ферму, добыть ресурсы.
Тщательно проработанная дзен система крафта. 

На первом биоме даже животные нормальные - лисы, кабаны, медведи, овцы, куры, коровы, козы.
Почти как в нормальный, южный лес попал, если бы не тролли.
Хотя я в южных лесах не часто бываю. может там есть :).

Минуса два:
1-й это конечно камера. Намертво приколоченная. 
Убивает виртуальность игры. Персоонаж воспринимается слишком отстранённо.

2-й отсутствие автоматизации процесса. 
Пример обычного часа игры это:

{ 
Собрал воду с колодцев >
Собрал урожай, с пары десятков грядок, прокликав каждую естественно. >
Посадил урожай.. тоже на все грядки. >
На обратном пути опять собрал воду с колодцев. >
Ещё рядом пасека, собрал немного мёда. >
Пошел покормил каждую из 10-ка куриц. зерном и собрал с каждой по яйцу.>
Покормил и собрал шерсть с овец, Покормил и подоил Коров. >
Распихал урожай в 10к хранилищ..
}
И дальше всё это повторять по кругу. Пока собираешь одно, уже время собирать второе.
В эти моменты в сон клонит от рутины. Ну не должно так в игре быть.

Гораздо реже - счастье таки готовить или шить и мастерить что-то.

Außerdem vermisst man den Himmel. Was gibt es schöneres, wenn man auf einer Insel gestrandet ist, als ins offene Meer zu sehen und den Himmel zu beobachten :D
- Die Steuerung und das Bau-System ist auch etwas seltsam, wobei ich mich schnell daran gewöhnt (reingefuchst) habe.

Es ist kein perfektes Spiel, aber macht definitv Spass und ist auch mit den 8,00 Euro recht günstig. Gerade weil es ein eigenes Spiel und nicht nur eine Kopie eines spiels ist (was man ja meist vorfindet).

Возможно, разработчик просто удаляет негативные, и эту постигнет та же участь, но...

Игра отвратительна, и вот почему:

1. Фарм любого ресурса занимает просто ОГРОМНОЕ количество времени по сравнению с любой игрой про крафт чего-либо. Это просто невыносимый аспект, который уничтожает все впечатление от довольно простенбкой инди-задумки.

2. Боевка просто ужасна. Бить врага не только скучно, но и местами сложно из-за кривоватого таргетинга. Тем более врагов много и все они однотипные до определенного уровня. И когда я говорю ""однотипные"", то применительно к этой игре имеются в виду гоблины с мечами. И изредка кабан, который вас просто убьет - от него даже не особо сбежать можно.

3. Ну и последний гвоздь в крышку гроба - вы все делаете по квесту. Скрафтите то, скрафтите это, и только тогда поднимите уровень, чтобы опять скрафтить то и это и поднять следующий. И это - ВНИМАНИЕ - единственный двигатель прогресса в игре. Вам нет смысла что-то исследовать больше, чем написано по квесту. Нет смысла бить больше врагов, чем написано по квесту. Нет никакой угрозы, пока вы сами ее себе не найдете - в отличии от большинства игр с циклом день/ночь, здесь ночью не вылезают сильные монстры и вам не нужно ничего пережидать. 

Словом, не покупайте этот шлак, пожалуйста.

-In depth crafting and building
-Combat and dodging mechanics.
-A lot of tameable animals for materials.
-Principle of farming first before going out to adventure, or else you get rekt.
-Weather matters, so you need to craft appropriate gears before you progress further.

CONS:
-Camera angle will be difficult, but gets easier as you get used to it
-Bound by quest in order to level up. You have to do quests as a requirement to progress in the game. You can kill 1000 foxes but you would still be level 1. Quests are easy though.
-Invasion of AI are predictable, no need to set up a good defense as long as you build your base by the starting point(coast/beach). If you build away from the coast, get ready to farm your materials for building repairs. Do not afk too away from the safe spawn.

Especially when you consider the fact that it is an indie game made by one person.

The game is basically like Runescape without the life sucking repetitive grind for individual skill levels. Though there is quite a bit of grind if you play the normal mode of the game, where its just like one big tutorial mode, where you are told to do basic quests that help you progress through the game, and you need to level up to unlock more items.

The dev recently added sandbox mode, or as he calls it ""creative"" mode, where you can build and craft everything without the level restrictions. Though to level up you still need to do annoying fetch quest for shinny baubles in this mode. There is still quite a bit of a grind in this mode, but that comes purely from gathering the resources you need to build stuff with, which kind of is the whole point of the game.

The whole game is just basically you wake up on some stranded island/continent, and build up personal settlement. You can tame farm animals, build houses, crafting stations, and craft armor, weapon, food, and other tools. There a plenty of enemies to fight, though combat is kind of just stand and click at enemy while consuming food. You can attempt to dodge/strafe around with some weapons that don't lock you into place, but in most cases its not really worth it or not possible. Like for instance if you're fighting a bear then you definitely wanna move since it has a consecutive combo attack, where if you just stand there it will do a rapid 3 hit attack on you (a lot of things in game have this but not all). But for other animals like foxes and boars... you kind of just want to stand still because if they get down to like 30% or 40% health they just start running away at super speed which is super annoying, so you want to just stand there and wait until they are locked into that 3 attack combo they're doing so that way they don't just attack and flee.

There are other creatures like the rock gollum or giant minotaur goblin thing that you literally can not evade their attacks due to their long range, so you just want to stand there and dps them down as quickly as possible.

Overall the game is a great game, very well polished, and well designed in every way minus the FOV camera... and maybe how useless the good armors are since most of the quest require you to go into a desert or cold biomes which require you to wear the cool / warmth clothing armor (bedouin / fur) sets that have low armor instead of the high armor value armor sets like steel or gold armor.",1487645085,1487645085,True,2,0,0.558823525905609131,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Some problem with building. You place the building and then sit and watch for minutes as the buildings build themselves.
- You also need a tool to craft anything. You craft yourself a stone knife as a tool, and even though you still have it on yourself, you can't use it for fighting, because it's a tool now.

My least favorite thing, The UI

[b]- The UI is grade A garbage -[/b]

All the windows you need you have to access seperately, wouldn't be too bad if you didn't need to navigate them awkwardly to get everything you craft. (you need to open a window for the crafting menu which has all the recipies and then close it so you can get your crafted item(s). To be honest about half the time played I was navigating different windows.

- Gameplay -
The whole game is 1 big tutorial. All of it. Which is made worse with the bad UI. Granted my character only made it to be level 5 so it MIGHT get better, but I wasn't going to hold my breath. No real survival aspect but I'll explain more below.

- ""Survival"" -
STAMINA! The only survival aspect was the use of stamina. If you don't have it, eat. You can ""survive"" forever if you simply stand where you spawn and don't do anything. So you have a lack of motivation other then to complete the tutorials, which is there to give you something to do because if it wasn't there then you would be bored in a sandbox.

- RPG -
NO EXP. Everything follows the wim of the step by step quest/tutorial. You can't craft if your not the right level, continue the tutorial to level

- Normal Navigation -
Pretty rough to be honest. Pretty well everythign obstructs your path. It would be nice if I was able to pass through simple bushes or sunflower patches. Hacking things down to get at enemies make it more difficult to fight because it eats all your stamina

- Visuals -
To be honest im ok with the graphics, feels like runescape or the first sims games. The camera however is aweful. No matter the angle your visually impaired.

First, the game captures the mouse.  Not a big deal for most people, but for someone who streams games as a hobby and likes to be able to use my secondary monitor at all, this is kind of big, but wouldn't have still been an issue if the game didn't also minimize upon hitting alt-tab to switch out of it so that I could have my mouse back.  Multi-tasking is a huge deal to me, and so that's a major strike, right there, and I'm filing it under poor UI design.

Second, I couldn't capitalize letters in the world name nor use any punctuation.  More accurately, I had to use all capital letters, SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE WAS YELLINLG THE WORLD NAME AT ALL TIMES.  All caps is, as one can tell, an eyesore and again, this is really poor UI design.  As a game developer and someone who has written an operating system from scratch, knowing the difference between when someone is holding their shift key and when they are not is kind of a no-brainer.

Third, and I see this, time and again in the video games industry, but not only no character customization, but I'm railroaded into being a male character.

How long did y'all spend developing this game?  I can tell there are a lot of gameplay elements that could have led to this being a pleasant experience with hours of gameplay for me (just look at how much time I've spent on other sandbox games like Wurm Unlimited, Terraria, Creativerse, and Starbound).

The game is heavily crafting based, loosely survival based. While it is a ""survival"" type of game, you dont die of hunger, dehydration, etc. You will not die if you don't eat every 5 minutes or drink. There are monsters that can kill you, and after I have played for 5 hours, that's the only cause of death I have found.

That being said, I personally love the crafting in the game. Some people say it is too ""guided"" with the level system, but I disagree. The level system essentially gives you objectives of certain new items to craft that help you progress in the game and get further. You can go farm materials as much as you want eventually, and build fenced in farms, etc.

Overall, I find the game extremely relaxing. It's a nice game to chill and play in the evenings and craft up your base, etc. The ""soundtrack"" is nature sounds, which to me is a huge plus and just makes the game even more relaxing.

TL;DR: Overall, if you like crafting games and aren't looking for something too hardcore on the survival side, I highly suggest this game. Very underrated title IMO.",1487223246,1487223246,True,8,0,0.584615349769592285,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have around 28 hours played and I'm only at level 9 because I have been taking my time and enjoying all this game has to offer.

Some complained about losing their stuff when they would die or how the game automatically saves all the time but I found this regreshing - brought me back to when you had 3 hearts and if you lost 'em, you restarted the whole level!

Il gioco inizia in un territorio non ben definito, nel quale io, personalmente, ho identificato un'isola. 
Non abbiamo nulla se non un paio di pantaloni strappati e un po' di speranza nel trovare qualcosa o qualcuno. Non ci sono particolari dialoghi, nei primi secondi di gioco il protagonista si chiede cosa sia accaduto ed ecco che inizia l'avventura di sopravvivenza.  
Il gioco ha le basi del più classico dei survival: si parte da un fuocherello per cuocere la carne e fare qualche oggetto in terracotta, si crafta qualche utensile base per tagliare legna e ottenere pietra; per ricavare ,invece,  la sabbia o la terra dovremo scavare. Tutto procede molto lentamente poichè serviranno sempre grandi quantità di materie prime per craftare determinati oggetti che a loro volta ne creeranno altri. Una particolarità che ho apprezzato è l'assenza della fame e del freddo. Io personalmente apprezzo questa cosa perchè mi immerge di più nel crafting strutturale.
Si può arrivare, dopo svariate ore di gioco, a creare un villaggio fortificato siccome si possono costruire diverse abitazioni e circondarle con palizzate in legno. 
Coltivare e allevare sarà fondamentale, le coltivazioni daranno il cibo per gli animali e loro daranno al giocatore prodotti come latte, uova e piume (le piume servono per fare le frecce). Catturarli non è affatto semplice, bisogna esplorare l'isola piena di goblin ed orsi che cercano di ucciderci e utilizzare delle reti da lanciare. Dopo 3 o 4 tentativi forse si riesce a prendere un polletto…o una mucca…
Un leggero lato fantasy è presente, ci sono diverse creature insolite, si possono utilizzare dei portali per passare da una parte all'altra della mappa e bisogna cercare dei ''force of nature shard'', artefatti che si possono trovare grazie ad una bussola. 

I lati negativi, a parer mio, sono molto pochi ma decisamente pesanti.
1) Iniziamo con le fortificazioni che, sempre secondo me, servono al 50%.
Che noi infatti siamo nel nostro territorio o ci troviamo lontano da esso, i nemici riescono comunque a sfondare la nostra palizzata in legno senza difficoltà alcuna. È però apprezzabile il fatto che una notifica ci avverta dell'imminente invasione e ci permetta così di ritornare in tempo.
2) Non comprendo del tutto il livello del personaggio. Ogni volta che saliamo  di livello sblocchiamo  nuovi oggetti da craftare; ciò nonostante, anche se abbiamo tutti I materiali per costruire una casa In legno, non riusciamo nella costruzione. Perchè mai dovremmo utilizzare tutto il materiale per edificare invece una casetta più piccola? 
Per salire di livello bisogna, inoltre, completare delle quest che, fondamentalmente, sono utili in quanto ci danno la possibilità di craftare determinati e importanti oggetti, tuttavia non abbiamo alcuna libertà. Infatti notiamo che, se non completiamo le quest, restiamo sempre con una mazza di pietra anche se abbiamo tutti materiali occorrenti per una in ferro. 
3) Gli oggetti e le costruzioni che sblocchiamo, sono distribuiti nei vari livelli, a parer mio, in modo insensato.
Per esempio: ho costruito delle palizzate ma per fare I portoni devo aspettare il livello successivo, quindi finchè non avrò il portone le mie difese non servono neanche al 50%.

Riassunto: con pochi euro si può comprare un prodotto particolare con una vasta gamma di oggetti e costruzioni che permettono di creare un piccolo paradiso in una terra misteriosa ma allo stesso tempo il gioco presenta dei fattori completamente privi di logica.

Из преимуществ - нет идиотичной сетевой версии, поэтому она оптимизирована сразу для игры против пк.

В игре все бы было классно, если бы не одно обстоятельство: обилие микроменеджмента. Тебе постоянно нужно заниматься всякой х.ней, бегая между курицами, грядками, колодцем, столом готовки и т.д. При этом все очень быстро созревает, вылупляется, набирается... Ты можешь час бегать между животными и постройками, чтобы скрафтить какую-нибудь фигню. Вначале, это нравится. Но потом страшно задалбливает. 80% игры сводится к беганию на маленьком пятачке и проведению одних и тех же операций. 
Нет очереди строительства. Нет возмоности сразу сделать чего-то много (пусть и затратив время), чтобы на какой-то период времени этим себя обеспечить. И не думайте, что из этого что-то интересное получится. Сделал многочасовую подготовку, собрал в дорогу себе продуктов, сходил за рудой, по дороге убил примитивно десяток мелких врагов, и опять возвращаешься, чтобы делать многочасовую мелочевку. 

Еще огромный минус игры - это то, что камера фиксирована почти над тобой и никак не меняет угол.

Теперь о плюсах, которые заставляют периодически возвращаться в игру:
- крафтинг. Вот всем, кому нравится что-то из чего-то получать, тут сделано неплохо. Кроме того, за счет относительно малого количества руды, а также того, что персонаж довольно быстро утает, процесс сбора ресурсов и дальнейшего крафтинга не выглядит совсем уж легкой прогулкой.
- простота. Это тот редкий случай, когда довольно простой геймплэй не минус, а плюс. Ничего лишнего. Да, управление далеко не идеальное, но к этом привыкаешь. Зато не отвлекаешься на сложности (например, нет параметров ""голод"", ""жажда"" и тд. Только здоровье и энергия)
- нет сетевой версии! Я знаю, что многие любят подобного рода игрушки за сетевые версии (тот же Ark или Rising world), но я в них разочаровался, так как они заточены именно на сетевые игры и только там становятся более-менее интересными. В итоге, ты постоянно борешься за жизнь с прокаченной агрессивной школатой, вместо того, чтобы тихо себе и мирно развиваться и крафтить.
- Несмотря на минусы микроменеджмента и то, что это тебя задалбливает и ты говоришь, что игра гамно, все равно к ней через некоторое время возвращаешься).

The answer is simple: no content. You cannot craft anything you want, you must do quests which say 'go build a table' or 'get next level', and to get next level you just bring some crafting materials like 5 golden bars, 30 logs, etc. Seriously, why the game tries to push me?

Pros:
[list]
[*] Nice graphics. Minecraft-style really sux.
[*] Somewhat challenging, thought challenge comes through grind.

Cons:
[list]
[*] Grind, grind, grind.
[*] Fights imbalance. You just cannot kill some animals cause they run away at 20%HP, you cannot outun them and bow is too low DPS  to finish them. And they return after some time with full HP.  BTW you cannot run away from fight, mobs will pursue you cross the map.
[*] Crafting imbalance. Most recipes take too long to complete. Most plants grow too fast. E.g. to make piece of burning wood you need 1 minute at fireplace and wheats grows from seed at the same exact time. Add to this some crazy recipes like compass = 2 copper bars + 4 glass bars + 2 tin bars +4 gold bars (guys, there must be iron or some other ferromagnetic stuff in compass, not gold which is uber-grindy to obtain in game)
[*] Respawn. WHY MOBS KEEP SPAWNING IN MY BASE???
[*] Bad camera. You cannot see anything 20 meters away.
[*] Outdated graphics.

配音很单调，但这是正式版了啊。
玩法很单调，不能批量种植很麻烦；
俘虏动物用的网，没有个预览范围，是向真实性低头吗。
总之现阶段弹bug会控制你的发展。

This game is ALL about very very slow grinding grinding grinding and losing your hard earned crafting mats, food, gear, etc as a death penalty. Not to mention the difficulty in accessing certain areas. I cant even put into words the amount of frustration this game has given me. I spent hours upon hours trying to get the second force of nature gem at level 7. I would continually get mobed by grouped npcs level 20+, get killed and lose most of my food. Upon respawning at home base, I would have to restock on materials which took atleast 30 mins to complete and head out again to make another attempt at getting the gem. By the time I got to the destination, all npcs had respawned thus having to clear the area again. (Rinse and Repeat)

This could be a very good game if it were more forgiving. If you dont mind a slow grinding challenging game where you dont mind losing hard earned materials, then this is for you. As for me, this has been extremly frustrating, unrewarding and a waste of my time.  ""DELETE""",1486896837,1486896837,False,5,2,0.466123104095458984,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I really didn't enjoy that leveling in this game is 100% based off of questing/looting. It's extremely annoying to have to loots 30 kobolds just to get 15 copper for 1 level, but mainly having to perform specific quests is annoying. Exp based leveling system I feel would make this game 100 times better. I died one time on this game in the 2.5 hrs i played. 

That's because there were 4 fox's 1 boar and a freaking bear in a spot surrounded by trees that I was completely unable to see. It wouldn't have been an issue if i was allowed to run away, however no matter how far you run from these animals they will continously follow you until either they get to 10% health or you die. This mixed with the inability to sprint is annoying. 

I would suggest adding in note or something telling people about the space bar. I didn't even know about this until I was forced to tame and animal and it took me about 20mins to realize there was a ruby on the shore to pick up for the bonfire. I didn't even know how to pick up items until I accidently hit Q when around some palms and at that point I was a long way away from the ruby I had to search for about 5 mins just to find it. 

The game as a whole is entertaining. However, with the way you level and having to level in order to get more items to create, I doubt I will play it to much more. Sitting around for 20 mins to get all the items or searching the map for 15 mins just to find enough kobolds to kill to get the gold or copper i need to level is extremely boring. With the inability to adjust the screen to actually see what is infront of you, just makes the experience a little more annoying than fun. 

With all that being said, I would still recommend this game for casual survival gamers. Not really hard to pick up, just a few annoyances you have to get over in order to really get into the game.",1486878767,1486878767,True,13,1,0.683997154235839844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's not a really good casual game or if you don't have time to dedicate to it, plan on doing stuff over and over again.

The day/night cycle is entirely too short, it gets dark really fast and it's hard to see where you are when it's dark out. You can make a bed to skip the nights, but by the time you get to exploring and you get into it, it's magically night time again. The enemies in this game seem to enjoy ganking you, get a bit further done with the map and suddenly you'll get ambushed by mobs. 

Don't plan on getting any type of armor for the game till you reach level 7, and the armor is not good. There are also areas in the game you need warm clothes or cool clothes, some areas that are even colder than the clothes you craft so you take on damage.

Увидел игру, заинтересовало. Прочитал отзывы, увидел отзыв о сильной похожести на старую олдскульную графику Аллодов (от которых я был без ума в свое время:)) и про сильную и долгую систему крафта. Потом поглядел стрим у знакомой и решил купить. Из плюсов: реально, чтобы что-то сделать, надо задолбаться побегать и понажимать кнопочки (об этом позже); активное окружение - все можно сломать, срубить, собрать; графика не ахти, но и не отталкивающая - кабанчики явно срисованы с Аллодов!; много всяких вещей, для которых вечно не хватает места, но они все потом оказываются нужны. Не понравилось: фиксированная камера, не дающая толком обзора; ограничение по крафту в зависимости от уровня (больше заданного значения колодцев/грядок не построишь), отсюда проблема постоянно делать одно и то же по несколько раз; чтобы апнуться, надо не только выполнить квесты, но и собрать некоторое количество ресурсов, которые после апа пропадают (а эти ресурсы выбиваюся только боевкой из мобов). Но все перевешивает крафт (но и он потом по факту достает)! Начнем по-порядку. Вы появляетесь, как обычно, голым и с пустыми руками. Первым делом бежим пинать деревья и кусты, выбиваем пальмовые листья и ветки. Из листьев в руках крафтим веревки, с ветками объединяем в примитивный инструмент. Дальше рубим деревья на бревна и ветки (попутно собираем кокосы, яблоки, бананы с них), долбим каменные блоки на камень и руду. Строим шалаш, костер. Потом собираем первый инструмент - стол. Это аналог ручного крафта с расширенными рецептами. В частности, в нем бревна разделываем в доски, делаем из камня осколки (пойдут на стрелы)  и т.д. В костре ветки превращаем в угольки, апаем второй уровень. Нам открывается угольная плавилка, где бревна превращаем в уголь. Строим кузницу и плавильную печь. Вторая - плавить руду, куда нам нужны угольки и уголь. Первая - делаем гвозди и мет. инструмент. По фермерству - строим грядки, высаживаем туда поначалу только пшеницу. Потом откроют кофе и разные травы. Там порядка 30 видов рассады (пока все не видал. Животноводство упрощено. В столе делаем ловушки, которые набрасываем на бегающих на территории диких животных: есть куры (яйца), петухи (перья на стрелы), козы и коровы (молоко), овцы (шерсть), свиньи (пока хз что). Живность не размножается. Ресы добывать с животных просто: покормил, подождал, собрал. Жрут все только пшеницу, кроме кур. Эти жрут семена пшеницы. Всем надо воду. Вода вообще дефицит. Набирается только в колодце, в котором лимит - 5 штук. Наполняется после забора быстро, но надо постоянно к нему бегать. Вода нужна: посадка одного растения, кормежка одного животного (коровам надо аж две за раз), изготовление 1 шт. еды - все требует 1 единицы воды. Короче, тут засада.  Через какое-то время дают стол портного, где можно делать одежду. Выясняется, что есть несколько климатических зон, где без спец. одежды нечего делать - быстро окочуришься. Кстати, про кулинарию и навыки персонажа. Навыков как таковых нет. Ап уровня дает исключительно небольшую прибавку к сопротивляемости урону и наносимому урону, ну и открывает новые возможности крафта. Никакого опыта в игре нет. Апаешься, когда сделаешь задания, назначенные на этот уровень и соберешь нужное количестве предметов. У персонажа два показателя - здоровье и энергия. Энергия падает от любого действия, здоровье собственно от урона. Со временем потихоньку восстанавливаются оба показателя. Конечно, с энергией вечная проблема. Поначалу перебиваешься кокосами и бананами (они немного восстанавливают ее), потом варишь кофе. Выращиваешь на грядках, делаешь на кухонном столе. Постепенно добавляются новые типы еды, одежды и крафт старых становится бесполезным. Смысла игры как такового нет: каждый уровень собираем дроп с мобов в виде драг. камней и добываем часть камня Force of Nature. На 12 уровне собираем 7 таких частей и крафтим все в один камень. При этом чтобы его скрафтить надо еще набить кучу камней из всех зон, где вы раньше были. Когда это все собираем, порядком устав, и ожидаем ВАУ, игра просто предлагает начать все заново на уровне ""Хардкор"". Ничего не происходит больше, можно дальше бегать, но смысла в этом нет. В итоге 6 олдскульных кабанов из 10.",1486394551,1486394551,True,1,0,0.484089374542236328,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall Score? 6.1/10

Game looks nice with that survival ""arc"" and immersive feel, but it is barely fun; the game is ultimately time consuming and boring. Force of Nature has in its core a badly implemented leveling/building system. You need to find resources very hard to obtain in order to level up. In order to unlock critical items you need, you are forced to do tedious quests in order to gain the next level. But... it only gets worse. The game is very strict. There is hardly any freedom in this game even though it claims to be an open world... game mechanics such as your stamina is horribly awful (for example if you are out of stamina, you cannot defend yourself or mine for resources + you can't run), obstacles (SOOOO MANY, like trees or even bushes) get in your way that you want to go hence you are forced to spend a really long time grinding your way through them (only to completely destroy your stamina), enemies run away from you all the time and it is extremely difficult to kill them or even catch up to them (so expect various enemies to take away your health then run away all the time if hurt), AND FINALLY the worst part of this game, progression!!

The progression in this game is terrible. Let me point out it has taken me 16 hours just to get to LEVEL SEVEN (7)! You need to get to level 2 just to get an axe to chop down trees, yeah it's that bad. The time and effort needed to be put in this game in order to do anything is worse than even space engineers, and that game's survival mechanics sucks too. But anyway, if you are tired of the items you got and you wanna get even better stuff, prepare to grind another 10 hours out of your life.

Limits placed on what you can build is another BIG issue. First off, why can't I put chests on grass or nature ground? Outside of the little cramed area that is so called a house? The chests also don't contain a lot of space to store items. That is pretty disgusting in itself as I am forced to litter my own yard with useless items you can't even get arrid of. Inventory space is a problem, interior spacing is bad, and by the time you are at level 7, you can only build 2 houses and 2 other that costs a heck ton of resources. You can only build one of this building and one of that building, why not unlimited and freely expand my territory?

- Camera angle unadjustable, I hate the top down view.
- Limitations placed on all of what you can build.
- Wonky GUI, not fluid. You have to spend time dragging items from your inventory to a chest for example (no control or shift click).
- Enemies run away from you all the time and are hard to kill at that point. No rewards for loss of health and stamina.
- In hot weather and out of food to eat to cure stamina? RIP
- Lack of hotkeys.
- GUI wonky implementation (hard to explain, just copy Minecraft/factorio mechanics and scrap this GUI).
- Forced obstacle removal to get to where you need to go.
- Forced direction, hardly any freedom.
- Incredibly bad leveling system (why can't you just kill things for XP?)
- Incredibly tedious resource gathering.
- Incredibly bad stamina implementation.
- Agonizing progression system.
- 8 hotbars instead of 10 for your quickslots (WHY ONLY 8??)
- Bad controls.
- Some rigid sound affects are present, specifically the goblins.
- Lack of paliside Gates.
- Iron axe/pickaxe at level 8? Progression gap.
- Spelling errors.
- Half naked until 10+ hours of gameplay.
- Feels unfinished.

BUT...
- Very nice immersive playstyle.
- Has lots of potential.
- I like the portals idea.
- I like the click and hold mechanic where you can gather like 100 wheat in 2 seconds. Not even minecraft has that.
- 5 feathers given from a rooster? SWEET!
- Tame an ally to fight with you? Nice.
- I like the beginning choices of your cudgel, stone cudgel or fang cudgel. Why can't you add more weapon variants?
- Art style is almost flawless.
- AI is very good (EXCEPT WHEN THEY RUN AWAY!)
- I like the compass mechanic.

Overall, this review seems harsh, but not bad. It can compete as it has that spark of potential and I WANT to like the game. So if the game improves and these major errors are fixed, then I'll gladly change my review and play it again. But for now? $7 ... I guess it is almost worth it if you removed at least the creatures running away ALL THE TIME, obstacles in your path, the stamina mechanic improvements, and finally rehauled the leveling system or give the game more freedom.",1485994461,1485994461,False,5,0,0.545489788055419922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Nach knapp 6 Spielstunden möchte ich euch dieses Game gerne ans Herz legen. Es bietet die typischen Survival-Elemente wie Crafting, Kochen, das Anbauen von Lebensmitteln sowie das Halten von Haus- beziehungsweise Nutztieren. Mich persönlich fesselt das Spiel von der ersten Minute. Ich habe das Spiel hier bei Steam entdeckt und bin nach einem kurzen Technikcheck sofort ins Let´s Play gestartet. Es gibt ständig etwas zu entdecken und selbst das Sammeln von Rohstoffen wird nicht langweilig. Schnell kommen erste Erfolge wie das errichten der ersten Hütte oder das Fangen der ersten Nutztiere.

[b]Folgende Eckpunkte möchte ich gerne festhalten:[/b]

+ Schöne Grafik
+ Wechselnde Wetterverhältnisse
+ Verständlicher Einstieg in das Spiel ohne langweiliges Tutorial
+ inzwischen deutsche Lokalisierung
+ gute Ressourcendosierung auf der Map (nicht zuviel, nicht zu wenig)

- starre Kameraperspektive, hier bitte nochmal nachbessern
- teilweise schwierige Kämpfe, wenn z.B. 2 Bären kommen (evtl. Möglichkeit zur Flucht ?)
- Charakter startet nach dem Laden immer am Strand (nur ein ganz kleiner Kritikpunkt)

Alles in allem empfehle ich dieses Spiel jedem der das Survival-Crafting-Genre mag.

Just finished the game, good god. Well it's my first review so im gonna keep it short:

Pros:
- Beautiful world
- Nice but yet a bit incomplete crafting system
- Skillful and difficoult, but if too hard grind can compromise the lack of skills
- Dying doesn't feel too punishing yet you wanna avoid it
- Easy to understand, difficoult to master. You really need some creativity or tons of grinding for pots to beat some chunks of enemies

Cons:
- Killing enemies doesnt feel rewarding enough, since there is nothign such as EXP. Plus the drops feel a bit weak aswell. The coins appear to be fun at first like a currency, sadly all u gonna do with them is melting them for material... Please do a seperate leveling system by killing stuff next to the progress with the quests... where you can specialize your char and customize his stats! WE WANT!
- No Coop. Really hope thats gonna happen... This is one of those games in which you really wish you could play with friends...
- Too Grindy during the last 2 Levels... Thing is, this game isnt too complex, so grinding easily feels monotoneus. Would add more stuff to craft like e.g. enchanting equip´ment or being able to upgrade it or smth would bring more variety into this. Maybe even more types of arrows like frosting arrows etc.
- Camera might get you frustrated, but you get used to it. At start it was depressive not being able to tilt the cam... I get why, but really hope its getting at least a bit more dynamic.

All in all, watch some gameplay. If it appears okay to you, then get it, because its a decent game and all its flaws are basicly being too simple and in early access after all. If the devs keep on adding more good stuff and get that cam more dynamic and support online mode (at least coop if no pvp aswell), we would have a fantastic game worth every penny.",1485901223,1485901419,True,7,1,0.557615935802459717,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The concept is one we've seen before, Unnamed guy stranded on unnamed island, survive.

my first complaint is that unless you are telling a -specific- story, there is no reason to not allow some style of character selection between male or female character. I make this grip for a lot of these games. Life Is feudal had it, but they eventually added the option. Savage Lands and Subnautica are other culprits that still has yet to make the fix. DEvs often cite 'it's a lto of work' and i'm sure it's a good bit of coding/modeling, but really... a little forethought for those of us who are not male gamers, who like ot see a girl in the lead... it's not that much to ask is it?

The camera is VERY unintuitive... it would be easier to set Q & E as strafe and have A & D for turning, or something, than to have the mouse control the camera spin, especially when the pointer is your form of interacting with objects...

a zoom option might be a good thing too, but that's a small nitpick...

SAdly my play with this game has come to a halt due to multiple, consistent critical crashes. the kind that make you reach over and hard restart your whole system. i haven't tracked down the cause, but since it happens at the exact same moment, EVERY time, regardless of graphics settings, I'm giving up until there's more patches done on this to stabilize it a bit.

Dieses Spiel macht wirklich großen Spass !!! Man landet auf einer einsamen Insel. 
Am Anfang überlebt man mit dem was einem die Natür gibt. Aus Steinen werden Splitter hergestellt, aus Palmwedeln Seile, aus einfachsten Materialien werden erstmal Kleinigkeiten gebaut, einfache Werkzeuge hergestellt usw.
Man bekommt jedes Level neue Quests zum erfüllen und diese Quests leiten einen außerderm durch die Karte und man hat sehr schnell den Dreh raus. 
Ab und zu ist natürlich auch mal paar Minuten Holz kloppen oder Erz farmen dran aber es hält sich in Grenzen und artet nicht aus zu einem langweiligem gefarme, da natürlich auch die Insel Feinde bietet :)
Am Anfang relativ leicht Goblins, dann greift dich mal ein verrücktes Wildschwein an usw.
Ich habe bis jetzt knapp 30 Std gespielt und bin Level 8 und mir hat einfach die Vielfalt was man in dem Spiel alles machen kann am meisten Spass gemacht :) Tiere einfangen (zähmen) und eine Weide bauen für seine Schäfchen Kühe Hühner etc^^
Laut Liste bzw. die Kronik zeigt einem was man mit div. Level bauen kann. Diese geht aktuell bis Level 12

Kurz und knapp ich kann euch nur das Spiel empfehlen, wer gerne Craftet, Farmt, die Welt erkundet und aber auch Aktion bieten die div. Monster und Feinde. Die Musik ist sehr entspannend, und das Spiel läuft sehr rund und ist wirklich gut gelungen.

ゲームコンセプトは良いのだが過剰なまでのクエスト進行によるアイテムの作製制限と厳しすぎるゲームバランスが駄目にしている。



このゲームはクエストという名目で指定された施設を建て、アイテムを作製していく事でレベルが上がり新しいアイテムが解禁されていくシステムなのだが、
このクエストで指示された以外の順番でのアイテム作製は　一　切　認　め　ら　れ　な　い　

鉄のインゴットが手に入ったから石の斧から鉄の斧に変えて採集効率あげたい。→駄目。その前に料理施設建てなさい。

料理や動物の餌やりに水沢山使うから井戸を２つ建てたい！　→駄目。レベルが上がるまで１つしか建てられない。

虹色の鉱石守ってる敵が集団でボコってきて辛い・・・防具作りたい。　→駄目。虹色の鉱石手に入れたら作っていいよ。


・・・そう。このゲームにサンドボックスやサバイバルゲーム特有の自由差は全くない。
貧弱な装備で奥地に進み上級素材を入手して無双するとか、序盤から拠点構築に力を入れてアイテム満載で探索に励むといった
プレイヤーの好みにあった攻略の仕方が出来ない。あるのは制作者の意図した通りのバランスによる進行のみ。



それでもゲーム内容は自分の趣味ドストライクだったし、厳しいバランスでも我慢してやり続けるつもりだったが
第二の虹色鉱石を探しに行ったら気温の変化でダメージを受けるようになり、指定された防具を作らないと絶対に先に進めないバランスと察して心が折れた。
苦労して防具作ってもまたすぐに同じ事やらないといけないと思うとやってられない。（辛いのはここだけかもしれないけどね）

It's supposedly a survival/crafting/adventure game..  and 18 hours of play into it, it's fairly nonsensical on all 3 fronts.

To begin with, the available camera angles are *abysmal*.  You basically have ""overhead"" and ""almost overhead"". Which means you have about 25 feet of visibility, regardless of weather conditions.  And since I haven't read anything suggesting an in-game story reason for this, such as ""your character is hideously nearsighted"".. there's no excuse for it.

Additionally, visibility is further decreased by treecover. Which is nigh everywhere.  Down on the ground, where your character is, you would ostensibly be able to see reasonably well.  Up above, where the camera sits.. tree cover reduces your visibility to a mere 3-5 feet in many places..

And considering that your ability to survive encounters with goblins and hostile wildlife is wholly dependent upon your ability to be able to see them before they see you, and selectively ""pull"" individuals.. well, effectively you will die far more often from the complete rubbish camera angles and getting jumped by multiple enemies (none of whom have any logical in-world reason why they would be working together, btw) than from any other circumstance.

You will be attacked by bears. Boars. Goblins.  These sorta make sense.  You will also be attacked by foxes.. who are harder to kill than the weapon wielding humanoid goblins.  This does not make sense. Neither their durability nor their behavior.. as, simply put, foxes *don't do this*.

The Crafting system.. I have mentioned it is nonsensical. Some examples..  Early on,  you build a ""blast furnace"". Well, even if we discount the silliness that what appears to be a medieval bread oven is being called a ""blast furnace"", despite no bellows or the like,  you gain the ability to cast ingots of copper, iron, tin, gold...   And when you build an anvil, you can make copper or iron into nails..  But yet.. when you go to make a ""spiked cudgel"", you cannot, as logic would dictate, simply hammer a bunch of iron nails into a cudgel.. no, you must go slay many aggressive animals with your inferior weaponry in order to acquire their teeth and claws, substances far less effective to make a cudgel ""spiked"" than actual metal *nails*..

There's a lot of similar nonsense. Later on, when you have the ability to make clothing.. you need something like 14 pelts to make a pair of gloves.  I could see that if you were killing chipmunks. Bears?  Boars? Foxes?  Um, hell no.  Requiring nails to make fences..   There's a dozen ways to make fences.. sturdy fences, that don't require nails at all. I can actually build you a *house* without the use of nails..   So some very illogical bits here.  Requiring gold ingots to make a compass. Dafuq?   It's not that I'm expecting immaculate realism here, but if you're making a game in which crafting and survival are significant components, you ought to be expected to at least pick up a boy scout handbook or something for reference..

Similarly.. you can smelt and work iron. Yet the first weapon advances past your inferior animal-fang-and-claw-studded-cudgel is a *bronze* sword.  You can work iron. Why the *hell* would someone concerned with survival make a weapon of Bronze?  The ""Bronze Age"" preceeded the ""Iron Age"" for a reason.  Anyway..

Let's talk about levelling.. and its effects..  Every time you level, you gain a small amount of health, stamina, and defense.. and apparently, the magical understanding of things like ""pants"" because you've beaned 50 goblins over the head.  Yeah, crafting is locked behind level walls, which are determined mainly by completing a couple quests and how much loot you've gotten from killing various aggressive things..   The combat and exploration mechanics are *entirely* forced and feel very unnatural.   You're set off to acquire some various mystic widgets.. which you mysteriously know you need to get because reasons, but yet you cannot comprehend pants without beaning things in the head...  There's no ""story"" here to make this an ""adventure"" or ""rpg"", despite the tags... there's no lore that I've discovered within the game context...  The only reason you do anything is because a little quest box tells you to.. 

And, in my opinion, that really robs much of the redeeming quality as an ""Adventure"" game that Force of Nature has.  

You can basically sum it up as ""grind a whole bunch to satisfy some nonsensical quest requirements, level up, kill a bunch of wildlife to magically gain the ability to make pants, repeat ad nauseum."" 

Most games with a ""survival"" aspect to them generally fail in that regard... and this is no exception.  But it's not too far from its peers, so I'm got going to be too ruthless in my criticism here..    Apparently, later on, temperature of the area you're exploring plays a role, but for the most part, you don't have to eat, you don't have to drink, you don't have to sleep..  Ingestion of food replenishes heath and/or stamina.. water is used for agriculture, animals, and crafting.. but you don't actually *drink* any of it.. unless you make coffee.. 

But the main element of survival is the mindset... and this game misses it totally with its forced combat and level locked crafting mechanics.  If you're trying to survive, you don't go randomly wandering into hostile territory just for giggles.

Besonders schade finde ich, das man komplett an die Quests gebunden ist, was die Craftingmöglichkeiten angeht. Ich fühlte mich dadurch stellenweise ziemlich limitiert und saß lange auf Rohstoffen, die sich erst einige Level später, dank der Quest-/Levelabhängigkeit verarbeiten ließen.

Auch der Umstand, das es bis Lvl9/10 einfach nicht lohnt Lagerplatz zu bauen (zu teuer, zu aufwändig, zu wenig Slots) ist bedauerlich. Es ist sicherlich nie Sinn des Ganzen gewesen, das Spieler ihr Inventar auf dem Boden verteilen, weil das Lagersystem viele Level lang schlicht zu unattraktiv ist.

An den oft kritisierten Kamerawinkel habe ich mich relativ schnell gewöhnt, dennoch führt dieser nicht selten dazu, das man plötzlich von 2 Bären, nem Fuchs, nem Wildschwein und am besten noch 3 Goblins zugleich angegriffen wird, weil schlichtweg der Überblick fehlt.

Auch das Craftingmenü könnte besser durchdacht aufgebaut und bedienungsfreundlicher sein. 

Etwas das ich sehr schade finde ist, das die Häuschen die man baut, schlussendlich lediglich als Herberge für Werkbänke und Lagermöglichkeiten dienen, die man versucht möglichst platzsparend aneinander zu quetschen, was nicht nur nicht sonderlich schön aussieht, sondern mich vor allem etwas wie eben ein 'zu Hause' für meinen tapferen Überlebenden vermissen lässt

i find the game quite addictive at this point as theres always something to do, its not necessarily a good thing though. Collecting water, planting stuff and managing the animals is fun, but becomes quite old fast when you realise how much time it will take to get object A to make objest B. In fact you can quite easily stay at home base for 7 in game days just making stuff. I'm positive some folk will like that though as it gives a sence of accomplishment.

The graphics are ok if not a bit grainy and the weird camera angle can be annoying at first but it just adds to the charm of the game, there are different biomes that require different clothes to keep hot or cool but this adds the ""you have to do this to proceed"" element which is fine, till you run out of water. I really enjoyed the biome changes as it improved the immersion and even though you generally fight the same mobs which are just re-skins each biome sets a new enemy /challenge against you and the graphic effects really do add to the overall atmosphere.

Combat: Now this is my biggest gripe about this game and seeing as its a core element it can, for some casual gamers, be game breaking. This game will punish anyone not prepared, running wildly into ANY area can and will get you dead in seconds if you are not levelled correctly or have the required health/stamina/armour. some areas are completed closed to you as the mobs are always levelled to the biome and not the player. This also means that running through areas previously cleared is a cake walk late game and just a waste of stamina. However the addition of placing portols can negate this entirely.

The enemies seem to always be able to hit you in some circumstances no matter what, I've been several paces away and completely out of range of the mobs but still get hit even with speed amulets and the short sword, very frustrating seeing as the game awards you with a ""Bad Player"" achievement when you die 8 times...Stamina seems to bleed out of you whenever you use something and an increase in level doesnt reduce the cost you just get more stamina and better equipment.
things to note are that enemies are always faster than you, get 2 attacks to your one and swinging your sword only ever hits one enemy even when surrounded. At least you dont lose everything on death but you Do lose some stuff which can be a royal pain but adds a rogue like quality to the game.

Not bad but exceedingly time consuming to complete some tasks

Wuseliges und ( bisher ) bugfreies Spiel für diverse Stunden Aufbauspaß. Man kann Pflanzen ziehen, Tiere halten, sozusagen quasi eine Farm aufbauen.. es gibt jede Menge Crafting Rezepte für Möbel Haushaltsgeräte Waffen Klamotten.

Natürlich muss man erstmal von allem etwas finden und zur Farm bringen.. dann kann man mehr draus machen.

Damit nicht genug.. gibts jede Menge Gegner und wilde Tiere.. die einen fleissig angreifen. Und natürlich Quests bzw. ein Level System über das man neue Crafting Rezepte freischalten kann.

Kleiner Tipp: Möglichst am eigenen Spawn bauen und [u]nicht[/u] sämtliche Büsche bis zu den Gegner abholzen. Möglichst nur einen Korridor frei machen.. dann hat man wenig Probleme mit Angriffen.

Es ist grafisch nichts besonderes.. aber es sieht sehr anständig aus. Die Welt ist lebendig und bunt. Ein bischen hübsch halt auch ( viel Natur ^^ ).

Hier noch ein paar Besonderheiten:

Spawns: Beim Start wird die Welt generiert.. inklusive festen Spawns für den eigenen Charakter, Tiere, Gegner, Wildtiere, Lootplätze ( Wiesen, Pilzstellen usw. ). Das bleibt dann auch so. Alles spawnt bei Reload neu, dann kann man also ordentlich farmen gehen oder neue Tiere beschaffen. Das führt allerdings auch dazu, dass wenn man eine Gegnerhorde killt und dort in der Nähe dann baut.. wird die Base grundsätzlich nach Reload angegriffen! Also lieber abseits der Spawns bauen.

Ableben: Stirbt man, spawnt man mitsamt dem Inventar wieder am ursprünglichen Spawn. Der Wiedereintritt kostet allerdings.. und zwar zufällige Items aus dem Inventar! Dabei entscheidet der Zufall, welche Items ( das können wenige oder viele sein ).. und auch wie viel von den jeweiligen Items.

Kamera & Steuerung: Ich lese hier immer das Gejammere bzgl. Kamera und Steuerung. Die Kamera ist starr. Man sieht nicht unmittelbar was hinter einem ist.

И этот ММ, честно говоря, немного печалит. Самая большая проблема - в производственных штуках нет очередей. Ну. для грядок с растениями это еще какой то логике поддается, но то, что на столе невозможно выстроить хотя бы небольшую очередь - вымораживает. Хочешь сделать осколочков для последующего изготовления стрел - нет, дорогой. подожди, пока на столе не изготовится 10 единиц праха, который тебе зачем то понадобился. Хочешь несколько яиц сразу -не выйдет, или заводи много много кур, или жди. В результате изготовление, например, простой буханочки выглядит как постоянная беготня между коровой (молоко), курицей (яйца), ожиданием, когда там изготовится мука, изыманием воды и собиранием пшеницы (так как куриц и коров надо кормить - той самой водой и семенами пшеницы). 
Еще одна проблема - управление. Оно, с одной стороны, и логичное, но не додуманное. Нельзя, например, вытащить план постройки в отдельное окно. В результате, чтобы посмотреть, чего нам не хватает для счастья в этой жизни - или записывай на бумажке, или лезь по всем вкладкам - то есть - В (постройки), в открытом окне - Сооружения - в следующем - открывай (а не просто наводись) нужное строение. Посмотрел - молодец.
Еще одна претензия (но это уже вкусовщина) - отсутствие золотой руды. Золото - а оно нужно для слитков, которые нужны для поднятия левела - выпадает ТОЛЬКО из вражин. И выпадает, надо сказать, нечасто - обычно сыпятся медяки. В результате, для добычи 75 золота (т.е. последующей выплавки 5 слитков) приходится устраивать локальныый геноцид этих милых, в общем то, существ. С учетом того, что они, худо-бедно, сопротивляются, падает здоровье, его надо постоянно поправлять, а еще в самый неподходящий момент может заглянуть на шумок медведик. С понятным результатом. Итого - сбор такого количества монет превращается в пытку.

Резюме - в принципе мило, но на любителя. С учетом невеликой цены - можно пару деньков побегать.

 물론 콘텐츠가 복잡해 보이나. 간단하고 쉽기때문에 후에는 단순 반복인 경우가 있다. 그럼에도 추천하고 싶다.
꾸준힌 업뎃이 매주마다 기대되기 때문이다. 한글화 안되어있으나 쉬운영어다. 초등학생 수준. 몰라도 눈치껏 해라 쉽다.

Как по мне в ней есть всё что нужно:
- выживание;
- крафтинг, которого не много и не мало;
- экшен, когда ты идёшь за очередным фрагментом Force of Nature;
- открытый мир, который хоть и ограничен определённой локацией, где ты можешь выжить без специальной брони, но и того хватает. А дальше с бронёй тебя ждёт ещё большая локация со своим миром.
Много различных врагов и на каждй локации они свои. Когда увидела голема, то радости не было предела. Очень хотелось поближе подойти и рассмотреть его.
По началу кажется, что камера неудобная, но когда ты прокачаешься немного и у тебя будет твой первый меч, то на камеру внимания не обращаешь. Камера раздражает только по началу, когда для тебя самый главный враг мишка, которого просто так не увидишь. Потом эта проблема пропадает.
Фарм. Он есть и он нужен. Игра всё-таки с крафтом. Я спокойно хожу фармить шкурки и для меня проблемы в этом нет никакой. Часа за 2 можно почти 200 шкурок нафармить и при этом подобывать руду с камешков и деревья порубить на поленья. Для меня это не трудно и не нудно. Тем более что кабанов, лисичек и медведей в лесу очень много.
Не хватает наверное того, где можно было бы ненужные инструменты, оружие, броню как-то переработать или просто сложить. А то у меня всё на пляже валяется в кучке.)
И не очень понятно сколько можно приручить животных всего на определённом уровне. Не подписано.
Очень понравилось обновление, где можно гоблина приручить и у тебя появляется союзник, который помогает тебе в бою. Очень помогает при фарме шкурок, так как он наносит тот самый важный удар после чего животное не успевает убежать и  ты его спокойно убиваешь. Про гоблина подписано какого уровня можно приручать и это хорошо.
Очень нравится игра. Сейчас хороших и интересных выживалок очень мало.)
Но здесь наверное можно было бы и кооп сделать. Кооп имеется в виду как отдельная функция в игре, отдельная вкладка. То есть сетевая игра, где максимум могут играть только 4 человека, а не толпа из 100 людей на острове. Тем, кто не может играть долго один будет скучновато и они поиграют пару часов и забросят игру. И если бы я не снимала видео по ней, то и я бы её забросила. Но пока играю и мне интересно что же будет в той или иной локации, где я ещё не была, какие враги меня встретят.)

Немного о минусах... За 30 часов игры я уже к ним приловчилась и не считаю их как таковыми совсем страшными или неудобными, но с начала игры было сложно...
- камера.. о да, в начале она приносила просто катострофические неудобства, но со временем это стало даже удобно)
- карта... она не имеет контролируемого масштаба (не уменьшается не увеличивается, и это до сих пор приносит неудобства...) а то что она пиксельная это даже мило (^_^)
- музыка... не смотря на то, что она прекрасна, проигрывается она 1 раз, и в настройках этого не изменить( хотелось бы чтобы было побольше музыки)
В будующем хотелось бы увидеть добавления вещей, оружия, материалов и многого другого, в том числе и живности, строительства и возможно ещё больше разной флоры)

If you want to get to level 12 then yes - your going to grind.
If you want to explore, then the creation of items compliments that aim.

For instance, at level 6 you gain access to Portals and are strong enough to move outside your localised area to find a place for them.  Levels 1-5 are about getting started and for me Level 6 is about exploration.

At 8 hrs in, I am exploring and level 6.  I am not looking to get to level 12 or complete the game - I am looking to enjoy my experiences.

On a final note: the Devs released a patch yesterday that broke digging.  Within a few hours they had fixed it.  Updates at the moment are every few days and add elements to the game - many are fan suggestions.

If you like lots of crafting, some fighting, loads of base building and farming then you may enjoy this game. That being said, it is very very very grindy- building and crafting takes a variety of materials which you'll spend most of the game collecting. In-game content could use a bit of tweaking (ie wells refilling to a more reasonable amount- I think I spent around a third of the game getting water for crops, cooking, livestock. Very slow and somewhat frustrating as the well only refills to 4 units and even with 6 wells at the end I was still short on water) Oddly there's also no way at present to destroy items so after a while you end up with a pile of old gear, assorted junk and a ton of wheat seeds strewn all over the place.

If you're keen on combat then you may not like this. Your character is very squishy and the wilderness is populated by plenty of monsters who hit a lot harder than you do. Very basic click to whack something with a sword and see if you or it dies first. No skills, nothing fancy, stuff your face with food to recover health and stamina. Combat may be a bit difficult for first time players. Armour doesn't provide much in the way of protection and even wearing the endgame gear I had to duck behind trees and bushes in order to survive pulling more than one mob at a time. Your weapons, while they don't have durability or need repairing, don't do much damage so expect to spent a lot of time poking bears with swords and getting mauled. Part of the game involves killing large numbers of enemies guarding quest-related rocks (which you mine for Force of Nature shards needed to craft said FoN) and you'll spend a lot of time cutting and chopping narrow paths through flora and fauna to survive any kind of combat- most mobs can't slip through small spaces so despite aggro they're unable to reach you. This sounds a bit odd but if you play the game for a bit you'll understand.

Most of your time though will be spent building up your base so you can craft better gear, farm more ingredients and cook a mountain of food that you'll end up going through each time you venture out into the forest. No rushing headlong into battle, you'll need to plan ahead and prepare before getting into a fight. I think I ended up eating around 500 apple pies towards the end.

Hoping that there will be more content updates in the future but for $9 it offers a fair amount of gameplay and so long as you're ok with grinding a whole bunch I'd say it's worth getting.

If you are a player that likes to blast through a game on a marathon run...this game will disappoint you. The crafting requires a ton of foraging, harvesting and trail blazing. 

It is very important to keep your base (spawn point) surrounded with the vegetation barrier...the goblins do not like you and will batter the walls you put in place.The devs put in a GR8 little alarm system to let you know.

The camera angle is an aerial view only and not a very large diameter, but it is enough to get a couple seconds to set for the attacks from the mobs as you try to get the shards.
This is where you can cut trees or break rocks and ores to get a narrow pathway to the mobs and a chance to retreat and hide to regain your health.

At first the game gave me vertigo but once I played a bit that effect went away.
The sound effects are really superb in a headset (or not) you can almost smell the seabreeze.  ;)

The detail on the farm animals ,their vocals and the rooster crows really enhances the immersion for me. But if bees buzzing and roosters crowing annoys you ...you might want to adjust your settings for the game.

I recommend this game to those of you that are looking for an adventure, a smidgen of challenges and questing that requires a desire for tedious gameplay.

I hope the developers will build on this first game they did and maybe put out Force of Nature 2  .

2. Строительство поселения  через крафт не продумано. 
-сундуки вмещают столько же как и бочки. Стоимость бочки такая же как и сундука? 
-здания не имеют уроня апгрейда. Приходится постоянно строить типичные здания.

I usually don't do forum posts or reviews but I feel like I had to. I Love this game and adore it. It reminds me of like the old fashioned diablo but so muc better because there is crafting and terrain cutting there is a large element of thought to this game. I have seen people whine about how horrid some parts are I think it is quite well balanced. each biome is different from another with temp differences. Sometimes you need more gear in one than another you can't just wear one suit and run the game. Even with ultimate gear two of the areas require you to modify your gear to survive in them. It is brilliant to mechanic that instead of just having one setup each area you need to plan out your advancement. Some areas need antidotes or teas and some need a lot more on the stamina because there is a lot of cutting involved some need a lot of health because you have to sacrifice armor for heat cold management. It is brilliant this game gets 5 out of 5 stars for its type. It isnt an MMO it isnt an RPG it isnt a sandbox it is elements of all of them and I would love to see more games like this in the future. Great job developer on a game well done. Stability seems to be quite good as well. The only downside I see is some players like to be spoonfed and when they get the best gear they like to be brainless and be set his game requires thought effort and planning.  The areas are gorgeous I LOVE the last area with the purple flowers and the trees and the bubbles. I love the fact that you have to make your own stuff instead of just going to a shopkeeper. Some places were enraging and you die a lot but thats ok i think some areas should be vicious for me it was the dreaded snow area. Pretty yes died alot also yes.

The ambience is perfect with the exception of emphasized stomping sounds for rabbits (Not a Negative).

The eating system is rather lucrative as I still yet to understand how to eat, which appears to be essential for moving through the game as it restores stamina and potentially health. I wish that the battle system wasn't required or it was at least able to be switched off. The game is gorgeous for requiring such low stats for your PC even the most fragile of PCs should be able to run this perfectly and be a real pleaser without any battle needs. The water is a gorgeous trickling attraction as it dawns gorgeous growth within what appears to be the fresh water habitat. Some other minor inconviences you will notice, such as when in battle if you are under a tree you can not see where you are, if the trees aren't behind your character. Maybe the developer will later implement a combat specific removal of the upper tree much like when they go behind the player to aid in the battle. This game quickly became my favorite thus far for a the reasons it doesn't require a beefy computer and still is beautiful, the low amount of keys used to manage the character which allows you to learn buttons easily even if you missed the tip for how to make it happen, I absolutely ADORE the collect all near key that is even conviently located near WASD (L.Ctrl). Overall, if I were to mention rather to purchase or pass. This would be a sure fire purchase as long as you are into sandbox games. Note to the developer (How do I Eat?) ***Note: The term ""Sandbox"" doesn't refer to a Minecraft Creative but rather the world is your oyster, at this time I haven't seen a creative or actual sandbox mode***

Когда покупал эту игру, не особенно надеялся, что она окажется качественной и сможет зацепить. Но теперь с уверенностью могу сказать, что Force of Nature, тот редкий случай, когда за не большую цену, нам предлагают очень даже приятный продукт, который способен цепануть и продержать в своих ""лапках"" долгое время. 
Так как я занимаюсь Ютубом, то увы не могу сесть за игру на 10-20 часов и безвылазно в ней сидеть, - нужно заниматься и другими видео. Но по данной игре, я с удовольствием запишу сезон выживания, - именно с удовольствием.

Из плюсов:
+ Сочная, красивая картинка
+ Хорошая оптимизация
+ Грамотная и интересная система прокачки, которая каким-то образом, - сильно затягивает.
+ Огромное количество крафта и интересные производственные цепочки.
+ Не плохая система приручения животных
+ Огромное количество растений, которые можно выращивать, собирать и использовать в различных крафтах

Из минусов:
На данный момент могу назвать только статичное положение камеры, которое постоянно подталкивает к тому, чтобы его поменять... но нельзя. Однако для слабых компов, этот минус является плюсом, потому что нет дальней прорисовки, а значит нет дополнительной нагрузки на проц и видяху.

В общем всем, кому нравятся выживалки и песочницы, - рекомендую.

Easy slow start, good instructions within quests and crafting.  

I wish there was the choice of male vs female character, but as it is, you're male, like it or not.  Perhaps in some future update they will add the option to be female.  Being a ""girl gamer"", it would be a welcome addition.  

I honestly can't think of any real ""cons"" for this review.  The UI was a little clumbsy to get used to but after a time I got used to it.  The graphics are good (not fantastic, but good enough).

Yes, it beats Terraria in play and price (in my opinion). I thought the price was awesome for the content, I've only had an issue with it crash one time, and never after that (playing a lot for around a week now and boy am I PICKY AF about bugs!)

Once you've mastered the control mechanisms and the quick bar, this game is easy to play and fluid. If you need more monsters in a certain area, all you do is save/ quit and reopen the game then use the portals to get right back. 

It could use a little improvement, as all things can. Here is a list of things I would like to see improved:

~I would like to see the farming plot numbers pushed upwards per level, as farming can be a bit tedious. Maybe an option to exchange the small plots up to the bigger plot sizes?

~Make a tree farming plot available to regenerate tree supplies at home, especially the fruit bearing trees and sugar cane/ bamboo.

~Please add hotkeys for the harvest all button like the Ctrl key is used to collect. Perhaps the Alt key for harvest all? I know the button is in the inventory but getting that up then hitting that button that slows things down.

~A little more variety in decor, such as, please make a hanging lantern available to hang on the buildings. I don't mind if ""Hovel"" and up is required to hang them, as that makes sense that straw like huts wouldn't hold them well.

~I would also like the cooking station numbers to be increased per character level a bit. Cooking tends to be somewhat slow.

~I love the apple and meat pies, please make coconut and banana pies available, or find a use for them. Also, I would like to see orange trees and lemon trees, and to make juices for stamina options (OJ and lemonade that would also need the sugar/ honey use).

~Need more uses for sticks and stones, or an option to destroy materials. The game isn't buggy but I'm sure leaving the extra junk lying around has a potential to create issues, including lag, even though I haven't seen it yet.

~More uses of gems, such as embrodered into armors and engraved into weapons? (Tailor Bench and Anvil?)

The developers are not active in the Steam forums and that leaves a lot of guessing on where/when/what is planned for this game. As far as I know the game is out of Early Access and no major changes are expected.  Hope this review helps a you make an informed decision on the purchase.

There’s a TON of stuff to craft, a massive island to explore, animals to tame and add to your farm/village, and plenty of enemies to conquer.

Alors ce Force of nature ! 

Donc le genre vous vous en doutez s'est du suvival/craft/action.

Coté survival s'est assez light la nourriture ne sert qu'à se healer ou a récupérer de la stamina (pas de jauge faim, soif ect)
Même chose pour le dodo, il ne sert qu'à se healer (même pas pour passer le temps durant une longue suite de craft) sachant que votre premier lit ne sera craftable qu'au niveau 6.

Côté craft y a juste se qu'il faut, la liste de tous les crafts figure dans un onglet dre l'inventaire

Côté action/gameplay s'est basique, on frappe du clic gauche et droit, clic droit est plus puissant, sinon vous donnez un coup de pied. On ne saute pas, on ne sprint pas. on court lorsqu'on est en forme et on marche lorsque la barre d'endu est en dessous de 20% (à vue de nez).
La difficulté des combats IA pour se que j'en ai vu est assez simple run hit et parfois re-run quand l'ennemi panique et fuit, domage que pour l'instant il n'alerte pas ses potes...
Quand on meurt on rez au point de demarage ou plutard en créant des portails, on pert pas mal de butin aléatoirement.

Graphiquement s'est joli sans plus (je ne suis vraiment pas exigeant, préférant le contenu au contenant)
L'ambiance sonore est basique aussi, chant d'oiseau, mouche qui passe, tout le monde reconnaitra cette bibliothèque sonore. Musique je sais pas je l'ai coupée.

Bon en résumé je trouve que ce jeu est agréable, un bon rapport qualité prix, facile et accessible pour les petits joueurs comme moi, connaissance de l'anglais inutile.
Les PGM hardcore survivors seront surement déçu devant la facilité.

It's very clearly designed and made for those that love grinding to progress. 

The difference to me is that the grind matters. Every item has value, and a use. You have to prepare for your explorations, and while you're exploring you will find things to make a better base.

The con being the same that many have. The restrictions are to restricting. You start out far too slow in all aspects. Fighting, harvesting, moving, etc. It also seems pointless to have a build restriction. The player is already restricted from crafting the best supplies and buildings due to the cost of building them. There's no reason to bar a player from accessing them as well. On top of which, when you level up, it requires resources. Often time it's vital resources that may be hard to come by. Once you level up, they get deleted, just gone from existence. Why? Where did they go? Why did I need to sacrafice vital resources when completing 5 quests would suffice to level up?

The scaling of conflict is about right, however even 13 hours in, I have never experienced monsters sieging my base as shown in the video. The only way this seems to happen is if you build your base on top of a heavily infested area, as monsters always respawn on sleep / log in.

The camera angle is often times infuriating. If the player had some control over it, or it were angled lower to see further that would be much better. Or simply just do it top down as the standard isometric style.",1483863908,1483863908,True,60,0,0.830550849437713623,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The game progresses as a never ending tutorial, you can't do anything other than going through a handheld list of do this to unlock that, then do that. The entire game is monotunus and clunky.

The quests seem simple enough too, some building, crafting,  and killing, all in all a nice walk through tutorial style.

Don't get me wrong my first play thru I got over whelemed by goblins and boars.  So I die a few times at first.   Game reminds me kind of a Sims 3 Survival game (lol).  As in most games of this nature you find yourself waking up un sure where you are.   You get a tutorial quest line that levels you up while you learn gathering resource and crafting the differant Items and building  things you will need to progress.  I like the way it drives this home.

Some things I would ask for in the future though.  

1.  A more detailed map.   Maybe a map ledger or perhaps a way to mark things on it.
2.  More options on the building cues maybe more auto craft like for exsample the water you get from the well you make around level 5 I think.
3.  Less running npcs.  Fox, rabits, and goblins I'm looking at you.

Things that might turn you off with this one are:

1.  Stamina regen in the early levels.  It does get better as you level up thankfully
2.  The grinding of raw materials you need to craft things.
3.  Mobs that run, and how if you give chase you can get over ran, and killed rather fast.
4.  The slow swinging of your weapons in the early levels.
5.  the controls/interface might turn folks of at first till they get the hang of it.
6.  The postion of your character on the screen.
7.  The small area in which you can grab stuff in.

Having said that I would like to say its a fun relaxing game for the most part.  It has a lot of what I have always wanted.  Sure it has things that will make you go WTF at first but the more you play, the easier those moments get.  I found that level up was challanging enough to keep me intrested.  Which is always a good thing.

Most of all bare with the folks mkaing this one.  It has regular updates and is still in development.  I am greatful for this one it has a new way of doing stuff.  Sure its a gamble but in the end it works for me.

It offers little of the freedom of a sandbox game, and instead forces you to complete objectives in order to learn how to craft things, which can only be crafted upon reaching certain levels.  Not only that, but you can only craft a limited number of the structures each level.  For example, upon learning to craft anvils, you can only craft one and must level up in order to craft another.

The user interface design is also pretty awful.  If you want to pick up items and drops, you have to open the menu.  Also while the menu is open, you can move around, but you cannot turn, and you cannot mine, dig, chop trees, or fight, and while the menu is closed you cannot inspect the progress of the various crafting stations.  Items also take a substantial time to craft, sometimes a minute or more.  Combat has no depth, it involves little more than just holding down the LMB until the enemy falls down or runs away.

I never got far past building a stick hut and a table, and it took a few hours of playtime just to get to that point.  Around that time I realized that the game just wasn't fun, and I can't really say I ""played"" the game because it never really felt like I was playing.

- скорость шага\бега одна и не меняется (бега нет вообще, если закончилась выносливость - персонаж изображает ковыляющего инвалида паралитика)

- крафт... не быстрый. в туторе, банально сделать угольки - прийдется тупо ждать. да, ставьте несколько костров...

советы по игре:
- не рубите ничего предварительно не попинав ногами... с тех же подсолнухов можно  получить 8 семечек , а не 3 если сразу срубить их
- лисы... мочить этих ""№;%:! можно следующим образом - встать так чтобы убегать она могла от вас только по прямой, бьем дубиной до момента когда эта паскуда делает от вас лапы и стреляем в догонку из лука... 
- первый артефакт (как добыть и не проклясть разработчиков) - ставим портал в лесу так чтобы между мобами и порталом были преграды образующие коридор с единственным проходом  для ОДНОГО моба и агрим в надежде что побегут не все... стоя в проходе валим их. стандартная пачка - 2 гоблина + медвед  и все они 4 лв. и да... выложите все ценное ибо умирать всеравно прийдется

Хотелось бы увидеть следующие улучшения (ну на данный момент, то что бросилось в глаза в первую очередь):

1. Хотелось бы иметь какую то причастность к созданию таких вещей как постройки. Не просто чтобы как бы посадил каменную печь и она растёт себе в процентах, а может молоточком где постучать или что то вроде этого.
2. Чтобы было побольше всяких предметов для создания (ну это будет скорее всего)
3. Хотелось бы чтобы главный герой мог бегать.
4. Чтобы был износ инструментов, оружия и одежды.
5. Чтобы у героя появилась потребность в еде, воде и сне.
6. Изменить звук добывания камня (а то ощущение что персонаж вгоняет кирку в песок), например сделать таким как в факторио.
7. Улучшить боевую систему. Скорее всего это может заключаться в том чтобы сделать персонажа более проворным.
8. Было бы не плохо если бы в настройках появилась возможность настраивать гамму и яркость.
9. Не помешала бы возможность менять масштаб интерфейса. В главном меню, с моей точки зрения, текст можно сделать меньше чтобы ушла лёгкая ватность контуров текста (да и смотреться будет лучше), к курсору это тоже относится - меньше и чётче. Хочется повысить резкость самой картинки.
10. Было бы неплохо чтобы костёр догорал.
11. Ночь и день были чуток подлиней.
12. Ну и пока не знаю есть ли это в игре но было бы здорово добавить какие ни будь пещеры, скалы, катакомбы, руины и т.п.",1483634126,1483741224,True,6,1,0.49832618236541748,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It also requires you to use nature to your adventage.

-Pro-
Interesting game that challenges me to do something else then what I'm used to, see ""a few insight"" for details.

-Con-
Ok to sub-par graphics.

-Neutral-
Controls are quirky at first, but I got used to them.  Progression can be questioned as it's dependent on doing quests (think of it as a very long tutorial). There is no permadeath but you'll loose some inventory permanently when you die (random, see ""a few insight"").

-A few insight-
This is a game you won't go into in the ""collect all, grind early"" philosophy... it won't work for you... notice how the vids show selective looting?.  Now if you go about it grabing what you need when you need it... and you keep a decent ""nature"" shield around your base... you'll do fine. -Edit- : Loot left on the ground does not despawn, so it's a decent alternative to building lots of chests.  Basic loot can go into single item pile with nearly the same effectiveness (hint : leave the partial stack slightly to the side).

-An extra insight-
I've seen some bad review concerning mostly the stamina system. First, this is mostly an early on issue where (a) you don't have a lot of it (it grows with levels, as well as natural regeneration), (b) you don't have access to lots consumable to replenish it (wait untill level 7 for coffee, thank me later) and (c) your tools are not as effectives (you start with stone tier, then copper tier, then bronze, then iron, then steel... each tier take less ""hits"" to gather the same ressources). All in all, it's pretty much what I said when I said you should only loot as you need... part of what challenged me to think differently.

-I got this for free-
A friend of mine was kind enough to gift this to me.  Other then being very grateful for that friend, it has no bearing on my review.

-Why don't you give any negative review?-
I try to be fair in my review and not waste time on bashing a game.  If there is some improvement to be made to the game, I voice it in suggestions.  Otherwise, I just don't play games I don't like (period).

Данный обзор не является плагиатом и написан мной, Гвардом, от первого до последнего слова!

Данная игра зацепит душу любого олдфага начинавшего путь геймера ещё с ZX-spectruma. Данная игра очень сильно напоминает Аллоды: Проклятые земли. Игра отличается от прочих выживалок во-первых весьма придирчивым и довольно объёмным крафтом. Здесь нет очень быстрого старта и развития как во многих нынешних выживалках. Здесь очень долгое и кропотливое развитие. До того момента как вы сможете создать свой первый бронзовый меч пройдёт не один и не пять и даже не десять часов беспрерывной игры. А уж первую майку и первые штаны - и того позже. Забудьте о доступности всего и сразу — тут вам не Майнкрафт.

Начинаем игру мы с того что нас выбрасывает на необитаемом (как мы думаем по началу) острове буквально в одних рваных штанах. Очухавшись и оглядевшись по сторонам мы начинаем делать свои первые шаги благо туториал пунктуально ведет нас под ручки и дотошно обучает нас всему. Все задания объясняются подробно и показывают места своего выполнения на карте.
Начинаем с того что собираем все что плохо лежит, а так же рубим и трясем все что видим. Ресурсы нам еще очень пригодятся для крафта.

Для того что бы открывать более топовые рецепты нужны уровни, а их получать начиная с 4 будет весьма не просто.
Строить здания в любой форме и планировке не выйдет. Начнёте с шалаша, потом однокомнатная хибарка в которую даже три поросёнка бы от волка не спрятались... Ну и т.д
Зато в постройке элементов декора вас не ограничат и выбор довольно широк. Мой вам совет — первым делом постройте небольшой загон для животных — это сэкономит вам десятки часов, кучу нервов.Животные оставленные без присмотра — ВСЕГДА разбредаются по всему острову и искать их потом будет проблемно да и дикие звери не прочь полакомиться вашим скотом.

Кстати о вражинах ... Боевая система абсолютно точно копирует Аллодов Проклятые земли. Как собственно и система его создания. Да и брони, одежды — тоже. Кстати, создавать можно не только полезную и защитную одежду, но и просто практичную и красивую. Для того лучше сразу по возможности привести в загон к себе тройку овец и стричь с них шерсть. Её понадобится ОЧЕНЬ много.

Добыча ископаемых весьма и весьма важный процесс и часть игры. Разные ископаемые находятся и как бы впаяны в разные залежи камней. Разбивая их вы получаете камни, а так же тот тип ресурса который в жиле содержится. Тёмно-Коричневые жилки — железо, светлые — олово, светло-коричневые — медь и т.д Далее переплавка в слитки и т.д
Лечимся мы пищей которую готовим по сложным рецептам из многих составляющих. Можно и просто лопать на первых порах кокосы и бананы, либо нажарить мяса дичи. Для начала вам этого хватит. Часть этой пищи восстанавливает не ХП (или не только ХП) а и энергию, то есть ваши силы.

Ну и пара рекомендаций — если враги кажутся вам сложными, скрафтите оружие получше и мой совет не пользуйте лук со стрелами, особо по началу. Толку от них мало. И не забывайте крафтить и носить с собой минимум 15 ловушек для того что бы приручать живность. Курочка, Корова, петух, овечка — ваш необходимый минимум! И ещё когда будете крафтить порталы — один установите возле дома, а второй как можно дальше, желательно у полянки с первым осколком природы (там ещё куча мобов и медведей спавнится).

Маленькая хитрость для тех кому совсем невмоготу добывать сотни шкур животных для крафта — просто сохранитесь и выйдите из игры и снова тут же войдите — все животные соспавнятся на своих местах в прежнем объёме. Я не рекомендую так ,, читерить"" но если вам уж совсем лень то воля ваша.

Here are some things I'd love to see, however.
- An optional Hunger/Thirst meter (Thirst would be taken care of early-game by Coconuts.)
- More options for the camera angle. The distant view is a bit annoying at times, hard to see ahead of you or behind you. What would be great is a zoomed in 3rd person and 1st person.
- Less grind when it comes to Coal requirements for metal. Bronze is the earliest metal you can work on armor-wise, and total, it costs 25 coal to make 1 bronze ingot (5 for the tin and copper, 15 for the alloy), and the wood -> coal converter carries 50 coal, which also takes forever to make. Now, an iron ingot costs 5 coal, and iron is more mid-game than Bronze. You can make five times as much iron than bronze with 50 coal. The game should be increasingly grindy as you progress, but it jumps up and down. Because Steel requires a grand total of 30 coal per ingot, which, in my opinion, should be lowered along with bronze. And I question the realism of glass needing a higher temperature (more coal) than ore to smelt, but I'm not really informed, so don't quote me on that.
- The amount of pelt used for clothes is also a bit too high, in my opinion.
I really do like this game, though, despite the grind. As it's still early access, there's a lot of content to come, which I'm excited for. More content, naturally, makes the game have more of an objective and options so far as progression goes.

Not because it's a bad game, which is the problem.  There are a lot of things I like about the game, including the scenery and the basic crafting setup.  It's the wonky design choices that make it so frustrating, and they all sort of tie in together for added frustration.

First of all, the camera.  It's a static cam, which is just fine in some situations, like if you're on rails in close quarters, but this is an open world.  You have a very limited range where you can see danger coming, and seeing danger coming is hugely important, because everything that wants to kill you is faster than you are, and if there's a sprint key anywhere to be had, I haven't found it by looking at the control options.  You have one speed that seems to hinge on you being at max stamina, and it's too slow to do you any good.  You also have no armor to start with thanks to the layout of the skill tree.  You're going to learn how to tame a chicken, build a cook stove, and fry an egg before you ever get anything like armor, but you're still going to have to go fight goblins, and angry foxes, and wild boars, and heaven help you a bear if you don't see it in time, because the game requires you to have gold coins before you can level up.  So you're going to go fight all of those things literally in your underwear.  Crafting itself is somewhat deep, but slow, and I know I could speed some of it up by creating, say, an iron knife instead of a stone one to load into some of my crafting stations, only I'm running low on iron already and I'm hoping that eventually I will get to put some of it towards armor.  Instead of, you know, running out in my underwear to look for more iron rocks while failing to run away from things that want to kill me if I don't see them coming.  Add to that the fact that I have to go into a frozen-cam mode just to harvest anything or interact with crafting stations, and I'm left wondering what the purpose was behind all these clunky mechanics.

I do like the game...sort of...but even thinking about starting it up again in the state it's currently in just leaves me feeling tired.  And I play a lot of Early Access games--probably half of my library is EA games--so it's not a lack of patience or willingness to experiment.  It's purely down to frustration at how many of the design choices have combined to turn a good game into an aggravating game.  I'd suggest waiting to see how it looks further down the line unless a big lure for you is ""but it's different!""  It is definitely different.

It closely reminds me of ""Life is Fuedal: Your Own"" except you cant do freely what you want and level what you want up. You are restricted to build things until you level up and based on quest restrictions. And leveling up takes grinding. It took me 10 hours to get to level 7. 

Its still good though.  I already have 10 hours in for $8...seems worth it. I dont see me replaying this solely on the fact that i would have to grind again to get where i am. 

You are free to go around the world, however there are higher level creatures the farther you span, and environment hazards..... that require you to grind to get better equipment. 

POSSIBLE SPOILER:
An example would be you have to grind to upgrade your weapon to get a bronze sword which means you need bronze. But then you need to go out into the world to get the ore, which means you need to make bread to keep you alive. To make bread you need to farm wheat, make flour, produce eggs, etc. Then to keep your stamina high you need coffee, which means you need to farm coffee seeds, make coffee. But you cant do this at the same time as growing wheat, because you can have only so many crops. And thats just not to get the bronze sword, you need to do it every time you go out...when you need iron, when you need copper, when you need gold, etc. And you do need them because you need to make things based on quests, not your own interests. Also to level up you need ingots just laying around just to level up. And you do this all in your boxers/shorts, as you have yet to be able to make any clothing due to quest restriction. The only armor you have it your level armor.

Similar games are enjoyable because if your tools are weak or you need better weapons, armor, you can set that as a goal to reach and achieve - here, you can't improve your situation until you jump through all the hoops the game puts in front of you.

The controls are bad and awkward, and so is the camera.  You can't see things in front of you very well, and you can't really do anything with a window open.

You usually click through simple menues that tell you what to do or how to do it. There are tips about how to get some items as you soon will loose overview of all the recipes and ingredients.

So basically all you do is start crafting crude tools, collect some food as you loose stamina quickly for all you do.

Crafting get's more tedious as soon as you have an anvil and can work with iron. A handful of nails becomes quite a task and many new items or buildings will need lots of them. Iron ore becomes sparse and you have to travel far into enemy terrain to obtain some. Yet it is fun to find out how to create new things, like bake a bread or even make coffee.

I think this goes on and on like this, but I haven't played very much yet. I see that I will be able to craft iron sword and armor later, so I guess there will be more than only gobbos in my way.

Until you can build a wood cabin and fences as seen in the screenshots you will have to play quite some hours.

The only downside so far is that the game crashes after playing it for 1-2 hours. I use Windows 10 and have no idea what causes this.

There is a bit of a grind in order to get to certain points in the game, which is good in my opinion.
And like plenty of others have already pointed out, don't be scared of the camera angle, you'll get used to it before you know! 

I highly recommend people to try this game, as its a very relaxing game.

The only ""issue"" I have is the water grind.. Makes you babysit a bit too much as wells stops making more water after 4, untill you take those out.

The game is very limiting, in the fact that you can only craft certain objects at each level and you can only lvl by completing the set quests and crafting what is listed. So this game is wrongly classed as a sandbox game as there are limitations to what you can do. Such as you can't craft any clothes until lvl 7 or iron axes until lvl 8.

At lvl 6 I was only allowed 1 cooking table, so I could not make bread, coffee and cheese at the same time. And crafting is not queued, so you can only craft 1 thing at a time so it takes ages, especially since I did not want to leave my base without having  a decent amount of food.
And the food you find is not good enough as it hardly restores any health or stamina.

Iam currently, not allowed to make a better weapon than a cudgel or a crude bow, both are rather weak and hate that you can only attack 1 enemy at a time so if you get more than 1 goblin and a bear joining in the fight, you end up dead as I can't craft armour at lvl 6.

I hate how very restrictive the game is, so it makes this game less fun for me.
Everything takes forever to craft. It becomes very tedious and grindy, needing  15 amethyst chips just to progress, it gets boring by the time you get to lvl 7 as you need way too many items and
you have to spend ages making food and drink just to survive going anywhere.

When trying to hunt animals for pelts, boars and foxes will run away when their health gets low and they are way too fast espcially when you have -3 movement speed from wearing bronze armour. Only bears stay and fight, makes it annoying when you need 50+ pelts for crafting fur armour.

Other bad things is combat is terrible and so is the camera angle, it's a weird angle so you can't see into the distance.
Also for some strange reason animals need 2 traps before they can be tamed, the first trap thrown always fails.
I gave this game a chance, playing it even when feeling bored.


I got up to lvl 8, had to get my third force of nature in the cold area, the area surrounded thick in mobs each lvl 10, tried to pull 1, 5 mobs came after me, died, came back and am faced with the same problem this game is just frustrating and annoying, I can't recommend it anymore.

This game has a good concept, but is let down by poor execution, there is a lot that needs to be improved. It feels unbalanced and not as polished as it could be. I may change this game to recommend if the gameplay is updated and improved. Things such as when digging soil, you get 1 piece of soil at a time, which is slow when you need like 30 soil for a seedbed. Or having 30 animals and having to feed each of them 1 at a time. Which is crazy considering a real productive farm would have large feed troughs so that all animals can be fed quickly.

Free motion camera is needed!  Also - the fact that you have to have your inventory window open to pick up items in the world is simply stupid.  Also - your character movement changes when you have said inventory window open so instead of moving left to right, you change to side stepping.  So forget about just leaving the window open all the time.  See a stick?  Walk up to it.  Open inventory window, click the new ""Stick"" box that appears.  Close inventory window, continue rest of your day.  Also, crafting...  When you are done crafting you have to click ""Get Object"" or whatever it was to put the item in your inventory.

Combat sucks. Combat sucks, yeah I typed it twice it is that bad.
The game is quest driven, to level up you need to complete set quests, which entails lots of farming for pelts, and other mats.
There is very little to build in the game, and it all has level requirements, see above.
Designed this way because there is very little to do in the game. You will end up growing food to go and fight some mobs, rinse and repeat. Get enough mats to finish that levels quests, level up, and start all over again doing the same thing every level.
You cannot design and construct your own buildings which would be a great improvement, hopefully the game will get better with new patches.

Dear prospective buyer, 
Force of nature is worth your time ( quite literally ) if you have a lot of time on your hands to play a slow-paced crafting game. In my opinion the game is more suited for children than adults as all the graphics are simple a processes are slow.

- Gameplay-
The game offers pre-made buildings which can be placed and requires you to harvest and obtain resources, just like any other crafting game. This is however slower than in most games and you need to harvest a lot of materials before you are able to craft anything big. In addition, there is a limit to how many building or items you can place. So, placing 15 smelters to create industrial scale production of iron is right out. 

- Combat - 
The combat is what you would expect of the first diablo. In addition there is no real threat in the game apart from goblins and wolves. both do not threaten your base and you have to actively seek them out to get into a fight. Which makes this game quite peaceful. 

- leveling system - 
You need to obtain resources before you can level. that means that whether you've killed 20.000 goblins or only 1, you might still be level 1. This can be seen as a challenge or a millstone aroun ones neck. 

----------------------------- After 10 hours of gameplay --------------------------------------------------------- :s

- opinion - 
Personally , I am enjoying this game as a casual game. It's very peaceful and will run on machines with low specs. Like my broken down laptop of a bazillion years old. Exellent game for casual use, but not very immersive. If you want hardcore combat and crafting, don't buy this game. If you want a peaceful / slow crafting game, buy this game. 

------------------- After more than 20 hours of playing ---------------------------------------------- :(

This game is horrific. Let me list some major cons: 

1 * You need insane amounts of materials before constructing stuff.
 ( example: you need to kill 25 bears before you are able to make a pair of gloves ) 
 ( You need gloves, boots, jacket, hat and pants to enter a cold area, this requires you to kill 125      bears )

2 * You need stuff instead of XP to level up. 

3 * The game is extremely linear, you need to create all items of that level before you can continue.

4. UBER-grind , really to the point you are actually starting to ask yourself existential questions.

5. Terrain messed- up -> you use your stamina to chop a way through a marsh only to find out that you cannot walk up a mediocre hill. 

6. No stamina - no fighting. Oh shit ! you are out of coffee, now you will just stand there as the bear claws you to death and you gain the "" bad player "" achievement. 

7. Crappy translations - This is an English teacher thing, but "" Furs pants "" and double letters do begin to annoy. 

8. You can't do things in bulk. You may only have so many productive buildings per level. 

9. No skills. You aren't getting better. You just get better stuff. ( by grinding )

10. Random item loss at death. You die ? Too bad, you lose you 2 hours worth of ropes !


!!!! TL;DR !!!!!!
SLow paced crafting game, ok but not aggresive, requires a lot of time. Interface sucks, lots of bugs, total grind.

Yes, the game is 'grindy', it's kind of point of these sorts of games, to do the dull tasks to get the good stuff, but the game works in such a way as you can set the pace, how quickly you work your way up through the levels, or whether you simply choose to stockpile a load of basic level stuff first is up to you.

Visually, the game is appealing enough, not a massive fan of the non-tiltable camera, since I actually find myself craning my neck to look under the top of the monitor, but you DO get used to it. Audio is fine, though I seemed to get hit by 'surprise music' when I ventured into the desert earlier, which seemed kind of odd after hours of ambience. 

Gameplay is well-paced, you can control your own speed of advancement, and removing resources locally as you grow means your base is more exposed to the nearby creatures, so there's still work to do there, and the portal system means you don't have to constantly walk back and forth across the map.

There are some things I'd like to see, though some in-game stuff may simply not be unlocked yet, I'd like a bit more control over world generation, and maybe a way to automate some processes (though, as I say, the tech may simply not be unlocked yet).

I suppose if I were to describe the 'feel' of the game, I'd say it's a production/hunting/farming game (not really survival) that plays a tiny bit like Diablo or Titan Quest, at least I get that vibe from it. It's not a game for action freaks, but if you want a moderately relaxing game that you can invest a bit of time in and explore at your own pace, you could certainly do worse.",1482695671,1482695671,True,6,0,0.557855784893035889,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I would compare it to Life is Feudal, Stranded Deep, Don't Starve and Timber & Stone (though you play one guy rather than a colony). All good games, and FoN takes a bit from each.

The camera angle; it feels claustrophobic for the first while, I found myself wantting to lower it to see further. I got used to it though and it doesn't occur to me anymore while playing, you can turn the screen to see further, and if you use the map often, you can avoid mobs or at least pull them one at a time if your careful. Mobs show as a red dot on the map.

I found once I took the time to remap my keys to more comfortable places on my G13 I enjoyed the game much more. Some controls are a bit awkward for a bit.

The graphics are really nice (I play at 4k), I love the ""Castaway"" idea and setting, and this game gets it right. Nice ambient birds, waves, and wildlife sounds make it relaxing to plod away. I put on some tunes and just enjoy slowly getting my primitive camp better and better set up with animals, farms, and the ton of crafting and busy work to keep it all going.

Combat is kind of slow and mostly about not getting overwhelmed and having food buffs to stay up, the mobs around the early area are quickly little threat. You can build weapons, armor, clothes etc eventually.

Cons include level-gating the advanced crafting. So no bow until lvl 4 for example. However, you level by completing crafting quests, not mob grinding. So you have no choice but to lvl by grinding out whatever crafts are needed, and it quickly gets to be a long slog. I want to craft much more, much earlier personally.

Camera will turn off some people, but i think it's just a matter of getting used to it.

aus anderen Spielen schon kennt. Gut daran ist, das diese Mechaniken
sehr gut funktionieren.

Hier ein kleines Video meinerseits, weiter unten steht der Text.
https://youtu.be/dg4c0DRPYqY


Man startet auf einer fremden Insel und hat Nichts. Absolut Nichts.
Wie üblich bei solchen Spielen fängt man damit an Ressourcen zu
sammeln und die ersten nützlichen Gegenstände herzustellen.

Dabei nimmt das Spiel einen gut an die Hand, sehr gut sogar.
Es wird über Quests dem Spieler alles erklärt was man zum Überleben braucht.
Wobei man nicht auf Nahrung oder Wasser achten muss.
Es gibt lediglich einen Lebens- und Ausdauerbalken. Was ich gut finde.

Durch das erfüllen der Quests kann man auch Stufen aufsteigen.
Der Charakter wird dadurch besser und erhält mehr Lebensenergie,
Ausdauer, Regeneration und kommt besser mit den Umweltbedingungen
zurecht.

Das Spiel läuft sehr flüssig, was aber daran liegt, das die Grafik zwar schön und
Atmosphärisch ist, aber nicht auf dem neuesten Stand der Dinge.
Was auch gar nicht sein muss, oder vielleicht sogar kann. Durch
die ganzen Dinge die man in diesem Spiel machen kann.
(Indie Entwickler)

Detailverliebt ist es aber allemal, wenn man einen Baum abholzt dann fallen
Blätter herunter. Der Regen kann verschiedene Stufen annehmen.
Wenn ein neuer Tag beginnt, dann kann der schon mal neblig anfangen
und später zu Sonnenschein werden. 
Der ganze Tag/Nacht Zyklus ist super gelungen.

Was den ein oder anderen vielleicht stören kann, ist die Kamera.
In diesem Fall, steht der Spieler nicht in der Mitte des Bildschirms,
sondern unten am Rand. Das ist zwar gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber
stört nach ein paar Minuten eigentlich nicht mehr.

Man kann weder rein- noch rauszoomen, das wäre vielleicht etwas,
was man noch irgendwann einbinden kann.

Über das Endgame kann ich noch nicht viel sagen, aber soweit wie
ich es bisher gespielt habe macht es eine Menge Spaß.

Gerade wenn man anfängt zu kämpfen und den ersten Knüppel
auspackt um ein paar Goblins einen Satz heiße Ohren zu verpassen!

Wie oben bereits beschrieben, funktioniert das Gameplay sehr gut
und ist auch sauber ausgearbeitet. Bisher hatte ich keine Bugs oder Glitches.

Wer lust auf ein Sandbox spiel hat, in dem die Survival-Elemente
eine eher untergeordnete Rolle spielen und gern Sachen baut und Dinge
erforscht, der ist bei Force of Nature genau richtig.

トレーラーでは複数畑を作っていますがそれができるのはかなり後半になります。建築物も同様にレベルごとに作成限界個数が決められています。レベルをあげないことには作れる物が限られてきます。
じゃあさっさとレベルをあげたらいいじゃないか。しかしそれが面倒なのです。

レベルをあげるにはクエストをこなしていく必要があります。作業台を作れなり、羊を捕まえて来いなり。最初こそ簡単に進みますが、後半にさしかかり厄介になってきます。

オブジェクトを破壊してアイテムを手に入れて来い、というクエストが中盤あたりからレベルアップの条件となります。オブジェクトの周辺に１０匹ほどのモンスターが配置されています。周囲のモンスターに比べ強力で、囲まれるとやられます。一定距離に入るとこちらを認識し襲ってきますが、そのモンスターの近くにいる敵も一斉に向かってきます。一度やられて拠点に戻ると敵もリスポーンしてるので最初から。

攻撃はもっさりしていてノーダメージで倒すことは不可能でしょう。敵の移動速度、攻撃速度は早いので回避ができません。たまに草むらでひっかけて攻撃もできますが稀です。戦闘で何よりイラつくのが一部の敵はＨＰが減ると逃げてしまうことです。異常な速度で逃げていきます、追いつくどころか見失います。狐や猪など、毛皮を必要とするときに戦いますがストレスマッハです。移動速度アップの装備、アクセサリーもありますが体感できるほど変わりません。

枝や草、皮など素材は数多くあります。しかし持てる数には当然限りがありますので保管しなければなりません。たくさん集めてやるぞ、と意気込んで宝箱を作ったら驚きました。１０スロットしか空きがない。しかも宝箱を設置できるのは建築物の中だけ。ベッドや一部設置物も同様なので置ける数は限られてきます。一応その辺にドロップしておいても消えませんが見栄えは悪く、どこに何があるかもよく分かりません。早急に宝箱のスロットを増やすか、屋外にも設置できるアプデが必要だと思います。

上で挙げたオブジェクト破壊はゾンビアタックが有効かと思われます。デスすると所持品をいくつか失いますが何も持っていなければノーリスクです。付近にポータルをつくりそこをリスポーンポイントに設定。敵は無視しオブジェクトまっしぐらでつるはしで壊します。ダメージは蓄積されてるので何度か繰り返せば破壊は可能です。Escキーで一時停止、Exit→continueで再開すると拠点にワープしてるので荷物が多いとき、すぐに拠点に帰りたいときは重宝します。ゲームとして楽しいかは・・・

悪い点ばかりあげてきましたがなんだかんだで起動して遊んでしまうあたり楽しんでいるのかもしれません。他の方のレビューをみて私も書いてみようと思い立ち、初レビューでした。ポータルは円が重なっていても起動可能ですし、アイテムは左Ctrlキーで一括で拾うことができます。みてくださっているといいのですが。",1482420298,1482420298,False,27,0,0.740379393100738525,0,True,False,False,False,,,

いまのところ何の問題もなく楽しくプレイしています。この値段で遊べるなら大満足(･Д･´☆)ゞです。
牧場物語系が好きなので家畜の動物を捕まえてきて大きなファームや畑を作ることが楽しいです。

動物を捕獲するとき罠をかけますが中央の上に現れる緑のあたりみたいなものは意味ないです。（これは弓で必要）
よっぽど手が届きそうなところまで動物のところに行かないと捕まえられません。
木や岩等で行き止まりになっているところまで追い込むとうまくいきやすいです。
うまく捕まえたら自分の拠点地まで連れて帰ります。勿論途中に熊やゴブリンとかになるべく遭遇しないように気を付けて…。
一匹一匹増えるのかうれしいです。毎日エサやりとかは必要ないみたいで、でもやらないと卵やミルクを出しません。

まわりでちょろちょろしているウサギは捕まえられないようです。
当方これで罠を50ぐらいムダにしました；＾＾

拠点地は安全ですが敷地内の周りの木や茂みを切りすぎていくつも外に出る通路を作るとゴブリンとか入ってきます。
操作がキーボードとマウスのみなので少々てまどいますが何とかやっています。落ちているものをいちいちスペースキーを押さないと拾えないのがやや面倒です。手持ちのアイテムがいっぱいになったら地面に置いておけます。これが消えてなくならないので◎。ただいらないものを捨てるゴミ箱はあった方がいいと思います。あと日本語もおねがいします。

This game has lots of issues:

The camera is infuriating.  
The controls are lacking.
You can't chop/mine/attack/etc while inventory is up.
Abysmal enemy AI.
Tons of resources required for crafting in mid game with no crafting queue.  It's super tedious and can get confusing.
Only has very basic base building and requires massive resources for even a fence.

Even though I'm finding it mildly entertaining, It's hard to recommend this game when there are vastly superior options.  7 Days to Die for example is more money, but absolutely amazing.  I have around 200 hours in it and still go back regularly.  Force of Nature won't see 10 hours in its current form.

Les +:
-crafting  développé
- map qui semble bien grande
-visiblement, il y a un semblant d'histoire et non un simple crafting sans but
- toujours quelque chose à faire
-construction de base sympa
-prix + qu'abordable

Les bofs:
-caméra zarbi mais on s'y habitue
- combat fadasse pour l'instant
-graphisme années 2000 (pour ceux que ca gêne, moi ca allait perso)
- manque un peu de survie à mon gout, malgré que cela soit agréable de ne pas stresser tout le temps pour trouver de la bouffe.

Les -:
- une map pixelisée dégueue et quasi inutile. Trés frustrante quand on cherche une ressource déséspérément. 
-des quêtes affligeantes de dirigisme et d'ennuyosité (pourquoi tout bonnement ne pas bloquer le passage de niveau par des constructions requises directement, au lieu de dire que pour passer au niveau supérieur il faut avoir rempli la quête ""construit un four""). 
-coté RPG inexistant alors que vendu comme tel.


Néanmoins, pour le prix, et vu que c'est à peine le début du jeu, je conseille vivement aux amateurs du genre de l'acheter. C'est rare de trouver un tel crafting dans un jeu solo et pas un MMORPG, sans pour autant que cela tombe dans un ennui mortel. Mérite de s'y intérésser et d'éspérer de bons patchs, et mérite amplement le prix

NOTE: Many people address the issue of the camera view. You must hold the 'space bar' when any menu is up to change your camera view with your mouse. Exit all on screen menus with 'escape key' or repress the same menu key as before.

Jumping straight into the Pros and Cons...

Pros:
* Death penalty - lose random items in personal inventory
Why is this a Pro? Because you do not have to hunt down your old inventory/lose everything

* Multi-tasking - can craft multiple items from DIFFERENT work benches/crafting menus.
You can craft several of one item (if materials permit), run through the forest like Rambo, and be home in time for tea. Yes, the crafting works while you walk away from any station.

* Multitude of crafting - There is many (many) things to craft, and each has a purpose.

* Safe Startup - So far, every time I spawned it was back at the original beach which has been safe from monsters thus far. However there is a con to this, leading right to...

* Character Progression - The character progresses in terms of completing quests and as a reward gains more health/stamina/damage/speed. This is non-selective, and is a fixed leveling system. Each level opens up new crafting recipes to further your survival/exploration.

Cons:
* Mobs respawn on Startup/death - The monsters and other baddies respawn after I leave the game or die, even if I did nuke the island clean. This isn't necessarily bad, because there is more resources available. But if I want to get across the map I need to wipe out everyone again.

* Combat - the combat feels a bit sluggish specifically with melee weapons. Ranged weapons are bit tricky to get used to due to the camera view.

* No Sprint - this isn't a feature in the game that I know of, and would come in handy when being chased by a bear, a boar, and a fox. Leading into ...

* Non-neutral Animals - There are many animals in the game that can be tamed for resources. There is also a number of bad animals for hunting, and if they see you from a good distance away they will chase you and most likely kill you.

* No Mob control combat - Many times there will be 3 or more monsters/animals attacking you and you can only hit one at a time. This usually results in your death, and ranged attacks need to be used before-hand.

* Tedious - This game will consume a lot of time before anything is done. Getting resources cost stamina, and at lower levels at the beginning can take some time.

* Menus - There are several menus for different crafting, which requires a lot of clicking and/or dragging. 

OVERALL: 3.5/5

This game is a pretty good investment so far.  Cheap enough to risk the 8 bucks and I have already got 6 hours out of it.

Force of Nature feels claustrophobic due to the very limited camera angle and control method - maybe this is intentional but I struggled with it.  The devs really need to make this a bit more flexible as I think this will be the thing that disappoints most players.  Maybe it is me, but I found it hard to get to the goblins - I had to chop things down to do this which used up stamina and made me vulnerable when I finally stumbled on to 4 goblins at once.  The spelling and grammar in the game are quite often incorrect but maybe only old farts like me care about that.

My only tiny issue would be the camera angle. The distance one is better than the top down one, but you still can't see very far.

НИКОГДА не верьте тем людям, которые наиграли в любую игру не более 2-5 часов. У них ВСЕГДА складывается НЕПРАВИЛЬНОЕ впечатление о них.
!!!ACHTUNG!!!
Итак, перед нами очень даже неплохая выживалка с красочными и сочными пейзажами, развитой системой крафта, обширным бестиарием и ""ламповой"" атмосферой. Начнем с плюсов:
1. Крафт в игре очень даже обширен, логичен, довольно прост. Для тех, кто в танке, существуют специальные подсказки, как добыть тот или иной ингредиент для вашего предмета. Например: хотите скрафтить компас? Ок, берете руду (Олово, медь), переплавляете ее в слитки, берете песок и переплавляете его в стеклянные блоки, после берете золотые монетки, которые выпадают из гоблинов и переплавляете их в золотые слитки. Все то, что я сейчас перечислил есть в подсказках, поэтому даже тугодум разберется что к чему.
2. Строительство шикарно. Опять же, все довольно просто: есть спец. меню строительства, выбираете нужный предмет и ставите его (Каждый предмет имеет площадь в клетках). Если не знаете, из чего нужно сделать тот или иной предмет - подсказки в помощь. Во-вторых, постройки выглядят довольно красиво, сделаны явно добротно, с душой. Лепота, одним словом!
3. Пейзажи хороши, картинка сочная, на высоких настройках выглядит очень реалистично. Дождь, снег, гром с молниями - все это есть. Плюс к этому разнообразные биомы (Я пока что нашел второй биом по счету: похож чем-то на тропический, туда без сета бедуина не сунешься, температура высокая).
4. Бестиарий достаточно разнообразен. Уже успел насчитать более 10 существ (Враждебных) и это только за 20 часов игры! Гоблины, коварные лисицы, дикие медведи, озверевшие лоси и такие же озверевшие вепри, каменные големы, какие-то гориллы с дубинками, скорпионы и т.д. - это только то, что я вспомнил.
5. Присутствует приручение животных: берете сеть-ловушку, кидаете на животное (Обычно со 2-3 попытки животное оказывается в ловушке), подходите к нему и нажимаете на кнопочку ""Приручить"". Вот и все! Потом фолловите животное и ведите его на базу.
6. Растениеводство есть, пасеки строить можно и т.д.
7. Самое главное: в игре есть своя атмосфера, довольно ""лампово"" получается, особенно с добротно сделанными постройками выходит очень уютно. А этот потрескивающий шум костра... Красотища!
Ну а теперь недостатки и то, что можно (Даже НУЖНО) добавить в игру:
1. Мобы должны отагриваться через какое-то расстояние. Иначе - беда! Пример: зафолловил корову, к ней подкралась лисица и цапнула. Корова умчалась прочь, лисица за ней. Через 5 минут я нахожу корову, которая почти прибежала ко мне. Вместе с ней ко мне прибежали 9 гоблинов, 2 медведя и все та же лисица. Короче, мне пизда пришла, т.к. даже убежав к себе на базу и забыв нахер про эту корову, мобы даже и не думали от меня отставать, уж слишком лакомым кусочком я был.
2. Добавить прочность инструментов, оружия, одежды. Добавить голод, жажду. Попытаться сделать так, чтобы мой рацион был разнообразен (Т.е. нельзя употреблять одну и туже пищу несколько раз подряд. А то тогда какой толк от хлеба, если у меня проблемы с водой, зато ингредиентов для клубничного десерта уйма? Вот я и жру эти десерты до усрачки)
3. Сделать так, чтобы предметы через какое-то время исчезали. Или же добавить что-то вроде переработчика. Просто надобность в некоторых вещах отпадает, занимают место, лежа в сундуках, выкинуть можно, но они не исчезают. Некрасиво выглядит, когда на песке валяют палка-копалка, булава, дубинка и т.д. Как вариант - разбор предметов на компоненты (Как со строительством).
Вроде все, если что-то вспомню еще - обязательно отпишу. Короче говоря, игре есть куда расти, ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНО надеюсь, что разработку не забросят. Пока на данном этапе брать стоит, но с авансом. Дерзайте разрабы, я за вами пристально слежу...",1482119716,1482119716,True,79,2,0.805369973182678223,38,True,True,False,False,,,

It somehow has the near perfect balance between grind and reward.  The quests are required to continue, but at the same time they are things you want to do anyway.  You level up by completing quests and handing in what you've crafted through those quests.  So it's kind of like paying for increasing your tech tree, which I was kinda iffy about it at first but it just works.  
With the new camera introduced in the last patch it is easier on the eyes.  Graphics are simple yet pretty.  Food works to heal you or increase stamina [both regenerate really slowly, but a bit too slow, so having foods that heal and recover stamina is always a good idea, specially out in the wild].  
Farm, craft, battle, build, tame animals.  
Only things missing is co-op [which is being worked on by what I've read in the forums].  

You are stuck playing as the guy in the video so don't get hopes about any character creation or gender options.  It will also be quite a few hours before you start getting armor/clothing, so hope you like generic castaway shorts!  
But those are minor gripes that don't take away from the fun and relaxing gameplay.  
Should also point out:  only languages available at the time of this writing are English and Russian, so if that is an issue you may want to wait.  

tl;dr - At this price this game is a must buy for all crafting-survival fans that don't mind playing solo.",1482025545,1482025545,True,22,0,0.731187224388122559,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You get to do a lot of things that are available in other survival games.  But there is a storyline and goal.  You can stop doing quests and just explore but you won't level up because leveling is based only on completing quests.  This is neither good nor bad. If you use that fact to your advantage you can have alot of control over your experience.

This game is not trying to be like other games. It's trying to provide a quality experience and do everything it does as well as possible.  So it might feel a bit more on the rails, but you're rewarded in a quality experience.

CONS:  The camera control or lack of it.  I keep trying to change the camera angle only to remember it's fixed.

PROS:  
Good crafting system that's not frustrating but not too easy
Interesting and subtly funny things to do, especially related to taming animals.
You don't get awesome gear off mobs you kill.  You craft it or you don't have it.
There's enough resources to start off with so you don't have to go somewhere impossible at first.

I dig it.  I guess I'm a bit more forgiving when it comes to a game's idiosyncrasies, but the camera angle some people don't like doesn't bother me; I just accept it as part of the game.  I've yet to play it with yesterday's patch, so I might amend this later.
There's always something you could be doing to gain resources while waiting on something to be completed craft or buildwise, and you'll need everything you find at one point or another.  If I had to find something negative, I'd have to say the fighting just seems like taking turns whacking one another, rather than your levels and experience helping you with some misses every once in a while (on both sides, if applicable).  The taming process is a bit of a pain, but I remember what a time Rocky had with trying to catch a chicken, so that's most likely just my inexperience with this style game.

Overall, great job, developers!  I'm really enjoying the balance between the Zen of gathering resources, and the sheer panic when trying to catch an animal, or fighting a group of goblins.

Bei dem Preis kannst du jedoch nichts falsch machen ! ;)

Als ich Force of Nature vor ein paar Tagen entdeckte, dachte ich: ""Bei dem Preis kann es noch nicht gut sein!""

Ich muss sagen: Irrtum! EIn ganz großes Lob an die Entwickler. Sie haben ein sehr detailverliebtes Spiel mit vielen Möglichkeiten und sehr viel Farming entwickelt.

Ich will nun versuchen ein bischen mehr aufzuteilen:

Grafik:
Die Grafik gibt selbst auf meinem alten Lenovo B590 einiges her. Die Oberflächenstrukturen wirken natürlich, das Grün der Wiesen und Bäume ist satt und wirklich naturnah im Farbspektrum. Die Texturen der unterschiedlichen Objekte passen und alles wirkt insgesamt sehr geschmeidig - immerhin rennt man halbnackt auf einer Insel?? rum, wo es nun mal seh viel Flora und Fauna gibt, die es grafisch gut darzustellen gilt. Das wurde hervorragend gelöst, das Auge hat viel zu sehen. Ich denke je besser die Grafikkarte im PC, desto besser sieht es dann noch aus. Aber für alle mit etwas älteren Gamer-Inseln: Traut ruch ruhig ran!

Gameplay:
Die Bewegungen wirken sehr flüssig, man merkt das man eine Axt schwingt oder das Messer benutzt.
Es gibt viel zu entdecken, Bäume, Büsche und andere Dinge versperren einen tatsächlich den Weg, hier gilt es sich durchzuarbeiten und gleichzeitig viel Material zu sammeln.

Was entwas merkwürdig daher kommt ist die Draufsicht, man sieht seinen Charakter nur aus der Vogelperspektive. Wirklich störend ist das allerdings bisher nicht.

Die Natur ist hier der Rohstofflieferant, welcher gut genutzt werden muss um alles zu bauen was man sich erträumt und das ist bis jetzt schon einiges: Es reicht von einfachen Steinwaffen über Häuser, Zäune, Öfen bis hin zu Beeten, Rüstung und sogar Bienenstöcken.

Alles funktioniert sehr sinnig, selbst die Rezepte wirken plausibel. Lediglich der Zugang zu den Menüs ist am Anfang etwas verwirrend, man kann nciht mit offenen Menü laufen wie mit geschlossenem sondern rennt quasi nur horizontal oder vertikal durch die Gegend, das müsste gelöst werden das die Bewegungsfreiheit die gleich bleibt wenn man sein Inventar offen hat.

Kämpfe:

Ich habe bisher nur gegen Goblins gekämpft, wo sich die richtige Waffewahl durchaus bemerkbar macht. Je mehr es nämlich werden, deto nutzloser ist der Knüppel. Mal schauen was ncoh kommt...Bossgegner und eine Art Magie schienen laut Video dabei zu sein.

Fazit:
Pro:
- Farming, Farmin, Farming
- Baut eueren eigenen Hof
-Jagen und sammeln
- Gute Grafik
- Zusammenspiel zwischen Natur und Spieler ist genial gelöst
- sinnvolle Rezepte
- Kampf macht irgendwie Laune auf mehr Gegener und bessere Waffen

Contra:

- Kamerasteuerung
- Menü auf und Laufen ist etwas ungünstig gelöst

Between the camera angle and the somewhat weird graphics, I was feeling somewhat nauseous after playing for an hour or so. Though obviously this may vary from person to person. 

Secondly, there is little to no sense of urgency despite it being a survival game. Hunger and thirst currently does not exist, and any food you craft exist solely to heal you or give you back stamina, both of which regenerate (slowly) on their own anyway. 

Thirdly, the gameplay was incredibly, incredibly slow paced, yet the 'slowness' felt artificial and manifest primarily in the form of crafting time on just about anything you make. Though the gathering speed was also frustratingly slow even though it may simply be an illusion created by the painfully slow gathering animation, this is compounded further by the fact that you'll be constantly low/out of stamina even when you're spamming food. Looking back, what I accomplished in an hour in this game I probably could've done in other games within the first fifteen minutes of spawning into a world.

But on the plus side, this game IS relatively cheap, and if the camera angle is ever fixed I would probably flip the 'No' to a 'Yes' based on the price alone.

“Force of Nature” is an interesting game. It’s a quasi-survival, open world, RPG, adventure, crafting, and farming genre laden experience. It isn’t overly complicated and it provides just the right mix of tasks to fun. It’s casually simple in nature and I found it quite relaxing to play. I definitely recommend anyone to give it try!

When you begin, you’ll start out with nothing and have to craft everything you need to get by. This idea isn’t really new or ground breaking in the world of survival type sims. However, how you survive and craft is a little different from the likes of say “Stranded Deep.” You have two bars to manage: a health bar & a stamina bar. Health depletes as you take damage from the “wildlife” and stamina depletes as you perform tasks such as chopping down trees or gathering items. To replenish these all you have to do is eat, and drink. No hunger, or thirst bars to manage. No sleeping, unless you want too. In fact sleeping isn’t even available at the start of the game, as the schematic to craft the bed doesn’t unlock until you gain a few levels. In order to gain levels you’ll have to complete tasks contained in your journal. After completing said tasks and leveling all the way up, you’ve essentially beat the game. However, you’re free to continue playing the game in a type of sandbox mode with all crafting recipes unlocked. 

The controls are simple, the graphics and art are well done and look good. Some of the animations can look a bit strange at times, but they work well within the simplicity of the task actions - such as digging, mining ore, etc. Currently, there is only one locked playing view. The view is in a third person perspective and is elevated directly behind the player – sort of isometric’ish, but not quite. The lack of viewing freedom and the viewing field can get a little frustrating at times, especially while trying to navigate the thick forest areas and during combat. I understand the design choice, being that there is no “fog of war” so having a free camera would probably spoil the excitement that comes with exploring the area, and foraging for materials necessary to craft. However if you get lost, there is an available mini-map to assist with navigation around the lush and dangerous world. 

Over all, I have to say that I am very impressed with the design of the game, as well as the gameplay. I like what the devs have done with it by thinking outside of the box and by incorporating several different gameplay mechanics into it to make it their own. I’m honestly a little shocked the game isn’t more expensive, as I think it could be. It was $7.99 USD for me. However after playing it I would’ve been happy paying more for it – if I had to, of course. It seems the developer is active on the forums and is open to suggestions on ways to better the game. Force of Nature is a promising game and I really hope the devs stay with it by continuing to add and improve upon it. Just a couple items I would like to see is; more enemy variety and a few character customization options. Overall I give Force of Nature a “[b]Must Play[/b]”  - [b]9/10[/b].

Das Spiel kommt sehr detailverliebt daher, ansehnlich in hübscher Grafik verpackt, mit einem angenehmen Spielfluss und simpler Steuerung. Es stört meiner Meinung nach nicht einmal, dass es bislang nur eine russische und englische Sprachausgabe gibt, denn jeder Aspekt, jede Tätigkeit ist genau beschrieben und leicht verständlich, selbst wenn man die Fremdsprache nicht allzu gut beherrscht. In meinen bisherigen fünf Spielstunden konnte ich tatsächlich auch nicht wirklich aufhören zu spielen, weil die Quests und das daraus resultierende Levelsystem einen irgendwie fesseln. Ich bin kein Steam-Trophäen-Jäger, doch jeder kleine Erfolg im Spiel, der mich einLevel weiterbringt macht einfach Spaß. Monster und Tiere sind von knuffig süß bis gruselig hart dabei und das in vielfältiger Form. Neben den klassischem RPG Komponenten kann man enorm viel craften und erkunden, ausprobieren und entdecken. 

Gibt es bei all der Euphorie auch Negatives zu berichten? Die Grafik ist zweifelsohne ein kleiner Hingucker - leider (noch) etwas Arm an Schatteneffekten, was nicht wirklich stört. Bugs (Abstürze, Klippenfehler usw.) hatte ich in den fünf Spielstunden keinen einzigen, Hut ab an der Stelle. Eine Kleinigkeit, die ich aber ehr witzig, als störend empfinde: weglaufende Tiere am Strand laufen gern mal so weit ins offene Meer hinaus, dass man nur noch die Blubberblasen sieht. Aber keine Panik, sie überleben das ;-) Was mich persönlich etwas stutzig macht ist, dass man die Kamera weder kippen noch zoomen kann. Das wäre noch verbesserungswürdig. Allerdings stört das den Spielfluss nur insoweit, dass man ab und zu einen Feind hinter einen Baum nicht rechtzeitig sieht, weil die Perspektive der Kamera nicht immer gleich für das Ausblenden des Laubwerks sorgt. Vorsicht also beim Betreten der Wälder - Gefahren können überall lauern :-)

Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen: ein sehr gelungenes Mix-Genre- Spiel, wo für jeden etwas dabei ist, dass von Anfang an ohne lahmende Wartezeiten beim Craften auskommt - es gibt immer etwas zu tun!

Pros:
- hübsche Grafik, detailverliebt
- ausgewogene Ressourcen, Biome
- sehr einfache Erklärungen der Quests in englischer Textausgabe (auch für weniger Wortgewandte geeignet)
- guter und leichter Einstieg
- praktisch keine Bugs (bereits in Version 1.0)
- Tiere und Monster verhalten sich realistisch
- viele und detailreiche Craftingmöglichkeiten (mit Bild und Worterklärungen und Tips)
- ungehemmter Erkundungsdrang
- hoher Wiederspielfaktor, da prozedural generierte Landschaft

Cons:
- fehlende Kipp- u. Zoomfunktion der Vogelperspektiven-Kamera
- wenige Schatteneffekte

Also the UI  could be better but it works for now ok but I am sure in time they will customise it better,  not too bad really its easy to come to grips with after a few mins or so.
My last suggestion as well is the view point at the moment its top down almost and being able to look into the distance or pull back would be great it is a bit low.

 - I appear to have woken up on a beach, as a... brown-haired white man. How dull.
 - These bushes are weirdly solid... I can't even get close to that spidly leaf? Really?
 - While I'm always looking at the ground IRL, if I'm looking for palm leaves and strawberry plants in a place devoid of other people I will definitely want to look around. But I can't. So I'm on a beach and can't remember which way the sea is...
 - Speaking of camera controls, I'd rather not have to do this funky crab-walk whenever I want to pick something up, and when I'm exploring, I'd really like to see if that cool-looking object is pick-up-able.
 - You're telling me that if I dig my digging stick into grass, I can't get soil? What's this grass growing on, bedrock?
 - Too many inventory windows. IMO, character, inventory, crafting and building could have gone in one tabbed window that stays open while camera controls/picking up objects remains enabled. Too much clicking and not enough playing!

Why I like this game:
 - Quests: few at a time, easy at first, difficulty increasing. Great way to learn the controls and game mechanics.
 - Mining/gathering/crafting/building: easy to understand, fun and realistic (both in terms of materials found/needed and time taken to gather/make).
 - Stamina: could be a little more balanced but overall is realistic. Also got me wanting bananas now...
 - Graphics: the world is pretty and the weather effects are both cool and realistic! 
 - The aesthetic and aims of the game combine to make it feel really relaxed and chill, if you ignore the frustration from the UI/camera controls.

TL;DR: UI and cameral controls are rubbish but the ideas behind the game are good, making it feel like it should be early access. It definitely has the potential to be fun but right now it's just a little irritating.",1481743065,1481743065,False,11,4,0.297261506319046021,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich stöberte im shop und stieß auf diesen Titel, von dem ich bisher noch nichts gehört hatte. Spontan entschloß ich mich zum Kauf, da ich noch ein wenig Guthaben hatte und startete das Spiel.

Die Grafik ist schnuckelig und stimmig, der Sound ist atmosphärisch. Die Steuerung und der Umgang mit den Menus ist selbsterklärend. Das Spiel nimmt einen am Anfang an die Hand und erklärt das crafting-System.

Farmen, Bauen, erkunden und kämpfen...all das durfte ich bereits in der ersten Spielstunde erleben.

Negativ muss ich die Kameraposition erwähnen. Der Winkel der Kamera ist etwas unglücklich, sodass die Sichtweite sehr eingeschränkt ist. Auch die Orientierung fällt wegen der seltsamen Kameraperspektive manchmal etwas schwer. Ich hoffe hier wird noch nachgebessert.

Fazit: Scheint ein wirklich tolles Spiel zu sein und bei dem Preis sollten Freunde des Genres zugreifen.

1) Graphics wise- simple but vauled for money map looks tacky though.
2) Early in the game tried to kill a rabbit but it just runs off way faster than i can attack it. 
A little frustrating but I guess I'll be able to kil it later.
3) The quests helps to get you going in the right direction.
4) Stamina recovers quite slowly though. And theres only one fixed camera view.
5)The background nature soundtrack has calming / hypnotizng effects  not sure if thats good or bad.
6) The crafting menus are simple and easy to learn.
7) Should have a keyboard function to harvest stuff instead of having to click the harvest option in inventory menu.
8) Perhaps should include some skill trees. / skill tree map to show the unlockable stuff like wood work, mining, fishing etc which will allow for more challenge and reward systems like the over all leveling up.
9) Perhaps including a gender selection would be nice? 
10) the collection of crafted items seems to be abit of a time wasting hassle which can be improved on. 
11) Please make seeds for trees #SAVE THE EARTH
12)Throwable spears made from wood would be nice too.

ランダム生成されたオープンワールドでマイライフを楽しむクラフトサンドボックスゲームです
飲食睡眠[strike]体温[/strike]管理等のサバイバル要素やストーリー等はありません
*体温管理システムの存在を確認しました、熱帯寒冷地域探索用の防寒着及び冷感着が存在します
また、体力スタミナ回復及び昼夜の切り替えとして睡眠はとれます（必須ではありません）

開始直後、浜辺にパンツ一丁で倒れた状態からスタートし、同時にクエストという形でチュートリアルが始まります
英語ですが要求は「アイコンｘ数」のように視覚的に判断できるので読めなくても安心です

操作性はWASDで移動、LMBでパンチ、RMBでキック、マウス操作でカメラの回転といったTPS系のゲームに準拠しています
また、インベントリを開くかスペースキーをホールドすることで画面にカーソルが現れ、ドロップアイテムやインベントリの操作ができます

木や草等のオブジェクトは素手の状態で「キック」することで葉や枝、食料などがドロップします←超重要
木や草の種類によってドロップアイテムが変化し、斧やつるはしで伐採採石、棒やスコップで地面から土、砂、粘土などが掘り出せます

クラフトはレシピから選択して行い、素手で作成できるものやクラフト台、焚き火、溶鉱炉、鉄床などアイテム毎に要求が変わり、更にセットする要求ツールも異なります
例えばロープなら素手＋尖った石(専用ツール)、釘なら鉄床＋ハンマー(専用ツール)など
また、専用ツールは上位ツールになるほど製作時間が短縮されます

設置型オブジェクトのクラフトもほぼ同様の方法で作成しますが、アイテムによっては室内にしか置けない物も存在します（チェストやクラフト台などは室内のみ）

道具類に耐久度はありませんが設置型はモンスターの行動範囲内にある場合、破壊される恐れがあります

スキルなどはありませんが、独自のレベリングシステムがあります
経験値を稼ぐといった一般的なシステムではなく、要求クエストの完了及び要求アイテムを消費して好きなタイミングでレベリングします
要求クエストと要求アイテムはレベル毎に事細かに変化し、レベルが上がると作成できるクラフトが順次開放される仕組みになっていて、順序立てて学ぶ事ができます

スタート位置近辺は危険な生物の沸きが一切ない安全地域なので、この辺りで出来る限り準備を整えておくことをお薦めします
専用ツールがクラフトできる頃には木々をなぎ倒して隔離された安全地域からいよいよ旅が始まります

どのモンスターも手強く囲まれると危険です
モンスターはゴブリンやスケルトンの他、狐や猪、熊など動物も襲ってきます
鶏、兎、山羊、羊、豚、牛などの草食動物はおとなしく、捕獲ツールで捕獲し飼育することも可能です
一部の獰猛な動物も戦わせるために手懐けることができるようですが、[strike]まだプレイが浅いので断言できません[/strike]
開発者によれば現在まだ実装されておらず、近いうちに実装予定とのことです
捕獲ツール（網投げ）の成功率は対象との距離によって変動するかもしれません

スタミナ管理が少しキツめに設定されていて、歩く以外の行動全てにスタミナを消費し、飲食管理はないものの食事を取ることでスタミナが秒で回復するシステムともあり
意外にもひっきりなしに食べ物を食べる習慣がつくので、これが良い意味で食事を収集したり畑で栽培したり調理したりといったシステムとうまく絡み合っています

ワールドの広さはどのくらいかは分かりませんが、トレーラーを見る限りバイオームがいくつか存在しているのでかなり広範囲に及ぶのではないかと思われます
また、クラフトで任意の場所にポータルを設置することができるので資源が潤えば探索も捗ります
海を泳ぐといったシステムはないので限りはあるでしょう


序盤を通して一通りプレイした感じこれといったバグはなく、クラフト品やアイテムも豊富で、マイクラに代表される生活ゲームが好みであれば十分楽しめるかと思います
また探索についてですが、進路を阻む木々や草がここかしこに鬱蒼と生茂っているので伐採し自ら道を切り開いたり、高低差も相まって迂回路を作ったりと経路を作る楽しさもあります
とはいえ不満がないわけではありません
特にモンスターとの戦闘においてはバランスが良いとは言えず、複数を相手にするのは危険なため窮屈さを感じるかもしれません

不評レビュー者の多くの不満要素はカメラアングルが見下ろし固定であることと飢え乾きなどの生存要素がないことのようです
*v1.0.03にてカメラアングルが修正され視界範囲が広がりました
------------------------------------------
欠点
完全ソロ用のゲームでマルチプレイ未対応
オートセーブが入る定期時に一瞬カク付きがある
プレイヤーレベルによって一部設置型オブジェクトの配置上限数がある
アクションゲームではないのでヒット＆アウェイがなく単調
プレイヤーの移動やスイングは遅いのですがモンスター側は硬く攻撃も素早いため囲まれると危険で、対峙数を意識せざるを得ないため爽快感がない

*認知しているバグを修正した後、バランス修正にカスタム建築とマルチプレイを実装予定とのことです

メモ
新規ワールドを作成する際はクライアントの再起動が必要
周囲のドロップアイテムはL-CTRLでまとめて入手
羽は色付きのニワトリを捕獲してエサを与えることで入手
開発者曰く持ちきれないアイテムは地面放置でも消去されず安全（セーブ/ロード可）
デスペナルティはインベントリのアイテムのいくつかが永久に失われます
動物の捕獲は捕獲成功後、網が消える前に近づいてテイムをクリック
コンパス作成後ダイアモンドマーカーが追加され現地は危険生物が屯し、かなり鬼門です

Some pro's and con's are listed below:

Pro's:
- The game's intuitive questing system provides enough guideline to get you fully started and initiated into the game. There's no guessing as to what to do!
- The RPG aspect of the game is wonderful. Full of crafting, fighting, surviving, etc. It's truly a sandbox
- Interface is fairly easy to understand
- Leveling system (though, there is no skill allocation)
- Minimal controls! 1 - 8 on your keyboard, 4 buttons to access your crafting, building, inventory and map, and your mouse.
- Graphics are outstandingly wonderful for the minimalization of spec's required to play the game. Truly is wonderful and simple for any computer or toaster :)


Con's:
- Aerial view can be discomforting at times
- No option to scroll in and out of your character
- All mobs aggro to you, and there's no getting away (But are level 1 when you start, so you can kill them, but 1 by 1)
- A bit of a slow start. So if you're looking to jump in and craft some crazy armor, you're gonna have to wait a bit. (THAT's JUST A PERSONAL THING FOR ME!!!)


Overall - The con's do not nearly have enough of a negative effect on the expereince of the game to say this game is just not amazing. There are very few games out there where you can just play alone and feel like you're immersed into the world. It's your village, your way, your own farms, your own way of fighting, your way for gathering, your way of getting by. You're not restricted by any means and it's just so simply complex. It really is worth the money 100%, and it's developers are certainly headed towards a wonderful future for this fresh RPG Sandbox.

There aren't games as freeing as this folks, so if you're really looking for a, dare I say, realistic Minecraft, or Medeival and simple Elder Scrolls combo, this is definitely the game for you. I'm sure the developers will work with the aerial view and the minor kinks of the game to bring out the best.

Я повёлся на эту простоту. Думал, что разиваться в игре будет легко и недолго. Напротив. Чтобы добиться того, чт овы видите на скринах, нужно, наверное, около часа бегать и долбить деревья своим недотопоришком. 
В этой игре НЕТ стимула. Нет того, ради чего тебе ХОЧЕТСЯ играть дальше.
Сама механика игры неплоха, но в том виде, в котором она продаётся СЕЙЧАС её не стоит брать. 
Это tipical indie game. 
Если геймдевы продолжат обновлять игру, добавлять предметы, квесты, нпс, голод и прочую дичь (можно перечислять долго), то выйдет ТАКОЙ СЕБЕ МАЙНКРАФТ.

Ability to rotate cama when inventory is open.

You're locked to bird's eye view of your character, without the ability to zoom in or out. 

There are a few major annoyances too, that I found to be way too annoying to enjoy the game. For example. If you close a crafting menu after you initate crafting, to get to the menu where you claim the crafted item, you have to fiddle with all other menus until it will randomly come into focus again.

Item names are only seen (for items on the ground) when you are in inventory view. While this may be fine, when you're in inventory view, you are locked to a single direction of travel. Whever your char is pointing at the time, is where you can go forward/back and strafe... but not turn. Turning is done when you are out of any menus' only.

The combat  and controls in general are clunky and need to optimized.  A click to move system would make navigation better.  The controls feel like it came from a console. I like the crafting and building but the char development and leveling system is also lackluster.    It doesn't appear as of yet that there are any devs involved in steam forums so thats a big negative for me as the game feels very EA and it would be cool if devs were taking ideas from fans.  

Almost forgot... Your char only has health and stamina.   You do not need to eat, drink, sleep.  The weather doesn't seem to matter...heat,cold,rain,etc. You can afk for hours and your char will be fine.  You can carry huge ginormous amounts of inventory but you can't store it on the ground or in containers.

For the price the game has very good amount of playtime, lots of different enemies, crafting, building, farming, plants, tools, weapons, armor and loot etc.

Replayability with hardcore mode. Futur updates will bring some new features.
If you are okay with sandbox mode and liked games like Don't starve, this game is a good buy :)

Had 1 crash so far, but thx to autosave I lost nothing at all.


The only few things I dislike:

To discover new plans and recipes, you have to level up. 
To level up, u have to finish all quests (get xx and yy loot and craft zz).
The level up then needs additional materials. Who the hell needs 10x sand to level up?........

It feels like an artificial border, why I can't just get them ironswords and armor and have to run around naked with hundreds of iron ores in my pocket : /

Also there is a major ""harvest all"" button bug, where u can harvest unlimitied amounts of recources by simply clicking the button over and over again.

Combat is simple tank&spank because of simple clumsy movement.

Windows/menues are clumsy, you have to close additional windows and take loot manually. You can move with windows open, but not turn around.",1481682516,1481682516,True,3,0,0.466510951519012451,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Sure its got mediocre graphics but they're not the highlight anyway. Progression is in these crafting survival games and this game has it in spades! Each upgrade is an obvious increase to your survivability. The only two ""survival"" stats are health and stamina, neither of which are difficult to manage and death only results in a few items being lost (a permadeath mode can be unlocked it seems). Seeing your base go from a shack and a fire to a spiked fortress filled with animals is incredibly fun and Ill be coming back to this one for a while.

Something that does need to be mentioned is the controls take a bit of getting used to. You are set on a high third person camera right behind your character which is very jarring (even possibly annoying) at first. Holding space allows you to pick stuff up with the mouse or interact with items which feels very ""stop and start"" since you control the turning of your character when not holding space. This would be a pretty big con EXCEPT you can just hit ctrl to grab stuff. At this point I'm completely used to it and find the controls to be fine.

What sets this one apart from the rest is the variety of biomes you will come across as well as the types of beasts out there to hunt or tame.

Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of the survival/crafting genre, then this one is well worth the low price.

Если вы играли в Rust или аналоги, то конечно же захотите ее купить. И ее стоит брать - однозначно! Если вы прирожденный мазохист с явным желанием получить неземное удовольствие. 

     Итак, для начала вас выкидывает на пустынный берег, ну куда же еще... Перед вами бесчисленные джунгли, песочек и куча начального лута (у меня по крайней мере мир сгенерировался с кучей всякой дряни на берегу). Быстро затаривайтесь клубникой, кокосами, пшеницой, лопухами и палками. Будем выживать. 
     А далее начинается симулятор инвалида в условиях дикой природы. Ваш неспешный протеже будет очень медленно собирать ресурсы, неторопливо крафтить. В общем сделать так, чтобы битый час вы потратили на достижение 4-го уровня. Надо жечь угольки в кострах, надо пинать кусты выбивая палки и пальмовые листья. Это была бы неплохая выживалка, если бы вы хотели пить, есть, спать, размножаться... Но единственное, что хочет герой, это неспешно отдыхать собирая всякий хлам и делая бесполезный лут. 
     Тем в ременем в лесах бродят гоблины, и как только вы закрафтите первое боевое дубье вам нужно будет выбивать и с них монеты... Причем довольно прилично и уныло. 
     Энергия кстати довольно быстро кончается, приходится пополнять ее пожирая грибы и клубнику. Я удивляюсь, что от такого количества подножного корма все побережье не засрал... Причем жрет главный герой медленно, не торопясь, он же на отдыхе в турецком отеле по системе ""все включено"" и соответственно еще дольше растягивает прохождение игры. Однако, я обнаружил, что восполняет энергию быстро - это семки. Так что валим подсолнухи и лузгаем семки до усеру, благо его в этой выживалке нет. 
     В общем резюмирую, это симулятор бомжеватого гопника в драных трениках, лихо жрущего семки, пинающего кусты и отжимающего монетки от гоблинов. Из игры я вышел когда сколотил хижину. В ней нельзя было спать. Просто тупой навес не понятно для чего. 
     А еще тут можно приручить овцу. И сделать ее своей ""походной"" женой. Наверное. Потому, что жрать можно семки, а одежда не нужна - гопник закаленный. 
     Постскрыптум: утопиться в море нельзя, так же как и проходить сквозь кусты.

Камера крайне неудобная, часто не дает видимости. Но не это самое главное...

Итак, вас выбрасывает не небольшой пляж, огороженный со всех сторон такими непроходимыми препятствиями как: деревья, камни, кусты, подсолнухи, камыш, кувшинки и стеклянная стена в воде. И дают квест. Выполняешь, дают еще один. На 3-м квесте ты понимаешь, что пальмовых листов, которые требуются - нигде нет. Два раза оббежав вдоль и поперек свой загон, ты переначинаешь. Ура, в этот раз пальмовых листов гораздо больше. Играем-играем. А теперь попробуй создать топор. Опять пальмовые листы, а их нет! В руках только палка-копалка и нож (которым ни кусты, ни камыш, ни тем более пальмы - не срубить, я пробовал и очень долго ковырял пальму ножом). Все, опять неудачный мир, надо переначинать. (Кстати, чтобы переначать, нужно полностью перезапустить игру). Я уж думал, может ночью заспаунятся листы. Нифига, пробегал кругами 3 дня. Никакого спауна ресов.

PS: Оказалось, что листья можно сбивать правой кнопкой мыши (ни для чего больше эта кнопка мыши не применяется) - опять спасибо управлению.
