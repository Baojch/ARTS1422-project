After about 10 minutes of playing this game, I really wanted to request a refund. However, I figured I should at least play 20 minutes more before I do any kind of review. Well, I am glad that I did not request a refund because although this is not a great game by any stretch of the imagination, it actually has some very epic moments.

I'm rating the game a sale price rating of 6/10. So I'm not saying it's a really good game. What I am saying, is that this game is definitely a good deal for $5. You're getting quite a bit of content here. So the negative reviews mention walking around and just hacking away at enemies. 

However, there's more to the game than that. In fact, you can teleport or move in 3rd person full locomotion. I suggest you move in 3rd person full locomotion at all times and forget teleportation. Teleportation is very bad in this game and I imagine it's a reason for a lot of the negative reviews. Take off the option for the boundary guard as well. Yes, this game automatically adds another space guard for your VR space. Why? I have no idea.

Once you get used to the 3rd person full locomotion, you see that moving in this game is actually pretty fast. It's not sluggish at all. You'll be quickly moving from location to location. And soon you'll discover a secret which lets you magically auto teleport to witch area locations. 

The inventory system is also weird. You press Y on your Oculus controller and you'll see everything you have floating in your space. Then you click to read its description and consume or use it. There are lots of items in this game and soon your inventory will be an unwieldly mess. I suggest just eating as much as possible. Try different weapons. I prefer double swords myself. Or double mace weapons.

The main criticism is that you just hack and slash in this game. There's some truth to that, at least superficially. There is actually a stamina system in this game to prevent you from wildly swinging away. Of course, you are OP. You'll be taking down several enemies in no time once you figure out what the game wants you to do. Basically, the trick is to block when you can and yes you can shield bash and then swing at the openings you see. I found that a bottom up and diagonal approach usually worked. But as long as you see an opening, swing away. 

There's also different types of enemies. All sorts of humans with different weapons. Goblins. Spiders. This tall father type dude and his midget son, I believe? They were awesome to cut down. And the map is pretty big. I spent 45 minutes in the game and not anywhere close to finishing the first quest. 

Rate 6/10.

[h1] 感兴趣的朋友可以先看我的评测视频~
http://www.vrjhkj.com/index.php/gamecircle/info/id-492	[/h1]

[b] 这款游戏的移动方式很特别，按住左手的触控板，英雄以第三人称的视角运动，手柄控制移动方向，松扳机后英雄回到第一视角，这样完成一次位移。这样的嵌入我举得比较自然和舒适，超出了我的想象。虽然是第三人称视角移动，但是你可以随时捕捉到第一人称视图。[/b]

但是这种移动方式也因人而异，有一部分就喜欢使用传送或向前的风格运动，毕竟这种方式是与我们平时的游戏体验有很大的差别，需要适应，解决了眩晕，但是没能解决在击打时位移带来的击打延时的现象。吐槽一点就是，开发者可能是担心眩晕的问题，所以，移动的节奏控制的很慢，这会导致一些急性子的用户会觉得移动很漫长，因为这个游戏中的地图很大，你需要不断往前走闯关才能解锁更多的成就。

再说说它的内容，地图选用的是开放性的地图，你可以随意行走没有任何限制，这一点是这款游戏很成功的地方，至少它让你感到是一个开放的世界。但是，战斗有点相似（这里是说它的模式很相似）基本上都是在1v多，但它的物理体验做的还是很成功的，真的感觉像你在战斗，玩久了会感觉很累，游戏的介绍是有32种不同的武器可以选择，每种武器的属性都不一样，需要你不断获得战斗胜利而得到它们。

游戏感觉还是可以的，至少你可以看到RPG类型的游戏未来可能的样子，虽然这款游戏也不是很完美，但是在移动方式和物理体验上是一次很大的尝试和突破。

[h1] 我建议玩这款游戏空间越大越好，因为你可能会有较大的移动范围，因为有时候自己移动比自带的位移游戏感会更好。[/h1]

除去这款游戏的价格偏高外，整体游戏的设计和思路是很不错的，至少能感觉到开发者的用心，但是在这个阶段这个价位还是有些小贵，个人认为，价格砍一半的话更为合理一些。

This game poses as 'open world' sword/melee fighting game but doesn't excel in any of the advertised aspects.

[b]Visuals[/b]

Very unimpressive visuals, art assets often do not fit stylistically together and the world is thoroughly empty. There is just a single road that shoehorns you to a certain path with some houses or ruins to the left and to the right of that road. This game definitely could have done better with a more compact world. The terrain also was not well designed as there are unnatural-looking hills/mountains that have too steep slopes, as if somebody went over the terrain with a brush and just pulled it up randomly without much thought.

The ruins and houses are also most of the time nearly empty except for some crates/vases or chests to smash up. It doesn't seem like a place that is alive which does break the immersion by a lot.

[b]Sound[/b]

The music and the sound itself are fine, one soundtrack actually is very fitting to sell the 'epicness' the game tries to achieve, however, there are several problems present with the sound design.

1. Some music don't fit the setting: especially the 'exploration theme' sounds more fitting to a horror game than a fantasy fighting game

2. Enemy sound design: the enemies 'grunt' way too often, making each battle against several enemies at once very comical.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

In this game your goal is to find a certain amount of 'wheels' that are hidden in the world. On your way to these 'wheels' the only thing you do is fight, fight, fight. Even when you arrive at a seemingly peaceful village, there are only aggressive soldiers that try to kill you on sight.

The game also has a very clunky combat system where you can just swipe at the enemies a few times to kill them, it doesn't matter if you hit them on their shield or on their body, they will still go down. While the tutorial encourages you to parry attacks which will in turn increase your damage output, most of the time this isn't necessary.

The only 'good' thing I can say about the gameplay is the use of the 3rd person locomotion. It is generally well done as it allows movement even during combat that is sufficient to flank around the enemies. 

The world's structure discourages exploration and wants you to only go to apparent landmarks (consisting of the same houses several times again and again).

[b]Early Access[/b]

Usually I'm more lenient about early access games as they aren't fully released yet and often they have a promising foundation. Here, the foundation, unfortunately looks very poor and in tandem of the early access roadmap which is only planned for 2 - 3 months (!), I have my doubts this game will go in a good direction. That timeframe makes it impossible to flesh out the game enough to justifiy its price point.

Additionally, the specifics in the roadmap do not address the biggest flaws this game currently has (e.g. achievements, localization and just putting more enemies into the world won't make the game any better).

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Stay away from this game. Right now it is not worth playing and I have very big doubts it will become a better game in the future due to the short, future development time planend for this game and bad early access road map.",1496484156,1496484156,False,12,0,0.62117534875869751,0,True,False,True,False,,,

这游戏这么贵是有一定道理的，可以说是目前第一个有开放世界感觉的VR游戏，画面不错，场景够大，真的可以自由探索，不是每次开始战斗后就局限在一个范围内或者关卡内，随便逃跑都可以（当然敌人也会跟着），还有昼夜变化，任务就是收集钥匙和武器，不完成都可以，貌似可以一直往前走。

音乐很好很燃，走一小段距离就换了好几首背景音乐了。武器够多，三十二个，各有属性。玩这种格斗游戏最怕的就是胡乱砍就能杀敌，这游戏挥舞武器会消耗体力，体力不够就会模糊视野，胡乱砍只会死得更快，需要有技巧性地砍杀。敌人种类也够多，动作都不同。可以说是比较纯粹的格斗游戏，一路向前不断杀敌，杀久了我估计会有点单调，如果添加更多RPG元素就更好。

冷兵器游戏最难处理的就是物理碰撞，对大部分物体都做碰撞效果就会太“灵敏”，会出现稍微一碰撞就乱“飞”的情况，不处理的话就会穿过去，有利有弊，都挺出戏的。这游戏采用的是大部分物体都有物理碰撞，所以碰到物体的反应很“灵敏”，介意这情况的就没必要买了，比如在战斗中尽量别让武器碰到自己盾牌，不然武器会乱动。

毕竟是抢先体验版，缺点和值得改进的地方也有不少。

第三人称移动，看起来效果还是不错的，但移动的方便程度就不及触控板移动甚至瞬移了，这个我估计会成为这游戏最大的槽点，现在做VR游戏，提供几种移动方式应该成为标配，不要想当然的为玩家考虑晕眩问题而只设计最不晕眩的方式，除非游戏天生只适合某类移动。不过在玩了Tales Of Glory后，发现这种移动方式也有一定道理，能够比较专注于战斗，总之就是习惯就好。

库存系统不够VR化，吃东西补血等只要对着物品按扳机（可能是考虑在战斗中这样能更快速补血），在VR中应该拿起来放到嘴边吃了才更自然。库存多了后，物品显示不够直观，选择不是那么方便。夜晚场景没照明，虽然物品相对来说高亮了一点，但看起来还是不够显眼。

没有教程关卡，虽然操作很简单，但一些技巧还是需要训练一下才会知道，我看官网游戏手册里就有不少技巧提示，玩家如果不知道就会乱来，然后以为游戏战斗系统垃圾。我最初就是发现敌人后就站在原地打，一开始敌人少还很容易打，后面敌人多了后就应付不过来了，后来才知道可以走到有利位置再打，逐一砍杀。

总的来说，没有啥大毛病，优点很突出，但定价这么高，会导致玩家期望很高，我不敢说这个游戏会合大家胃口，但如果对冷兵器游戏有兴趣，不妨一试，毕竟现有的几款类似游戏都各有优缺点，反正不满意能退款。",1496457144,1496457144,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True,False,,,

1 sq. kilometer of basically nothing.  There's no reason to explore any of it.  The environment is incredibly boring.  Everytime you get close to buildings or  any structure your oponents (whoever they are)  just come running out of all the buildings in single file.  They then form a half circle and take turns swiping at you.  Somtimes two of them swing at you together.  The animations are very stiff and after a 30 second encounter you spend the next 5 minutes walking in the most boring medieval landspace created since 1990.  

In fact the only reason this game has 1 square kilometer is to hold the pair of balls the developer(s?) must have for charging 30 dollars for this.

Fighting the tiny spiders was the worst due to how I can't properly reach them most of the time

Another issue I have is the really clunky inventory system, that is effected by your weapons and the light around you! So if you have a shield on your arm, and a ton of weapons and foods, good luck being able to see what you're hovering your hand over, and to make matters worse, if you get a lot of junk in there, it wraps around you, so your other hand might accidentally be pressing on your health potions while you try changing out your off hand weapon, and whoops, there goes all the potions you've been saving up! This is all, of course, assuming you can even see your inventory when the unnecessary day/night cycle hits midnight or whatever, and everything goes pitch black. I could not find the potion I was looking for after a needlessly difficult fight against enemies I couldn't see brought me down a lot of health. This was about when I realized that the 3 potions I had 5 minutes ago had entirely disappeared. At least as far as I know. I couldn't see much. A torch would be nice. 

This game feels way too early to be charging $40 for. That's asking a lot of us.",1496133883,1496133883,False,18,0,0.596533834934234619,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It will make you sweat, its quite a bit of work and during fights you really need to be moving around.

Pros
Decent graphics

Fights are fun and intense

Pretty decent size world

Cool music

The game highlights your VR bounds with red. This is very useful I've found. Helps keep you inside your space. Can be distracting but is really necessary for a game like this.

Enemy models are pretty cool. It feels quite real when 3 huge men are standing in front of you each waiting to take their swing at your face. The monster people things with swords look awesome. They're frightening.

Cons
Locomotion: The view switches to stationary camera 3rd person view when your character is moving. At first I didn't like this. It does suit the game I suppose and gets less jarring the more you use it. I would still prefer an option to use teleport or onward style movement.

Price: 32.99 CAD is quite steep. And thats at 25% off.

Playspace: The bigger the better. I have a smallish 2mx2.5m space and I wish I had a bigger space. It's do able but you need to be paying attention to your boundaries.


Overall, if you like this type of game, the combat is good, theres quite an open world to explore and many fights to be had. I'm 30 min in and have already had about 6 or 7 battles each with 3+ adversaries. I think this game can be great, but currently the price and the lack of locomotion options are the two things holding it back.",1496084940,1496085468,True,9,0,0.540033400058746338,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The actual exploration is mostly for show, with the purpose to put you in some situations where the ambiance and fighting end up feeling pretty epic. 

The game is also a pretty decent workout.

Finished the game.  It's OK.  Decent fighting engine keeps it interesting but otherwise boring pointless quest.  Ending is weak.  But basically think of it as arena combat in different settings.  Weapons all feel pretty similar though.",1496080586,1568355977,True,0,0,0,6,True,False,True,False,,,
