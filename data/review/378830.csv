My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

There are so many things I dislike about this game, but the biggest complaint is that it is unpolished - there's little if anything unique, interesting, or worthy in this game. It feels like the kind of projects I did on RPG Maker when I was a kid, except that I didn't charge for it. 

Story? Bland and uninvolving. Characters? Cookie cutter, unidimensional, and hard to care about. Graphics? Asset flip. Music? Extremely loud and repetitive. Side quests? Skip. Battles? Somewhere between random and grindy. Controls? Hope you like your keyboard, because you're not using your gamepad for that. World? Empty. Progression? Buy all the skills in the first two hours, and then use them ad infinitum afterwards.

I have finished FFIX a bit before playing this game, and it is hard not to compare both - but in FFIX, you're involved in the story and you care about what happens to the characters and to the world. Here, I barely even know why I'm running around and when I know, I don't care. Combat, progression and gear in FFIX were the difference between an area being a breeze and a kick in the nuts. Here, levels barely even matter - either you go to a very hard dungeon, grind every battle as if they were a boss battle, and then get a level up immediately after, or you go to an easy area and defeat all the enemies around (which you can hardly avoid based on their positioning and movement speed) to gain 0.1% of a level.

That said, all of that being said - dungeon design literally made me cry. Backtracking and having to cover every square inch twice or thrice in order to find all the levers, in the meantime fighting all the baddies regardless of whether they are a chore or challenging is NOT my idea of fun.

На этот раз про тупую принцессу с синдромом дефицита любви. Как и большинство игр из вышеупомянутого RPGM, она сделана буквально на коленке и с неба  звёзд не хватает. Более того, она кажется гораздо более казуальной, чем другие подобные игры (по крайней мере если судить по тем, в которые я играл).

Сюжет странный, в плохом смысле. В некотором фентезийном мире в не менее фентезийном королевстве живёт некая фентезийная принцесса Аирин, которая по уши влюблена в принца другого королевства по имени Томми(да, его так и зовут). Вроде как даже взаимно. Но вот беда, принцесса больна отнюдь не фентезийной болезнью - она долбаная алкашка. Во время очередного пьяного трипа, она вместе со своей охраной врывается в замок чужой страны, чтобы найти своего любимого принца, так как она с чего-то решила, что он ей изменяет. Принц, мягко говоря офигевший от такого подарочка, решает спокойно послать свою ""возлюбленную"" на все четыре стороны. После чего принцессу и её поданных ловят и (вроде как) депортируют обратно в свою страну. А там уже поджидали недовольные король и королева, которые решают отправить принцессу на реабилитацию в коттедж в лесу. Недовольная отказом горячо любимого ею принца, она решает заключить сделку с мощным архи-демоном, который очень удачно располагается недалеко от коттеджа. 
И да, это действительно завязка данной игры. 
Сюжет мало того, что странный, так ещё и все персонажи отталкивающие черти. Буквально, ни единого приятного действующего лица. Причём в игре постоянно встречаются похабные и, вот тут я даже удивился, расисткие диалоги. Я бы может воспринял бы это нормально, но к сожалению автор ввиду неопытности совершенно не умеет в писанину, из-за чего местные расовые колкости вызывают в основном только кринж. 
Причём я вроде бы понимаю, чего автор хотел добиться, а именно создать фентезийный мир, который при этом в социальном плане похож на наш. Но вместо этого у просто наклепал толпу раздражающий идиотов, которые вызывают лишь отвращение. 
Но всё же стоит похвалить разработчика за то, что он хотя бы попытался создать не generic образы. 

В атмосферном плане тоже беда. Во-первых, мир выглядит очень плохо(да, даже по меркам RPG Maker'а). Во-вторых, музыка некоторых локаций очень сильно раздражает. Та и в целом мир пустой, ничего интересного про него сказать не получается. Не интересные монстры, не особо интересные города, Скуууука. 

В плане геймплея, как я и говорил, это самая казуальная пройденная мной игра из RPGM. Во-первых, единственное снаряжение, которое можно менять - это аксессуары. В игре нет ни шлемов, ни брони. При этом есть оружие, но его менять тоже нельзя. Т.е. наша принцесса на протяжении всей игры ходит с одной и той же дубиной. При этом довольно необычным для жанра является заработок денег.  Заработать можно только на продаже лута, оставляемого монстрами. При этом лут делится на обычный и высокого качества. Второй тип выпадает гораздо реже, чем первый. Но всё это совершенно бесполезная механика, ибо деньги тупо не на что тратить. Разве что по сюжету будет пара мест, где придётся потратить довольно большую сумму, но Вы её отобьёте минут за пять гринда. 
Кроме обычного повышения статов при переходе на следующий уровень, персонажи также получают очки для открывания специальных способностей. Забавно, что самая полезная способность принадлежит самому не раздражающему персонажу - пареньку, который офигевает от тупости окружающих и постоянно хочет свалить(не осуждаю). Он может парализовать на семь(!) ходов. Эту способность я использовал в каждой битве, ибо она очень хорошо действует даже на тех, кто гораздо выше по уровню. Именно благодаря нему я поднял где-то уровней 15-20 примерно за полчаса. Причём это был даже не целенаправленный гринд, а просто зачистка подземелья, в которое нужно было прийти позже по сюжету. 
Кстати о подземельях. Они - просто худшее, что есть в игре. Автор с чего-то решил, что запендюрить  кучу однообразных лабиринтов в свою игру - хорошая идея. Просто дичь, абсолютно каждый данж тут - это просто запутанная система ничем не примечательных коридоров. Хорошо, что рандомных инкаунтеров нет, а то можно было бы с ума сойти. 
Вот что у автора получилось хорошо - это битвы с боссами. Они в меру сложные и довольно разнообразные, причём к каждому нужен свой подход(паралич на них не действует, сори). При этом именно во время битв с боссами используются почти все персонажи, что есть в пати, благо прямо во время боя можно заменить любого персонажа на другого, причём это не сильно облегчает битвы с глав-гадами. Так что за это автора очень хвалю.
Ещё стоит упомянуть, что есть сайд квесты. Всего их штук 11, Обычно надо либо принести тот самый лут высокого качества(грииинд), либо же просто найти кого-то и поговорить с ним. Награда почти всегда одна - три очка для открывания способностей, что нереально бесполезно, учитывая, что уже на пятом часу у меня были открыты все способности каждого из персонажей. Хотя кроме очков иногда даются аксессуары. Один из них просто нереально полезен, ибо он позволяет персонажу сделать два действия за один ход. Конечно же я надел его на чувака, кидающего параличи, ибо два паралича - сверх полезно. 

На самом деле, это далеко не худшая игра из RPGM, в которую я играл. Во время прохождения я не наткнулся ни на один баг, битвы с боссами были очень занимательными, та и негатива она вызывает куда меньше, чем всякие помойки типа 3 Stars of Desteny и  Vargant Hearts 2. Советовать я её никак не могу, слишком уж много недостатков и странных решений.

My memories are that it's solid and fun both writing-wise and gameplay-wise if you can get past the default graphics, with well-designed boss fights, amusing characters with fun abilities, and the ability to swap out as much of your party as you want once per battle to try and turn things around, or keep a rally going.

Most of the cast are 1-dimensional blocks of wood who will occasionally chime in with a line or two of reactionary dialogue, but not actually influence any part of the plot or each other through their words or actions.  Every opportunity - and there are many - to explore the personality and nuances of the protagonist, and grow her as a person, is invariably ignored and passed by.  There are no consequences whatsoever for the protagonist's wrongdoing, and her blitheness is only ever rewarded, yet the story presents itself as one in which she's supposed to be a sympathetic or even heroic figure.  Forget ""Show, Don't Tell"" - this game's carefree narrative approach doesn't even bother with ""Tell"".

Gameplay should never be a consideration for RPGs, as they are boring by design, but even by the low standard of the genre, this game's technical aspects are lacking.  Fulfilling most of the unengaging sidequests loses any gameplay purpose halfway through, due to the rewards only ever being skill points that, after a certain point, you simply don't need.  Enemies and bosses are heavy-hitting damage-sponges, and some party members simply don't have any utility beyond the early dungeons.  An optional character, one that you can give up as part of a sidequest, is an absolute necessity in the late game and against the final boss.  The shop system's ever-rising prices are frustrating.  The game feels crude, in and out of battle.

Of the 3 Roseportal Games products I've played now (this, Whisper of a Rose, and Sweet Lily Dreams), none has been a decent RPG, but at least with WoaR and SLD, the writing felt PRESENT, if inept.

TLDR: Fairly demanding mazes and monsters and half decent world setting and writing. Plot comes slowly about entitled power fantasy of entitled princess gone wrong.

The problem with this game is that the RPGMaker shell does not really allow for a detailed portrayal of the main protagonist, which would be necessary for us to get invested and relate with such an obviously flawed character. There is little else to distract from the main quest line with one-line flat npcs and rapidly introduced vast cast of sidekicks that are for the most part unwillling sidekicks. 

The underdevelopped characters aside the world felt somewhat credible as far as RPGMaker world goes. The towns and characters seemed appropriately named and it the illusion that this is in fact its own little fantasy world did stick with me. What helps creates this setting is that the game creates specific rosters of fantasy creatures for multiple ecosystems and the abilities and special traits of those creatures are consistent with the generally accepted lore that you would expect out of such things. There also seemed to be quite a few fluff areas that may or may not have a quest attached to them. Small side-castles, a wood nymph pond and so on.

The mazes can be fairly intricate to navigate with a long of branching paths in forests, dungeons with square rooms and twisting corridors coming one after the other with the odd grate and leverpull. The ice caves further limit progression with movement restrictions by way of a sliding ice floor.

The enemies do not constantly spawn unless an area is left and re-entered but are generously populated. Which means you will want to auto-resolve them to save on mental energy and tedium. However due to the long list of abilities of creatures it is common to have to pause the auto combat to assign potions to characters or trigger the odd special ability under threat of losing the entire party if neglected.

It is quite possible to use abilities often and not use only the regular attack since the experience distribution ensure a fairly common level up system which replenishes energy while away from resting areas. Additionally with the possibility of purchasing skills some degree of customization and priority will matter in character development. There is also, due to the large cast, a tactical aspect in selecting the right party for the right environment.

The itemization felt rather limited, while nearly all creatures willd drop flavor items, such as eyes, wings, and the like, they did not seem to serve any obvious purpose, although due to them being divided in quality it would seem to indicate that some NPC somewhere can craft those into consumable potions. The character equipment slots are limited to a single accessory slot and a single weapon slot and items are fairly uncommon to find in chests or as drops.

On the whole the execution is there, what really holds the experience back is the drudgery of having to babysit the unlikeable protagonist through her adventures, while navigating mazes and going through yet another encounter, you just end up feeling like all the side characters. Strung-along for the ride. 

Eventually the quality of the combat is not enough to really motivate deeper commitment on its own and after completing an area, getting served a few more lines of dialogue, a new objective and being directed to the next maze filled with creatures it becomes very tempting to just abandon play.

I would prefer enjoying tactical turn based combat in a different RPGMaker game where the characters matter to me, or better yet, play a proper pen and paper inspired rpg game with all the bells and whistles that comes along with that genre. The Princess's Heart is by nature of its engine but a pale imitation of such games.

At the time of deleting the game my party was made of a brainwashed suitor made to love the princess against his will by demonic sorcery, a guard bound by duty to protect the princess, a nun whom had to track down a holy artifact that the princess selfishly stole, a farmer and dark mage that were seemingly brought along for little to no reason, a prostituted-captain that loaned her services in exchange for the rescue of her ship and the main protagonist.

I do think there is an interesting setup here if the game had deeper more intricate writing, proper anime style animations and a richer world stage. The tale of the narcissism and demonic curses had at least some measure of intrigue to it. But that is not what is being served in this low ambitions RPGMaker title.

The map design isn't bad, either.

Among other things, I teach game design to middle school students, and I'd love to have a substantive RPG I could share with my female students. I thought this might be it - but it isn't. The problem isn't the premise, or the occasionally mature content. Rather, the problem is the execution. Far too often, the game contradicts itself. Far too often, the narrative breaks the fundamental rule of storytelling, telling you stuff instead of showing you stuff. And the RPG mechanics, while they bring back fond memories of FFII and FFIII, are pretty standard, and quickly get old.

An example. Vices as demons is a common but useful metaphor, and it could have been a solid foundation for a game that was both fun and thoughtful. Unfortunately, the very first demon battle (about 3 hours into the game) is just like every other battle. Before the battle began, the game told me in words that that this fantasy demon was a metaphor for the real problems of a real-world human. However, with the bland RPG battle mechanics, the game told me that this fantasy demon was just a bunch of stats - no different from a snake, bird, goblin, or manticore. Further, after defeating the demon, my princess was exactly the same person that she was before the battle began. There was no nifty mechanic, pithy punchline, no change-of-heart epiphany. At the end of the battle, all I got was a Scroll of Return - allowing me to teleport out of the dungeon. This was a huge missed opportunity.

On the bright side - the designers put lots of nice touches into the visuals and the UI. It's clear they cared about the game, and that care shines through the cracks in the narrative and the design. I just wish they'd been more consistently faithful to the premise, and had crafted mechanics that supported and enriched the narrative.

The completionist in me may someday sit down to finish this game so that I can lay claim all the achievements. Right now, I feel done. I'm a little curious about the story, but not so curious that I'm willing to slog through more cookie-cutter dungeons or consequence-less battles.",1478121547,1479012236,False,5,0,0.568443655967712402,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For an open-world RPG, the game is relatively easy to finish, with an estimated playtime of around 15 hours and doesn't require much grinding for experience levels or loot drops. The combat is simple and very consistent, with every character using the same weapon from start to end of game and only one optional jewellery slot to protect against a special negative effect or to enhance a certain combat ability. There are very few instances of failed or missed combat abilities or magic not working on allies or enemies that have no special resistance to that form of attack. The only con is the scaling up of prices for potions and elixirs with character level, which reduces the motivation to grind for loot and hoard 99 units of potions or elixirs. Among the side-quests available in the game, they are short and all can be completed without too much travelling or grinding for specific high-quality mob loot.

The music in this little gem is really great. One of the best soundtracks I've listened to in a while. The graphics are rather standard for an RPG Maker game, but some effects and a distinct set of tiles for each location creates a pleasant to look at game. The story isn't very deep, but it's well written and gives enough background.

The gameplay isn't without flaws though. There's the odd auto leveling of prices for inns and items. I guess it's meant to balance out the higher rewards you get from stronger enemies, but it just feels wrong. The other thing that is worth mentioning is the 'streamlined' equipment. There's only one accessory slot to equip something and the selection of equipable items only covers protection against the various status effects, more HP or MP and a small boost to attack. There's only one special accessory that you can get for completing a side quest. At least two slots and a bit more variation could have helped here.

The enemy variety and the boss fights are again very good. You won't find any 'recolored' enemies in this game. Each area/dungeon has its unique set of enemies and you will need a bit of strategy to get past them. The overall difficulty isn't very high, but it's not a casual game either. Make sure you save up enough potions before you enter any boss fights.

The game is only 15 hours long (including all side quests) and there's not that much to discover outside of the main path. A good amount of that time is grinding for levels as the lack of equipment forces you to make up for it by leveling your characters. It doesn't get too boring though even if the dungeons don't hold any surprises. You hunt for a switch or two and figure out which paths are dead ends. That's pretty much it. Still the game doesn't feel boring because the dungeons don't drag on too much and as mentioned above each location feels unique.

Overall it's a very solid JRPG with a bit wonky gameplay mechanics, but a beautiful soundtrack, a good variety of locations and enemies and an entertaining story. Well worth the 5 bucks.",1448461627,1448461627,True,17,0,0.657633483409881592,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The pre-made Enterbrain RTP visuals and mapping seems lazy. But is it? Is the game just a quick cash grab or is there more to it than a simple premade asset layer?[/i]

At first, when I saw the promotional screenshots for the game, I was appalled. Not only by what I saw as below average mapping (at least by RosePortal's usual high standards, compared to many other RPGs out there it doesn't stand out that much) but also horribly small characters that had barely anything redeemable to them. And the battle system - goodbye side-view custom battles, here we go, pre-made ""first person"" combat with sprites not really animated at all.

And yet, I gave this game a chance and played it through. In full.

And I don't regret one single minute.

Why? Like I said, graphics-wise the game is very much below RosePortal's usual average. It's not all that about the RTP tileset: the resource can be used to create beautiful environments that would be very much on par with Whisper of a Rose's (it just didn't happen here, instead we have a bunch of square-looking mazes), it's more about the characters, both the playable and NPC ones as well as the monsters. RosePortal made it a habit to have each monster fully animated in combat, here we have a simulation of movement by close-up effects or stretching and un-stretching the enemy pictures. The character sprites are RPG Maker VX Ace's defaults, meaning they occupy one tile (that provides little room for them to look good) instead of RosePortal's regular, whooping three. While the environments are varied, some of them just don't look authentic. Instead of posting a series of trees or a large unpenetrable layer of bushes/trees as the level ""wall"", RosePortal applied the one tile that I think shouldn't be used: a tree trunk on a black background... that looks grotesque when seen on the corners as the blackness between the trees would have been understandable in the middle but not at the corner. A few of the maps seem empty and barely decorated/filled with content, I'm mainly looking at the Old Dayaz desert area and Maplefield. The only actual custom graphics I've noticed are: the title screen and the intro movie, which both are really well done.

However, I'm bringing up what I said before: I don't regret one single minute spent on playing this game, not one bit. And that is because, quite frankly, The Princess' Heart delivers much more in terms of other departments than in terms of just visuals.

Let's start with the music. It's, again, downright beautiful. RosePortal have once again delivered an alluring, orchestral-sounding set of musical pieces which all fit quite well into the game's environments and narrative. I can't say it more clearly: buy the Deluxe version, just for the soundtrack alone, the music being already in the game files be damned. They deserve support just for the quality of that soundtrack alone. My absolute favorites are Dark Heavens (the demon boss combat theme) and The Beyond, named after one of the game's areas. Epicness absolutely ensues. Not a single RTP track was used in the making of this game, a stark contrast with the visual layer.

As far as the gameplay goes, this is your standard jRPG fare with a wee little twist. Just a little. There is no crafting option nor there are any weapons to be picked up (so that option is useless), instead like in Sweet Lily Dreams, the only thing we can equip our characters with are accessories. The combat system is simplistic but works - albeit it does have two new options. First, some spells have an area of effect - so a single-target spell may actually hit some neighbouring targets if you choose the right victim. That can actually save you a lot of MP which would normally be used for all-enemy-targeting spells. Second, you can swap characters in the active party not only outside of battles but also in-between turns! This can get you out of sticky situations - if some characters get knocked out and you have no means to bring them back, simply replace them with others, fully healed and just waiting to kick the monsters' butts. I happened to use this feature just once, on the final boss, but it sure counts: when it was almost dead and I knew my current party doesn't have what it takes to kill it in one volley nor will they survive its next attack, I just replaced them and in three further turns, the battle was over. I was the one left standing.

About the battles: they aren't a chore but they can be a challenge. Areas can technically be completed outside the beaten track as besides the final three dungeons, you can reach pretty much every location quite early on in the game. Enemies do NOT respawn in-between level sections most of the time, so you have to leave to the World Map - this may be a lifesaver if you're particularly wasted after just narrowly beating That One Boss. They do however have quite a level of difficulty, also due to the scarcity of items. There isn't an abundance: there's just what you get from the chests plus what you'll buy in the shops but with one catch: the prices rise alongside your overall character level so you won't be able to afford 999 of those Elixirs or Magic Waters. Most of the time, you need to make do with what you have found from chests. Money isn't earned by just winning the battle either, nor is it rewarded by the completion of a quest - you need to sell what you've acquired from battles in order to make some money.

About quests... well, there's just eleven of them, so not that all much, but then again a game advertised as 15-hour is less than a half of what you'd spend on Whisper of a Rose, so that number would kind of fit. What irks me is their overall lack of variety. Half of the sidequests involve you bringing the questgiver a bunch of high-quality drops from the monsters. The others do make much more sense but there's more than one occasion of the trope ""Guide Dang It"" being invoked. And it's a bad trope to invoke. I mean particularly the Cambolton Fortress quest involving the king's soul. Honestly, given what the Counselor was saying, one would think that the first place one should visit is the desert city Daragit. Uh... suffice it to say that it's a waste of time. The solution is right there in Cambolton, it's just so non-intuitive and so hard to spot that I literally needed a guide to complete it and I wasn't the only one, judging from the forums. A couple quests end in a really anti-climatic way, such as the Arsonist one (why didn't I get the option to deal with the guilty party?!) or the Emily exorcism one (props for the ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" reference by the way) - why wasn't I able to actually WHACK the possessing demon instead of just having it expelled like someone snapped a finger and said ""begone""? Yep, the sidequests definitely lack polish. The only reward you'll ever get for them is Journey Points which are used to learn skills. And again, there's a glaring issue: at some point (as a little grinding [i]is[/i] recommended to progress smoothly and you also get JPs after gaining character levels) there's simply TOO MUCH of these points to spend'em.

The basic story is about a princess who has to[spoiler]break a curse she set on herself because she made an agreement with a demon to make the prince love her. (What a Stalker!) [/spoiler] 

Positives:
+ It’s $4.99
+ Graphics are nice, if you like the SNES style
+ A few randomly funny moments, there's a few side quests, no random enemy encounters,  the combat is quick.

Negatives:
- Graphical issues: The screen flashes and skips often when walking. This is especially annoying if you set movement speed from walk to run.
- The story line: It is different and that helps it a little, but there needs to be more to the story and the characters within it.[spoiler](The story starts with the princess going on a drunken bender and ordering the death of innocent guards for no reason. This does not make for a very likable princess character.)[/spoiler]
- Some basic missing aspects: No armor or weapon upgrades, except for one accessory slot. New spells don’t unlock as you gain levels and each character only has 6-9 skills. Money is mostly irrelevant, since you don't need to buy gear. No world map.
- Some boring design choices and grinding: So far I have been going from dungeon to dungeon, moving two levers to unlock a boss room, and then killing a boss. Go to the next dungeon and repeat. There are also some difficulty spikes, where you are fine one level and then get crushed the next level. Exploring new areas is not advisable, as you really need to go in the order the game wants or you're going to die.

Other:
• Not recommended for kids. The majority of the game would be fine for kids but there are occasional, mostly random moments, where the text is pretty all over the place. I am an adult so I can handle it, but it a little unexpected in a cute looking game when a bandit states he going to kill the princess and rape her corpse if she comes back.

Overall this game has a few positive aspects but I haven't found enough enjoyable content in this game to make me recommend it. If more content was added and the above mentioned negatives were corrected, it would greatly improve the game and add some charm to it's world. Rating: 5/10

Game Tips:
-To get spells you have to buy them from within the game menu. This is simple but easy to overlook, so go to the skills screen and select learn skills to buy them with journey points.
-You need to talk to Maota, at the Snowline Port Inn, to be able to fight bandits at the tower and obtain the ship to sail the sea’s.

Those were the first words to greet me into this game after some rather awkward form of configuration. Just like how you don't hang out at alcoholics anonymous meetings for a laugh, don't come to this game expecting a documentary style affair. Don't come into this game expecting a lot, it saves a lot of disappointment in the long run.

Well, as if that little statement didn't give away my opinion on this. I should elaborate. The Princess' Heart is a story written from the perspective of an adolscent girl and like everyone's early work, this is just awful.

The princess herself is a brat. Totally irredeemable. The captain has no backbone. These two are introduced to us and are just flat out unlikable, how does one get invested in the story when the characters themselves actively fight your interest if you decide to give it a chance? You are punished for starting a new game.

It doesn't get any better from there. Bland plot points, one dimensional characters and just poor mapping. The game uses RTP which is included in RPG Maker and the built in character generator for the character sprites and faces. I maintain there is nothing wrong with that, however when you have a place called a Ridge, why is it suddenly floating in the sky?

The world itself feels empty. Characters sprouting the some few lines as nauseum. In a dungeon, there may only be a few things to interact with, some treasure chests and a switch or two if you're lucky. No flavour text, just events important to the plot and that's it. Here's another map you have to walk through until you get to the next non-interactive moment. A > B > C. Perhaps it opens up afterwards, I don't know. I doubt I'm going to find out.

If you recall the beginning of this ""review"", I mentioned some configuration. You are asked how you would like to play and you are then warned to not press the F12 key as that will reset the game. It does not, it does however crash the game. You can also change the window colour in the options menu however the audio system? Doesn't work. I changed all values to 0% and still had everything at the same volume it was earlier.

[h1]Audio: [/h1]

Didn't know what to expect in terms of audio. It was a pleasant surprise to hear the intro music and the music for each locale. Each of tracks to the locations represented each location's ""feel"" and theme very well. The music is very well made that it somehow stuck itself in head like bumping 90's track.
Minor gripe: A certain enemy type that has a high pitched battle intro sound, that's all.

[h1]Characters[/h1]

As it is a game with a party system, you can expect variation in each character's strength and weakness.
As for me I can't seem to work out the importance/strength of this one character that you will encounter in one of the first few locales. So I will usually alternate between every other character to play to their strengths when encountering different enemies except for this one character.
Banter/Interactions between characters is what makes them memorable. However I felt that it toned down a tad bit as the game progresses.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Battles have a turn-based combat system reminiscent of other RPG-Maker games (which isn't a bad thing necessarily)
Where you have the general ""attack"", ""special/magic"", ""guard"" moves etc and also to which you can try to escape from combat when things turn sour.
After each combat it will yield you with experience points and items that the enemy drops. These items then can be sold to acquire potions, rings etc.
A minor gripe: The item system, you will find yourself selling a lot of those item drops from battles because it doesn't have any use to them. If you play too much RPG games you might find yourself feeling that more could be done with those items, such as a crafting system where you can make special potions, enchant a ring or something along those lines. But if you can overlook that aspect then there won't be an issue at all.

Since the game does not have any difficulty settings, I was surprised to see certain locations that has really challenging enemies if you happen to enter those locations a little to early. So do expect a small portion of the game to level up your characters before you progress into a new area or you would find your party decimated over and over.

Getting into this game to beta test it, I was expecting (not hoping) to encounter certain bugs or maybe even a typo here and there in the dialogue. However much to my surprise, there wasn't any bugs encountered which was breath of fresh air, wish the same thing can be said about my house.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

As with other RPG-Maker games you get what you see in terms of the graphics of the game.
The art style is up at the standard of other good RPG-Maker & Visual Novels you can think of.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Don't let the initial cliché start of the story stop you from playing as it gains momentum as the minutes tick by. The initial cliché start will be a distant memory as story pans out.
A good note to take is that I expected the game to on the range of 6-8 hours but that doesn't seem to be the case as it is rather longer than I had expected but that could also vary from each player's play style.

[h1]Overall[/h1]

For a person who is easily put off from an RPG-Maker game like how some people are put off with pixel graphics games, I would say to give this game a shot if you're open to trying and giving a game of this nature a chance and who knows you might be finding yourself having some fun relaxing time in this game.
The minor gripes stated above is based on personal preference that can be overlooked and vary from person to person.

The soundtracks are one of the best features in this game, it really makes you feel like playing one of the oldschool RPG hits.

The Princess’ Heart is another RPG developed by Roseportal Games. It was their third commercial game, after successes like Whisper of a Rose and Sweet Lily Dreams (both available through Steam). It does not share the same universe as those games and looks and feels more like a traditional JRPG. 

The Princess’ Heart has a nice plot, if a bit short, however its characters make up for it quite well. I found them very unexpected and they often surprised me. There’s 9 party members in total, one of which is optional. I would have liked to see some more party interaction.

Graphics are pretty standard, but used wisely and correctly in my opinion. It also feels more traditional, because of the standard graphics. 

As for gameplay, there’s no difficulty modes, but as the battles are well balanced and the monsters don’t respawn until you’ve left the dungeon completely, it doesn’t feel necessarily. I liked that I could change the party formation easily, which is quite necessary as most battles require you to do so.  Some of the dungeons are mazes and loop, which I quite enjoyed as a challenge. 

All in all I recommend this game to every strategic RPG lover.

To start off my review, my opionion of the game was pretty low starting out. The intro gave me the impression that the plot was going to be quite dark. Having a few innocent guards executed near the begining reinforced my suspicions. The gamplay which ill cover later, also bothered me at first and i was almost ready to send the game back and not play anymore. That said, I am glad i pushed past that, as overall i realy enjoyed the game. It just took some warming up to. The plot was not nearly as dark as the intro made it feel for me.

Gameplay Mechanics(7/10): There were a few mechanics that irked me while playing, Such as entirely disabling dash in any combat area, making navigating already comquered areas much slower. or that Shop items never change, the price just goes up with your level, making it harder and harder to purchase everything. I ended up just not bothering to use consumable items and found it easier to grind till the area couldnt hurt me. 

There were also some mechanics i loved in the game, such as the ability to swap out your entire party once per combat, even boss battles, this has saved me many times. As you progress and unlock more skills the initially dull encounters start becoming very fun and engaging, there are so many ways to play your party strategically. The skills make the battles, as other than an accessory that allows double turns, most equipment in the game is rather dull and pointless. there are only accessories, armor and weapon do not change. also strange how many characters fight with some variation of fisticuffs.

Graphics: The engine used to create a game is not an excuse for the quality of the game. As with most RPGM games I feel i cant really even grade this catagory, other than the ""retro feel"" it does not stand up to current industry standards, though its what you will see in most RPGM games.

Characters(9/10): I very much enjoyed the banter between characters and the personality of each one, and no character felt worthless in my party so the battle balance was well done. the only flaw i find is there isnt enough screen time to showcae these characters, and few of them grow past what they start as.

Story(8/10): I feel this could have been much more than it was. while i did end up enjoying it quite a bit, there are alot of gaps between story moments, and the story moments were short and sweet. I do feel the needless deaths of countless guards was a bit much compared to the light heartedness of the story that follows. I started off with a negetive bias but enjoyed the game enough to get back into the story, and i feel that while too short, it was a good story. 

Overall: not without its flaws and frustration, but far better than a great many other games out there, and overall quite enjoyable even with the issues. Dont expect the next bioshock 2 out of it, but dont pass it up either.

EDIT:
In light of the recently released deluxe version, im afraid my overall opinion of this game has dropped conciderably. making 3 in game skills only available by spending extra money is kinda messed up. x.x",1438291889,1438879736,True,17,4,0.597733378410339355,2,False,False,False,False,,,
