Cutesy, well drawn pixel graphics hampered by obvious lack of controller support (I didn't see any controller options in the option menu), lack of world map (Zelda: A Link To The Past (SNES) had it in 1991), lack of wind-up dash at the start of the game (once again 1991) despite HUGE, EMPTY map. Combat and exploration has its moments (despite the snail's pace walking speed). It's worth what you pay for it (¬‿¬).

That being said, some minor sticking points...

OSTENSIBLE controller support means no controller support. I had to use my keyboard the entire time seeing as I couldn't manage to get my controller to work, even though it worked for every other game, even one released in 2014!

The only positive it has is its short, but even then I was annoyed and done with it before the hour was up.

I am befuddled by the amount of positive reviews for this game. It clearly wants to be Link's Awakening, but there is just nothing substantial here at all. Best reviewed in a list of the worst things about it:

-The overworld is needlessly large and barren. There are no enemies, 95% of the overworld map has literally nothing in it. Its needless padding to make walking between the five tiles with anything on it longer than it needs to be.

-Straight, linear game, no deviation or reason to replay. The only things you could miss are the health powerups, two of which are on the overworld, and the one 'joke' treasure chest that gave a single gold coin in the last dungeon, and only for those achievements.

-Each dungeon basically has two enemies in them, plus the ever-present bats. The combat is floaty, its hard to confidently swing and hit an enemy and not take a hit of your own. You get a shield, but it changes block directions when you move, so you can't use it well enough to matter. Most traps in dungeons are arrow traps, which is basically just 'you can't get the shield facing the right way, so just take a hit'. I -never- felt confident enough about my hitbox, and most of the time I was just chewing down healing items.

-You get tons of gold. There is one store to spend gold in, it has two healing items and arrows. You can not access this store between the second to last and last dungeon. I had 900 gold and would have -liked- to spend it on healing items, but nope.

-The last bossfight is him arrow spamming you with no way to block and still hit back, and you'll take 2-3 hits for every one you manage to land. They apparently decided to balance it by having waves of enemies that can drop a few healing items.

-There are way, way too many dark areas, and the lantern takes up one of two item slots. So can't lantern+shield+sword. Your weapons range is just slightly shorter than the light, so you will just walk into enemies or pits if you aren't inching around. Its extremely annoying.

In summary: No, pick something else.",1654089529,1654089529,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have a couple of gripes but you can buy this game for about a dollar on sale and it's fun enough for it's 2-3 hour runtime to satisfy fans of this type of game genre.

Things I liked:
-Game runs well and automatically scales to screens by maximizing the window, no need to fiddle around with settings, it just works. ""Fullscreen"" mode is a borderless window, so you can alt tab out without having a black screen for a bit. Controller support just works and doesn't need any setup.
-Game autosaves perfectly and you can jump in and out whenever you like
-Very nice music for this tiny game. It sounds nice and you will probably enjoy the music as you play through each dungeon.
-The dungeons are well designed and not too confusing, but also satisfying on a puzzle-solving level. Combat doesn't have much to it but it's still fun to fight. Especially once you get arrows.
-The shield is very useful, moreso than most Zelda games. I kept it on one of my item slots just about the whole game since it was really fun to guard every attack with it and stun enemies.

My Gripes:
-The overworld has no enemies. This would be fine if the overworld was really small, but it's a bit too big for how empty it is. Once you get in the dungeons it's great. You might get bored quick if you think exploring the overworld is worth your time. Try to head straight for the dungeons if you want to have fun with the game.
-The town has a couple of NPCs, but most of the houses are empty...it would be easy to add a couple more NPCs, wouldn't it?
-This is often a problem with most Zelda style games, but I had a lot of money and nothing to spend it on very quickly in the game. Maybe a sword upgrade or shield upgrade to purchase would have made it a bit more fun.

Overall I can recommend it to fans of Zelda style games for a quick playthrough. The dungeons are fun at least, and the combat and music work well enough to make it enjoyable to play.",1645593758,1645593758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b][i]Shipwreck[/i][/b] is an old-school 8-bit-style [i]Zelda[/i] clone that is carefully crafted but lacks any visual or gameplay innovations or variety.

The pixel-art is sufficient, reminiscent of the older [i]Final Fantasy[/i] games; however, it is utterly unmemorable.

The music is pleasing to the ear but it feels out of place since it is not retro-styled, rather some modern easy-listening vibes.

The outer world is boring and devoid of life, just random trees placed here and there, with no secrets and no incentive to explore.

The dungeons are very straightforward, the puzzles are boring and feel like padding (e.g. pull a lever in one end of the map to open the gate across from it).

The only exciting level is the Deserts dungeon, it actually has a [spoiler]disappearing tiles[/spoiler] puzzle that requires a bit of thinking through.

The swordplay is incurious due to the weird hitboxes that are a bit bigger than they should be and dumb enemies.

The plot is non-existent.

The sad thing is that the game is actually polished - there are no bugs, no sudden difficulty curve swerves, the enemies are placed thoughtfully, there is some quality-of-life here and there (e.g. when you defeat a boss, you don't have to backtrack - you just get teleported back to the dungeon entrance). But it is [i]so utterly uninspiring[/i]: there is nothing, literally nothing that makes it stand out from its competitors. There are much worse games that are worth playing due to their unusual game mechanics or peculiar art.

You've got a sword, a shield and a couple of items - a crossbow, a lantern to light dark rooms, a pickaxe to break rocks and some food to heal up anywhere, but that's it. No boomerang, no grappling hook, no boots that make you run faster.

This has two effects:
- Everything is kept very simple and to the point. Enemies are never too complicated, don't take too many hits, and the focus is on puzzles as well as dungeon design. And it works! [b]Shipwreck[/b] takes around two hours to go through and doesn't beat around the bush. The plot is very simple, with four dungeons (plus a tutorial one and a final one, so actually six) to beat in order to finish the game, which can be done in about two hours. These dungeons are the main focus of the game, with some interesting puzzles and design playing around verticality. They're mostly fun and punctuated by good bosses.
- It's quite repetitive and can get boring. Since you don't really get new gadgets to play with, you'll always walk at the same speed, swing your sword to do the same amount of damage and never have fun items to think about. It's a pity! The best dungeon is the desert one, with a few branching paths and enigmas based around spikes and switches. It's not too hard, but it feels a bit like a Zelda dungeon, which is great - unfortunately, it falls short I feel like it could have been even better with puzzles based around items.

This duality is at the heart of [b]Shipwreck[/b]. On the one hand, it gets a bit repetitive when you feel like you're just going through the motion, never having to think too much about what you're doing except when you have to ration food. On the other hand, Its simplicity and short length are a big strength, since it's a Zelda-lite experience you can be done with in about two hours. And even though it isn't quite up to the series' level, it gets pretty close at times, which is why I would absolutely recommend it for such a cheap price.

Two things keep this firmly in the average category. One is mechanical: it mimics the top-down perspective of old-school [i]Zelda[/i] (and, in premise, [i]Link's Awakening[/i] specifically), using a grid-based system for locating objects on the map. Unfortunately, whether an object takes up its entire square of the grid or not, the game will behave as if it does. This means you'll often fail to squeeze through a passage that seems wide enough for your character, or an enemy's attack will damage you despite appearing to miss. It never becomes a serious problem, but you'll spend a good fifteen minutes getting used to it.

The second, more fundamental one is conceptual: if you've played any [i]Zelda[/i] game or its ilk in the last ten or so years, nothing here will surprise or challenge you all that much. The story is extremely simple - defeat the big bad to escape the island - and no subplots or sidequests exist to flesh it out. (Your character doesn't even have a name.) Action-adventures thrive on the tried-and-true formula of constant evolution by giving you new items to further explore and a wide variety of locales, but [i]Shipwreck[/i] only somewhat understands this. Here, your inventory caps out by the 50% mark, and the overworld is lifeless; outside of the single town there is nothing to interact with. Dungeons are nicely distinct in both aesthetic and atmosphere (the soundtrack is arguably the game's best feature), but outside of the final one they're a pushover - puzzles are very simple and most enemies can be defeated with sheer brute force. And at barely three hours (five if you're less experienced), it's only good for a few sessions at most.

Still, as I said, a pleasantly unremarkable experience. For the price, you can't get mad at its very modest ambitions.",1614400194,1635987531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen eine Junge Frau (denke ich, Name wird nicht genant) und wir sind auf einer Insel gestrandet. In einem Dorf angekommen, werden wir vom Bürgermeister beauftragt einen Geist aus einem Leuchtturm zu vertreiben, der für Stürme sorgt. Vorher müssen wir allerdings 4 Siegel finden um überhaupt erst in den Leuchtturm hinein zu gelangen

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es erinnert sehr stark an ""The Legend of Zelda: A link To The Past"" auf dem SNES. Es ist aber kein Billiger Klon wie so viele andere, sondern das Spiel ist wirklich sehr gut gemacht, vor allem die Musik ist sehr gut gelungen. Wir müssen uns durch insgesamt 5 Kurze Dungeons kämpfen und ein paar Schalter & Schiebe Rätsel lösen. Am Ende eines jeden Dungeons erwartet uns natürlich ein Boss Kampf, auch diese sind ganz gut gelungen

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 14 Erfolge. Die meisten sind Story basierend und somit nicht verpassbar. Für die anderen muss man alle Herz Container finden (7 Stück), eine Geheime Schatz Truhe im Leuchtturm finden und 100% des Spiels erreichen (was man, wenn man alle Herz Container und den Schatz findet sowieso hat)

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Günstig
+ Story OK
+ Nettes Gameplay
+ Gute Boss Kämpfe
+ Sehr Gute Musik
+ Rätsel sind ganz OK
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten
+ XBox 360 Controller Support

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein richtig Gutes Action Adventure alá Legend of Zelda. Tolle Boss Kämpfe und sehr Gute Musik. Wer die Alten Zelda Spiele mag, der sollte sich dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall mal anschauen. Auch für Achievement Hunter sehr zu Empfehlen weil die Erfolge sehr Einfach zu bekommen sind aber Spaß machen

The plot is simple and there isn't any world building beyond what services it (why is the ghost haunting the island in the first place?) but it's got a nice nostalgic feel to it.

Pros:
- Soundtrack
- Easy to 100% if you want to
- A couple of the dungeon designs are pretty cool
- Autosaving

Cons:
- At some points in dungeons you're required to hold a torch to see the enemies you're fighting and since you can't equip more than two items at a time this means you can't use your shield and have to take damage
- There's no world building beyond your mission
- It can be tedious to work your way back through a dungeon if you die or want to get a big heart you missed
- Short (though the price reflects that)

Keep in mind if you play that you can only hold 999 coins at a time (although you don't need that much money anyway since you can only use it to sleep at the inn or buy apples, bread and crossbow bolts).

2.

[h1]Gameplay?[/h1]
So I died to the 2nd boss who deals an entire heart per hit, and I didn't have any apples or bread. You respawn with 3 hearts (My max health was 7 hearts by now.) and you literally have to walk through like 25 screens to go back to the boss and the entire thing has arrow traps, bottomless pits, dark rooms AT THE SAME TIME that requires swapping between lantern and shield, and absolutely nothing to refill your apples. Why? Well you see, pots reappear if you die. Rocks don't.

The village was too far, so I refought the boss like 17 times (I wish I was joking) til I beat him with 3 hearts and I learned to speedrun the entire 2nd dungeon very optimally damageless. It wasn't fun.

[h1]Overall?[/h1]
These guys were inspired by Zelda. Ironically, they didn't [b]learn how to make games[/b] from Zelda. If they did, they'd know the very basic thing to do which is to put a freakin [i]teleporter[/i] so players don't have to walk 30 rooms full of nothing but completed puzzles. Also these guys need to learn how to make puzzles that isn't ""a single gimmick + a maze,"" like every single time.

Also, an overworld map. Also, an overworld with some enemies and less trees. Also, those tree hitboxes are just objectively wrong. Also, the sword just awkwardly does not swing all the way. Also, don't punish an explorative player with dead ends and a empty-handed, required backtracks.

The pros: Great music!

The OKs: The dungeon design, the puzzles, the boss battles, and the overall gameplay. They are NOT bad, but they are not specially good - they are just acceptable.

The cons: The world feels BARREN! The overworld has no enemies at all, and when you do kill some of the few enemies in the dungeons, they never re-spawn.

Also, it's annoying that there's no run functionality (like in the GBA Pokémon games), which makes backtracking tedious and a bit annoying.

But overall, I still recommend this game if you are a fan of Zelda clones, and want to relax and unwind for a while with a game that doesn't present much of a challenge.

It was primarily created by brothers Gravelyn with art and music contributions by Ty Lagalo and Dan Waters respectively.

There isn't much in the way of a story: basically, you get shipwrecked on an island unknown to you and learn from the town inhabitants that the frequent storms are caused by an entity which dwells in the said island's lighthouse. You agree to help the folks out to earn your sail back home.

Just like a classic Zelda title, the gameplay mainly revolves around traversing dungeons in search of the four seals that act as a key to the haunted lighthouse, your final destination. The dungeons themselves are more-or-less multi-layered environmental puzzles, each themed differently from one another, that you need to overcome with the tools at hand. You get your sword and shield early on, followed by a bow and a pick-axe coupled by a lantern. Each dungeon is populated by an assortment of two-hit baddies and a boss which serves as a guardian to the seal to be found within. The scope being limited, there isn't much else to do in the game world apart from overcoming each dungeon one by one. This being a Zelda inspired title, there isn't any levelling up and the interaction with the overworld (which is devoid of any random encounters or enemies, by the way) as well as the townsfolk is bare-minimum. Even if you search every nook and cranny, it takes 3 hours at most to see everything the game has on offer.

Still, considering there's only four guys behind it, Shipwreck's successful at evoking a feeling of byte-sized nostalgia. What it lacks in depth and length, it makes up for it with lovely pixel art and heartfelt, moody music. The relative ease of progression, alongside the basic two-button control scheme and a bug-free ride add up to the overall 'feel-good' experience.

If you are fond of the time you've spent with the portable adventuring titles of olde, Shipwreck's well-worth its asking price. Plug in your gamepad and go for it in a sunny afternoon.",1513108965,1513108965,True,5,0,0.584705173969268799,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is sort of like a Legend of Zelda lite.  It's smaller in scale, has less dungeons and isn't as memorable.  But it still is pretty fun.  The thing in this game that will probably bug people most is that for example in most LoZ games whenever you do the most complicated puzzles in a dungeon you are usually awarded a dungeon item, and a boss key.   In this game there are NO BOSS KEYS AND NO DUNGEON ITEMS!   Often times you will do a rather long puzzle to receive a single key, or in the case of the desert dungeon 1/4 SWITCHES to open the door to the boss.  You can often walk right in the boss room without realizing it.  I did that on the second dungeon and got wiped the floor with.

Also unfortunately the game is a bit too forgiving.  Enemies only are in dungeons, and once you kill them they don't respawn even if you die.  And most of the hazards (which they emphasize in this game) isn't enough to kill you.  plus the game gives you enough gold to fill your 999 cap TWICE by the end of the game meaning you can easily stock up on healing bread.

Это заметил не только я, но скажу правду - эту игру хотел купить давно, просто ждал на неё скидочки. Среди прочих поделок в вонючем рпг-мейкере эта игра особенно выделялась. Она была вдохновлена первой Зельдой, это видно сразу. Но помимо этого, она самостоятельная, как бы это странно не звучало.  В ней нет украденных ассетов и заготовок для персонажей. Она сделана людьми с нуля и с любовью. От Зельды тут разве что общий принцип, механика и интерфейс.

[u]Сюжетик и общий антураж[/u]

Мы девушка приключенец, чей корабль попал в шторм (Кораблекрушение же в названии, не забыли?) и мы были выброшены на берег. Остров маленький, да не простой. На нем есть небольшая деревенька, но люди не могут даже отплыть с острова  - призрак захватил старый маяк, заперся там на 4 священные печати , ну и зараза такая, не хочет выходить оттуда, террорезируя людей штормами без конца. Что бы уплыть с острова, а заодно и избавить людей от призрака, мы должны ворваться в маяк и навалять ему, предварительно собрав 4 печати.

Сам остров очень милый и миролюбивый, даже в шторм и слыша в ушах угрозы того-самого призрака, никто нам делать плохо не будет.  Он небольшой, но даже при этом заняться там особо нечем - все интересности в данжах. Их много, но в каждом из  них свои враги и пазлы с уникальными боссами, что не может не радовать. Графон пиксельный, и по духу больше подходит первой финалке до переиздания, чем Зельде если честно (плюс поиск 4 печатей намекает), но это уже реально личные придирки.

[u] Геймплей [/u]
Все очень просто - есть героиня, и интерфейс и боевка из Зельды - экшн рпг в своей красе. Казуальным игрокам нечего боятся - все загадки простенькие, битвы с врагами и боссами максимально облегчены за счет постоянного дропа мини-аптечек и стрел для арбалета. Да, тут можно добывать монетки, но  они не нужны, так как все самое необходимое мы найдем по сюжету. Кстати, саму игру легко пройти за 3-4 часа, без учета выбивания карточек само собой.  В данжах нужно бить врагов, решать загадки и уклоняться от ловушек. В этом нам поможет наш инвентарь. В игре всего вещей активных 6-7, но у меня язык не поворачивается назвать хоть одну из вещей не нужной. Меч рубит эффективно всех , кирка так же, еще и булыжники разбивает, фонарь помогает решать пазлы , щит эффективно блокирует стрелы и большинство врагов, и аптечки всегда под рукой.  Что касательно механики игры  - все работает безупречно в рамках самой игры.  Казуальщики вроде меня могут это освоить без особых трудов, так  как оригинальную Зельду я сейчас осилить бы точно не сумел.  А если у вас и возникнут проблемы, то поиск бонусных сердец - вам в помощь, анлокнуть штук 5-6 можно на изи, другие прийдется немного поискать. Монстры просты, но надоедливы, невнимательным игрокам попортят нервы. Боссов пятеро, и они хороши - у каждого свои патерны атак, тактики и музыкальные темы даже.
Диалоги с персонажами минимальны и несущественны, чувствуется дух старой школы.  Кстати, о минусах, их тут не очень много, но подчеркнуть стоит. Игра маленькая, учитывайте это при покупке , 4 часа - и она пройдена. Нет реиграбельности и доп.квестов, для многих это может быть проблемой, но помните - это маленькая инди-игра , не более. Мир вне данжей - пуст на 85%. Да, в некоторых домах есть лут и только в одном доме можно потратить монеты за челендж и получить за это бонусы, но на этом все. Ни врагов, ни ивентов - ничего. Остров мирный, что же вы хотели то?)
[u]Музыка [/u]
Ну и в финале обзора хочется отметить, что покупка игры с саундтреком - не самая плохая идея. Он тут реально хороший. Этакий лайт- эмбиент-фентези стиль, видно что композитор хороший попался. Это субъективно на самом деле, как и про графон, но я придирчив к музыке, и если мне она понравилась - значит смело зеленый свет.
[u]Итог[/u]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126176713
Маленькая и хорошая экшн-адвенчура в духе самой первый Зельды, но проходится быстро и рекомендовать её могу только любителям подобного жанра. Игра сделана хорошо и  с любовью, и дать ей шанс  на одно прохождение все же стоит, потому что даже таких середнячков в Стиме - очень и очень мало к сожалению. Либо шедевры, либо мусор. Нам нужно больше таких Кораблекрушений. Кстати, игру прошел - осталься приятно доволен)

Die Geschichte von Shipwreck ist kurz & simpel gehalten: eine namenlose Heldin kentert mit ihrem Schiff in einem Sturm und wacht am Strand einer dünn besidelten Insel auf.

Die Insel wird seit einiger Zeit von einem im Leuchtturm beheimateten ruhelosen Geist terrorisiert und die Heldin muss nun 4 Siegel brechen, um sich Zutritt zum selbigen zu erhalten und dem Spuk ein Ende zu bereiten.

Die Story wird routiniert heruntergespult - Wendungen oder gar Überraschungen gibt es nicht.

Die insgesamt 5 Verliese bieten thematisch Abwechslung (Sumpf, Wüste, ...) und warten mit kleineren Puzzeleinlagen auf. In der Regel lassen sich diese jedoch durch einfaches umherlaufen und ausprobieren lösen. Gehirnschmalz wird hier nicht verlangt. 

Laune macht das Spiel aufgrund der hübschen Pixelgrafik und des flotten Soundtracks. Die Steuerung geht gut von der Hand. Die Kämpfe benötigen etwas Gewöhnung, da die Gegner nach einem Treffer ungewöhnlich lang unverwundbar sind.

Die Gegner inklusive Bosse stellen keine große Herausforderung da. Dank Gegenstände zum Heilen die im Überfluss vorhanden bzw. im örtlichen Laden kaufbar sind kann man nahezu alles einstecken das einem die Gegner entgegenwerfen ohne wirklich in Notlage zu geraten. Das Spiel ist also vom Schwierigkeitsgrad her eher einfach.

Schade ist, dass das Spiel recht kurz ist: selbst wer 100% alles erforscht, kann das Spiel im ersten Durchlauf in unter 3 Stunden schaffen. Die Insel ist sehr klein und abgesehen von der Hauptstory gibt es keine Nebengeschichten und Nebenaufgaben. Mangels dynamischer Inhalte und Moddingsupport bietet das Spiel auch leider keinen wirklichen Wiederspielwert.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Shipwreck is a Zelda-like RPG game where you find yourself stuck in a problem island. There are 6 dungeons in this game with unique bosses at the end of the dungeon.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses pixelated graphics and it looks bold and enjoyable. It shows a unique theme in each area. The mapping looks decent with a lot of empty houses in the town.

[h1]Music[/h1]
The music sounds relaxing. I really love the music, especially the ones played in the town. It has a relaxing and cheerful vibe.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The game doesn't focus on the story too much. The dialogues explain the important things properly and it doesn't sound weird at all. Although you can talk to most NPCs, you can't talk to the guards.

[h1]The game[/h1]
This game has an auto save. It is quite short; It can be completed in around 3 hours (less if you are not aiming for 100%). As i said before, there are 6 dungeons in total and these dungeons can be completed in around 30 minutes (the first dungeon might take faster while the last dungeon might take longer). The dungeon varies from 1-6 floors in total.

The dungeon itself works like Zelda games; you explore a room, find a map, open the locked rooms, and fight the dungeon boss. The map itself might look weird since it doesn't cover the map in detail (and there is no world map), but it's not really a problem except for the last dungeon since the dungeon is more complex than usual (i even missed a key because i was not paying too much attention when i played the game).

There are a few additional item that you can also utilize to advance the room, such as torch and pickaxe. There is also an additional crossbow in addition to the original sword and shield. While the pickaxe can work like a sword (although it can only hit in a straight line), the torch is more like a passive thing; you equip it in your item slot and you'll have more vision in the dark. However, the dev seems to love this concept very much, to the point that i have to kill the enemies with sword and torch because of the dark room. Some enemies can be hard to kill without taking damage with no shield and because i have to use the torch to light the room, i'll have to take some damage in that room. I think there are better level designs that the dev can take without exploiting this fact.

Just like any other zelda games, you can gain ""heart container"" (called ""big heart"" in the game) to gain an extra heart and some health restoring items. Unlike zelda games, you can keep these items (up to 9) and carry it anywhere you want. You also can use the item anywhere and anytime you want as long as you still have some heart left. This makes it easier to kill the boss, especially since there are 2 health restoring items in the game.

The bosses have their own attack patterns, although they can be killed by just attacking it. Some bosses need to be killed with certain item, although the boss' stature or location might already give it off. The boss might take a few hits to kill and sometimes, it might be hard to kill without taking damage. You'll have no problem in finishing it off once you know what to do though. If you're afraid of dying, you can just stock on health restoring items in advance since the boss will die before you run out of it. However, if you, by any chance, die, you'll be teleported to the dungeon entrance and have to start over. It's a good thing that you'll be teleported out of the dungeon once you kill the boss though.

Pros:
- Auto save
- 6 dungeons
- Unique bosses
- Interesting dungeon design
- Health restoring items

Cons:
- No world map
- Dying in a dungeon will teleport you to dungeon entrance
- There are a lot of dark rooms that require torch to clear

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This is a fast paced zelda-like game. There are 6 dungeons in total and you can have up to 3 additional items for your journey.

I'll go over a few aspects of the game below and rate them on a scale of 1 to 10.

Story/Writing: 3/10
-----------------------
The story starts out with the protaganist shipwrecked on an island due to a storm. They find out that the storm is being caused by a ghost that moved into the local lighthouse. After that, the story is about as basic as you can get. Find 'x' number of seals to open the final dungeon. Nothing wrong with a straightforward narrative (Know what I mean, Mario?), but there is very little aside from this going on. No other plots or anything going on. A few NPCs that talk about not liking the storms. Nothing really special.

Art Design: 5/10
----------------------------
A lot of the sprite work is nice, but there seems to be some inconstency in the sprite designs between characters and monsters and what-not. Shading, outlining, etc are different between different sprites and just fails to feel cohesive. The dungeons all have nice themes and the various areas look distinct and feel like they fit in with what the area is supposed to be (ie, desert, swamp, forest, etc). The HUD and design elements of the world are definitely an homage to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, if you hadn't already seen that from the screenshots.

Gameplay: 4/10
-------------------------
At first the controls felt a little clunky, but I got used to them pretty quickly. The puzzles and dungeon designs really leave a lot to be desired. Most puzzles are really just walking through mazes or walking around obstacles for several screens to hit a switch. There was one dungeon that had a puzzle that got me for a couple of minutes involving some teleporting. Otherwise the dungeons feel bland in their layout. The overworld has a lot of area to explore, but most of it is pretty empty and just leads to dead-ends. It doesn't feel like a lot of them have any purpose other than to take up some extra time as you try to find the dungeon entrances.

Sound Design: 6/10
--------------------------
The music is really nice. They went a little unconventional by using a lot of acoustic guitar and woodwinds/pan flutes. The music fits the areas really well, and I found myself really enjoying it. Most of the tracks are very chill and would be great for background music while you're working on other stuff. The sound effects get the job done, but I turned them down becasue they were very loud in comparison to the music. Nothing really special about the SFX though.

Final Verdict: 4/10
----------------------
It's not bad, it's just not particularly good. I'd rather give this a ""neutral"" rating, but since it's not an option, I'll give it a positive. If it cost any more, I'd have given it a negative rating. I think this developer will definitely make some good stuff in the future. Everyone has to start somewhere, and with this as the basis for their company, I think they have a good start.
It's very short (took me around an hour and a half to beat) and it's only $2.99 USD. Or just wait till the next steam sale when it's $0.99 USD. 
Do yourself a favor, though, and spend the extra dollar to get the deluxe edition with the soundtrack.

Bits & Bobs
-----------------
This is just a section for various thoughts that don't really reflect any of the ratings.
~ I know that they were emulating the style of Link's Awakening by using the two button format for your items, but it was kind of annoying to pop open the menu to equip healing items, heal real quick and then go back to the menu to re-equip whatever else you had. Especially in areas where you have to use your lantern to see and need your weapon to attack. Felt a bit too frantic, but that's just a nitpick.",1483996808,1483997235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Insofar as it goes, it does what it sets out to do well, but it's short, and you'll have every item you're going to get by half-way through, with the last three dungeons free of any items. The bosses are the best thing about it, the dungeons only have three or so unique enemies each, and can become a slog - though I do like the switch puzzles. The items are a lantern, a bow, a sword, a pick that basically works like a sword and is only ever used in one dungeon, and a shield, plus healing items. Besides the pick being necessary to fight one boss, and to open up the entrance to the dungeon, none of these are ever used for any purpose besides the obvious ones. Indeed, after doing a trial where the crossbow hits targets, it's never used for anything but attacking again.

The game system is good, and it plays well, but I'd hold off for this group's second game.

1. Story was vague and almost boring
2. Only 3-4 hours gameplay
3. Not a variety of weapons

Comments: 
I like the gameplay but it is not a very long game. I think that the creator of the game could have added more a variety of weapons to make the game more interesting and allowing more difficult puzzles. The story was a bit vague and could have used more characters.

A ghost haunts a lighthouse. The ghost causes storms to ravage the island, thus ships can no longer travel to and fro.

I am prone to getting the ""Zelda itch"" for top-down action-adventure games with atmospheric dungeons, challenging puzzles, memorable characters, engaging story, and -- maybe most importantly -- secrets and treasures. Playing ""Shipwreck"" has left that itch virtually unscratched.

I hate to be too hard on ""Shipwreck"", though. The developer -- Brushfire Games out of Seattle-- is obviously a small independent operation, and I am sure they put tons of love into their product. There is a lot of effort on display here, but not enough for me to recommend this game.

Controls for ""Shipwreck"" are pretty responsive and intuitive, and I dig some of the soundtrack. However, spritework, story, writing, environments, goals, and that ever-elusive ""game feel"" just don't cut it.

I was unable to feel immersed while playing ""Shipwreck"", which is disappointing, as it is in the same style as some of my favorite games. Perhaps I have been spoiled by similar titles from producers with bigger budgets and greater pools of creativity and experience, but I still think ""Shipwreck"" walks an awkward line of wanting to experiment while trying to pay homage to its predecessors.

""Shipwreck"" is certainly not worthless and is far from junk. I think there is a lot to learn -- for both Brushfire and other aspiring game designers -- by playing this game, dissecting it, and reflecting upon it. If you have the time and means to play ""Shipwreck"" and are interested in making games, I recommend you do so. I also think this game could be rewarding to new and younger players. However, if you are an experienced gamer looking to lose yourself in an exciting new world, you may want to steer clear of ""Shipwreck's"" unpolished and sometimes choppy waters.

There are not many games on Steam like ""Shipwreck"" that I would recommend. One exception, however, is ""Anodyne"", another game that is not perfect but was, to me, shockingly immersive. Off of Steam, ""Link's Awakening"" would be my go-to, and is most likely what inspired ""Shipwreck"".",1459803498,1459803498,False,7,1,0.546402513980865479,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don’t throw out that comparison easily, as that’s one of the best handheld titles ever made, but the game is clearly heavily inspired by this in terms of setting, story and gameplay. 
I feel I have to downplay the expectations when I drop a name like that, as it’s not as perfect as a Nintendo game - but what can you expect from a game made by two brothers. 

It follows the protagonist as she tries to uncover what is haunting the island she stranded on, and in a true Zelda-like fashion you crawl through a number of increasingly difficult dungeons to gather the Seals of Elements needed to unlock the final ‘castle’. 

Again, as it’s heavily inspired by the earlier Zelda games, I have very little to complain in general. The dungeons are varied and very well designed, accompanied by a nice soundtrack for each of them. The puzzles aren’t very challenging, and while some of the bosses are hard as nails the others fail to test you in any way. 
This doesn’t really hurt the game though. The only thing that does affect the game negatively are the sluggish controls, which you may not even notice until you reach one of the aforementioned harder bosses. All in all it’s good game with some flaws that can be forgiven considering how powerfully nostalgic it is as a whole. 

Tldr: If you’ve been looking for a Zelda clone on Steam, look no further.

+ Great level design
+ Catchy soundtrack

As much as Shipwreck desperately wants to be Link's Awakening, it mostly accomplishes highlighting how brilliantly that game (and the similar A Link to the Past) was designed by doing everything markedly worse. 

The first and most prominent issue is that the hit detection simply doesn't work. I've stood next to an arrow trap and been hit by alternating arrows despite not moving and the arrows all theoretically hitting the same spot. I've been hit through my shield. I've been hit by a boss that wasn't even close to me. These issues are compounded by a combat system that gives enemies entirely too many invincibility frames and sometimes no interrupt/knockback at all. The fact the devs give out on-use healing items so frequently and cheaply suggests to me that they knew the combat was fundamentally flawed and opted to work around it by effectively increasing player health by as much as 30 hearts rather than attempting to fix it. 

Next, the game world is over-designed. There are loads of screens that serve no purpose whatsoever except to pad out the overworld, town, or dungeon they're part of. Some of these screens don't even have anything to interact with - they're literally just time-wasters. The game's characters were designed in a similar fashion. There are [i]loads[/i] of NPCs, even compared to the far larger Link's Awakening, but many are recolored versions of eachother (even important ones!), none have any character, and almost none even have unique dialogue. Almost all of the NPCs will say the same few lines if you talk to them enough times, one of which is along the lines of ""There's not much to talk about on such a small island."" It's true, but if the devs knew that, why did they make 30 different characters to talk about it?

Next, and somewhat confusingly, the game is also under-designed where it matters. The dungeon puzzles aren't interesting or difficult. There's no Big Key equivalent and maps are missable, so you may unknowingly walk into the boss room for the biggest anti-climax ever. Houses feature no interactive items and are almost always empty. Items that are [i]always[/i] interactive in games, like gravestones, aren't. The world feels like a rough draft of a Zelda-like based on a second-hand account of Link's Awakening rather than an attempt to recreate the character or detail of those games. 

Finally, some minor complaints: Moving diagonally (needed for shield usage) is unreliable with a gamepad. The soundtrack is largely inoffensive, but lacks combat music, meaning boss fights are occasionally done to gentle ocean music. The enemies are overwhelmingly clearly derived from existing Zelda enemies. The game inherits Zelda's issues with meaningless money - there's nothing to buy except bow ammo and healing items. 

Shipwreck would be a perfectly functional game in a hypothetical world where Zelda or other imitators like Anodyne and Ittle Dew didn't exist, but unfortunately for it, they do. If you've played those games, Shipwreck will likely be as disappointing for you as it was for me. If you haven't, I'd strongly recommend doing so instead of playing this. I can only really recommend Shipwreck if you're desperate for a new Zelda-like and you're choosing between it, broken games, or flash games. It's not a particularly bad game in the grand scheme of things, but it commits the cardinal sin of being a below-average game in a crowded genre absolutely loaded with better options.

The overworld has a really nice tune but its empty, literally 0 (zero) monsters and its just a poor maze with dead ends that feels like its been like this to stretch the game lenght and tbh feels insulting for the gamer.
The dungeons are themed but are boring with boring puzzles (if you call them puzzles) and every single enemy, except the bosses, dies in 2 hits. The only challenge is the that the enemies are untouchable for one second after each hit, only then they will hit you because they lack any AI to be challenging, they never attack you directly.
 The bosses have paterns but they are really easy and beating them gives zero satisfaction.
 The game showers you with useless coins that can be used in the only shop of the game for food to replenish your HP and arrows, but you find plenty of those inside the dungeons.
The story is barely there and there are absolutely zero interesting characters.
Furthermore the game lacks any secrets or collectibles, there are 7 heart containers to find that are incredible easy to find and 2 minigames that offer a time trial, but once you complete them you will never want to play again.
The 8-bit graphics sometimes feel ok and other times feel soulless. Their point is to mimic the classic gameboy zelda games and they achieve that, offering that retro feeling and nostalgia.
The only decent part of the game is the music that offers a couple good tunes, the overworld music is actually pretty good.

Strangely, while the game is the definition of boring, i did not had a bad time, mainly because i bought it to ""scratch that itch"", but it barely scratched it.

Legend of Zelda is, at its heart, about puzzles and exploration. This game is pretty much just about action. And what works for an action-puzzler doesn't work for a nearly pure action game.

The combat is fairly bland, run up and swing your sword. Being able to shield-bash enemies is sort of interesting, but overall it doesn't do much new. There are other weapons as well, but I admittedly lost interest towards the end of the first 'real' dungeon.

The puzzles are... well, honestly, they feel tacked on. They're mostly of the 'step on this switch, open that door' variety.

The exploration is non-existent. Oh, sure, you can go off the path, but you just wind up on a completely empty and useless screen. The game feels like it punishes exploration rather than rewarding it.

Overall:

Graphics: 9/10. Probably the only really good thing about this game.

Music: 6/10. Not really good, not really bad. This might be skewed down a bit due to me playing this game very shortly after finishing Undertale.

Story: 4/10. It's an excuse plot. Not the worst I've ever heard, but not the best either.

World: 0/10. Full of empty screens, and almost all of NPCs draw from the same dialogue pool. Even the NPCs that don't do so have very little personality. Makes it feel like talking to anyone or going anywhere is a waste of time. If the devs were going to do this, they might as well have just put all the dungeons directly adjacent to the town and made the NPCs unresponsive.

Gameplay (Action): 6/10. Decent, nothing to really write home about. The combat is basically identical to the old 2D Zelda games, except your shield and boomerang are fused together. Killing enemies is basically mindless busywork. The first boss was okay, the second boss is basically a more frustrating version of Moldorm that takes up an eighth of the screen and summons minions.

Gameplay (Puzzle): 2/10. The puzzles just aren't good and leave almost no impression.

Gameplay (Exploration): -3/10. Yes, negative three. The game passively punishes you for trying to explore by presenting you with empty dead ends and backtracking. The worst part is, there actually are two health-ups discovered by exploring. They're inside peoples' houses, but give the impression that maybe if you go down enough dead-ends you'll eventually find something interesting.

---

Overall: 2/10

A quick note:

As I mentioned once or twice, I have not completed this game. Maybe it gets better towards the end, I wouldn't really know. However, I doubt the improvement is enough to warrant playing through the beginning of the game.


Some comments for the devs:

Don't be disheartened by this review. While I didn't like the game, it was well programmed and fairly well put together. It's clear that you guys are passionate about games, and even if this game wasn't great, it shows potential. It just maybe needed to be cooked a little longer before being pulled out of the oven. If you're looking to make a game like this in the future, here's some observations I've made about where I feel this game fell short and how to fix it (which is admittedly subjective, but no harm in mentioning it):

1. The most obvious issue is the lack of point to exploration. If you give a player an option to go somewhere, there should be something in that place, even if it's just an NPC saying 'why are you on the roof of my house?'. You clearly have a talent for good looking graphics; even including some interesting landmarks could be good. If I wander down a side-path and come to a dead end, my reaction would be a lot better if that dead end is the edge of a canyon looking down into a rushing ravine than if it's just a wall of the same trees that are everywhere else. That strategy tends to work better in 3D games than in 2D games, however, and I admit to still being frustrated upon going north from the village due to not being able to interact with the headstones or enter the windmill (mostly since I didn't know it was and wasn't expecting it to be the final dungeon). Honestly, the bit about the windmill could have been solved by putting a visible lock on the door, which would change it from an annoyance to an objective. In general, expect that a player will try to interact with anything that looks unusual, and will always go in every single direction except towards the main quest until there's no other option. If there's a way to leave the road, you can't just make the road pretty and ignore the places off the path.

2. The second most obvious issue is the NPCs. Generally speaking, it's better to create individual dialogues for each separate NPC. I'm not trying to be condescending, there are reasons to program global dialogue pools like the ones in your game. However, dialogue pools like that are generally more of use if you have NPCs that might spout off a single line of dialogue on their own before walking away, or situations where NPCs are chatting with each other in the background. Random pedestrians, in other words. For situations where the NPCs stay in one place, giving them even one line of unique dialogue would make them feel less generic than drawing from a universal pool.

3. With regard to the puzzles being bland, I again admit that I didn't get very far, and that the later puzzles might be better. The shield doesn't really seem to lend itself as much to puzzling as the boomerang from Legend of Zelda does, but that itself might be a reason to do things a bit differently. If you're trying to make a Legend of Zelda style game, all required items should generally have a use in the puzzles. The player will want to play with their new toys, and if they don't do anything beyond granting an advantage in combat, it makes them less interesting.

4. The story honestly is probably fine. It's an excuse plot, and nobody really expects an excuse plot to be great. It would be nice if the antagonist actively tried to prevent you from progressing somehow though.

5. A bit more enemy variety would be good. The first dungeon had one enemy type, the second dungeon had two. Not really that high a priority, but it might be nice.

I am genuinely looking forward to seeing what you're next game is, for what it's worth. You guys do seem to pay attention to feedback over on the game's forums, so I imagine that your next game will be a bit less empty.",1444605421,1444605690,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1. This game has great music that fits the mood from fighting bosses to exploring the village. Well done!

2. It's a fun adventure that is challenging but at the same time fun to play. Finding that balance is hard and i commend the developers for achieving that.

Now for the not so great.

1. Great games MAKE you care about the characters and the story. Unfortunately this game fails to provide any background on any of the characters (including the main hero and the antagonist). This makes for a game with no purpose. Since the game is also very short (took me 3.5 hours with all achievements), it makes you feel kind of empty watching the end credits. I thought to myself ""that was it? What did i accomplish? What was the point?""

2. Another downfall of this game is that it has ZERO replay value. Since i beat it and got all the achievements there is no reason for me to ever play this game again. There is no challenge mode or time-trials or anything to make you want to go back and visit this game again. So you are going to spend 3 dollars on a game that you will only get 3.5 hours out of....period. 

I think that the developers could think about some of these things when making their next game. A good story with characters that you get to know can change an ok game to a great game! Some form of replay value also makes gamers very happy. I would reccomend a game like that for sure.

While a spawn of a genre pretty much defined by Legend of Zelda games (specifically NES and Gameboy versions), Shipwreck left me with a feeling of barely positive ""meh"". Let's get down to details.

In the beginning of the story there is a shipwreck that leaves everyone else but the protagonist dead or missing. It is a stormy night. You find yourself stranded on a beach and as the luck would have it, there's also a sword on the shore near you. You can swing it at a wide angle to attack monsters or bushes. Curiously but traditionally, both are filled with money and apples.

Moving, sword swinging and other item use is easy enough, even familiar if you have played other similar titles like the aforementioned top-down Zelda games. You've got only two slots for items, presumably because you have two hands and the interface has space for pretty much only two items at the time because of the art style. Considering that particularly in some boss fights, albeit also in some dungeons, you need to juggle three or four items in short succession, the limit of two items is rather inconvenient.

Continuing the story, after wandering around the beach for several uneventful screens you finally find yourself in a cave, a dungeon. The dungeons are by far the best part of the game: there are monsters, traps, locked doors and even some nice puzzles. If you are a completionist, you generally need to solve the puzzles to acquire all big hearts that increase your maximum health.

In later dungeons, the puzzles become mandatory, and this effectively makes those dungeons the best (especially the sand dungeon and the lighthouse). You can be stuck for a short while when pondering where to go, only to notice that you can fall to an unvisited room by jumping down a hole on a higher floor. Rooms could be dark requiring you to carry a lantern (in my concern the only valid reason for having mere two slots for items) to see around and some walls or boulders can be smashed broken with a pickaxe. Bow is used regrettably little being useful only in one or two boss fights.

Speaking of which, every dungeon has a boss fight of varying difficulty. Some are ridiculously easy, like the first crab boss (admittedly the first one should be easy) and the worm boss that just goes in circles and you can beat him without much resistance. Others are way more difficult and require you to study their attack and defense patterns closely. I especially liked the rock and slime bosses, the rock guy actually managing to kill me twice.

Monsters are only found in the dungeons. There are only few different ones and all of them die by swinging them twice - exactly twice. Sure, the slimeblobs split into smaller slimeblobs, but every slimeblob dies with two strikes regardless of their size. Same is true of every snake, ghost, spider and bat you see. Consistency might be the key but it's peculiar with monster healths. Monsters being rather boring it's a good thing that they actually stay dead after killing them, even if you leave the dungeon.

The cool twist of Shipwreck is that you can only heal (in addition to staying at the inn) by eating apples (and the occasional bread) that are found lying around in bushes and carried by monsters. Before the boss fights it is a good idea to stockpile food for additional health. Unfortunately, as money is found basically everywhere and there is a shop for food, this renders health a trivial matter later on.

I spent a long time exploring the small world after the first dungeon. The storm was still going on, but the world was empty of any other activity: no enemies, no people, basically nothing happening anywhere. When the storm finally ended, the town sprang to life (of motionless villagers but at least they talk to you) but there was still nothing going on in the wilderness. The wilderness is really an untapped opportunity for exploration and monster whacking for the developers. Just a couple of farm houses and a cemetery (where nothing exciting happens, as realistic as that is) doesn't really cut it.

In Link's Awakening you wanted to escape the island, and Shipwreck snatches basically the same storyline in that respect. There's a big bad boss that stands in your way but has hidden in the most inaccessible place possible: lighthouse is locked by four magical seals for some nefarious reason. In the case of Shipwreck though, let's just say that I was refreshingly disappointed that sometimes the bad guy is just the bad guy. With no special twist of any kind, I was nevertheless [i]mostly[/i] disappointed, even though the boss was rather difficult and for once I almost ran out of food.

Lasting only 4 hours (even 2 hours for the faster players), I can tell that it's worth its cheap price. To me it was not a very special experience, but it was not all bad either, so I would score it as something between mediocre and decent. It might help with your Zelda itch but afterwards you'd need to fire up your old console anyway.",1439426156,1439426156,True,6,1,0.573275864124298096,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros
  •The music is very nice and like the rest of this game borrows heavily from Legend of Zelda (not a bad thing)
Cons
  •All sprites are comprised of the same size boxes so even if you see a clear path between objects you can't go through it and you will constantly find yourself getting hung up on the invisible square that the sprites occupy
  •Tall sprites (trees, houses, anything taller than ground level) are set so that you cannot walk behind the second level of the sprite.  If you are going to do this why not just have only single level sprites as proportion clearly wasn't a concern
  •Pickaxe swings from the right while facing three directions and from the left while facing to the right which seems like someone just didn't want to animate this the correct way
  •Personal preference but the attacks have no impact to them and either it was subtle or non-existant because I can't recall an impact sound effect again the enemies
  •The controls don't know if they want to be NES/Gameboy or something else.  I have no problem with an older control style to go along with the retro graphics (Oniken did this and the controls were great) but when you have three buttons and the start button mapped out why not just let us map an item to every button, or have a dedicated healing item button so we aren't constantly jumping into the item menu and out of the game?

I wouldn't ultimately recommend this game unless you got it for super cheap and wanted to get a game to easily up your perfect games and completion %. Here's a few good things and mostly bad things:

Good
- Easy Perfect Game: The game will take you down all the necessary paths to get every single achievement and I got all of them fairly easily, with maybe only 2 dungeons giving me a little trouble on getting the extra hearts.
- Music: The music isn't extravagant by any means, but it is charming. Every place will have its own music and though it's composed very simplistically, it fits the game well. I actually would rather have the soundtrack than the game.
- Short: Can be beat in a reasonable amount of time. It took me about 3 hours, while it may take some a bit less or a bit longer, but you don't have to be too committed to this game to beat it, so it helps your overall perfect games and completion %.

Bad
- Story doesn't really matter: I found myself not really caring about the story. I don't think they ever gave the main hero a name and the gender is neutral. It could be a dude with a ponytail or a girl with a ponytail, you never really know. Either way, though it's only a $2 game, the story is pretty much non-existant and therefore, the game is just not worth investing your interest in.
- Overworld is barren: The devs must have focused all of their time into the dungeons for this game. While there is terrain in the overworld while you're walking around, there are absolutely no enemies. Just bushes that you can slice to try to find items and occasional butterflies that did nothing to deserve the deaths that I so swiftly gave them. Anyway, it makes running around the world uninteresting and tedious.
- Enemies: All enemies are pretty predictable and don't have much to them. The monsters during the dungeons all die in 2 hits from pretty much anything, but even the bosses are extremely predictable. They don't have much variety to their move set. It's easy to never die in this game, but also makes all these encounters extremely boring.
- Items: Most of the items in this game are pretty non-rewarding. I found myself using pretty much only the sword, bow, and shield. Everything else is kind of just there as an excuse to add content to the game.

I don't want to say this is a terrible game, because it at least gave me something to do for a few hours, but the bottom line is that I just didn't care about the story, characters, the mission, etc. Not because i'm complacent, but because the game seems like it doesn't care either. Get your shit done and get out of the game is the sort of rushed feeling I got from it.",1435487728,1435487728,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game has some decently catchy music, The island theme reminds me of the main theme from Dark Cloud, the PS2 game? THAT GAME WAS AWESOME! But we aren't talking about Darkcloud. The Bosses of each Dungeon are pretty easy except for the last boss who can be a bother, the other bosses are basically "" Hit him enough times and boom you win"" almost no strategy but there is slight strategy. Another problem I have is the pre hit invincibility for ENEMIES, Yes, you hit an enemy and you have to wait about a second to be able to hit them again, I have backed a bat into a corner, hit it, tried to hit it again quickly and it goes through my sword and it hits me once, thankfully however, the game counters this with oversaturation of health items (Apples). There is barely any secrets in this game, getting the ""Big hearts"" (Heart containers...cmon...that's basically what they are xD ) are very simple to get in dungeons, getting health items is a breeze, and the enemies are not a problem unless there are many but your sword swing is rather large, in fact, if you are standing at the edge of a tile (A game pixel tile) Then your sword can reach two tiles of the game space, basically, hug a bush with another bush behind it, swing your sword and you hit the bush in front of you and the bush behind that bush. All in all with this, the dungeon I had most fun with is the last two dungeons, the desert dungeon and the lighthouse. So is the game worth 3 bucks? I think...yeah, A dumbed down zelda game? of course! It's a bit boring, but it has it's moments, Some of the dialoge is a bit sixth grader-ish, the bosses are pretty easy, the puzzles I wouldn't call puzzles except for a couple of them, and the story is short, I mean, I beat this game in like, a few hours, WITH a 100% rating. Easy achievements, decent game, I wouldn't be surprised if this was someone's first attempt at making a game, it's not terrible, it's just....Simple, Thats the best word I can use to describe it, the game is VERY simple, it will keep you busy for a few hours until you beat it, and that includes collecting the ""Big Hearts"" and stuff, my serious main complaint, NO MONSTERS OUTSIDE OF DUNGEONS! The topside of the island is barren of enemies to kill. So is the game worth 3 bucks? Yes, you get what you payed for, a short and sweet game, nothing complicated, nothing over the top, SLIGHTLY boring, but it kept me interested for a short while and that is what it was set out to do, and I like that. So I recommend this because this game knows what it is, a Zelda clone that is stripped to the most basic level, and it's short, the end. Worth the money for a quick play.

The game features 6 dungeons total, each of which has puzzles, keys, and a boss. Items include a bow, sword, shield, and healing items. The game is developed primarily by two brothers and it shows as a labour of love; this is the kind of independent PC game that was being made before Steam became a big thing. At $2-3, the game is priced to reflect the short length. I don't think it's going to displace any of the Zelda games in the pantheon of gaming greatness, but it's a fun little game with a lot of charm and some enjoyable puzzling. I had a great time and ran through the game in one sitting. If short, simple, and sweet is what you're looking for, I think Shipwreck is worth a look.

Game has achievements and trading cards, although Steam recently changed trading cards so that they don't drop until 2 hours of play so you might not get any unless you take your time or idle the game afterwards.

Edit: One other thing worth mentioning. The music, while a little repetitive, has the feel of the late 90s-early 2000s PC tracking scene (.mod, .s3m electronic music).

As others have stated, this is VERY similar to Link's Awakening (LA) in various elements of the game.  While it doesn't have the 2D platformer that LA did, it has a similar menu system with the ability to swap out what item is on what button.  Throw in the usual ""explore these dungeons, get these items, and unseal the final area with them"" you've got a nice little Zelda clone here.

It feels like the game is a bit lacking in some areas.  What I mean is, the inventory has some open spaces even AFTER I got everything.  I'm not sure what that's about.  The overworld feels empty as there are no mobs to fight.  This is both good and bad as sometimes it does get annoying to fight things in the overworld, but at the same time it just feels too empty without them.  Still, the fights and puzzles in the dungeons were rather enjoyable and weren't hard at all to figure out.

Steam says I have 2.8 hours spent in game.  I actually completed it 100% in about 2.4ish (see my screenshots, heh).  The rest of the time was just waiting around for the card drops.

If you're one that likes to equate hours to money spent to see if the game is ""worth it"" (I can see the logic in it myself), then I'd advise to wait for a sale.

It's short. Really, really, really, really short. You can get 100% in less than 2 hours.

Graphics and screen size are built to be remeniscent of a Game Boy Zelda, but the high-quality sound effects and music clash with the 8-bit graphics.

Overworld is just a big empty maze with no enemies, no secrets, and no interesting puzzles. It's just a bunch of shrubs and dead-ends, like the developers simply forgot to add monsters, or decided there was no point.

Swordplay is painfully awkward, and enemies don't make a satisfying ""crunch"" sound when they take damage or die.

Dungeon puzzles amount to nothing more than ""You have to go through hallway X before you go through hallway Y."" There are only about six types of enemies to fight in the entire game, including bats with the most irritating flight patterns I have ever seen in any Zelda-like.

There's practically no story. No unsettling themes, no NPCs who tell you anything relevant, no huge conspiracy or plot twist. The bad guy is exactly who everyone says he is, and you kill defeat him to stop the storms and sail off the island just like everyone tells you to. The game makes no effort to hide the fact that you're just going through the standard motions of a Zelda game, but with none of the parts that make it fascinating or addicting, like using new items to solve puzzles or finding secret areas.

Any positives? Well, a few. In this game, instead of enemies dropping hearts, they drop apples, which you can collect and eat later when you need them. Alternately you can buy bread from the shop which heals four hearts at once. I thought that was very good idea.

The desert dungeon was a total blast. It was huge, had great atmosphere, and had some actual puzzles. It was the only time when the game felt like it was reaching its full potential. The Lighthouse was a bit annoying, but it was also a very well-designed and challenging final dungeon.

The soundtrack feels too overproduced to fit in a retro Zelda game. Nevertheless, it's quite pleasant to listen to.

Overall, I give this game a giant ""Meh."" It's not terrible, it just felt uninspired and pointless. Achievement hunters looking for an easy 100% should get this game. People looking for a homage to [i]Link's Awakening[/i] should get this game, only if they're willing to lower their expectations to the absolute minimum.

You can see my playtime above which is how much time I needed to complete the game, although there is a little bit more you can collect.

I believe the game could use a little more enemy variety in dungeons, there isn't a large amount of basic enemies in the game, and none in the overworld, making overworld traveling a bit boring.

Shipwreck non deve essere considerato un vero e proprio gioco, ma piuttosto la volontà di un team di sviluppo giovanissimo di farsi le ossa e di lanciarsi sul campo, con una produzione che tributa uno dei più grandi classici della storia dei videogame. Il gioco è semplicissimo, breve, estremamente grezzo e privo di rifiniture, dunque se siete alla ricerca di un prodotto realmente simile a The Legend of Zelda il nostro consiglio è di cercare altrove.

	This classical style RPG brings back some of my best gaming memories. From classic Zelda to Dragon Warrior this style just never gets old. That being said this is defiantly no Zelda, but it has quite the charm. 
	
	From the 1st moment I died, fighting the 1st boss, my attention had been captivated. Parts of the game are difficult, but not too frustrating. The music is outstanding. Story is better than most. (sadly)  Graphics could use a little work. But all in all a great game, especially for $3.

In saying that though, the game is lovely with beautiful pixel art and nice music (although a little annoying).

And actually it's pretty good at it, though sadly not in every aspect.
The game itself is pretty simple: Shipwrecked on an island that has troubles with the frequent storms. You'll need to defeat the entity that causes this by collecting 4 special seals.  Each seal is in a dungeon with different biome, with unique bosses.  (There are 6 dungeons - 1 tutorial, 4 seals + final boss' dungeon) The dungeons are pretty good - enemies are different, there are some nice traps, and a puzzle here and there. Sadly the enemies doesn't respawn at all, so in my opinion this turns the dungeons a little too easy. Bosses are also varied, for example the guardian of Earth Seal gave me a really hard time (wanted to kill it without using healing food)   Speaking of food, you'll get LOTS of gold in the game, and in my opinion you will only want to buy food, maybe a few arrows - so if the game is hard for you, you can simply stack up with food between dungeons making fights and dungeon-lurking easier.
 I mentioned arrows (maybe bolts, as you'll use a crossbow): you'll need to complete a minigame to prove you're good enough at fighting to use the crossbow. It's a really nice idea! Sadly this is the single minigame or activity you can do between dungeons - the world is utterly empty on the surface. Trees, bushes (smack them for possible loot!) and butterfies. 
The slight negatives of the game:
[list]
  [*]It's quite short ( Please don't look at my time, I was idling a lot while playing it) - I'm sure it can be completed to 100% in less than 5 hours
  [*]It's lacking content and ""life"" in surroundings - feels like the whole island's purpose is only to get the seals (no roaming enemy, just empty desert/forest/rocky parts on map)
[/list]
But don't forget it's positives:
[list]
  [*]Nice, atmospheric retro graphics
  [*]Nice music, different for biomes/locations
  [*]Some nice puzzles (could be a little harder though, IMO)
  [*] Easy to 100% if you're into that
  [*] Great price: 3$ at full price - I think it will be around 1$ on sales.

It's a fun experience. Basically, your ship gets wrecked on this island, so you need another to leave. You adventure to get one, but the only way to do so is to use the one ship on the island once the mayor allows it. So you end up having to help the mayor solve the island's problem. A ghost showed up recently, locked itself away in the island's lighthouse, and has been causing storms which disrupt the people's way of life. You must stop this evil ghost. To open the lighthouse, you need to obtain four seals, each in their own dungeon protected by monsters. Typical adventure stuff. Go to the dungeons, get new items, use the items to complete the dungeons and fight the bosses. Get the seals. Do the final dungeon, beat the final boss, and win the game. Also, you more than likely will be able to get all the achievements just by playing normally, which is good if you care about getting achievements I suppose. The music is alright. The retro style is nice if you're into that. And you get to run around hitting things with a sword. What can I say? It's fun. However, I feel this game has some rough downsides. While it's clearly inspired by Zelda games, it seems to lack a lot of what makes Zelda games so entertaining. 

There's not much story in Shipwreck, instead just surviving on a main plot. That's fine by me, but some people will see this as a point of disconnect. My point of disconnect was moreso from the fact that there's a distinct lack of characterization. The main character has no personality or lines, but that's because it's YOU. The part that bugs me is that none of the people in the game have any real personality. Everyone is rather bland and most of the townspeople will say nothing of consequence to your journey or the world building. It makes them feel very forgettable and doesn't motivate you to help them. All the villain does is cause storms, so there's not a lot there to make you really hate them or understand them as a villain, which is sad for the main villain of the game. So your only real motivation to beat this villain is to leave the island and beat the game. Kind of a weak motivator. 

Another strange thing is the overworld. Zelda games have overworlds, but... they have things in them for you to do. In Shipwreck, there are a decent number of screens on the overworld to explore, but there's no point in exploring those extra screens. There are no enemies to fight in the overworld. No secrets to find. I believe there are one or two houses to enter. One has an item you'll need, the other might just have some treasure. But there's a desert, a swamp, a forest, even a graveyard in the overworld that are all empty. There are dungeons in four of the areas, a town in the center, and the final lighthouse to the North. That's it. The areas leading to the dungeons are just small mazes. I can understand this being cool for one, possibly two areas. But all four? It feels a little bit like padding. Why not put some enemies in here? Thow in some puzzles or terrain I need my new item from the previous dungeon to overcome. Something more than just a change of scenery would've been greatly appreciated and give the overworld more purpose. 

The dungeons aren't too bad. I just can't help but feel like the dungeon bosses could've been cooler. Maybe that's just me. The puzzles in dungeons were also a bit lacking. There could've been more or just trickier ones that required more thought. Still, I will admit the dungeons were probably the best part of the game. I think having more items would've opened up a lot more possibilities here. You can equip any two items at a time, but there are three empty item slots. I can't imagine why. Perhaps I've missed something, but it just feels like there was supposed to be more items than what we ended up with. Plus, none of the items were that creative. Sword and shield are basic. So is a bow. Having two slots for healing items, one for each specific one, is a bit silly since this is the only way to heal on the go. I like that you keep all the health you pick up because of this, but switching to the healing item every time can get tedious. And the pickaxe is probably the saddest item because, while it's cool for the dungeon you get it for, it serves no putpose outside of that. Why wasn't breaking rocks to get to new areas or breaking walls in other places part of the gameplay? Why was the pickaxe a one and done dungeon item? It just seems like such a missed opportunity. Also, while I liked the retro look, I wasn't too fond of some of the art and color choices, but that's not a big deal.

Overall, Shipwreck is a cool little game. It just could've been so much more. There's lots of good ideas here, but they need to be explored. The adventuring in this game isn't much, even though the gameplay that IS there is solid. It is also fairly short, as I beat it in one sitting.  It's only three bucks at full price. I'd say that, if you're a Zelda fan, or want to get into Zelda games without the stress of learning all the references or paying full game prices... this is a good start. But if you're a Zelda fan... don't come into this expecting Link's Awakening 2. It takes the basics of Zelda games and cuts to the chase, sacrificing most of the charm. If it was more expensive I wouldn't recommend it, but it's not bad for the price. If you're looking to test out Zelda basics, or if you're already a big Zelda fan, you'll probably appreciate this game. Otherwise it might just be too bland for your taste. Make a sequel expanding on these ideas and I'm sure I'd give it much more praise. I'm easily suckered into Zelda type games so make those improvements and you have a sale right here already.

3) Do you like Gameboy style Graphics and basic two slot Gameboy controls?
4) Do you mind games where the mechanics change per dungeon?
5) Are you missing your Hyrule dungeon fix for the week?

The music is pleasent and the gameplay is very Zelda-like. If you liked Link's Awakening and you have a couple bucks (on sale at time of writing) or 3ish bucks when it is full price then buy it.

The story is a tad simplistic like in the older Zelda's. NPC dialouge is a bit limited at time (Some of them will repeat stuff). But is overall fun. I do like the stun function of the sheild and there 2 time trial mini-games you that could give you some replay if you want to hone your skills. The game tracks progress and Play time which can be nice if you like speed-running.

Has a nice fullscreen mode that plays the game at it's native resolution but applies a ""Frame"" like the Pokemon GBA game used to when played in Stadium's emulator. A nice touch, especially if you want to record it in full screen without distortions and are too lazy to craft your own frame. X3

+ Gorgeous pixel art. The game never stops looking good.

- The item selection you're given throughout the game feels uninspired.

There could've been done a lot more with riddles involving clever use of your items.
- The overworld is maze-like, empty and boring. There are no enemies to fight, no secrets to discover, and on your search for the various dungeon entrances you'll often have to backtrack a couple of screens because you'll run into arbitrary dead ends with nothing in them.
- Combat has hitbox issues and as a result feels very rough and somewhat un-fun. The game often registers a hit on you when the enemy/projectile didn't even visually touch you, and some enemies (the small slimes are the most obvious offenders) will sometimes [i]not[/i] register as hit even if your sword clearly went through them.

[h1]I did not expect such an enjoyable and polished title for these two euros![/h1]

The game is reminiscent of, and rather consciously based on, the first Zelda - and it succeeds to the best of its ability.
The fights are very skillful and the subsequent bosses are based on different mechanics, which you need to learn, understand and use against them.
At the very beginning the game seems to be difficult and in fact the first boss already caused me a lot of problems and I think I was able to beat him only on the 6th attempt.

Pixel art graphics are decent, sounds - there is nothing to complain about here, either.

What more can you write about such a simple game - if you want to return to the times of Zelda, I can recommend it as much as possible, the game uses those solutions, adds an arcade combat system and quite a decent thistle.
It gets 7 stars

상점에서 도둑질 못 하는거랑, 피 채우는 방식이 살짝 다르다는 점, 그리고 함부로 건들다 험한 꼴 보는 닭 무리가 없다는 걸 제외하면 완전히 '젤다의 전설 ~꿈꾸는 섬~'이랑 똑같다. 딱 미니 게임기로 즐기기엔 최고의 게임. 짧은 게임, 알차고 재미있게 즐겨서 크게 할 말은 없긴 한데, 회복 수단인 베리/빵을 별도로 장비해서 사용하게 만든게 개인적으론 살짝 불편했다.

가격이 엄청 싸니 가볍게 사서 가볍게 즐기고 가볍게 끝낼 수 있는 게임. 도전과제도 상당히 쉬워서 더 Gooood!!!",1423885002,1423885002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Feels like zelda seasons and ages. I like the bgm used when you travel east of the mayor's house.
