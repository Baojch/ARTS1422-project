It's basically a third person endless runner, where you weave around obstacles as your ship speeds on and on.

Since the controls are simple (only left and right), it offers three options to control the ship - gamepad, head turn, or head movement.
You can't use the motion controllers, I guess because it was developed for mobile and before the Vive announced its motion controllers.

Personally I think the head controls are okay with this specific game, they make sense.
And surprisingly, there's no motion sickness at all, despite the high speed and third person camera. Even for first time VR users, it plays comfortably.

There are a few negatives: no motion controller support, and the levels are arranged in a strange order - it starts out difficult and then gets easier. Also each level has a colour scheme, but some of them are too monochromatic to offer proper depth perception.

PolyRunner is one of the earliest VR releases, and one of the first to showcase arcade-style flying. The ship can either be controlled with full head movement, head tilt movement, or even a gamepad. The goal is simple, to make it as far as possible without crashing in to the many obstacles, and the gameplay is split into various levels that are mostly monochromatic and duochromatic in nature. If you crash, however, it's all the way back to the beginning of the game.

While flying around the levels, dodging various obstacles or flying through them, there are three different types of circles to aim for; blue are strictly points, orange slow the ship down and give points, and green speed the ship up while also giving points. There are two difficulty modes, normal and hard, with the latter simply speeding up the gameplay. One major flaw is that the ship is always somewhat off center of your vision, making it entirely possible that you will accidentally hit a structure due to this mechanic offset. Likewise, you're unable to fly the ship up or down, and therefore it's hard to determine if you'll crash against the ground in some areas.

Another issue is the infamous ""screen door effect"" that's prevelant throughout the game. While the colors are vibrant, the graphics are simple; made out of mostly harsh polygonal shapes, thus the name of the game. Being an early title, this is mostly forgivable, but it does take away a lot from the gameplay. From the free arcade-style flying games, PolyRunner is probably the best that you'll find, despite the fact that it doesn't have global leaderboards.

I agree with the people that mentioned the first level (and some others) are all the same color. That doesn't work very well, and more importatntly looks bland. Maybe if there was a bit more contrast, tone differences, or light rays, or something it would be less bland. Also, getting clipped by the ground sucks. Big pillars, or moving things?

Poly Runner VR is a simple game, an endless flyer where you simply move left or right. Hit one object and you're restarting, go through a ring and you get a bonus.

There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of depth to this game so the amount of time I've put into it is probably about right.  Have you ever played ""Race the Sun""?  If so, this game feels a lot like that, except there's no slowing down because you ran out of power.

You start out with a space ship in front of you flying low over some random brown terrain.  Nothing too visually stimulating here...the most colorful thing you'll see are the blue bonus rings you fly through for extra points or the green bonus rings that also speed your ship up for a limited time.

As you progress through the game, objects start to get thrust upward (and removed back downward) at regular intervals so that your ship is in a bit more danger than before.  After you get past that, you fly through a tunnel and come out to a new world with a new color to the landscape (but still fairly monochrome).

The idea of the game is to go for as long as possible through all these obstacles while also grabbing bonuses and speed boosts for more points.  Control methods are: looking (as you look left, your ship increasingly flies left, and as you look right the ship increasingly flies right), tilt (looking forward but tilting your head to the left makes the ship fly left, and tilting your head right makes your ship fly right), and gamepad (use a steam controller or Xbox 360 controller to fly).

All three methods work well, but if you're the suicidal type who wants to be able to fly forward and look left or right as the scenery flies past, you need the gamepad option to do that.  

Things I liked about this game: 
[list]
 [*] It's simple to get into
 [*] The learning curve is pretty gentle. You feel like every time you play you can break your old record.
 [*] Zero Motion sickness from sitting while moving...Probably because the motion is constant.
[/list]

Things I didn't like:
 [*] There's not a whole lot of variety.  Even ""Race the Sun"" had some extras like different ships, and some slightly different game modes.
 [*] it's pretty casual so while it's easy to pick up and play, it's also easy to put down and forget.
 [*] Controlling it by turning or tilting my head actually wears me out pretty fast. I guess I need to get used to neck excersize more?

A great game to get people into the world of vr without bringing them out of their comfort zone. I found the game to be fun and challenging at the same time. 
Some feedback I would give is that it's easy to cheat if you just start off going all the way to the side (left or right). Eventually, you will be outside the map and won't have to deal with obstacles. This should be taken care of. 
It also seemed to me that there wasn't too much of a difference between the easy and hard mode. Both seemed about the same level of difficulty. Maybe it was faster, I wasn't sure. However, they should have two different high scores instead of both going toward a mutual high score. 
Another thing is that it wasn't very intuitive how to play the game in the beginning. I wasn't sure if it was a tilt of the head or looking in that direction, so I did both (whatever seemed to work). It wasn't until after a while that I saw the menu and where to change it. They both seem very similar and that you kinda have to do one while doing the other.

The game has three control modes, two of which are stupid and one which is good if you play standing up. 

The first mode is ""look"", where you steer your ship by looking where you want it to go. This is the default, and is completely useless because turning your head to steer mean you can't see where you are going and will crash. The second mode is controlling with a gamepad (or the keyboard), which is boring. 

The third mode is ""Tilt"", where you steer by tilting your head (as opposed to turning it). This one is boring if you play it sitting down, but for some reason it becomes exhilarating if you play it standing up. Although you only need to tilt your head, I like to tilt my whole body as if I was on a skateboard. This gives you a fanstic feeling like you are riding a hoverboard over the landscape at 70 miles per hour; although it's a little weird seeing your ship in front of you, I think it helps you maintain a point of reference and keep from getting motion sick. 

Since it's free, I definitely recommend giving it a go in ""Tilt"" mode while standing up.",1461233446,1461233446,True,5,0,0.551378965377807617,0,False,False,False,False,,,
