Simple small arenas with little critters chasing you sometimes throwing bullets and whatnot. Has proper resolution options and Xbox360 pad support.

Ogni 10 c'è un checkpoint, ti danno una vita e una bomba (poco utile) e se si muore si può ricominciare liberamente da lì.

C'è un sistema di incremento della difficoltà basato sulle cinture delle arti marziali, che funziona così: si sceglie una cintura, si inizia il gioco da dove si vuole, ogni stanza superata aumenta del 5% il livello della cintura (che corrisponde all'intensità del gioco), arrivati a 100% si sblocca la cintura seguente. Se si muore però si perde un tot di percentuale, che alle cinture più alte è così tanta che si fa prima a ricominciare da capo.
È un sistema un po' intricato, e comunque poco interessante specialmente visto quanto il gioco è punitivo: si hanno 3 vite per cercare di arrivare al prossimo checkpoint, se si muore si ricomincia da quello prima. Il problema maggiore però è che le stanze sono così piccole che ad alte intensità è quasi impossibile muoversi, schivare i nemici e i colpi in uno spazio così ristretto, perciò le vite vanno via come niente. 

In ogni caso, ogni stanza porta via sì e no 30 secondi, non ci sono boss (solo nemici un po' più forti), i power-up durano letteralmente 5 secondi, e anche se si lascia giocare non vedo particolari ragioni per consigliarne l'acquisto.",1485110102,1485110143,False,2,0,0.510040163993835449,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And sure, looks wise even despite a couple of makeovers it looks sort of less inspirational now than it did in the early 2000's and we're in a post Geometry Wars world where everything subscribes to a similar sort of neon-particle explosion sort of thing and I like that, I really really like that but Mutant Storm looks like Mutant Storm and nothing else.

The gameplay seems, now, rather tame considering. It's not easy but there's a rigidity to the waves and patterns that compared to a lot of what we see now is very much more considered. And that's fine, absolutely fine because it still remains a very good little game of shooting things. And what's a game like this if not about shooting things, right? Right.

This is a top-down, twin-stick, shooter. You choose from 8 levels of difficulty in the form of different coloured belts then dive into as many 30-second levels as you wish. [i]Adventure[/i] mode is a last-as-long-as-you-can romp. First off, the game throws you into a very tight arena-type room with little space for manoeuvre and challenges you to clear it in thirty seconds. You get an ominous siren after 20 seconds to signal that an indestructible nasty will soon arrive. The actual challenge from room to room rises well. One death ends the level (in [i]Tally[/i] mode) making that 15 seconds delay to get back into the game seem VERY long. 

[u]--PRESENTATION & DESIGN--[/u]
Progress is displayed by showing which of the 89 rooms have been cleared and with which coloured belt. The game takes you to this screen every time you finish a room which is a great, at-a-glance progress system. The sound is ambient and tunnel-like. When entering a room you get that echoey industrial sound which adds a suitable edge to the game's atmosphere. Explosions and the deaths of enemies is satisfying especially those that require a number of hits to be dispatched. Rooms are lit with a Tron inspired neon-lighting theme.

[u]--CONCLUSION--[/u]
Like most twin-stick shooters this is not a game you'd normally play for long stretches. However, for a fifteen or twenty minute blast it's a great pick-up-and-play game. There is a bit of back and forth screen hopping when changing difficulty but no biggie. 

5/5
