Thev voxel graphics are quite nice, at first they felt a little amatuerish and low budget but grew on me.

I think the worst thing about the game is the sound. The effects are low quality and the music is royalty free, stock music which I don't think matches very well with the game at all. In fact the endless loops of it puts me off to the point of wanting to stop playing.

I think the developer was probably working on it by himself or with a few people, without much budget, hence the library stock music. I'd suggest getting a composer/sound engineer to redo the sound and music to create a better atmosphere.

However, minus the sound, this is a super addictive little game and for OCD people like myself, there are plenty of collectibles, secrets and stuff to unlock (similar system to doom again).",1464910186,1464910186,True,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+ Level layouts encourage exploration.
+ Cleared maps can be replayed with new weapons and upgrades in towe.
+ Level editor will probably result in newer and cooler maps hitting the web.
