My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This game is a puzzle platformer that was really lost when it came to the platforming part. None of the puzzles were particularly difficult but I found myself hating the controls in general.

The gimmick of traveling through time would get old if it wasn't executed so seamlessly but I still found the idea to get a bit samey. On the other hand I really did like the ability to stop time. It actually made me stop and think through a few of the puzzles. All in all, I can't recommend this game entirely because of the clunky stilted platforming.

This is middle of the road and to the point – not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer’s work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these – it is their life after all – this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy’s Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, “She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man’s tonsils!”.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score – perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It’s a flat stomach....sure it’s nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‘gaming rooms’.  The definitive ‘Meh’ - the middle ‘sideways thumb’ option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‘a’ or is it an ‘o’?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like – the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it’s like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who’s trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  Torso Teaser


The Review:  

It's simple but ok to pass a few hours.  Not a ringing endorsement I know, but if you want something stress free that requires just a half-dozing brain then this will do.  

Your sciencey-boffin type has the ability to change time from the past where everything works to the future (now) when everything is fubar.  He can also jump and go through doors to other levels/platforms.  Your snail sticks to walls and can be used as a platform in itself, and can also freeze time.  You can call the snail to you and it teleports itself by your side.  

This is it in a nutshell.  A puzzle platformer that isn't too challenging and something to waste a few hours on (super short but super cheap) that will you feeling, ""Eh, I've wasted time on worse.""

They aren't even neatly grouped into a single category or area; there are a lot of small problems that invade what could have been a pleasant little puzzle platformer and leave it feeling anemic.

-There is about a third of a second delay every time you jump or fall from any height. While not long enough to actually be irritating, it is mildly annoying and feels out of place. It hurts to say this about something that I know required extra effort to animate, but the reality of the situation is that I feel like this adds no additional value to the game and only serves to make every instance of vertical movement just a bit less pleasant.

-The story makes absolutely no sense, but lacks any aspects of satire, lampoon, or comedy. It's implied that we should be taking the apocalypse seriously, but there simply aren't enough details given about the characters or setting to grow any real attachment to them. You don't necessarily [i]need[/i] a long game to grow attached to characters or develop a poignant relationship, but Chronology has no idea what it's doing. One character tries to imply that another is ""running away from their past,"" but they've literally done nothing but face their problems head-on the entire time. It has a simplicity that makes it feel like it was made for children under the misguided assumption that everyone under the age of fifteen is an idiot, yet also incorporates elements of amoral PC adventure game nonsense, like breaking child's leg to create a nonsensical solution to a puzzle.

-The puzzles themselves are ""fine"" but ultimately uninspired or completely nonsensical. The game has neat concepts, with the idea of two different characters who both have unique time-related abilities, but from start to finish it never feels like anything especially novel occurs with these wondrous abilities.

If you want a time-themed puzzle platformer, play Braid instead if you haven't. If you've already played Braid, just look for a better game. I don't have any particularly strong negative feelings about my time with Chronology, but it truly left me with nothing special or unique for my time.

Leichtgewichtiger Plattformer/Puzzler mit dezentem Frustfaktor

Hatte das Spiel vor zig Jahren mal ne Stunde zum Idlen laufen gelassen, um die Karten zu farmen. Jetzt habe ich das Spielen nachgeholt. Ergebnis: Wie so viele ""kleine Spiele"": Hübsch, originell mit vielen Schwächen.

Mein Hauptkritikpunkt: Die Steuerung ist im Grunde nur für Controller optimiert. Wie man Maus und Tastatur-SpielerInnen so dreist links liegen lassen kann, erstaunt mich immer wieder. Das ist ja kein 0815-RPG-Maker Spiel, sondern ein von westlichen Entwicklern gemachtes ""Eigenwerk"". Das Aufzwingen von Pfeiltasten über WASD, die komplette Nicht-Möglichkeit eigener Belegungen gibt automatisch saftige Abzüge. Ich habe mir sogar ernsthaft überlegt das Spiel sofort wieder zu deinstallieren, nachdem die Steuerung nur mit den Pfeiltasten ging. Es ist einfach unangenehm, teilweise sogar krampfhaft schmerzend. Nur die Aussicht, dass es sich um ein ""kurzes"", eher ""einfaches"" Spiel handeln sollte, hat es mich durchziehen lassen.

Die ""Rätsel"" sind ok. Ein paar Stellen sind schon echt mies, so dass man locker wie ein Idiot 20 Minuten an derselben Stelle steht (ansonsten würde man das Spiel wahrscheinlich richtig schnell durchziehen).

Die Ladezeiten sind ne Katastrophe. Ernsthaft. Das Spiel ist uralt, mein Rechner kann modernere Sachen gut laden und so ein ""mini""-Game spielt 10 Sekunden Cinematic und danach 1 Minute Ladezeit? Und das immer und immer wieder? Also irgendwas passt da nicht. Immerhin gab es keine Abstürze.

Das Spiel ""bestraft"" zurückgehen radikal. Falls man irgendwo nicht weiterkommt und dann weiter hinten sucht und wieder zurückkehren will, wird das unmöglich gemacht (z.B. bei der Stelle mit der Kanone). Ein ""Tod"" in die Tiefe lässt dich nicht am ""weitesten"" Punkt respawnen, sondern an Ort und Stelle. Einzige Lösung: Das gesamte Kapitel von vorne. 

Die Story ist ohne viel Tiefgang, aber wird mit Charme und schönen Zeichnungen der Comiccharakter erzählt. Man hat eine oberflächliche emotionale Bindung. Aber: An einer Stelle wird es extrem unmoralisch. Ohne zu Spoilern sage ich nur ""Kind"" + ""Banane"". Von der ganzen Aufmachung richtet sich Chronology ja eher an jüngere Zielgruppen, da fand ich so eine zynische Nutzung deiner Kraft schon echt übel...

Das Ende kommt dann auch sehr Knall auf Fall, aber immerhin rundet das Game mit einer kurzen Schlussabspannsequenz ab, anstatt einfach plump zu enden.

Fazit: Ganz ehrlich: Das Spiel hat mich nicht abgeholt. Ich hatte mir mehr, etwas ""runderes"" erwartet. Trotzdem ist die Idee mit den Zeitzonen, dem Schneckenbuddy und der hübschen Graphik schön umgesetzt. Man sollte sich bewusst sein, dass der Umfang des Spiels 1-3 Stunden beträgt und keinen Wiederspielwert hat, da es nichts zum sammeln oder irgendwelche Geheimdinge gibt (was dem Spiel an sich guttut, aber es hätte sicher doppelt so lange sein können, um sich dennoch vollwertig anzufühlen).",1673793563,1673793563,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

https://youtu.be/WeQQ6dKEaF4

Is a game content based on time manipulation and switching two environments interesting enough to make a good puzzle platformer that could be enjoyed by both children and their parents? Let’s start with the pluses - good story that is developed further, original game concept, two charismatic main heroes with time based special abilities, sense of humor, well designed puzzles, difficulty suitable for casual players, beautiful game graphics, good music and great voice acting. The game is not flawless of course, so here are the minuses - quite a short length, snail’s ability to stop time is not sufficiently used, sometimes clunky controls and low number of music tracks. The game with two main heroes would deserve some form of a local multiplayer so, it’s a pity that it is not present here.

Pros:
- story
- original concept
- two charismatic heroes
- sense of humor
- puzzle design
- difficulty for casual players
- graphics
- music
- voice acting

Cons:
- short length
- snail's ability is not sufficiently used
- clunky controls sometimes
- only a few music tracks
- no local multiplayer


The game’s target group are mainly children or casual players due to the game's relaxing fairy tale-like atmosphere, short levels and easy difficulty. I could imagine that the local co-op and the game design that would be using the characters' cooperation more often would make the game great for family playing. Like this it is still a very good puzzle platformer that most casual players will have fun with and thus I am giving Chronology Thumbs Up and Video Gaming Father’s Index 8- out of 10 - recommended!",1671806149,1671806149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

While the developers clearly tried to make a fun and simple puzzle platformer, the game is sadly just not that fun to play. The story is unfulfilling, the controls are clunky, the time travel gimmick is not really used to its full potential, stopping time (the snail ability) is only used very rarely and can mostly be ignored and the puzzles range from really easy to nonsensical. 

Some of the puzzles feel only solvable if you do something that seems to be completely unintended, unfitting or weird and while it seems obvious in hindsight, it isn't at all obvious while you're playing. For how simple the game is, the puzzles should have been thought out more. One puzzle in particular near the end made my jaw drop to the ground because the solution is so nonsensical and out-of-character for the main characters that it felt the developers just gave up at that point.

The biggest problem though, despite the extremely short length (about 90 minutes even if you get stuck a bit), are the bugs. I experienced no less than a dozen. You can phase into the ground by time traveling ""into"" NPCs; jumps sometimes do not work; I have fallen through the snail shell several times; a puzzle just would not work for me despite following the walkthrough to a T because I felt I was going crazy, until it then decided to randomly work after all without me changing anything; the characters get stuck in animations sometimes, and so on.

Figment, by the same developers, embodies that very same design philosophy of Chronology, but is a trillion times more polished and thought out. I chalk this game up to the developers still finding their groove. I can see the intent is there, but the execution is flawed and haphazard. I would skip this game and support the developers by checking out Figment instead, which is similar in terms of being a simple, pretty puzzler (though isometric), but is actually fun.",1670189142,1670189329,False,1,0,0.501677870750427246,0,True,False,False,True,,,

But there were some things that really, really let it down, 1 the characters/voice acting. The old man is a jerk, to the NPC's and the snail for literally no reason and he's the one we are meant to be rooting for. That said the snail has the most annoying, grating voice, that whenever it speaks you want to punch it in the face.

The ideas for gameplay, stopping time, jumping between timezones are nice, but they don't do anything imaginitive with them, the puzzles are relatively simple and samey then you get one which is non-sensical, so you can't help but get bored, the story doesn't help - I mean it's not objectionable but it's once again not really imaginitive. The controls at time were also painful (I used controller) it wasn't very intuitive.

It's a shame because there are good ideas in here, but they just never did anything exciting with it, and all you'll want to do is kill the main characters off constantly.

Пожилой Изобретатель обнаруживает себя в лесу среди развалин старого дома. Ничего не понимая, он идёт по лесу и находит странные часы, которые оказываются машиной времени и позволяют вернуться в прошлое. Тут оказывается, что на месте леса и развалин когда-то был индустриальный город, полный различных приспособлений и механизмов. Тут наш старичок вспоминает, что он когда-то приложил руку к разработке этих часов, а возможно и к тому, что случилось с городом. Он решает выяснить всё до конца и отправляется в не очень долгое, но интересное путешествие. По пути он встречается с Улиткой – огромной улиткой, выращенной в секретных лабораториях и обладающей способностью останавливать время. Они подружились и, в последствии, ни раз выручали друг друга.

Chronology – это платформер, наполненный головоломками, связанными со временем. В принципе, основные механики нам показывают ещё в самом начале и ничего нового до конца игры не будет. Зато сами загадки достаточно разнообразные. Например, в прошлом есть рабочий лифт, на котором можно подняться, зато в настоящем рядом выросло дерево, на которое можно перепрыгнуть и пройти дальше. Или забиться в настоящем в укромный уголок, а в прошлом можно обойти охранника. А Улитка умеет ползать по стенам и забираться в места, куда Изобретатель попасть не может.

Картинка на экране просто замечательная мир нарисован мягкими, не напрягающими глаза тонами, но при этом он достаточно солнечный. При переходах во времени мир плавно меняется и поначалу перепрыгиваешь просто, чтобы посмотреть, как красиво происходит этот эффект. Особенно нравится, когда лесные заросли превращаются в городские застройки. Ближе к концу игры окружение становится более индустриальным. Кругом становится полно колёс, шестерёнок и дыма.

除非你对它的玩法实在感兴趣，又闲出鸟来了，这游戏又刚好打骨折，那么可以入手。否则都不推荐。

这个游戏的机制——时间操控（1.穿梭于过去/未来，2.时间停止）挺吸引我的，但关卡设计属实一般。不可否认有部分关卡基于机制进行了独特的设计，可这样的段落极少极少。在这种情况下，还存在反复利用相同套路的情况，让人难以忍受。

但这还不至于让我打出差评。这游戏相当糟糕的一点是，作为一款平台解谜游戏，硬生生地给我整出了点击指向的感觉。时间操控+2D平台跳跃+解谜，做出来的游戏不像时空幻境，反而像机械迷城，你说荒不荒谬？
点击指向、对脑电波的解谜模式自然不能被苛责，但问题在于，如果这种模式设计得不好，会让玩家不知如何行动，只能一通乱点，把能互动的东西全互动一遍。在第6、7章，我绝大部分时间正是花在了看哪里可以互动上，去掉这些繁琐的尝试，游戏流程恐怕都到不了1个小时。

但这还不够离谱，最离谱的是，从第7章后半段开始，这游戏就变成了一个纯纯的平台跳跃闯关游戏——没错，就是跳火跳电锯跳移动平台的那种游戏。
我tm真是完全裂开了，一个前面一直是玩法驱动型的解谜游戏，最后居然要丢掉所有玩法机制，靠动作来塑造高潮？？？要玩这种游戏我为什么不去玩i wanna去空洞骑士跳白宫，来玩这手感稀烂打着解谜旗号的游戏？？？？？

PS：这个游戏还有一定量的bug，比如按键判定提示经常性缺失，很容易忽略可以互动的点。我还跳到过山体的内侧，出不去，只能靠重开解决问题，但这蛋疼游戏每次重开都得一大关从头开始，游戏体验直接爆炸。",1646153650,1688256277,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Then use this wire on the plant in present, take its tooth and with this tooth cut the phone wire outside. After that we need to cut off this flower again in the past and give it to cashier in present.  [/spoiler] And only after this we'll get the ticket to ride.

[code] [b] Chronology [/b] - платформер-головоломка от разработчиков Bedtime Digital Games. Игра вышла в Steam в мае 2014 года года и на данный момент имеет чуть менее 350 отзывов, по совокупности дающих ""очень положительный"" рейтинг. Мне игра понравилась и стала даже своего рода приятной неожиданностью, о чем я попробую рассказать ниже. [/code]

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СЮЖЕТ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Наша история начинается в далеком фэнтезийном королевстве, которое уже успело перешагнуть рубеж технологического прогресса и открыть для себя паровые механизмы. Играть нам предстоит от лица старичка-изобретателя, некогда бывшего учеником одного из самых известных мастеров. Вместе с учителем они сумели открыть новый материал, обладавший доселе невиданными свойствами и сулящий большие возможности тому, кто возьмется с ним работать. Поначалу дела шли неплохо, однако вскоре стало понятно, что найденная материя слишком опасна для дальнейшего освоения, и наш главный герой вынужден был оставить своего мастера один на один с неизвестным материалом. 

Сюжет начинается некоторое время спустя. Не помня ничего, старик-изобретатель просыпается в дикой местности, неподалеку от города, что когда-то был ему домом. В некогда цветущем и благоухающем краю повсюду царит разруха и запустение. Что случилось с былым раем на земле, и самое главное - кто в этом виноват? Именно это и предстоит выяснить нашему главному герою. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Игровой процесс в Chronology сочетает в себе одновременно жанр ""платформер"" и элементы головоломки. Управляя ГГ от третьего лица, мы ведем его вперед, преодолевая различные препятствия. Впрочем, не изобретателем единым - буквально на первых уровнях к нам присоединится еще один важный персонаж - механическая улитка. Стоит отметить, что у каждого из героев припасен свой туз в рукаве - оба протагониста по-разному могут управлять течением времени. Старик обладает особым устройством, которое способно в любой момент обратить время вспять и вернуть ""твой 2006"", в то время как улитка и вовсе способна остановить мгновенье, причем в буквальном смысле - со всем, что хоть как-то движется или представляет опасность. Но не думайте, что от этого вам мгновенно станет легко - моментов поломать голову будет немало, но это будут исключительно приятные минуты. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ПЛЮСЫ И МИНУСЫ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

+ Атмосферный сюжет и проработанный мир
+ Необычный игровой процесс со скачками во времени
+ Головоломки с адекватной сложностью и логикой
+ Игра добрая и светлая, прекрасно подойдет детям
+ Приятная графика и музыка
+ Низкая цена и частые скидки
+ Качественный русский язык 

- Игра достаточно короткая
- Нет достижений и карточек Steam

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Chronology я пытался проходить дважды, и, честно говоря, первый раз она мне не зашла. Сейчас уже сложно сказать почему, видимо, просто не пришлась тогда к настроению. Вернувшись с новыми силами во второй раз, я проскакал всю игру буквально за два часа, и остался вполне доволен. Если любите платформеры-головоломки с легкой атмосферой и красочным живым миром - смело можете попробовать Chronology.

[code] Студия Bedtime Digital Games предпочитает выпускать сюрреалистичные платформеры и головоломки, которые невозможно раскусить до стадии личного прохождения. Некоторые из вас влюбятся в стилистику их проектов, другие же убегут к более реалистичным вещам. [/code]

Всем привет, сегодня предложу вам обратить свое внимание на малопопулярную, но весьма интересную и качественную головоломку, которая займет не более одного вечера. Игра подойдет даже детям, но некоторые из местных загадок заставят смазать извилины. За все прохождение я не встретил никаких багов и ошибок, игра имеет удобное управление и понятный интерфейс, а на скидках Chronology отдают за сущие копейки.

Chronology - медитативный платформер\головоломка, сетующий о приключениях пожилого изобретателя с весьма экстравагантным напарником в виде гигантской улитки. Игра имеет приличный запас интересных механик, которые порционно всплывают по мере прохождения,  привнося в геймплей новые эмоции и трудности. Тут вам и перемотка времени, и перемещение между мирами, и управление несколькими персонажами одновременно, а еще можно использовать интерактивные предметы, влияя на дизайн определенных уровней. И все это так складно влезло в скоротечное приключение, что не ощущаешь лишнего перегруза, а наоборот радуешься богатому функционалу. 

[h1] Стопка, стопка, огуречик, в феске старый человечек.   [/h1]
Мне понравился дизайн уровней, постоянное переключение между измерениями, занятно разглядывать последствия влияния времени на бренный мир. И если где-нибудь надломить ветку, то в далеком будущем она тоже упадет, позволяя пройти сложный участок. И вся эта красота пропитана атмосферой стимпанка, заоблачной диктатурой и интересными отсылками к золотой классике. Если обращать внимание на мелочи, то можно обнаружить забавные пасхалки и шутки от разработчиков. 

Если вы столкнетесь с какими-нибудь трудностями, то игра начнет намекать на решение, но зачастую отгадка лежит на самой поверхности. Иной раз вас буквально будут тыкать носом в стрелочку, но из-за обилия интерактивных предметов можно пропустить любые подсказки. И если вы такой невнимательный игрок, то заклинаю вас слушать все диалоги между персонажами, понеже сюжетная линия целиком и полностью завязана на фактах из скоротечных бесед. 

[list]
[*] Время прохождения ~2-3 часа.
[*] Разнообразие игровых механик. 
[*] Не самая интересная история. 
[/list]

[h1] Мой сосед [strike] Тоторо [/strike] татарин. [/h1]
В конечном итоге перед вами отличная закуска между более именитыми проектами. Советую захватить Chronology на скидках, понеже в своей ценовой категории обозреваемый платформер практически не имеет аналогов и конкурентов. Мне понравилось, посему, друзья, желаю всем приятной игры, до скорых встреч!

首先虽然故事框架设定得颇为吸引人——一位老人和一名年轻助手通过操控时间来解开历史谜团，但在实际叙事过程中却显得苍白无力。剧情推进不够紧凑，角色塑造也相对单薄，难以引发玩家的情感共鸣。故事线索的散乱导致整体剧情略显拖沓，缺乏引人入胜的高潮迭起。

其次游戏的核心玩法在于时间操控，允许玩家在不同时代之间切换以解决环境谜题。然而这一原本极具创意的设计并未得到充分发展。许多谜题过于依赖固定模式，重复性较高，缺乏足够多变和深度的挑战，使得时间操控的乐趣很快消耗殆尽。另外谜题提示有时含糊不清，增加了不必要的困扰，而非提升游戏乐趣。

再者从技术层面来看在优化方面尚有欠缺。游戏运行过程中偶现卡顿和延迟问题，影响了整体游戏体验的顺畅度。此外游戏内的动画表现也不够流畅，特别是在时间切换时的效果处理，本应成为亮点的部分反而给人留下粗糙的印象。

最后尽管在视觉艺术风格上有着一定的吸引力，但关卡设计的局限性和操作反馈的不足，无法让玩家在长时间游玩后保持持续的兴趣。考虑到市场上同类作品的竞争激烈，如果能在故事情节编排、谜题设计以及游戏性能等方面做出显著改进，或许能真正展现出时间操控类解谜游戏的独特魅力。

综上所述，尽管具有独特的游戏概念和视觉呈现，但由于剧情平淡、谜题设计欠佳以及技术上的瑕疵，使得游戏的整体表现不尽如人意。期待开发团队在未来的作品中能够吸取经验教训，进一步打磨游戏品质，将这一题材的潜力充分发挥出来。",1632500798,1711294733,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Платформинг в игре не идеальный, но терпимый, загадки он излишне не переусложняет, и то хлеб. Геймплей - пожалуй, самая сильная сторона Chronology.
Также в позитивном ключе хочется отметить музыку - она неожиданно хороша для, казалось бы, камерного и не претенциозного проекта, не делающего упор именно на саундтрек. Она привлекает к себе внимание и гармонично сопровождает историю.

А вот с историей есть проблемы. Сюжет здесь чисто номинальный, сценарий - плохонький, герои - унылые, немного надоедливые, о динамике развития их отношений даже говорить не хочется. Как такового лора нет, да и вряд ли он здесь нужен: сомневаюсь, что кому-то захотелось бы погружаться в эту историю глубже, чем она есть. Цеплять там нечему.

Визуальный стиль здесь, говоря по чести, никакой. Chronology легко потерять среди сотен подобных проектов. Ничего запоминающегося, а простенькая мультяшность нравится далеко не всем. Мне субъективно совсем не нравится: стиль недостаточно яркий и самобытный, чтобы не быть с успехом каким угодно другим.

Отзыв всё-таки ""синий"", потому что объективно игра - норм. Не больше и не меньше, но - норм. Она подойдёт скоротать пару часов, наверняка может понравиться детям, недорого стоит. Звёзд с неба не хватает, но провести в ней немного времени мне было объективно весело. Может, Chronology - это и проходняк, но по крайней мере проходняк не претенциозный и не откровенная халтура. Пусть к игре я не вернусь, восторженно советовать друзьям не стану - но ""спасибо"" за вечерний досуг скажу.",1631395080,1631395080,True,3,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Также совершенно неожиданно быстро для себя я оказался в финальном уровне где битва с боссом это сплошное разочарование. А также финальная кат-сцена, которая несет минимум информации.

И в итоге игра оставляет после себя не очень положительно впечатление, как будто разработчики в первоначальном сценарии замахнулись на что-то большее, но потом в процессе разработки пришлось все переиграть и урезать и поэтому игра вышла скомканная, короткая и с проблемами в сюжете.",1619725447,1619725447,False,3,0,0.560014784336090088,0,True,False,False,False,,,

É super satisfatório, como deveria ser. Com puzzles, aventura e a ideia perfeita de viajar no tempo.
Você tem ajuda de um amigo, o Caramujo.
O cenário e design são do tipo simples, com um gameplay de personagem visto na lateral.
E resumindo, é ótimo!

Chronology is an adventure platformer developed by Bedtime Digital Games.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

Brief memory loss is generally a popular narrative medium and the nameless protagonist of Chronology suffers from it at the beginning. Fortunately, memories quickly return and the little gnome realizes that civilization was almost entirely wiped out by one of his inventions, which was abused by his old mentor. But since, as a researcher of the world, he has a time machine with him, this is actually not as unbelievably tragic as you first suspect. He quickly makes it his goal to save the world as it should be for a decent hero. The only problem is that he has woken up in the middle of the wilderness and has to overcome numerous dangers before he can get to the capital and thus to his invention.

Unfortunately, the story doesn't tear up trees and prefers to rely on solidity, which is not improved by the rather mediocre speakers. Fortunately, the gameplay is more convincing. Because the little guy can travel around in time, some interesting puzzles and situations arise. Do you have to aim high in the present? Then just travel into the past and plant a flower there that will later sprout gigantic blossoms. That would have been an example of the simple puzzles at the beginning of the Odyssey, but a few more elements are added later - one of them not only likes to babble, but also likes to slime around in the truest sense of the word.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ Cool hero duo
+ Interesting game with past and future
+ nice puzzles
+ catchy soundtrack
+ Beautiful and coherent art style
+ Trading cards

[h1] Contra [/h1]

- short playing time
- Control not implemented well
- kept too simple

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Chronology offers you a good look and some really good puzzles that really demand all the skills you have learned.


[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

Chronology ist ein Abenteuer-Plattformer, welcher von Bedtime Digital Games entwickelt wurde. 

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Kurzzeitiger Gedächtnisverlust ist generell ein beliebtes Erzählungsmittel und auch der namenlose Protagonist von Chronology leidet zu Beginn darunter. Glücklicherweise kehren die Erinnerungen jedoch schnell wieder zurück und dem kleinen Gnom wird klar, dass die Zivilisation durch eine seiner Erfindungen, die von seinem alten Mentor missbraucht wurde, beinahe gänzlich ausgelöscht wurde. Da er aber als Forscher von Welt eine Zeitmaschine dabei hat, ist das eigentlich gar nicht so unglaublich tragisch, wie man zuerst vermutet. Schnell macht er es sich so zum Ziel die Welt zu erretten, wie es sich eben für einen anständigen Helden gehört. Problematisch ist dabei nur, dass er mitten in der Wildnis aufgewacht ist und er zahlreiche Gefahren überwinden muss, bis er in die Hauptstadt und damit zu seiner Erfindung gelangen kann.

Die Story reißt leider keine Bäume aus und verlässt sich lieber auf Solides, was durch die eher mittelmäßigen Sprecher auch nicht besser wird. Zum Glück kann das Gameplay dagegen mehr überzeugen. Dadurch, dass der kleine Kerl in der Zeit umher reisen kann, entstehen einige interessante Rätsel und Situationen. Müsst ihr in der Gegenwart hoch hinaus? Dann reist doch einfach in die Vergangenheit und pflanzt dort eine Blume ein, die später gigantische Blüten sprießen lässt. Das wäre nun ein Beispiel für die simplen Rätsel zu Beginn der Odyssee gewesen, doch später kommen noch einige weitere Elemente hinzu – eines davon plappert nicht nur gerne, sondern schleimt im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes auch gerne mal rum.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ Cooles Heldenduo
+ Interessantes Spiel mit Vergangenheit und Zukunft
+ nette Rätsel
+ eingängiger Soundtrack
+ Schöner und stimmiger Artstil
+ Trading Cards

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- kurze Spielzeit
- Steuerung nicht gut umgesetzt
- zu einfach gehalten

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

First of all, the game is really buggy. By accident I managed to get myself into several situations that I found no way out again other than to close the game and start again from the beginning of the chapter. And again. And again. 
- Once, I tried to do a jump from snail's back that resulted in endless spawning and immediately dying because of falling down which made the whole game window flicker like it was on drugs. 
- Another time, I did an unlucky jump on a cannon ball and ended up caged between the structures where there was no way out again.
- And I also ended up on places with my snail where I couldn't get out again.
- Also, there's no option to just normally end and quit the game. One has to close the game using the windows task bar....
In my opinion, these things should not happen... and at least not so many of them.
Second, I found the old man not very sympathetic. I did not like the way he talked to the snail and also I was sorry for what happened to the boy.

I really enjoyed the different layers of time and switching between the characters. 

If I could rate this game by stars, I would give 3.5/5 stars by now. Since that's not possible on Steam and I think that something should be done to fix the bugs I experienced I cannot recommend this game.

パズル要素のある2Dプラットフォーマーアクションで、死んでも少し前のポイントに戻るだけでゲームオーバーなし。全８ステージで１ステージは10分程度、難易度は非常に低くて（タイミングが少し難しい場所もあるけど何度でもペナルティなしで再挑戦できるのでいずれはクリア可能）、アクションゲームが苦手な人でもエンディングまで行けると思います。
このゲームのユニークな点は、主人公のじいさんと仲間のカタツムリ（笑）を切り替えて操作すること。じいさんは瞬時に２つの時間を行き来するタイムトラベル能力、カタツムリは時間を止めるタイムストップ能力をもっているので、操作キャラの切り替え＋それぞれの特殊能力を駆使して、一見クリアできない仕掛けをクリアしていくのがこのゲームの面白さとなっています。場面によっては、ジャンプした瞬間にタイムトラベルして、「別の時間」にしか存在しない足場にたどりつく、みたいなのもあったりして、特殊能力がゲーム内容にうまくマッチしていると思います。
ボリュームは少なくて、やりこみ要素とかも見当たらない感じですが、ちゃんとクリアまで遊べるアクションゲームって、アクション苦手な人間には意外と貴重だったりするので、これはこれで良かったと思います。
気になったのは、チャプター間のローディングに異様に時間がかかることがあること。同じチャプターでも10秒くらいで読み込むときもあれば、１分くらいかかってフリーズしたかと思うときもあって、ちょっと不安定ですね。
ともあれ、気軽に遊べるアクションゲームとしておすすめです。",1604903480,1604903480,True,4,0,0.576719582080841064,0,True,False,False,False,,,

VOTO: 6

----------
GRAFICA
----------
Graficamente cartoonesco, con tratti puliti.

--------
AUDIO
--------
L'audio niente di straordinario.
Sottotitoli in italiano.

-------------
GAMEPLAY
-------------
Rompicapo ambientale con un pò di platforming, basato sul mandare avanti e indietro il tempo a due ere prefisse, oppure nel congelare l'istante. Non è difficile, anzi, però gli enigmi sono davvero ben studiati,
occorre concatenare le abilità dei due protagonisti e utilizzare anche l'ambiente circostante.

----------
STORIA
----------
Molto semplice, è facile con poche parole spoilerare tutto il gioco, per cui vi lascio la scoperta, tanto dura davvero poco.

---------
DURATA
---------
Il più grosso inconveniente è che dura poco (circa 2 ore).

-----------------------------
PROBLEMI TECNICI / BUG
-----------------------------
Ogni volta che si avvia il gioco è sempre in finestra, occorre andare in impostazioni e reimpostare a fullscreen (2 volte).

Ma kilka niedopracowań, np. jak upuścimy przedmiot w wyjątkowo nieodpowiednim momencie albo na polu z inną interakcją (np. rozmową), możemy już przedmiotu nie odzyskać i cały poziom trzeba będzie zaczynać od nowa.  
Polecam grać na padzie, gdyż dużo wygodniej niż na klawiaturze można na nim pokonywać elementy zręcznościowe. 

Plusy:
+ ciekawy pomysł i rozwiązania
+ ciekawa historyjka
+ przyjemna . . .

Minusy:
- . . . ale potrafi sfrustrować
- drobne niedopracowania
- cena (kupiłem na wyprzedaży za 2,69zł, więc śmieszna cena ale pozawyprzedażowych 18zł to bym za nią nie dał; nie jest warta więcej niż 5-6zł)
- lubi długo ładować poziomy, niezależnie od sprzętu
- zwiastun zawiera strasznie dużo spoilerów i rozwiązań zagadek

You have to use the gimmicks constantly to progress inches at a time, this is painful and not at all fun for anyone.

You play as Old Inventor ( a kind of gnome thing) and as Snail, your side-kick and frenemy. While your power is over time, Snail controls the speed of time. Switching between the past and the present, and between slowed or normal time, you solve puzzles to progress through the 8 chapters. At the end you stop the mad guy, Mentor, from screwing everything up completely.

Chronology is relatively short. I left it paused for a few hours but could probably have completed the game in 2 hours or thereabouts. The puzzles are rather straightforward but there is still a sense of accomplishment once you pass each one - especially when you do it first time. The last chapter, with the banana, is a little confusing at first but jiggling time back and forth the path forward soon becomes apparent.

Chronology's charm is in its simplicity. Not a lot of puzzle platformers are just plain old simple fun these days. It doesn't take a puzzle genius to figure these puzzles out. The aim of Chronology seems to be not in having amazing powers of deduction but rather in just enjoying a story balanced against its gameplay.

I ran into [b]zero[/b] problems with lag or response between screen and keyboard. Zero issues with graphics. Zero bugs. My [i]only[/i] recommendation is that if you pick up an item - key, banana, bucket, flower, etc - don't drop it right on top of an interactable element like a power switch because, like with any game, if you put two interactable items on top of one another, one will override the other.

I very much so appreciated the auto-save - I could turn Chronology off at [i]any[/i] point and it would pick back up [i]exactly[/i] where I was - and, if/when you die, Old Inventor respawns very close to where you last were.

I definitely I got my moneys worth with Chronology - Under $10 for 2+ hours of entertainment is, imho, pretty darned good. And I'm always happy to pay full price for indie titles, keeps them mean big guys on their toes.

Chronology is a platform-adventure game about time travelling, Bedtime Digital Games studio is responsible for the production of this game. In the game we take on the role of an Old Inventor and a Snail.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This is a platform game in which our goal is to control an old inventor who, due to his amnesia, landed in a world he knows well, but destroyed. At the beginning of the game he discovers that we can manipulate time with a found watch. It is this watch that will allow us to go through the next levels, of which there are 8 in total. The game mechanics are very simple and pleasant. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]

Soundtrack in the game is pleasant, depending on the situation, the music changes. Ambient sounds are also ok. Dubbing in the game is ok, but there is not much of it.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

The graphics are in fairy tale style and very pleasant. Although it is a low-budget game, it looks very good. 

[h1]Summary[/h1]

Chronology is certainly not a game that was on my list of games that I want to play. However, I can not say a bad word about this game. This is a really good game for a platformer, although the puzzles are too simple. In addition sometimes a character can juggle or behave strangely, but it is not an element that rejects this game.

✔️Cheap
✔️Short
✔️Pleasant graphics
✔️Nice soundtrack

❌Few bugs

PROS:

- Interesting gameplay and unique, fun mechanics
- Very aesthetic art mixed with a bit of weird art
(both art styles mesh together well with the final product)
- Good music, ambient sounds, effects and soundtrack
- Good voice acting (not the best, but really good)
- Variation in that the game will go easy on you if you miss the goal by a bit
- Short and sweet
- Family friendly and okay for ALL audiences to enjoy
- Good jokes and mediocre puns that can make you chuckle

CONS:

- Bugs (there are bugs, probably related to the game engine or certain actions. Also seeing ""R.I.P. jokingly being stated for one of the studios behind this games, means that the developers probably have no intention of fixing anything)
- The game is kinda orientated toward children and family playing together too much
- Really short - it took me exactly 6 hours and I don't rush games and try everything possible
(trying to find easter eggs, hidden areas and never looking for Internet hints)
- Price is a little bit much for the game's cons. 5 euros seem a bit high - get it on sale (even 40% OFF will do)

Wir können bzw. müssen hierbei von der Gegenwart in die Vergangenheit switchen oder die Zeit komplett anhalten um Puzzle zu lösen. Oftmals müssen wir die Fähigkeiten der Charaktere verbinden (Schnecke hält die Zeit an und Erfinder wechselt in die Vergangenheit um über Hindernisse zu kommen oder Gegenstände aufzunehmen). Die Rätsel sind relativ einfach und schnell lösbar. Die Animationen & die Musik sind dabei Hervorragend.

But I did find some things annoying about the game
- Controller and action response is a bit slow
- Changing response between times past and present & stopped and constant is a bit slow
- Not a game that can continue playing repeatedly 
- Sometimes you make a mistake and cannot revert it, like dropping a key next to cannonballs, and unable to pick it up again. So you have to restart the whole chapter... not that it is long but still
- I know it was short game but it is very short. Not even many cutscenes of his past

On that note, what was good
- The game is simple and you have to accept this 
- music was cute along with the graphic sprites which are ok
- the puzzles were not hard and not boring either, they allowed for a little challenge and good timing (better response from controller).
- like the option to bring objects from different times
- Animation is good

The story seems very similar to the Disney Up, on the note that you have to consider that the character is really dead and facing these adventures with his trusty snail that moves him along (for schmeckles) in the afterlife. 
Definitely a game for all ages.

TLDR: Short duration. Puzzles. Two protagonists. Levelswap from past to future. Uninteresting story. Gets annoying to manage the gimmicks.

Chronology is your typical indie puzzle platformer. Each act is rather short, but having to constantly level swap. As well as transition from the snail to the old man gets a bit tedious. Some of the solutions need some thinking while others have you trickjump across simple platforms. The short duration and forgettable setting makes this a prime candidate for archiving in hidden library. I am not exactly fond of puzzle platformers and there is little enjoyment or replay value left after getting through it once.

I would recommend checking out Gianna Sisters instead for a more action oriented take on a similar concept.

O seu ajudante é um caracol chamado Snail, que também pode parar o tempo. Juntos com as suas habilidades eles manipularam objetos para resolverem diversos puzzles.

  O game contém uma história muito cativante. Old é um brilhante inventor, que construiu uma máquina poderosa e acabou sendo traído pelo seu próprio mestre, que deseja utiliza-lá para acabar com a humanidade. Em meio a um começo de um apocalipse mecânico, o velho inventor e o caracol refazem todos os passos do seu mestre para poder salva o mundo de um desastre.

   Chronology possui oito capítulos que desafiaram a sua mente. O essencial na gameplay é o tempo, pois seu objetivo é manipulá-lo para resolver os diversos enigmas, que são encontrados nos cenários com um estilo de plataforma, assim, ocorrendo uma harmonia nos desafios.

   A jogabilidade é simples e se adequa a cada tipo de situação. Nos três primeiros capítulos você irá se aventurar com o inventor, realizando uma série de puzzles fácies. Logo após isso, o seu ajudante caracol vai começar a te acompanhar nessa jornada e isso tornará os desafios mais complexos, pois exigirá um certo trabalho em equipe para poder solucioná-los, alternando entre as duas funções dos personagens, Old viaja no tempo e Snail paralisa-o.

   Tudo é apresentado em gráficos com estilo de desenho animado, sendo bastante notável pela ambientação. Já as trilhas sonoras são relaxantes e agradáveis. 

   Contudo, Chronology é um ótimo título, a viagem no tempo é uma mecânica muito interessante, que acaba nos prendendo em desafios, além disso, o jogo possui uma ambientação extremamente linda.

On my current low-end laptop (which can run The Witness, Hollow Knight, almost all 2D Indie game with ease), there are achingly long load times. Unfortunately these are also placed in between the short cutscenes, meaning you end up waiting through a long load time to see a 30 or 40 second cutscene, and then go back into a long load time.

This game is full of charm, and I will probably come back to it when I upgrade my machine. The small glimpse of the time-bending mechanic I have managed to see is well implemented, in terms of aesthetic and sound design, and I imagine the developers have done interesting things with it. Unfortunately, some of the game's sound effects are horribly compressed which really takes away from the great voice acting. The music seems well written, but the sound is unbalanced so it gets washed out by the crunchy sound effects.

So far, this game does a lot in the right direction: The mechanics seem well thought out, the writing and voice acting is solid and the main character seems charismatic. For every good thing, however, there seems to be a drawback that really does take away from the game experience as a whole. We'll have to see how it pans out when I get an upgrade but for now, it's a no from me =/",1546723847,1546723847,False,0,0,0.425531923770904541,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You play as two interchangeable characters, a wizard and a snail and the puzzles are mostly well done and fun, although a couple did stretch the game’s internal logic a bit, and were hard to figure out. It’s an entertaining and enjoyable game, though pretty short. It took me around 4 hours to complete.

I do have two gripes, though. Firstly, it lacks a save game feature, so if you have to quit the game for any reason (for example, as a result of the several progress breaking bugs I encountered) you have to restart the level, and secondly, it lacks a couch co-op option. With 2 characters at play, it really felt like this was  missing.

If you like the time manipulation bit, I recommend that you give the game ''Seasons After Fall'' a go. It’s got a similar mechanic and is an excellent game.",1545175513,1545570603,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[i]Chronology[/i] es un juego de plataformas en 2D con puzles muy fáciles de poquísima calidad. Esto va de pasear y mirar el bosque ya que ni las breves plataformas que encontrarás son dignas de llamarse plataformas.
La historia no está bien desarrollada, solo hay una intro, un amago de algo y un final apresurado. ¿Dónde diantres está el nudo? ¿Cuál es el conflicto?, ¿cuál es el motivo por el que uno de los personajes se vuelve tonto y villano? ¿De dónde salió ese caracol? ¿Quién diantres eres tú? Todo un sin sentido.

Las pocas ambientaciones que se nos presentan son tan básicas con una camiseta blanca en oferta del “Pull&Bear”. Se nos brinda una mecánica de adelantar y retroceder en el tiempo con un simple clic y así aprovecharnos del entorno. Esto es la mayor baza del juego y la verdad no resulta demasiado interesante (no es una mecánica nueva). Hay que alternar el tiempo para saltar sobre mecanismos y estructuras nuevas, o por el otro lado,  beneficiarse del paso de los años y tener un escenario lleno de elementos deteriorados. Así constantemente para sortear los obstáculos. 

El juego va dirigido a un público infantil (con esa edad de ver Disney Channel y Boing) o especialmente a usuarios recién llegados al mundo de los videojuegos. La facilidad y la brevedad del título puede ser un insulto al jugador medio experimentado. 
Tras superar los 3 primeros niveles (son el tutorial), seguimos con 4 niveles más que son fáciles y cortos (contamos ya con 7 niveles que han hecho la función de toma de contacto para aprender la mecánica completamente). Cuanto todo parece que se pondrá interesante llegamos al nivel 8 donde sin jugar más te dicen que es el fin. No hay enfrentamiento con el jefe final y la historia se cierra de un plumazo sin que des cuenta de que esto ya se acabó.

La cara de bobo que se te queda es digna de un TV Show de cámara oculta. Pedí la devolución porque me parece caro por 3 niveles de un juego sin sentido. 

Buena idea para un juego que se queda muy muy lejos de merecer un aprobado. Mi opinión sería totalmete distinta si existieran 10 niveles más en los que aprovechar el concepto jugable. Para algo parecido con viajes en el tiempo instantáneos deberías probar [i]Silent Age[/i]. Es una aventura gráfica con buena historia y mecánica similar. Todo el juego se siente como un trabajo desmotivado y eso me pone triste.
  
[b]Lo mejor[/b]: la mecánica de adelantar y retroceder en el tiempo para superar el nivel no es nueva pero es entretenida. La ambientación de los niveles de bosque con lluvia es agradable.

      玩家扮演一名科学家老爷爷和另外一名邪恶科学家建造出一种蒸汽机器，这种蒸汽机器被邪恶科学家所使用破坏了文明世界。故事的开端玩家从一个濒临毁灭的世界中醒来，失去了他的记忆，需要找回自己的记忆并想办法过到过去改变世界即将毁灭的结局。随着故事的进展，玩家会遇上自己的伙伴一只小蜗牛，两人结伴去拯救世界。
      整个游戏的核心概念就是时间的改变，所有谜题都与时间有关联。科学家老爷爷的能力是使用自己的时间跳跃装置来进行穿越到过去和回到现在的事件点。蜗牛的能力是时间停止，不能跳，但能沿着墙壁移动以及使用自己的壳帮老爷爷提供站立点或者挡住有毒物质。
      加分点：1、画面比较漂亮，卡通化适合儿童。细节还不错，如花跟过去旧建筑到现在的变化。

                    2、音乐从低沉，急速，快乐的时刻都很贴合场景，充满活力。

                    3、难度比较低，主要难度更集中于谜题的思考上，操作上没多少要求。并且哪怕失败或者死亡老爷爷也能利用时间穿梭能力无限复活，毫无压力。整个游戏过程是比较悠闲的。
      减分点：1、虽然有古早前的汉化补丁，但是已经不能使用了。好在英文难度不是非常高。大概的内容还是能理解的。

                    2、剧情的设置以及角色的对话反转得很突兀，老爷爷和蜗牛的分开和结伴等等情节设置上的变化太无逻辑性，感觉是做给儿童玩的。

                    3、动画音乐等都很棒，但是8章的长度太短了。每章如果不思考太久卡关的话，那么6分钟左右一章并不稀奇，也就是说你能在一个小时内通关这个游戏。这个长度实在太短，只推荐慈善包入手。   

                    4、有几个小BUG，不过因主角能死后无限复活可以刷新通过所以不太影响。

      总体上属于能拿来悠闲的消遣一小段时间的游戏，游戏过程中感觉还是比较愉快的体验，缺陷在于太短。角色设定有点反转太快不过考虑到应该是供给儿童的游戏。做的很不错了。",1529853495,1531932340,True,5,0,0.205393508076667786,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Also the characters were just awful. Why was the old guy such a terrible person?? My favorite scene was where he realizes he needs the snail and then in the same cutscene where he calls it back is already telling it to go fuck itself again. The most absurd part is that instead of a final boss battle you platform to the final boss' location and somehow your platforming causes him to drop dead and the game's like, well, he's dead, and then it just ends. It was incredibly bizarre.

The central mechanic is that you have a phenomenally specific time machine that takes you back and forth between two exact moments in time and you can use the differences in the landscape over time to platform. In practice is was stupidly simple -- go back, move a block, go forward, jump on block, go back move forward, etc. There was never any point at which it wasn't immediately clear what needed to be done and what needed to be done was always insultingly simple. It was all the worst things about indie platformers: more attention paid to painting the background than to creating a coherent game, and acting as though its trite elements were somehow super clever.

Also, it somehow had longer loading times than Witcher 3, which is an absurd thing to have to say about a 2-hour platformer.

[h1]An old mans tale[/h1]

He we got a nice and neat puzzle platformer with a rather short story.
This game is quite old and has been released a while back. But even then this game is playable and completable without a problem. 

I do like this game, i like the story, i like the characters and i like the world.
This game keeps a lot of things simple. You move with the arrow keys and controll and switch characters with wasd. Riddles aren´t that hard and the feature of travel betweem feature and past is well made. Everything is rounded with a well drawn graphics. The most beatiful things is the soundtrack. So good i bought it on the devpage, sadly its not avaible here on steam. 
Despites the goods things there are few things notable.
Mayor problem is the budget. Why?
Well this game is short and can be played within half and a hour. Story is nice but not deep. Same applies for the characters. 
Don´t get me wrong the combo between snail and old men is awesome and works well but afterwards you know nothing they are replacable. Not considering the main evil has no name except for the mentor, because he is/was his mentor.
Second thing were you see is how this game is made, how polished it is. Everything works with minor glitches but the flow needed  for a realy enjoyment is missing. The snail for example only looks in one direction no matter were it moves. 
Surely this is an indie title but this bugges me the most. An interuptes flow. I didn´t feeled absorbed into the game.

I realy hope i can see a game with simerlar mechanic and more content from the same devs. I wouldn´t mind building my own levels. 

If you are interested or got this game out of a bundle its good and a try worth.

I got stuck in walls and had to reload several times. The storyline is muddled, and the protagnist only has enough personality to be dislikable. Seriously, why is he mean to that snail for no reason?

Art, assets, idea, all good. They needed better writing and way better level design. In my opinion, the makers should've fielded this for free on Kongregate then used what they learned to tighten up the ideas and make a better game, if they're going to charge money for it.

Chronology is a puzzler platformer, which uses, rather than phase shift, a time shift mechanic (same difference really) to alter the world around you in order to traverse the world and progress.

I have to start by saying LOAD times are atrotious!!!  Half my paytime was loading each level.  There were numerous times I had to simply close the game and reopen to get the level loaded.

What about the good?  Well, it is beautifully designed, with pleasant voice over (though I feel like the writing targets children), but the character movements leaves a lot to be desired.  I suspect that the implementation flaws comes from the fact that it is a table port.

The game is very short, where you apply a number of mechanics to progress.  At some point a time stopping snail is introduced

Most of the puzzles are simple, but a few can be obscure [spoiler](in fact cruel)[/spoiler], but nothing that feels very satisfying.

I am definitely on the fence on this one, for $1 maybe yes, but because of the technical difficulties, I found it more tedious that enjoyable :(


ACHIEVEMENTS:  Sadly, none.

[b]Metropolis darf nicht untergehen - Geschichte[/b]

Metropolis, die wohl nicht zufällig namensgleich zur Stadt Fritz Langs ist, ist vom Verfall bedroht. Wir spielen einen namenlosen alten Herrn, der dies zusammen mit einer süßen Schnecke verhindern will, indem er den Verursacher des Problems sucht.

Wirklich verstanden habe ich die Geschichte nicht, vielleicht habe ich ein paar Informationen verpasst. Mir schien es aber auch eher nur Aufhänger zum Gameplay zu sein.

[b]Zeit ist relativ - Gameplay[/b]

Um in den 8 Kapiteln des Spiels voran zu kommen, muss der Namenlose nicht nur genreüblich über Plattformen hüpfen und Gefahren ausweichen. Vielmehr muss er auch die Zeit manipulieren. Es gibt ein Jetzt (allerdings im Spiel als ""Before"" bezeichnet"") und ein Später (""After""), in dem die Welt leicht anders, verfallen, aussieht. Dies nutzt unser Mann ebenso, um Hindernisse zu überwinden, wie die Fähigkeit der Schnecke, die Umgebung zeitlich einzufrieren.

Da der Alte die Schnecke (fast) jederzeit zu sich rufen kann, ist es für den Spieler nur wichtig, den Knorz ins Ziel zu bringen. Dennoch sind beide Partner und aufeinander angewiesen.

Hinzu kommen ein paar Gegenstände, die richtig eingesetzt werden müssen und fertig ist das Gameplay. Heraus kommt ein relativ kurzes Spiel, in dem man die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten eifrig nutzen muss, um dann aber meist zügig voranzukommen.

Das ist auch gut so, da nur zu Beginn eines Kapitels gespeichert wird. Stirbt der alte Mann aber einen Bildschirmtod, so erscheint er in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Weiterspielen.

Die Jump&Run-Einlagen sind so einfach, dass ich mich frage, weswegen sie überhaupt drin sind.

[b]Zeit für Micky Maus? - Technik[/b]

Die Grafik ist schön gemacht, nur nicht ganz mein Geschmack. Gemalte Hintergrundbilder, von denen es immer je zwei (für beide Zeiten) gibt, schnuckelige Maschinen, eine dauergrinsende Schnecke mit Warnlampe fürs Rückwärtsfahren, ein rauschebärtiges Fez-tragendes Männchen. Eine Inspiration durch den japanischen Regisseur Hayao Miyazaki konnte ich nun nicht wiederfinden, die da sein soll, aber es hat schon einen sehr schönen Stil, der nur manchmal ins kitschige abgleitet.

Der Sound ist gut, die Sprecher (Englisch) allerdings auch nichts besonderes, die Schnecke war mir leider zu piepsig. Dennoch immer noch OK. Es gibt auch deutsche Untertitel zu den englischen Sprechern der, wie es scheint, skandinavischen Produktion.

Die Handhabung mit Controller ist einfach. Tastatur (und Maus?) wurde von mir nicht getestet.

The story is limited and does very little to explain why things turned out the way they did, or how the snail got involved, or what their motive really was...

- The sounds sometimes clip out when changing between characters (at one point the music entirely stopped until I progressed, or the music was there but some sound effects were missing). There also just weren't [i]enough[/i] sounds. Like, when you first launch the game, you must first press the space bar to bring up the options on the title screen, and there isn't even a click sound for it. It's just awkward to have the music rolling, for you to smack the key, and then see the menu come down with no indicator.

- The keyboard controls are unchangeable. This is a major issue, because there is only a faint arrow that briefly shows for your control changing between the snail and the character, so switching can be so subtle that you're not sure that it even happened. And then each character's individual power is accessed by the same key, which just caused a great deal of confusion that could easily be solved by assigning each power a separate, dedicated key.

- The game opens with music whose tune's first notes are nearly identical to Hans Zimmer's Pirates of the Caribbean theme. I know it sucks that note patterns can become taken forever by a composer like that, but that's just how art is, so the composer really should have noticed that and written a more original melody. As it is, it just sounds cheesy.

- The Inventor calls the Snail with different lines like ""Come on, boy,"" and ""I'd better find another way to call her."" Huh?

- The plot was entirely nonsensical. It didn't explain how the snail could talk, why it's so big, how it could [spoiler]teleport to the Inventor's location across the map at a whim (and it can't jump so you can't chalk that up to time travel/time-stopping)[/spoiler].

- The puzzles, while some were interesting requiring both simultaneous powers of the characters, were disconnected tasks, which is completely opposite to the ""Limbo + Braid"" comparison that one reviewer made. Each screen of each area was basically its own self-contained puzzle. Nearly an hour in to chapter VI (where I stopped), maybe one or two at most spanned more than a screen's worth (which was usually because of [spoiler]a doorway in a city area that you had to enter to reach a remote room for a brief moment[/spoiler]).

Pros:

Pretty, fun, appropriate background music -- the only exception is the song during the end credits which is, quite frankly, awful. It doesn't fit the game at all.

It's fun to control both the old man and the snail.

Switching back and forth between the present and the future adds an extra element of thoughtfulness in regards to completing the puzzles.

The puzzles are somewhat complex, but not frustratingly so.

Cons:

The loading screen that occurs between each level takes 2-3 minutes to load. While this doesn't seem that bad, actually sitting through those 2-3 minutes multiple times becomes very tedious. It's not even that graphics-heavy of a game; I can't guess why these sort levels take so long to load.

The ending is very anticlimactic. In fact, the last level is the shortest one of all. SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD And you don't even beat the mentor/boss yourself.

It is a short game and even if you are really slow in figuring out all puzzles (only two or three of which are really challenging) it would not last beyond 10 hours. 

I completed the game in a shade under 4hrs.

The only gripe I have with this game is that that there is no save in between the levels. If you exit the game somewhere in between, you will have to replay it from the last checkpoint. While it is not always a problem, some puzzles which require timing to see you through can pose problems if you have to redo them. 

Barring that one minor and entirely forgiveable flaw, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and how the time bending / stalling mechanics have been used to create puzzles.

I won't lie: the levels were pretty darn good: a 2-layered level design ('past' and 'future') where puzzle solving is central. When the snail comes in, you also get the ability to stop time. And those mechanics work well together (sort of like Lost vikings, but by far not as advanced). On top of that, it has beautiful graphics and sounds, so what more could you ask for...right?

Unfortunately, the game runs out of steam as it goes on. By the time you descend into metropolis, the puzzles lower in quality to an average point 'n click game, and almost suddenly it becomes nothing but basic platforming until the end. As said by others: it's short. That wouldn't be that bad (short games can be good too), but the storyline and boss battle seem to just be there because the developer ran out of money and/or ideas.

It was completely unnecessarily cruel and I didn't see what the game, the story or even the game designers got out of putting that into the game - it's like a silly idea during brainstorming that should have been thrown out for a much better puzzle.

- Former Mentor Turned Evil

Overall this game is nothing spectacular; it looks nice and plays well, but aside from a giant talking snail partner, it brings nothing new to the table. If you enjoy platforming and easy-moderate puzzles, this is a good way to spend a few hours.

It's executed very well for an indie game, but be warned there are a few game breaking oversights.

The devs must also have realized that the snail would break some puzzle solutions and therefore they sometimes arbitrarly don't alow you to call her to you. 

It's also very short. I finished it at 1,8 hours acording to steam and it would have been shorter had it not been for the fact that you can permanently get stuck in a chapter and since there are no mid chapter checkpoints, you can have to replay the entire chapter again. I would guess you would finish it in about 90 minutes in a blind playthrough. Yes the chapters are very short but you shouldn't force the player to replay the entire chapter if they quit mid chapter (did this once) or if something with the game phyiscs breaks (this happend two times). But the worst of theese where when you give away your timeswapper just before the final confrontation (because reasons...) in the end of the 7th chapter, if you are in the wrong world (the current timeline) you are permanently stuck since you can't interact with anything and the platforms that you move forward with does not excist in this timeline.

老爷爷的能力是穿梭于不同的时间节点，利用这一能力，他可以回到过去或者前进到未来。蜗牛的能力则是让时间静止到某一个时间节点上，在解决某些运动式机关的时候会起到关键作用。玩家切换老爷爷和蜗牛的4种能力，解开各种谜题，最终找到邪恶科学家。

游戏流程很短，虽然看上去有8章，但是每章只需要解决一个核心谜题就结束了，去掉挂卡时间通关只需要大约2-3小时。谜题设计还是很用心的，因为老爷爷的能力是时空穿梭，而不同的事物在不同的时间点的形态是不一样的，老爷爷还可以带着物体穿梭。

更为巧妙的是，蜗牛的能力也并不仅仅被用来静止一些杀伤性机关，对炮弹的滞空效果会让炮弹成为一个可落脚点。另外，场景里的人物活动同时静止容易被忽视但在关键时刻又会成为破解谜题的关键，菲菲好几次卡关都是因为没有重视小蜗牛，特此提醒。

由于游戏是小作坊出品，因此一些判定不是很合理，偶尔还会出现BUG，遇到这种情况不用慌张，利用穿梭时空能力让老爷爷死掉重来即可。复活点基本就是当前位置，不需要重头再来。游戏采用自动存档机制，因此玩家尽量打完一章再关闭游戏，反正不长。

场景互动基本都有提示，玩家要做的就是找到这些互动点，同时根据物体在不同时间点的形态差异，来推断过关方法。每种可拾取的物品都是有用的，如果暂时看不出怎么用就多走走，来回切换一下时间点，不要着急。

本作对操作的要求并不高，最后一小段路不能使用任何能力，但是很短，坚持过去就是胜利。总体来说是一款比较休闲的游戏，由于流程比较短，推荐打折或者入包时购买。",1482985683,1482985683,True,32,0,0.756084203720092773,1,False,False,False,False,,,

老爷爷和蜗牛CP：）简直太有爱，两个声优也选的很好。

小问题：
关卡主要以环境区分，玩法有些单一。
部分谜题设计没有提示可能会卡关。
情节展开有点仓促了。老爷爷和蜗牛关系的变化有些突兀。
关卡间也没什么起伏。最终关和其他关卡区分度不大略平淡。

Платформер-головоломка. Мы играем за старого ученого, который с помощью машины времени решил изменить мрачный и разрушенный мир, в такой каким он помнил его когда-то - живой, красочный, спокойный. Отправляясь в путешествие мы знакомимся с говорящей улиткой, способной останавливать время. С таким набором способностей нам не страшны любые преграды и мы с надоедливым другом отправляемся в опасное и интересное путешествие.

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
¥ Великолепная анимация, рисовка, декорации.
¥ Отличный саундтрек.
¥ Игра на русском языке (субтитры).
¥ Интересные для выполнения загадки.
¥ Удобное управление (на джойстике удобнее, но и на клаве все на уровне).
¥ Сочетание простого понятного всем юмора с глубокими мыслями о бытие.
¥ Каждый уровень красив и неповторим.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Один баг из-за которого пришлось проходить предпоследний уровень (во время передачи часов времени улитке нажал на возвращение в прошлое и после этого ничего вернуть было нельзя, как и проходить дальше),
¥ Нет достижений.
¥ Нет никаких пасхалок, скрытых мест или каких-то других бонусов.
¥ Слабый, скомканный сюжет.
¥ В игре очень мало уровней.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Начиналось все просто на уровне АХ и ОХ. Красивый мир, музыка, геймплей... Движемся вперед, узнаем историю, начинаем любить окружающий мир... А потом игра кончается... Продолжительность прохождения уж слишком маленькая, тут как минимум в два раза больше уровней надо... Ну да ладно... Чего нет того нет. А то, что есть оцениваю положительно.

L'histoire est plutôt rudimentaire, rien que de très classique pour ce genre de jeu. En gros, vous devez sauver le monde. Pour cela, vous disposez de deux aptitudes : arrêter le temps (et donc tout ce qui se trouve en mouvement) ou bien naviguer entre deux époques (avant et après, que sépare un certain nombre d'années, avec toutes les répercussions qu'on imagine).

Techniquement, ce n'est pas toujours très... propre, en particulier au niveau des sauts.

Chronology ist ein knuffiges kleines Game, das wirklich zu empfehlen ist.
Als alter Mann macht man sich auf den Weg, seinen Meister davor aufzuhalten eine ganze Stadt auszurotten.
Auf diesem ""epischem"" Abenteuer, begleitet Euch eine kleine Schnecke, die ebenfalls aus dieser Stadt kam.
Darüber ist der alte Mann zwar nicht sonderlich erfreut, da die Schnecke zwar nervig für den alten Herrn ist, aber auch nützlich.
Gelingt es Euch also, den Ablauf der Zeit zu verändern?

[*]Schöne Musik die sehr gut zum Spiel dazu passt.
[*]Steam-Sammelkarten.
[*]Das Spiel hat zwar volle Controllerunterstützung, ist aber auch genauso gut auf der Tastatur spielbar.
[*]Schöne Screenshotvorlagen.

Still, Chronology is a solid and colorful platformer with a clever use of the time traveling concept. While controlling the snail, you can also stop time, but I honestly feel it's not used much throughout the game.

Vous incarnez un vieil inventeur qui veut tenter d'empêcher la destruction du monde survenue après l'invention d'une machine très puissante.

Le gameplay est simple : vous vous servez d'une montre spéciale afin de jongler entre le passé d'avant la catastrophe et le présent désolé. Cette mécanique de jeu vous permettra de faire apparaitre des plateformes comme des arbres dans le présent ou des maisons dans le passé. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495728020 Lors des premiers chapitres du jeu la progression se fait sans heurts, on avance assez rapidement jusqu'à rencontrer un escargot. Ce dernier offrira de plus grandes possibilités de puzzles grâce à son pouvoir de figer le temps. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495728312 Ce pouvoir sera utile pour ralentir des plateformes, passer au travers de certains pièges ou encore pour actionner des leviers puis se déplacer sans que le mécanisme ne s'arrête. L'escargot sera aussi indispensable pour effectuer certains sauts puisqu'on pourra se placer sur son dos pour se rapprocher des plateformes. Il pourra aussi boucher des tuyaux crachant de la fumée ou des effluves toxiques afin de laisser notre inventeur passer etc...

Dans la seconde partie du jeu les puzzles deviennent plus intéressants, plus exigeants, sans être insurmontables. La réflexion sera au rendez-vous et il faudra jouer avec l'environnement autant qu'avec ses pouvoirs.

Scénaristiquement Chronology ne fait pas preuve de beaucoup d'originalité, il faudra simplement sauver le monde en arrêtant un savant fou. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495728113 On aura droit à quelques cinématiques dessinées à la main entre chaque niveaux, appréciables mais elles ne laissent pas un souvenir impérissable.

Les graphismes du jeu sont jolis, ses couleurs chatoyantes se rapprochent de celles d'un dessin animé avec des personnages attachants. Les quelques voix qui se feront entendre sont bien doublées elles-aussi et bien qu'il s'agisse d'un petit jeu on aura droit à des sous-titres français de bonne qualité.

En bref Chronology est un jeu vraiment sympathique dont l'intérêt réside principalement dans son gameplay et ses puzzles bien pensés. Vous auriez bien 2h-2h30 à lui consacrer ?

W grze wcielamy się w krasnoluda, który ma amnezję. Ląduje w znanej sobie okolicy, ale strasznie zniszczonej, jakby minęły lata od jego nieobecności. Po chwili orientuje się, że może manipulować czasem i cofać go o  parę? paręnaście? lat wstecz. Więc przeszkody musimy pokonywać wykorzystując tą umiejętność i pamiętając, że jak zrobimy coś w przeszłosci, w przyszłości okolica będzie wyglądała inaczej. Czasem też dopiero szybkie przełączanie miedzy przeszłością i przyszłością pozwala na przeskoczenie z punktu A do B, bo w żadnym czasie nie ma wystarczającej liczby elementów. Potem robi się jeszcze ciekawiej. Dołącza do nas bowiem ślimak, który może powstrzymywać niektóre pułapki i zatrzymywać czas. 

Wbrew pozorom, choć niektóre zadania są dość złożonę, grę można przejść w ciągu około 2 godzin. Nie jest irytująco trudno, jest tylko jak łamigłówka, którą trzeba rozwiązywać raz, za razem.

- SHORT
- After jumping character freezes for like 1 ms but it's long enough to take away from that smoothiness from gameplay.
- I don't think you were able to skip videos. (not sure about this)
- Absolutely zero replay value if you play in near future.
- Story (At least for me it was super boring.)

It it super short, only about 2 hours. The art and music are nice. I honestly couldn't tell you what the story was about, as it was pretty bare-bones, not captivating, and didn't make much sense. The voices of the characters are not fitting, especially the snail, which sounds like an 5 year old boy for some reason. There are multiple bugs. Items you have to use get stuck on your snail and you cannot pick them back up, making progressing impossible. This problem is furthered by the fact that there are no save points, if you quit the level you have to do the entire thing over. Luckily levels arent that long. Another big is sometimes things that should be interactable aren't, leaving you to spend some time switching time and hoping that it fixes itself. The other biggest problem is with puzzles. While many are cool and intuitive and make nice use of mechanics, some make no sense. Most of the time it's because you didn't know that object that looked to be part of the background was interactable. In one instance you're supposed to know that a light in the background can be jumped next to and that causes it to be knocked down, even though that's never happened before in the game, and there are other similar looking lights in the room but one is just usable for no reason. Usually when I looked up solutions I thought ""well how was I supposed to know I could use that, or that it would do that to that object, that has never happened earlier in the game and that's not reall reasonable"", or ""that looks like the background"". Also the platforming isn't that great, as your guy moves super slowly and jumping feels like he has lead weights tied around both ankles. Most of the jumps you have to make take multiple tries and you may just BARELY make one time even though you were standing on the very end of the ledge, and you just barely landed only half way on the other ledge.

One Part in Chapter 6..i couldnt pick up the flower anymore to give it to the old Lady. It needed 2 chapter restarts till it finally worked. Another Part was by fixing the saw..it didnt combine the 2 Parts..so another Chapter restart. Next Part in Chapter 7 i jump up to the Hook and it wont fall down after around 50 Jumps and restarting the chapter and replay everything i gave up..till im on another computer and see how it is working there.

[b]The Bad[/b]
The voice overs are quite absurd. I'm not sure if it is meant to be funny or just bad due to the budget constraints. The game isn't to glitchy, but you will notice you missing jumps you should make once in a while which can be annoying. There was at least twice where I tried a way to solve a puzzle and it failed because of this miss issue causing me to question my logic.

It's a puzzle platformer in appearance, but more akin to a point and click adventure game in structure. Time manipulation is introduced as the driving mechanic but then barely used in any interesting way, or completely forgotten for more tired adventure and platforming standards. There's this setup to an involving time travel narrative that's rather quickly exchanged for the dull relationship building between your character and a talking snail that does little but demonstrate that you're kind of a jerk.

All of Chronology's best ideas are left on the wayside for an experience that feels painfully typical. Puzzles are bland and extremely simple in construction, only ever becoming difficult do to the finicky interaction icon that makes it hard to discern what exactly you need to interact with, or the backgrounds which while beautiful tend to be hard to make out from objects in the foreground. Progression always felt tedious, puzzles slowing me down but providing no satisfaction to solve beyond the knowledge I'd never have to sluggishly make my way through them again.

There was a point when Chronology seemed promising, but it flounders around with its direction so long as to never feel cohesive or engaging. Its mechanics are disorganized, poorly implemented and rudimentary, and its narrative may as well not exist for as little substance as it has. The artwork is wonderful, but animations are choppy and the lack of vsync made for omnipresent screen tearing. It feels like a game formed in a puzzle platformer mold, with a handful of modifications having been made to differentiate it from the pack that probably did more harm than good in the long run.",1418700218,1418700218,False,8,1,0.548545956611633301,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Но слишком уж красиво выглядели скриншоты и чересчур вкусно звучали в аннотации «попытки исправить настоящее с помощью прошлого и будущего». В итоге же потенциально философская, довольно взрослая тема была безнадёжно потеряна плохим сценарием. Так для кого же этот проект? Не стоит держать интригу: он только для тех игроков, которым понравился художественный стиль по скриншотам. Однако вы видите «синюю» рекомендацию, потому что для семейного прохождения Хронология может сгодиться.

Вообще к игре уже с первых секунд можно задать несколько вопросов. Например, почему разработчики сделали игру абсолютно линейной. Даже укромных уголков или пасхалок здесь не найдёте (наверно, поэтому тут нет достижений). Какого-либо бонуса после прохождения игры тоже нет, так спрашивается: зачем делать головоломку, которую совершенно не имеет смысла перепроходить?

Проблемы тут и у сценария. В проекте, явно ориентированном на детскую аудиторию, создатели попытались придать серьёзности характеру Изобретателя. Получилось не ахти. Конечно, хорошо, что отношение главного героя к своему напарнику – Улитке – постоянно меняется, но, во-первых, хронометраж очень сжат, чтобы хорошо раскрыть характеры, а во-вторых, в игре ни разу не ставился акцент одновременно на двух персонажах: в начале игры во главу угла ставили Изобретателя, после середины – Улитку. Сразу оба они в центре внимания не были ни разу.

Их взаимоотношения – это тоже что-то с чем-то: как бы главный герой не относился к своей попутчице, она всегда будет глупо улыбаться и даже не попытается поддержать зарождающийся конфликт. Законами театра (о конфликтах) пренебрегать не стоит и в играх. Пример: Улитка достала Изобретателя болтовнёй. Тот на неё накричал, а ей как будто всё равно – стоит в стороне с глупой улыбкой. Ровно через одну головоломку Изобретатель её прощает (причём, в корыстных целях – она ему нужна, чтобы дальше пройти), и что бы вы думали? Прекратит Улитка болтать? Ничего подобного! Во второй части игры Улитка рассказывает о своём нелёгком прошлом. Истории действительно неплохие, даже пробирающие, но! Неужели нельзя было нарисовать её мордочку в это время огорчённой, напуганной, разозлённой – какой угодно другой, только без идиотской улыбочки? Хотя, о чём это я, - у неё нет даже анимации движения влево по экрану – влево она ползёт задом! А интерактивные объекты анимированы вполне себе неплохо: может, стоило поставить акцент на главных героях в вопросе анимации?

Головоломки в принципе неплохи и логичны, но с сюжетом не связаны никак. В той же Botanicula во время прохождения игрок нередко сам решает: помочь второстепенному персонажу или проигнорировать. Это давало приятнейшее ощущение, которое чувствуешь, когда кому-то искренне помог. В Chronology помощь не вызывает ровным счётом никаких эмоций. Даже забавные гуканья немногочисленных встречных незнакомцев не особо радуют. Также накладываются нелепые ограничения в головоломках, вроде невозможности позвать улитку просто потому что.

У игры четыре явных плюса: забавный визуальный стиль, хорошая музыка (хотя и без откровений), её скромная цена и короткая продолжительность, из-за которой она не успевает надоесть. В минусы же записывается всё остальное: скомканный, никакущий финал, ничтожно малое количество задач, слабый, клишированный сюжет, хотя рассказать о фишках со временем и последствиях решений можно было бы много и обстоятельно. На ум приходит Bastion с одной из главных тем сюжета: последствия принятых решений и невозможность избежать того, что зависит от человечества в целом. Ничего даже близкого к этому в Хронологии нет.

Хотя все претензии к сюжету, продолжительности и головоломкам беспочвенны, если вспомнить, что проект явно ориентирован на аудиторию младшего возраста. Эта игра семейная, удовольствие от неё получат всё-таки дети, а не взрослые. Задачки потому и простые: родители если что подскажут, что нужно делать. Также игра подойдёт тем, кто ищет симпатичную игру с несложными, но всё же интересными головоломками. Другой аудитории игра, скорее всего, покажется излишне простой, короткой и имеющей слабый сюжет и не особо интересных персонажей. В любом случае, в жанре приключенческих сказок Хронология – абсолютно проходной проект.

It's nothing groundbreaking, even though it offers a unique time-travel based mechanics (more like just two parallel 2D worlds between which you jump to solve puzzles, oh, and you can stop time). It's pretty close to Braid, Limbo, Fez, Swapper and many other indie puzzle platformers where basically every next puzzle is a scripted thing which you just need to figure out.
I think it took me an evening to complete it (dunno why it shows I only played it only for 2 hours).. The artwork is good, music too, the puzzles are interesting. As with most puzzle games, after the game is completed, there is nothing to come back to - so well, no replay value, but for the small price it's fine.
SPOLIERS AHEAD
I found 2 bugs and had to restart chapters 2 and 7 cuz I was stuck. Namely, in chapter 2 the plant for some reason wouldn't grow in the future after I planted it - the bug wasn't there the next time I restarted the chapter. In chapter 7 the cannon puzzle got completely broken for me. Namely, every vertical shot would result in a cannon loaded with a fireball, even though the fire wasn't running between the tubes - I guess this happened after I put a few balls on fire and shot them. Also, the water wouldn't extinguish the fire on the door after I shot 2 balls on fire at the door in a row. You can imagine that such bugs are especially nasty when you don't know how to solve the puzzle on the first playthru and still experiment with things to kind of ""brute-force"" solve it - only to find out that the puzzle is bugged. And no save feature - had to redo the whole chapter 7 once again and watch a walkthru - and it worked. Was also stuck with the phone puzzle in chapter 6 until I just watched a walkthru for that piece - didn't guess you can reach the lamp in a jump.
Anyway, a good game, 7/10.
I hope this will be one of the last games in this row of indie platformers cuz frankly I think people are pretty much bored with all of them by now, much like by 2002 everyone was bored with the RTS genre.

I can see how this game would be appealing to a younger audience or those new to the genre.

Except for the length. This is a very short game and I was able to beat it in less than 2 hours.

This game feels heavily underdevelopped. The time travel and time stopping mechanics are interesting, but very little is actually done with them. There are only two time periods that you can jump between (not too bad, but I've seen better) and very rarely did the actual passing of time between them come to play. More often than not, you might as well have been jumping between parallel universes or something along those lines.

The time stopping is also rarely utilized and with a handful of exeptions, usually to make stationary things that could have been stationary to begin with. Altough, looking back, I think I also missed a few opportunities to use this ability to make the timed platforming easier. Overall, I found that I mostly forgot about this ability and when it came to the puzzles, it was one of the last things I tried applying, unless the need was obvious.

Overall, the concepts in this game had potential. But I don't feel like they were fully realized. I was missing more inteplay between different mechanics and elements in the game. More use of the time travel aspect of this game about time travel. More mixing different mechanics in with the platforming.",1405247699,1405247699,False,39,1,0.748037993907928467,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Вони мають обмежені ресурси і бюджет, але навіть з дріб’язку можливостей вичавлюють максимум. Сподіваюся, що в майбутньому ситуація зміниться, і таких творців обов'язково підтримають не тільки гравці, а й чесні видавці.Сьогодні хочу представити чудовий незалежний проект під назвою Chronology. Гра створена невеликою студією Osao Games. Вона являє з себе пригодницький платформер, приправлений безліччю головоломок.
  Сюжет цієї забавки кожен може трактувати по-своєму. Для мене — це історія про велику силу, якій через людський егоїзм та недосконалість не місце у цьому світ. Хоч це і не відкривається відразу в центрі перед гравцем, але це та база, та істина, заради якої ми й будемо проходити гру. Розчарувавшись у своєму вчителеві, головний герой, професор Алхімії збирає манатки й вирушає у мандри, аби виправити їхню з вчителем помилку. За час біганини по лісі на початковому рівні професор знаходить собі друга — Равлика, який протягом гри буде його найбільшим помічником. Ці події і є нашою відправною точкою у довгу мандрівку, сповнену пригод.
  Ґеймплейна складова від жанрових рамок гри далеко не відходить, хоча й розбавлена всілякими маніпуляціями з часом та цікавими головоломками, але це просто констатація факту. Декілька слів про головоломки. Вони не є якимись занадто складними, а спрямовані швидше на людську увагу (тобто на повну її відсутність), а також на кмітливість і винахідливість.

Скажу чесно, мені знадобилося трохи звикнути до подібного, адже після ігор, де думати не прийнято, доволі важко було налаштуватися на загальний настрій та темп гри. Забавки з часом, для мене не дивина, щось подібне було і в тому ж Braid, а також в одному з моїх найулюбленіших шутерів — Singularity. Тобто творці не винаходили велосипеда, а просто скористалися досвідом інших розробників. Але потрібно віддати їм належне, вони все ж змогли гармонійно поєднати всі свої задуми в одному художньому творі. Основу ж гри складає, як завжди, біганина та стрибки. Це може й набриднути, але вже на фінальних титрах, якщо ви не застрягнете на якомусь квесті. Нам дають можливість побавитися з часом, тобто ми можемо „перемотати“ його вперед або ж назад. Мало того, що це дуже цікава й важлива ґеймплейна фішка, так ще й така можливість докорінно може змінити представлену нами локацію. Так звана часова рамка before (до) — показує нам живу і яскраву картинку. А after (після) — представляє нам темний і розорений рівень.

Виходить, що ми будь-якої миті можемо побачити два альтернативних світи. Але попри навіть таке різноманіття на деяких рівнях розробники трохи перестаралися з барвами. Особливої уваги заслуговують кат-сцени, хоч вони й представлені тут в якості малюнків, але їхня якість просто шедевральна, вони не тільки милують око ай доповнюють прогалини в сюжеті, одразу відчувається рука майстра. Chronology має стандартну для жанру графіку. Перед нами чудовий акварельний стиль та охайний візуальний ряд. Тобто канонів гра дотримується. 
  Звуковий супровід у Chronology лагідний та ненав'язлививий. Музика не тільки підкреслює загальний настрій забавки, а й надає додаткових ноток атмосфері. До озвучки також немає ніяких претензій, голоси головних героїв та другорядних персонажів повністю відповідають їхнім характерам.
  Chronology поки що найкращий інді-платформер у який я грав. Найбільше гра зачарувала мене своєю заплутанною історією, а також реалізацією ґеймплейних задумок. Графіка не вражає особливими ефектами, але побудова рівнів та їхнє забарвлення не залишать гравця байдужим. Маніпуляції з часом надають деякого контрасту грі та є смачнючим відром родзинок, потрібних жанру платформерів. Головний герой та його друг, стають для нас добрими супутниками упродовж подорожі. А звуковий супровід просто милує вуха.

Pros
Great concept
Art was pretty fun to look at and most of the time very well done
Loved the cannon exit door puzzle (needed more like that)

Cons
Character/Story Design very one-dimension (give your characters real names for pete sake! The ending was real lack laster - the disappointing payoff spurred me to write this review.)
Bland Puzzles (i think some were entertaining, but none went too far past simple platforming and bring this object back in time.)
Controls a bit awkward on PC. (I dont understand why the menu screens pull up so slow)



If you're looking for something as clever as Braid, this is not it, but it'll hold your attention for a few hours.
Recommend for Kids YES. Recommend for everyone else - eh maybe hold off til this goes on sale.

First, it's a very short  game, it takes 2-3 hours to finish everything and it has not really challenging puzzles. It's very linear too, so you better not get stuck somewhere because you are forced to progress solving one puzzle after another.

Second, it has a few action-platformer and adventure elements but doesn't succeed at these either as they are developed/presented in a very simple way and are not original at all.

Finally, although I felt it had potential at first, the game mechanics turn out to be too simple to create complex and interesting puzzles and probably that's why they ended up with this short and easy game. Anyway, I believe they could have made better puzzles.

Каждый уровень можно посещать в прошлом и будущем, действия совершенные в прошлом повлияют на уровень в будущем. Встреченный спутник - Улитка (второй игровой персонаж) может ползать по стенам и потолкам и (одна из важных особенностей) осанавливать время.
Игра, в целом, простая и короткая: 8 уровней по 5-10 минут (если знаешь как проходить). Некоторые загадки заставляют поломать голову, первое прохождение может занять до 2-х часов.

Минусы: легкость, всего 8 уровней, и, я думаю, несколько завышенная цена, как для такой короткой игры.
Плюсы: все остальное - впечатление от игры в целом приятное. Жалко денег - берите, когда скидка. Думаю, не пожалеете.

It's definitely worth a playthrough, and I would recommend it, but I'll try to keep my thoughts concise enough to be helpful.

Pros:
-Interesting gameplay concept.  I had a lot of fun just conceptually with the idea of not only switching between two versions of the levels, but more importantly controlling the two characters in tandem.  It was a lot of fun, and the game's strongest point.
-The game, while in a level, feels extremely responsive and well crafted.  Switching between the Old Inventor and the Snail is very fast, as is changing the time period.  Moving around and platforming feels good, rewarding and all around pleasant.  While there are a few quirks here and there, they're to be expected, and overall I think the dev team did a wonderful job making sure the play experience during levels was enjoyable.
-Every one of the game's backgrounds is a delight to look at.  The art is cartoony, and fits the feel of the game extremely well.  The music, as well, made my playthrough immersive and pleasant.  I'd very much recommend dropping the $3 on the OST.

Cons:
-Length:  The game, to be honest, felt really just too short.  The length of the levels would be fine, but the difficulty was a far cry from... well, difficult.  Admittedly subjective, but as someone who isn't that great at puzzle games, I breezed through this one almost without stopping.  I was stumped for a very brief moment on one or two parts, but otherwise it was more about the experience of playing the game, rather than solving any puzzles.
-Out-of-gameplay experience:  While the actual platforming and game mechanics felt amazing, the rest of the game left much to be desired.  With no ability to skip cutscenes, replaying the game feels needlessly cumbersome.  The inability to set custom controls was harshly felt, as by default my controller defauled to using the top face button for jump.  I had to go into my controller's settings and re-map the buttons to match up with hte game's control scheme, and that was not appreciated.  There was also no option to change the resolution of the game, only toggle between fullscreen and windowed  It is possible to resize the window, but it would still be appreciated, having defaults in the menu that resize it to maintain window ratio for recording or just comfort purposes

Final Thoughts/Summary:  Chronology is a fun, interesting title, albeit on the easy and short side, with a cute story and a lot to offer aesthetically.  Mandatory cutscenes and no custom control mapping curbed my appetite for replaying the game, but I would still recommend it for a single playthrough.  At a $10 pricetag, ($8 early sale at the time) however, and most of my on record gameplay time coming from leaving the game running while afk, I wouldn't recommend picking it up unless it greatly interests you.  If a future update were to fix the issues, however, I would love replaying the stages and finding little quirks in the gameplay.",1400141829,1400141829,True,2,0,0.517374515533447266,0,False,False,False,False,,,

An expertly crafted platformer, the game boasts a beautiful art style to complement its sharp gameplay. The story is simple, but effective. An unnamed, elderly inventor is determined to find his shady mentor after one of the pair's contraptions causes apocalyptic destruction. Along the way, the inventor encounters a friendly snail with the ability to freeze time. Combined with the old man's penchant for traveling from past to present, the slimy companion introduces a unique gameplay structure.
     The player alternates between the two characters in order to solve brilliantly designed puzzles oriented around manipulating time in order to alter the landscape and circumvent obstacles. The snail's shell serves as a movable platform that can be used to cross gaps, sawblades can be halted in mid-air, and impassible walls in the past become ruined structures in the present. Switching time periods in the middle of a jump can turn certain doom into a saving ledge or platform. These basic mechanis build and combine in interesting and challenging ways as the levles progress. One particularly creative head scratcher involves multiple time switches, an anvil, and flaming cannonballs, all to simply open a door. 
     The game's visual design is superb. Colorful character models and environments seem to pop off the screen. The bright wimsy of ""before"" transforms into the dark, dilapidated melancholy of ""after."" The contrast underscores the narrative's focus on regret and the consequences of terrible decisions. Puzzle construction also reinforces this relationship. In one of the game's shining moments, a decision made concerning a young child in the past has subtly profound implications in the present. 
     While the time spent in ""Chronology's"" world is welcome, it does not last forever. The entire experience can be completed in around 2.5-3 hours, leaving the player with a distinct-- and regrettably brief--brush with greatness. Osao Games should be commended for this effort, a game that merges artistic integrity and ambition with incredibly enjoyable platforming mechanics. Warning: ""Chronolology"" also contains blatant disregard for the laws of the space-time continuum.

I finished it in about 2-2.5 hours, and that was with some futzing around trying to solve puzzles. If the length of the game is enough to deter you, then I'd let this one pass. Otherwise, read on...

The game is a platforming puzzle game that mimics the artwork and feel of Teslagrad, Vessel, and Limbo, but with the mechanics of something like Braid. You are an old man who wakes up in a strange place and need to figure out where you are. He discovers his lost timepiece and with it, the ability to control time. You use the device to travel between past and future, altering the world in ways that allow you to overcome puzzles and advance to new areas. You can interact with certain objects in the environment, carry them with you between worlds, and use them in the past to influence the future, etc.
This is inherently the difficulty in the game: figuring out how to manipulate the past to affect the future, etc.

About a third of the way in, you meet a snail companion, who also has an uncanny ability; he can stop time. Together, you must use your powers to help the other succeed.

The puzzles are clever and challenging, but nothing that will keep you too stumped. The platforming is ok, and sometimes it's a bit frustrating, but it's nothing that's too unforgiving or would make you want to put it down.

The music is pretty good and fits well with the game ambience.

If you don't mind a short game that's more pleasing with the visuals and music, then this one is worth a go. I might suggest waiting for the price to come down, but <$10 isn't too bad.",1400026602,1400026602,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can only remember one occation where it really felt you had made an impact on a person - and even felt kinda bad for it.

The game was Greenlit on Steam last year only for the original development company, Progressive Media, to fold beneath it. Fortunately, former team members wanted to see the game come out, and formed Osao Games to complete work.

A lot of times it can be worrisome when a game changes hands like this, but the final product is a thoroughly charming experience that should be a staple of everyone's Steam library.

The gameplay centres around a two-character mechanic: a little old inventor, and his trusty companion, the snail. Neither character is given a name beyond that, but neither do they really need them. The inventor is able to travel back and forth between two time periods: 'Before' and 'After' the cataclysm which starts the game. The snail is able to stop time, but her hard shell also serves as a positionable platform for the inventor to stand upon. While in some cases, that merely gives an option to ease up a tricky platforming section, in other cases it's critical to solving puzzles.

This means, to address the elephant in the room, that Chronology really doesn't play like Braid at all. The intended effect, per the developers, is something like a cross between Day of the Tentacle and Lost Vikings. It's not a bad comparison, really-- you'll find yourself constantly adjusting the environment in one time to affect the other (taking boxes from After into Before, growing plants in Before to solve puzzles in After, and so on), and you'll need to use both Inventor and Snail's abilities to their fullest to figure out some of the harder tricks.

What's most impressive here is just how thoroughly the game hybridizes puzzle and platforming. You're never making a series of annoying jumps just to get to the next puzzle-- the question of how to set up those jumps <i>is</i> the puzzle. Chronology never pulls a new gimmick out of nowhere only to drop it after a single puzzle: it teaches you how to solve the doozies by teaching the components singly and then expecting you to put the pieces together.

And believe me, there are some <i>hard</i> puzzles in there. They make logical sense when you figure them out-- more than once, I found myself saying aloud, ""Oh, that's clever!"" -- but there were a few where I must have spent ten or fifteen minutes trying different things before the obvious-in-retrospect solution came to mind.

It's not a fast-paced game: you can always take a leisurely look at the puzzles to see what you have to do, and there are only a couple where twitch movement is even at all necessary. Good timing is often important (learn to switch times mid-jump) but the game is overall pretty forgiving. You have unlimited lives and you always respawn at a convenient spot when you inevitably fall to your death (or fall into toxic waste, or die to a sawblade, or drown...). The closest thing to a fly in the ointment in that respect is the fact that the game only saves at chapter breaks. Chapters are short enough that I can't complain, but I don't recommend quitting out mid-level after just finishing a tricky puzzle.

The game is fully voice-acted, which was a pleasant surprise. Of particular note is Nicki Rapp voicing the snail: recently she's been in Broken Age as Dead Eye Courtney, and Walking Dead as Lilly (and let's never forget Psychonauts, of course). The inventor is played by Brett Dunnelly, who gives him a pleasantly crotchety character. The background music is thoroughly pleasant, providing an excellent enhancement to the game, easily manipulating tension. It's well worth picking up right on its own.

The graphics-- well, they hardly need mention, but that's not because of anything bad to them! The cartoony art is downright gorgeous both still and in motion, and the attention to detail is wonderful. I'll gladly hand in a few points of gamer cred to admit that when I saw that when the snail backs up, the little red lights on her shell flash, I squealed like a little girl. Osao definitely went the whole nine yards here, even in places where they could have cut corners. Before and After are never identical-- After's ruined world skews broken supports, twists platforms, grows every tree. The game is outright beautiful.

The story is, for its part, a bit unremarkable. I don't honestly mind that-- it goes well with the cartoonish art style, and it's quite well-told. I can't call it light-hearted, given that it starts with an apocalypse, but it's consistently upbeat. The story respects itself well enough to be played straight-- it's never smug or condescending. No, instead it's a perfectly servicable children's story, and there's a lot of charm to it.

The game itself is a bit on the short side, but it knows to get out while the going's good. While I think another level or two wouldn't have hurt the game, it never wears out its welcome.

Was haben ein alter Mann, eine sprechende Schnecke und Zeitreisen miteinander zu tun? Nun, sie stellen allesamt tragende Elemente im neuen Indie-Adventure Chronology dar. In liebevollem Zeichenstil verpackt dürft ihr in diesem Greenlight-Titel aus dem Hause osao games wechselweise in der Rolle eines alten Erfinders und bereits erwähnter Schnecke allerlei Rätsel und Sprung-Passagen meistern.

Der betagte Herr erwacht alleine bei strömendem Regen in einer düsteren, trostlosen Gegend, ohne irgendeine Erinnerung, wie er in diese missliche Situation gelangt ist. Einem vertrauten Ticken folgend entdeckt er kurz darauf eine seiner Erfindungen: Eine Taschenuhr, mit der es möglich ist, zwischen der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit zu wechseln. Diese Fähigkeit gekonnt einzusetzen, wird dem Spieler auch sogleich im nächsten Level abverlangt. Sprungeinlagen, die nur mithilfe der Zeitreise schaffbar sind stehen ebenso auf dem Plan wie gewitzte Rätselpassagen, die von der gelungen umgesetzten Spielmechanik Gebrauch machen.

Ziel des Spiels ist es, die verwüstete Gegenwart wieder in Ordnung zu bringen. Wie sich herausstellt, ist unser namenloser Ingenieur nämlich garnicht so unschuldig am aktuellen Zustand der Spielwelt. Tatkräftige Unterstützung erhält er bei diesem Vorhaben vor allem von einer freundlichen, sprechenden Riesenschnecke, die er während seiner Reise am Wegesrand aufliest. Wäre ein quatschendes Weichtier nicht schon kurios genug, kann der sympathische Begleiter auf Knopfdruck sogar die Zeit anhalten.

Wobei Knopfdruck hier ein gutes Stichwort ist: Die Steuerung ist sehr eingängig und simpel, die jeweilige Spezialfähigkeit der beiden Helden wird durch einen einzigen Tastendruck eingesetzt. Zwischen den Charakteren kann ebenso einfach gewechselt werden und ansonsten bedient sich Chronology dem typischen Jump’n’Run-Standard, um die Sprungpassagen bewältigen zu können.

Das etwa dreistündige Abenteuer wird durch den angenehmen Soundtrack und den wunderschönen, bunten Zeichenstil der Assets auch zu einem audio-visuellem Erlebnis. Leider scheint das Spiel intern auf eine Auflösung von gerade einmal 1280×720 festgelegt zu sein, was vor allem dem Standard heutiger PC-Spiele nicht mehr entspricht. Im Vollbildmodus sieht das Spiel auf 1080p- oder gar 1440p-Bildschirmen daher leider unschön verschwommen aus; eventuell wird hier aber ja noch nachgebessert. Ansonsten nutzt das Spiel die Features der Steamworks-Umgebung bis auf die Spielstand-Cloud leider nicht, Achievement-Hunter und Kartensammler werden außenvor gelassen.",1399911104,1399911104,True,6,0,0.584968745708465576,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The puzzles and platforming give quite a challenge while not making you want to ram a keyboard through your monitor. All of this is welcome, but that just makes it all the more sad when the game comes to an end. It gave me a few hours of play with a great and satisfying story. I just wanted more. I guess that’s really my only complaint is that I wasn’t ready for Chronology to be over when it was. If they were to create a full scale game based off of this, I would pick that up in a heartbeat.

Full Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com

Chronology is a pleasant way to spend a lazy afternoon or three. The stew of world-morphing, co-op characters, time-freezing, delayed device effects, and character-as-platform give a lot of grist to the puzzle-making designers, and the light platforming keeps the experience from being a snooze. But bring a controller.

The snail is useful as in you can hop on the snail's shell then switch control to the snail and go for a ride and jump off the shell to a higher platform, and it can slide along the games surfaces to reach area's the inventor cannot reach.

I know what you're thinking. Another platformer, another day, right? Same old, same old? With the copious amounts of platforming games available on Steam, what makes Chronology worth a purchase?

Chronology, thankfully, gives you a lot of reasons.

As described in the trailer, you play as an older gentleman and his friend, a snail. The present time in the game is set after an apocalyptic event, and using a special device he invented, the old man can travel back and forth through time at will. The snail (who has some sort of robotic shell) can stop time. Together they use these abilities to progress further, to tackle challenges, and to save the world from destruction.

The very first thing you see here is the art of the game; no lame, overused, big pixel graphics here. The world is beautifully exhibited in the past time and hauntingly dark in the present time. The overall look can be described as having been painted on a canvas; Osao Games, developer of Chronology, seems to be inspired by Studio Ghibli in terms of artistry here, and it shows: attention to detail, such as curtains blowing in the wind as you pass them add a definite touch. The transitions going from past to present give a stark contrast: former architecture in the past has broken down in the future, vegetation takes over parts of a city; it's little things like these that add so much to the visuals.

The music here fits in well and is very, very awesome, ranging from happy, to urgent, to bleak, to pensive, and it seems that every scene you are in is complemented perfectly by a fitting musical score; whoever made the music to this, you get my props for that one, man. The audio for the rest of the world is vibrant and gets the job done. Voice acting in this is great, which surprised me. I didn't expect this level of quality in the audio!

The gameplay here is simple. You can utilize a gamepad or the computer keyboard's arrow keys + spacebar. Controls here are tight, and work really well and are very simple. The platforming aspect of the game is transformed through the use of the time machine in your possession; landscapes change from the past to the present. This leads to very cool and unique platforming (for example, jumping whilst in the present, using the time machine, then landing on a ledge in the past). Other puzzles include planting a tree in the past in order to climb up it in the present. The potential uses of time here are great, and it adds much needed fun to the dry platformer genre. 

The developers made an excellent choice by telling you the controls, and then they let you play. That's it. You are in control, and you learn how to tackle the game's puzzles on your own. Once you meet your snail friend, they'll give you a small clue on where to use her time-stopping powers, but other than that, it's all on you, and I love it for that. It's rewarding when you figure out a puzzle through your own assumption; that being said, more experienced people will sort of breeze through some puzzles, but even I got stuck at a cleverly designed puzzle at times.

The only negatives I could see to this game include minor audio bugs, which most likely will be sorted out, and some players may find it a bit easy to get through as it is relatively short, and the final climax at the end is slightly underwhelming. However, this game is solid at almost every level.

Overall, I'd recommend Chronology for anyone, at any age. It's an awesome game that rekindled my love of platforming games in a time where I didn't seem to like them anymore. It's unique, fun, simple, and just generally great. It's worth $9.99, definitely, if this kind of game interests you, although I wouldn't shy away from a discounted price.

If I had to give this game a numeric rating, it'd be a 9/10.",1399556027,1399560011,True,25,1,0.72042316198348999,0,False,False,False,False,,,
