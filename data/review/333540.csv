The game itself, though, is very fun and a unique concept. It at first seems very complex, but the tutorials explain everything well and are thankfully quite short. There is a lot of depth to be discovered in these mechanics, and I imagine even more if playing with other people, since when you add in the social aspect, there is a whole new layer of manipulation and bluffing that can be done. Unfortunately, the AI does not allow for this and is not particularly competent, although it is good when you're starting off and still learning, and isn't so bad that it isn't fun to mess around with them.

The commentary that is so obviously part of this game is really well done, all the actions you take (when thought of symbolically) make a lot of sense in the real world and puts into perspective, both how absurd the game is, as well as our real world, when you do something like take liquidate your assets in Africa in order to take control over North America, just to ratify a free-trade agreement.

TLDR: Jarring execution of a confused concept.

Game unfolds slowly, seems like turns increase in lenght as game goes on. Game feels very indirectly controlled, have to buy majority votes. Income is vaguely explained. Have to sell ur votes to put in bank account to win, but u need votes to control stuff, but you need to sell the votes to have money. Its just a little confusing and feels clunky. Needless to say I havent exactly been a powerhouse usually just checking out the user interface and the policy trees in one or two places before the AI takes over because a timer ran out.  

You are also supposed to be there to destroy the world with neocolonialism but all you really do is modernize infrastructures, open free trade, and try to argue over treaties with the A.I. so I am not sure how dystopian this game really is but I never seemed to find that layer. Game map is upside down which, you get used to it mainly because this makes more affordable votes more proeminently on display.

[i]Neocolonialism[/i] is an excellent game whose brevity and simplicity belies a profound critique of capitalism. Designed as a ""Marxist strategy game"", [i]Neocolonialism[/i] challenges the player to ruin the world by playing as a member of the bourgeoisie. In that capacity, the player must invest their capital throughout the world to purchase votes, which is then utilized to accumulate more capital. The player wins by possessing the most capital in their Swiss bank account by the end of the twelfth turn, which is achieved by liquidating their assets (namely, purchased votes). At the end of twelve turns (each turn comprising three phases), the world has been ruined, ostensibly due to the consequences that capitalism inexorably produces.

[h1]Analysis[/h1]
The Marxist influence in [i]Neocolonialism[/i] is obvious to anyone familiar with Marxist theory. Capital is dead labor and it is invested in order to generate living labor, which is then transformed into more dead labor and accumulated as such. This process, called capital accumulation, is inherent in capitalism. The state, as an organ of class rule, is used by owners of capital (capitalists) to facilitate their accumulation of capital through corruption. This is an unavoidable consequence of capitalism precisely because capital is what determines economic power and it is the owners of that capital who ultimately own society, including institutions such as the state. This ownership by the bourgeoisie (capitalists as a class) is due to their ownership of the means of production, which forms the productive and economic base for society. The bourgeoisie acts in this way due to their shared class interest, namely the accumulation and utilization of capital to reproduce the material conditions of capitalism and their favorable position therein.

[i]Neocolonialism[/i] succinctly encapsulates how capitalism as a system compels economic actors to perform according to the rules of that system. As a player, you are compelled by the rules of the game to invest and accumulate capital, despite knowing that the result of playing the game entails everyone losing regardless of who the winner may eventually be. Nevertheless, you compete with other players according to those rules because your success depends on it. This is similar to how capitalists in the real world compete in the global market in accumulating capital and liquidating it into offshore bank accounts, despite how playing by the rules of capitalism entails disastrous results.

For that reason, it makes no sense to blame this or that capitalist, just as it is absurd to blame the politicians they bought, because they are all performing rationally according to the rules of capitalism. The culpability is in the system itself: the consequences of capitalism are caused by the system of rules which govern the actions of its participants, not by the participants who are simply following those rules. Therefore, a rational response to this is to change the system of rules itself, not to simply depose this or that actor.

[i]Neocolonialism[/i] illustrates this by its very existence: the world is ruined ultimately because of the nature of the game, not simply because one chooses to participate in it. Regardless of whether the player personally participates in the game, others invariably will and they will be compelled by the same rules that any player would face, and it is those very rules which are to blame for the results of playing the game so long as there are players compelled to play it (and unaware of an alternative).

But why is it called [i]Neocolonialism[/i]? When the player decides to invest their capital, the most prudent initial investments are those which cost the least capital. The capital cost of a region is principally determined by its economic development and infrastructure. Lesser developed regions will therefore cost less capital to invest. These are the necessary conditions for neocolonialism: capitalists engage in economic imperialism by exploiting less developed regions to maximize profits and use the economic power they accumulate through this exploitation to control the development of those regions, which is done order to guarantee that the conditions in those regions serve their interests. In the game, players demonstrate this by investing in the least developed regions, accumulating capital through those investments, and utilizing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to either accelerate capital accumulation or impede regional development. In doing so, players essentially simulate Marxian theory of neocolonialism.

[h1]Recommended?[/h1]
I definitely recommend [i]Neocolonialism[/i] to anyone interested in Eurogame-style strategy games, especially those familiar with Marxist theory. Although the game design is rather simple, and the game options are very limited, [i]Neocolonialism[/i] nevertheless provides an enjoyable and educational experience with an inevitably bittersweet end.

Would I recommend [i]Neocolonialism[/i] for its current retail price of $3.99 (USD)? If you have money to spare, you really want the game, and you are aware of its quality, then I don't think you will regret your purchase. If you have reservations, however, or you would prefer to not spend that much money on the game, then maybe you should attempt to acquire [i]Neocolonialism[/i] through other means, such as winning it on a giveaway site or purchasing it when it is bundled or on sale. I was given this game by a friend who knew I would like it, and I certainly did. Maybe you will, too.",1465089556,1465090532,True,21,0,0.601312577724456787,0,False,False,False,False,,,

¥ Музыка (главная тема хороша - скрипка)
¥ Возможность онлайн игры с друзьями (правда найти друзей которые захотят покупать эту игру, ради сомнительного удовольствия думаю очень трудно будет)

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Перевернутая карта мира (в комментах бытует мнение, что разработчики сделали ее такой чтобы подчеркнуть циничность игры или что в реальных событиях такого быть не может, а значит только в перевернутом мире возможно то, что происходит в игре, но мне все равно... Мне неудобно)
¥ Отсутствие игроков в онлайн режиме (за час не одной даже закрытой игры замечено не было)
¥ Свобода действий очень ограничена.
¥ Нет достижений.
¥ Нет русского языка (этот минус безусловно самый главный, в игре довольно трудное введение в игру которое требует довольно сильного владения английским) (мне пришлось переводить со словариком) (уж обучение могли и запилить на других языках)

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Если бы обучение было на русском, если бы карту перевернули, если бы были достижения, я бы купил игру для пары друзей и гонял бы в нее. Но копаться палкой в куче навоза, зная, что в ней ничего нет и удовольствия от этого я не получу - не охота. Как думаю наврятли захочется и вам. Не рекомендую.

The AI in this game is horrible and gives you no challenge.

Secondly, this game is slow, and I'm not talking about how a match plays out but the game itself is incredibly slow. It appears to be constantly calculating something, however as there isn't really much to calculate its very puzzling why this game is so laggy. And it also appears to be prone to crashes.

The ""inverted"" world map serves no purpose other than to let you know how edgy the developer is by making you think aobut the world view and how it is centered on the developed world. Well, I don't think anybody who'll play this doesn't know this already and the map will just make it harder for you to find the regions you're looking for, because it won't be in the place you're used to.

I actually remember seeing this game and its developer in some video a couple years back and the way he described it made me excited for it. The final version which is at last here does leave a lot to be desired for however. As I alluded to at the start, if you're going to play this with other people you might find some enjoyment here, other than that I can't really recommended it.

Le concept est génial à partir du moment où on aime l'humour noir. L'ambiance est minimaliste, musique agaçante, mappemonde tristounette, icônes faites sous Paint, la partie technique est pauvre mais qu'importe, Neocolonialism se moque de sa plastique. Après tout le monde est sombre, donc le jeu l'est également, c'est cohérent. Nous voici donc dans la peau d'un capitaliste des temps modernes. On laisse les émotions et l'éthique au vestiaire, car seuls les chiffres comptent. On corromp, on s'arrange entre adversaires, on vote des politiques à contresens des besoins des pays. Dans quel but? Garnir son compte en Suisse inconnu des services fiscaux.

Bon il faut bien reconnaître que l'IA manque de mordant. Sans doute n'a t'elle simplement pas notre capacité à être vicieux, à trahir et à s'enrichir seul. Donc Neocolonialism est un jeu formidable en multi. Mais je le recommande quand même en solo, car il fallait oser le sortir. C'est cynique et ça me suffit pour m'amuser :)

[b] REVIEW[/b] :

[b] ABOUT THE GAME[/b]:
It is not like ""Plague Inc. Evolved"", where you play against the people of the world. No, here, you and the other players are competing each other to get as much money they can extract from each region.
Play agaisnt the IA is an easy win. [u]The fun is on multiplayer[/u], where you don't know who will vote to whom; and you can chat privately with other players to work together (temporaly, of course) or join forces to go against another player.

[b] TURN ESTRUCTURE[/b]: Buy votes. With the votes bought, each player choose who will be a minister of that region; if you are elected, then you decide to build mines, or factories, or free trade agreement. If another player is elected, he/she propose, and you vote ""Yes/No"". That finish a turn.
Even when it's unstated, the minister is not the player itself, it is ""controlled by the player"". You can have a minister in each region of the world, at same time.

[b] GRAPHICS[/b]: Horrible. I know, it's a ""Turn based strategy game"" and graphics are not important. But they are really ugly. About the map ""upside-down"", you get used to it in 5 minutes.
About the interface, the menus are well placed, simple, and fast to use. Rarely you have to click 2 times to make 1 thing.

[b] SHOULD YOU BUY?[/b]: Depends. If you are planning to play alone, I think you are not going to get much fun, because the IA is easy to beat. If you are planning to play online, then, yes, worth it. Would be awesome to have a 4-pack or a 6-pack, to invite friends and family.


=============

[b] ABOUT THE CONCEPT[/b]: Technically speaking, I should not call it ""neocolonialism"", because here you are buying votes on poor countries, and then make them grow up, creating factories and mines (you can destroy them too). When you cashout, the countries keep all the things you created.
Here, the poor countries are not working for a bigger one (like ""colonies""). Here, there is no debt, nor loans. So, more than a banker, you are a powerful (and corrupted) business magnate, with enough power to buy votes, control the IMF and propose free trade agreements.

So, you may find the name misleading; but don't care, the game shows a very bad side effect of the current system, where people with enough money may get corrupted and decide over what happens in the world, buy politicians, and force the countries to take decisions that are only good for this person business. Even agaisnt the people benefit.

Like I said, I consider it a ""Corporativism"" simulator.",1417642197,1417676276,True,79,4,0.680460512638092041,4,True,False,False,False,,,

I haven't played any online games yet but I imagine the game could only get more interesting with the addition of a human dynamic.  My one criticism is that I'd love to see more hi-res and interesting icons/symbols with a slightly better system of laying out the information on the worldmap.  Perhaps even having a zoom feature and moving the camera around to each election.  I feel this would really add some nice visual feedback to the game.
