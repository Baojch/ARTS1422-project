My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707049516,1707049516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This one is particularly badly made and carries a huge list of defects... this is so bad the developer couldn't even work out how to use ClickTeam Fusion to add colours to the game, it's just in greyscale.  Oof.  It gets worse.

Before we go into the long list of defects, just a note that the game design itself is also extremely poor, single screen platformer gameplay with some shooting elements... seems the developer also couldn't work out how to do screen scrolling in clickteam fusion so you move between screens instead.  Even Atari 2600 games in the 1980's had that functionality, and ClickTeam Fusion, while completely crap, is capable of it, so the failure here seems to lie squarely with the developer. 

Think of this as a ripoff of Metroid, an experiment to see if taking someone else's game concept and making a cheap nasty knockoff can cause a DMCA takedown. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Clickteam Fusion construction kit - the ""No-Code"" construction kit that ""Anyone can make games with!!"".  Including, you know, people who aren't game developers.  Which is a problem.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Powernaut VANGARDT has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  There's an achievement just for starting the game, so everyone who played this will have it, but less than 3 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 3 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the game?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Powernaut VANGARDT is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.",1688288327,1688288405,False,3,3,0.16747148334980011,0,True,False,False,True,,,

首先从游戏剧情的角度来看，故事情节显得平淡无奇，缺乏深度和吸引力。游戏的背景设定虽然看似庞大，但剧情推进过程中却显得单调乏味，缺乏足够的情感投入和情节转折。角色塑造也显得单薄，缺乏鲜明的个性和成长轨迹，难以引起玩家的共鸣。

其次游戏在玩法机制上也存在明显的不足。游戏的战斗系统显得单调且缺乏策略性，玩家的操作对战斗结果的影响有限，使得战斗过程变得乏味且缺乏挑战。此外游戏的探索和解谜元素也显得过于简单，缺乏深度和趣味性，难以吸引玩家的兴趣。

在画面和音效方面同样令人失望。游戏的画面质量粗糙，细节处理不够精细，使得游戏世界的整体观感显得廉价和粗糙。音效方面，游戏的背景音乐和音效效果也显得单调且缺乏层次感，无法为游戏营造出相应的氛围和情感。

此外我还发现存在一些严重的技术问题。游戏在运行过程中时常出现卡顿和延迟现象，尤其是在进行复杂操作或场景切换时。这些问题不仅影响了游戏的流畅度，也破坏了玩家的游戏体验。

最后从性价比的角度来看同样令人感到不值。考虑到游戏在剧情、玩法、画面音效以及技术方面存在的问题，其售价相对较高，与玩家的实际体验并不相符。对于寻求高质量游戏体验的玩家来说，这款游戏并不是一个明智的选择。

综上所述，在剧情、玩法、画面音效、技术问题和性价比等方面都存在明显的不足。如果你对这款游戏感兴趣，我建议你先观望一段时间，或者寻找其他更加出色且性价比更高的作品来满足你的需求。希望开发者能够认真倾听玩家的反馈，对游戏进行改进和优化，为玩家带来更好的游戏体验。",1662366070,1711822540,False,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,True,,,

An great GameBoy style Metroidvania if you're willing to put in the work of overcoming steep challenge.  There aren't many games like it on Steam. Give it a go. The fun you'll have with it is worth well over the modest $0.99 the developer is asking. If you like grinding, platforming, exploring, and action shooter combat, don't hesitate to buy it. It's loads of fun. Think Dark Souls meets Castlevania on a handheld and you'll know what you're getting yourself into.

Has an open world structure, kinda like Metroid, but instead of finding items you collect DNA from enemies to upgrade your powers. You start off pretty weak and it's easy to die, so I'd only recommend this to people who are used to old-school games. Has great pixel art and decent music.
