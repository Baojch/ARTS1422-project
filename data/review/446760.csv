▪物語
動物の町にロボットや異人種が襲来してきた。
植民地にされないよう皆で協力だ。
生活用雑貨からおもちゃまで、ありとあらゆる道具を使って追い返してやれ。

▪クリア時間
全コンテンツ解除しても6時間程度

▪ゲーム内容
20ウェーブ程に分けられた敵の波を掻い潜っていく。
使用される武器は生活用雑貨からおもちゃまで、へんてこなものが多い。

枕を振り回したり・・・
打ち上げ花火が迫撃砲だったり・・・
ドライヤーが火を噴いたり・・・

殺傷能力が備わったドラえもんの道具に近い。
ほぼ使ってみなければ効果が分からない。

ただ意外と差別化がされている。
遠距離型から防御型、特殊型に分類できる。
「風船のように膨れて守ってくれるチューイングガム」から
「犬が糞を垂れれば罠になる」など
協力プレイ時は個別で違う武器を選択することで有利になるだろう。

★ 肝はディフェンスシステム ★
リーダーを中心にディフェンスゾーンというものが展開される。
四人でプレイする際、そのディフェンスゾーンで守りを固めれば傷を癒すことが出来る。
常にディフェンスゾーンを意識してしまうと武器を回収できないので、
時にはチームの陣形を崩して話し合いながら武器の使い分けと戦術を駆使していくことになる。
難易度に直結しているので上手く使いこなせば楽な作品。

▪プレイ感想
遊びやすい作品だと思います。
ソロだとボットなので味気ないです。
正直なところ不安な作品だったのですが、テンポも良く難易度も高くないので楽しめました。
ただそれでもソロより協力プレイの方が断然楽しめられるので、友達とプレイされることを推奨します。
値段も手頃なので良いと思います。

・気になった点
カメラの向きによりキャラクターが重なりやすい。
敵が沢山現れた時に乱立するので尚更ごった返す。
自キャラから目を離さないようにしなければいけません。

他にも設定項目が足りない
オンライン機能が無いのは致し方ない。

Check out this review and many others on Save or Quit: https://saveorquit.com/2017/10/13/review-neighborhorde/

In Neighborhorde, up to four players are able to fight against some monsters that are trying to kill everyone and destroy the neighbourhood. If you don't have any friends who would want to play the game with you, you can play with bots, which are quite comparable to a human player.

The game appears interesting from the very beginning. The catchy music starts right at the splash screen and it lets you know straight away that the gameplay is going to be exciting. Once you start playing, a fun tutorial shows all the controls and gives you some tips. At first, I was a bit disappointed since all the controls were shown for the gamepad even though I was playing with my keyboard. There should probably be some detection in place, just to see if the user has a gamepad connected or not. After messing with the settings for a bit, I was able to complete the tutorial successfully.

Although I wanted to play with my keyboard at first, I soon realized that I have to change my gaming accessory. Moving the aim with my mouse was extremely annoying because it behaved very similarly to a gamepad analogue stick - if I moved my mouse to the right, my character would be shooting to the right even if I had my mouse in the top left corner and I only moved my mouse a little. That's why I switched to my Steam Controller and aiming proved to be much easier this way. You might want to use a different controller, though, the touch trackpad is also a bit clumsy when it comes to aiming.

The enemies come in waves and there are fifteen of those in total. There are also three bosses: two are among those fifteen levels and the last boss fight is the last fight of the game. Each wave is, obviously, more difficult than the last one and the game does get pretty hard as you approach the 15th wave. For every wave you survive, you get a certain amount of tickets (the number of those also increases), which you can later spend in the shop on a variety of items: new characters, cosmetic items, and different maps.

The graphics in Neighborhorde are very cartoonish. The colours are all very basic and it's easy to see the enemies and their attacks. A common problem in games with tons of enemies is that after a while, you don't even know where you are anymore. This is usually not a problem in this game. The animations are also well-made, I like how different weapons make different effects on the enemies, both physical and visual.

Since you are playing as a regular neighbourhood guy in a cartoon-like game, your weapons are not your usual video game weapons. You don't have shotguns, badass katanas, and rocket launchers, but you do have cymbals, toasters, bubble gum, wooden swords, and squeaky hammers, to list just a few. There are really a lot of different weapons and it's a lot of fun trying them all out and finding all kinds of weird effects they have. The trumpet, for example, emits sound waves which knock the enemies away from you and deal some damage to them as well.

You get to choose a new weapon after every second wave. When you choose a weapon, there is a chance that one of the gifts falling from the sky will contain this weapon. To clarify the whole gifts-falling-from-the-sky situation: the only way to get more ammo or to get a different weapon is by picking up one of the gifts that fall from the sky all the time across the map. If you pick up the same weapon you are currently holding, you are simply given more ammo, otherwise you switch the current weapon with the new one.

After every other second wave, you can choose a so-called superpower, an ability that gives you an advantage in one way or the other. There are three powers to choose from and those change every time you are given the choice. There are many different powers to choose from and there is usually at least one that helps you in the current situation and fits your style of playing as well (if you like using melee weapons, a power-up to every melee weapon is certainly a good option).

To make sure that the four players cooperate, the game uses a so-called ""friend zone"" to encourage players to stick together. When the players are all close to each other, a circle appears around them. When all players are inside this circle, they receive a certain amount of health every second. When one of the players steps outside the area, the circle disappears and reappears when the players get close to each other again. Also, when one of the players dies, the only way to resurrect them is to stand in a much smaller circle around their corpse and wait for a few seconds.

If the game is too hard for you or if you're only looking for some casual fun, there is also an Easy mode available, which can be beaten much more easily. However, no tickets are granted for the waves you complete in that mode.

Overall, I really like the game. It's never boring and you can replay you as many times as you want, especially if you want to obtain all of those fancy items in the bonus shop (you need a lot of tickets for some of those). I was playing the game with my brother a bit (sadly, I don't know any two other gaming friends nearby) and we had a lot of fun. With four people playing in a single room it would probably be even better. This is probably one of the best couch games out there so I definitely recommend it.

With love,
BirdCute

I have to say, the looks, design, and overall aesthetic is fantastic. The cheery fun visuals and the 90's toybox theme is wonderful.  For 4.99 there is tons of content/replayability.  Unlockable ""hats"" and levels as well as the ""roguelike"" in-run upgrade system have made it a staple already with my roomates.  After we had played it for around an hour we already had the theme stuck in our heads. the controls are super tight too! I purposely go out of my way to buy couch coop games. I have a cooler master scout 2 case with a gtx 1070 that is perfect to take to parties. I have 4 wireless xbox one controllers and 4 wireless 360s. Steam couch coop games are always hits.

The moment I opened up the options I knew there was going to be a problem as you get absolutely no display/video options, not even resolution or window/fullscreen... That's just pathetic. Anyways, the in game UI is also terrible, apparently you get a limited amount of ammo for range weapons, no biggie, but where the heck is the number letting me know how much I have left? Maybe it was there, I couldn't find it...

I'm 50-something years old, and playing this game brings back memories of watching my kids play with their friends. Their imagination was the highest resolution graphics possible, and they cranked it to the max. 

I'm really enjoying this indie game. I almost said ""little indie game"", but when I considered the sheer amount of content, I knew that didn't sound right. 80+ weapons and power-ups, each with a unique look and effect. The graphics style is cool, and the music is actually groovy. I don't know how many times I saw the weapons selection screen before I realized it looks like a package of el-cheapo toys you might buy at the supermarket. (50 cents, Mom! Can I get it?!) 

There are lots of subtle references throughout, that you may or may not get. I'm sure I only catch a fraction of the clever stuff the devs threw in there. The more I play, the more I appreciate the importance of combining the right power-ups with the right weapons. Though what you have to choose from is random, picking the right combinations really has an effect on your chances of success.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit I haven't played it with human partners yet, as it is obviously made with couch co-op in mind.

This game is really fun to play with friends. Tutorials are easy to understand. Both the graphics and music are great. I recommend this to everyone who wants to have fun with your friends. However, i found some problems that bugging me while I'm playing.

Known problems:

1. Sometime the game crash while entering a new round.

2. It is a bit unconfortable to control the player's moving direction using mouse (too fast, even lowering my mouse dpi can't really fix this problem)

3. The 'low aumo' indication is not very significant. (I die a lot in boss fight because of the sudden-bare-hand situation)

4. I found the Bots are stupid. In single player, bots don't save me first, and they almost hanging around alone while fighting enemies, which breaks the friend-zone.



Suggestions:

1. Make an option that player can automatically grab a weapon when there is no weapon on hand. If player wants to change weapon, they can use the 'e' button.

2. Automatically refill weapon's aumo when touching the same weapon. (Also add notification to this)

3. Add mouse sensitivity option for better control.

4. Currently there is no graphic option. (Consider adding it)",1496757676,1497243430,True,12,0,0.54838263988494873,1,False,True,False,False,,,

Neighborhorde é um twin-stick shooter extremamente arcadesco, com uma abordagem extremamente lúdica, onde um grupo de crianças sai para brincar na rua, e enfrentam inimigos de sua imaginação, usando brinquedos como armas.

Com gráficos bonitinhos e sua temática única, trata-se de um twin-stick shooter bem amigável em muitos sentidos, sem qualquer violência envolvida.

As partidas são procedurais, apresentando superpoderes e brinquedos aleatórios com escolha limitada, possibilitando várias partidas únicas.

Os estágios são divididos em etapas bem curtas, e o o desafio é um tanto elevado, com picos de dificuldade em algumas etapas.

O jogo tem uma base extremamente cooperativa, tendo suporte a coop local para 4 jogadores. Quem não conseguir completar o grupo, terá bots com cabeça de TV para auxiliar.

Outro motivo que promove a cooperação é a FRIENDZONE: uma área circular que aparece quando os jogadores estão próximos, que é a única forma de recuperar vida!",1496756199,1496756199,True,8,0,0.611166238784790039,0,False,True,False,False,,,

但可惜的是單機多人存在著Bug！P1允許使用鍵盤滑鼠的選項打勾後，搖桿並沒有變成P2！如此一來多人就無法使用鍵盤滑鼠與搖桿並用，希望製作者修正。

依然給予好評是因為其實單人完就已經夠刺激了！不過電腦隊友有點強，會有點被他們Carry的感覺。遊戲追求合作，不過同時又能陷害彼此讓其被怪物圍毆致死，可見多人一定會非常有趣。
