There are lines that need to be completed on some blocks, causing them to light up, and when all the pieces are lit up, you've won the puzzle and loft off to the next one.

It gets more complex as the game goes forward. Soon you're introduced to '3-D' shapes, and then black tiles that must be made non-contiguous to any other black tiles in order to become dots of light, a likewise condition for ongoing to the next puzzle.

The presentation brings what would be bearable, into the fun. The colors are simple yet clear, soft yet bold; the lighting effects have a satisfying bloom to them, and when you solve a puzzle, a bloom softer comes over the screen and a slow camera zoom asserts your success.

This game's proof that sometimes you don't need a hard-hitting, complex game with a big story or power fantasy to have fun. Sometimes a good puzzle with great presentation is what hits the spot.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[b]Description:[/b]
Klocki is an easy minimalist puzzle game. The puzzles are 3D objects that have different tiles on them that need to be manipulated. Each chapter adds different mechanics and types of puzzles, but most are about pattern making/recognition. The last levels mix several of these mechanics and puzzle types making the levels slightly harder.

The presentation is simple, with 3D objects placed over a plain colored background, and has some similarities with Hook, another game created by the same Dev.
There is no interface or chapter select, so the levels need to be completed in their order. The [b][u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVwxL_y_SQo] soundtrack[/url][/u][/b] is surprisingly good for a cheap game and provides a relaxing environment that doesn’t interfere with the thinking process. 

The gameplay relies on the mouse only: you need to click on the tiles to create paths, patterns and/or shapes to complete the levels. Most only took me a few seconds but others are not so obvious and take a bit more.


[b]Achievements:[/b]  
[b]How many:[/b] 1 Achievement.
[b]How much time:[/b] Around 1,5 hours, without any help.
[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Very Easy, with a few slightly harder levels.
[b]Achievements’ Difficulty:[/b] Very Easy, just complete all the levels.


[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  
Klocki is a short and easy minimalist puzzle game. The presentation is simple, the soundtrack is good and the puzzles are varied and well designed but most don’t require much effort to complete.

There are quite a lot minimalistic puzzle games, but this one really blew my mind because of the ideas and mechanisms in it. Whenever you think you mastered one of the mechanisms, the next level introduces something new for your mind to twist around. The levels get quite tricky at times, but they're not hard in a logical sense rather than in a creative sense. You simply have to see and figure out how everything matches together.

I found the game very entertaining, yet still challenging. There are a few things you should know though:
- The game is VERY simplicistic. There barely are any settings and it totally lacks any explanations. You have to figure out everything on your own, including controls. However, since the left mouse button is everything you need, it's rather intuitive after a short time.
- There are only 84 levels and the game silently repeats from the beginning after completing the final level. I did not notice otherwise than suddenly wondering about the easy levels coming up. ;) However, it also triggers the only available achievement in this game, which I simply didn't notice. It's still good for several days of fun if you don't rush the levels.
- For me, the game had problems with tabbing out to the desktop (alt+tab) when running in fullscreen mode. No crashes though, but it always shuffeled my windows around. I solved this by playing in window mode and using the Borderless Gaming tool to turn it into a maximized borderless window, thus looking like fullscreen.
- Unfortunately, there's no fps cap in this game. Hence it renders at >2000 fps, maxing out your GPU and unnecessarily wasting energy and producing heat. I solved this by forcing vertical synchronization on, using the NVIDIA control panel and managing the 3D settings for klocki. It ran nice and smoothly afterwards.

See, I used to feel anxious and overwhelmed at bigger games and I liked in the abstract the idea of abstract puzzle games, so I bought a lot of these.

So, klocki starts out good and interesting. The visuals and controls, its sense of minimalism and calm are nice and satisfying and there isn't too much grind. The visual arrangement after completing one feels nice. The mechanics are nice and interesting when introduced, and the idea of how they incorporate is interesting.

But, it never seems to know how to mesh its ideas. See, it runs into the trap of throwing in more mechanics but not really doing much with them. The 'peak' of each mechanic is fairly simple. It keeps you thinking 'oh, thats interesting, I wonder where it goes next' and throws in another thing... and another... but, apart from the rotating board, never really providing any real context, depth, or zen to them. It starts off the impression that way, but it fades in later half. Its a game that you feel supposed to zone in to but you don't. Lots of filler where if you just find where the corners are, can juts click click click and done.

And then... it is suddenly over. So you come in enjoying it, but has a lifeline cut so short that makes it feel empty.

It also has the issue that... to put it one way, the fact there *is* a solution basically necessitates by just connecting stuff you arrive at that solution rather than feeling a genuine pathway to a solution. You can also just say 'hey, I know this needs to go that way' and the mere existence of a solution will just easily lead you that way. 

Now, I get this is a casual game and I probably ought to be a hardcore puzzler-but I can appreciate a zen game, it just needs to convey that zen.

The minimalism might go too far by not providing a menu to navigate through the levels faster, though players will likely play each level once without desire to go back to a particular one anyway.

 Загадки не сказать чтобы особо гениальны, но держат планку интригующих. На протяжении всей игры тип головоломок меняться и даже комбинируется, что заставляет осваивать новые механики. Я считаю это довольно сильным плюсом, как для головолоки.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Bei den vielleicht 100 Leveln muss man Plättchen mit augezeichneten Linien so vertauschen, dass diese Linien zusammenhängen. Dieser Rätseltyp wird dann verschiedentlich variiert, z.B. Flächen statt Linien, oder man kann die Plätchen auch drehen, oder 3D statt 2D, etc.

Die Rätsel waren nicht sonderlich schwierig, aber mir lag das Rätseldesign auch. So hatte ich nur bei manchen Rätseln etwas zu tüfteln. Durch logische Annahmen und etwas probieren ging es aber immer zügig voran. Ganz offensichtlich, dass man mit diesem Rätselprinzip schwere Rätsel machen hätte können, wollte man aber nicht.

[b]Technik[/b]

Das Spiel präsentiert sich eher minimalistisch. Fast kein Menü, keine Erklärung (war auch unnötig), kein sonstwas. Angenehme Hintergrundmusik gab es immerhin dazu. Bedienung mit der Maus problemlos. Dass man das Spiel diesmal mit Esc beendet, hätte nicht sein müssen.

[b]Sonstiges[/b]

In 1,5h war ich durch und hatte damit die einizge Errungenschaft freigeschaltet.

Ein einfaches Puzzlespiel etwas anderer Art. Zum entspannten Zeitvertreib geeignet.

The music and sound effects are just fine (nothing extraordinary, but who needs them for a game like this?!?), the graphics are more than sufficient, and there is a wide variety of puzzles to solve, with the basic fundamentals changing every 10 or 15 levels or so.

I do have one serious caveat, and that is that the point of the puzzle is rather opaque from time to time, i.e. what you have to do to solve it, vis a vis the actual game mechanics required to achieve a win-state, and sometimes what that win-state will even look like are not always broadcast clearly to the player (if you look at a playthrough or Steam guide, it will usually become apparent what it is you were supposed to be working towards to ""solve"" the puzzle, but it is truly not always clear at all without outside help).

All in all, despite the occasional bafflingly arcane puzzle, this was a mellow little puzzle game that was a joy to play through.

       [b]在谜题设计方面[/b]，游戏的目的可以说是十分简单——所有关卡都围绕着连线/拼接展开，但开发者在表现形式的设计上下足了功夫——包括从平面谜题到立体结构的高低维度变换；从直接对换线段到旋转再到华容道式移动线段。
       而在这些谜题模式的编排上，每种模式的数量都恰到好处，让人感觉摸到门道却又不至于感到腻歪。在每种模式过了几关后，作者会安排一个综合前面几种模式的关卡，有一种总结与呼应的味道；这些总结关初看有点难度，但思考过后往往能快速解出。
       游戏的难度设计比较合理。整个游戏大多数关卡都不难，而且在仅有的几个难题后面，作者会紧跟着安排一个简单谜题让你舒缓你刚经历大量思考的脑壳，这一点与一般解谜游戏越来越难不同，可能这与作者紧紧扣住的休闲游戏定位离不开关系。同时难度曲线较为平滑，每种模式的开头一两关难度比较低，让你摸索规律，不至于像某些整蛊游戏“你已经知道1+1=2了，现在计算几个积分”。
       [b]游戏的UI和美术[/b]走的是简洁风，配色的运用和谐、不刺眼，看着非常清爽；配合线段格子移动时简短流畅的动画，给整个游戏带来了一种轻盈灵动的游戏体验，非常舒服。
       当然[b]缺点[/b]还是有，第一个是谜题难度不够（确信）；第二个是UI缺失一些必要功能，比如关卡间的移动，只能通过画面下方左右按钮一个一个切换，如果日后还想再次游玩某一关会非常麻烦。",1637235627,1637235627,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

같은 방식의 퍼즐이 계속 나오는것이 아닌 스테이지 진행에따라

여러가지방식의 퍼즐이 나온다 

그렇다고 아주어려운 난이도는 아니며, 총 클리어까지는 작성자 기분 딱 1시간,

다만 스팀 트레이딩카드를 얻기위해선 약간의 시간이 더 필요한듯하다

1시간에 딱맞춰끝내니 총 3개중 2개만 얻더라..

가격대비 아주 괜찮은 퍼즐게임이었다

However, with klocki I just couldn't fight the temptation! The game is actually one of the best, if not the best, puzzle games I've ever played. And although I haven't played many, it still really stands out for me.

klocki takes a minimalistic approach to puzzle games with it simple art and... lack of any sort of menu. The latter is the only issue I really have with this game – it is closed by pressing the ""Escape"" button, and while it may be a quick and simple way to close a game, many players will press the button expecting it will open a menu, where they could switch the game from full-screen to windowed, for example (turns out that it [i] is [/i] possible to do somehow, but I couldn't figure out how anyway). Levels in klocki are also not numbered, so if you want to replay a specific level you'll have to find it manually by going back one level at a time. The game has one single achievement, and I really appreciate it.

Everything else in klocki I loved. Its puzzles aren't repetitive thanks to several different mechanics presented to a player, and they complement each other well in many levels. I felt myself engaged in completing all the levels and it was very satisfying! The game is easy enough to be fun and relaxing for a casual player like me, but not too easy that there's no challenge at all. I mean, I'm not good at puzzles, and klocki was the first puzzle game that I didn't cheat in by looking up guides for some of the harder levels. And that not only because it's isn't that difficult, but really more because I was intrigued and excited and wanted to do them on my own. Colors and design of klocki deserve their own praise – they're very simple but so pleasing to the eye!

I completed the game in around 90 minutes, which is an appropriate game length, especially for such a low price.

If you haven't already played klocki I can definitely recommend it. Even if you're not that into puzzle games, this one is just pretty, short, and cheap, and it can be a nice introduction to the genre.",1625754616,1625754616,True,5,0,0.578313291072845459,0,True,False,False,False,,,

'Hook' 의 성공적인 출시이후에 개발사가 다시 출시한 퍼즐게임.

컨셉은 다르지만 저에게 다른 흥미를 느끼게 해준 게임이였습니다. 
전체적으로는 깔끔한 디자인에서 알수 있듯이 심플한 퍼즐게임이지만 
사실 그 안에는 다양함이 존재합니다. 
한가지 컨셉으로만 퍼즐을 푸는 것이 아닌 
여러가지 방식을 혼합하여 퍼즐을 풀어나가는 게임입니다.

난이도를 'Hook'과 비교하긴 어렵지만 저의 경험으로는 
가볍게 퍼즐을 풀면서 즐기기 좋은 난이도라고 생각합니다.

[h1]Combination of simplicity and variety[/h1]

It is a puzzle game that the developer re-released after the successful release of 'Hook'.

Although the concept was different, it was a game that made me feel different interests. 
Overall, as you can see from the clean design, it is a simple puzzle game, but in fact there is variety. 
It is a game that solves puzzles by mixing various methods rather than solving puzzles with only one concept.

It is difficult to compare the difficulty with 'Hook', 
but I think it is a good difficulty level to enjoy while solving puzzles lightly.",1624856809,1624856809,True,1,1,0.511111080646514893,2,True,False,False,False,,,

[code] Заканчиваю обозревать головоломки от задорного Maciej Targoni, ибо прошел всю коллекцию доступных игр с наслаждением и даже фанатизмом! Разработчик невероятным образом угодил всем любителям качественных головоломок, но все же этого показалось слишком мало. Хочу добавку, жду новых игр! [/code]

Доброго времени суток! Вот и подходит к концу мой забег по играм от Maciej Targoni. Я бесконечно влюблен в стилистику и механики, что всплывали в играх от этого разработчика, так что голубые пальцы на обзорах к его играм не просто стоят, а сверкают синевой во все стороны! Предлагаю и вам примкнуть к скромной базе фанатов, а попутно размять извилины под забористую мелодию из щелчков и звуков шестеренок.

klocki - казуальная головоломка, которую можно осилить за час, ибо она оказалась наиболее простенькой среди всех своих собратьев по разработчику. Вас ждет смесь атипичной мозаики с элементами упрощенных пятнашек. И пусть все это звучит довольно уныло, но на деле вы будете щелкать уровни, радуясь каждой победе. Компьютерные игры должны развлекать аудиторию, а klocki именно этим и занимается, но даже не думайте встретить чего-нибудь действительно сложное в этой игре.

[h1] Рисуем цепь, гадаем по черным пятнам. [/h1]
klocki крайне разносторонняя игра, но это присуще всем головоломкам обозреваемого разработчика. Игрок привыкает к какой-нибудь определённой механики, а спустя пару уровней встречает совершенно иные условия для победы, что привносит массу удовольствия и разнообразия в игровой процесс. После освоения нескольких подвидов игры, друзья мои, нас закидывают в тандем из всего материала, что мы умудрились пройти, а это уже и сложнее, и веселее одновременно.

Игрок будет соединять элементы в общую картину, замыкать лабиринты, повторяя принцип водопроводчика, расставлять по периметру элементы, дабы сохранить баланс свободного пространства между ними, метаться между 2D и 3D плоскостями, крутить-вертеть все грани по отдельности, а после использовать все это дело на общих уровнях, взрывая себе мозг обилием объединённых механик. Игра действительно удивляет своими трюками, но я ждал несколько иного уровня сложности, ибо закадычному любителю жанра будет излишне просто.

[list]
[*] Рабочие достижения.
[*] Сладкая цена!
[*] Время прохождения ~час\полтора.
[/list]

[h1] Красками по холсту. [/h1]
В очередной раз нас ждет приятный минимализм, разбавленный мягкой палитрой цветов, которая так нежно обнимает глаза, что я хотел просто проглотить все кубики, фоны и остальную мишуру! Плавные анимации и потрясающие звуки тоже радуют нервную систему, призывая поскорее пройти какой-нибудь уровень, дабы услышать сладострастный звук батутных прыжков. Музыкальное оформление  никак не успевает надоесть, да и  в целом гармонирует с происходящем на экране. Да, друзья, именно гармония и предельная медитативность отличает klocki от более колких конкурентов, которые так и не нашли своей аудитории. 

Разработчик трезво смотрит на свое детище, так что людей желающий может пощупать игру, откинув пару десятков рублей в сторону автора. На скидках игру вообще отдают за копейки, что должно подтолкнуть к покупке даже самых привередливых из вас. Наличие коллекционных карточек и достижений идут приятным бонусом в общую копилку плюсов игры.

В итоге перед вами достойная головоломка, которую не стыдно посоветовать всем друзьям и случайным прохожим. Игра красивая, мелодичная, в меру сложная и откровенно дешевая. Если вы любите качественные головоломки, то обязательно пополните свою коллекцию копией klocki! Лично мне очень понравилось, почему, друзья, желаю вам приятной игры, до связи! 

Хочу поблагодарить всех за отдачу и лайки, берегите нервы и избегайте шлака в магазине.

Мне показалось, что игра не до конца раскрывает свой потенциал: часть механик не взаимодействуют между собой и разделены условными главами.

У игры нету настроек экрана, приходится сидеть в полноэкранном режиме.

Not a too complicated nor boring puzzle game with elements of connecting things and mosaic mechanics.

This game is like the ease breeze of spring.
Light colours, mood and mechanics makes for simple and refreshing experience.
The developers have especially truly found the sweet spot of introducing a new element, letting the players experience the mechanic in easy mode, then feeling comfortable with it on a medium difficulty before throwing one into the more mindbuggling puzzles. But never did I experience any levels being too hard nor frustrating :
And new elements kept coming up which prevailed the boredom

[h1]The cube of greatness[/h1]
- Easy shapes and colours for the eyes (though I do not know if there is any mode for the colourblind!)
- A fine stepping curve
- Fair for the price! 
- Quite wellmade for its asking price!
- Suitable for playing on tablet

[h1]The voids of cons[/h1]
- The game was cleared in like 3 hours time (which is maybe a turnoff for some people)
- The rinse and repeat model of: Few levels of introduction to a new mechanic, few medium levels and then 1-2 ""hard"" ones with the mechanic.... became maybe a bit too predictable (not that it really matters)
- I hate... mosaic puzzles.... but luckily it was somewhat only introduced as a secondary element (but I was close to ragequitting the first time!)
- Maybe too brightful?
- Somewhat maybe too mobile ish of a game (if one hates those kind of games) BUT NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! NOR WAITING TIME

For such a low asking price especially in a bundle with sales. Oh boy, that is value for the buck! Also great for playing on a tablet (I did it through a shadowbox, but I think it should work fine in the steams app...

Pros

- The concept and how to play are both easy to grasp.  It starts out baby-grade easy and introduces new concepts after every few levels.  

- The whole game is therapeutic.  The music is chill, too.  If your'e stressed out, this is the game for you.

- There's a certain level of fulfillment you'll feel when completing the harder puzzles.  

- There is 1 full achievement to gain.  

- It's one penny less than a Dollar.  $


Cons

- There's no menu and the only way to exit the game (That I've found) is ESC - which takes you straight out the game without any preamble.  Thankfully the game will remember what level you're on when you come back.

- Like the last con, with no menu there's no way to select levels individually.  If you want to play again, you start from the beginning.

- The game is unforgivingly colorful and bright.  It flashes brighter when you match pieces and select tiles, and flashes white when you beat a level.  There's no way to tone it down any.  For light-sensitive people, it'd give you a headache.   The light doesn't blink on and off repeatedly in quick succession or anything.



In the end, Klocki is a simple, super cheap puzzle game that will keep you entertained until you're out of levels.  It feels a little short and I wish there were more levels and a way to tone down the colors, but for the whole 99 cent price tag you'll definitely get what you pay for and then some.  Recommended for the puzzle lovers out there.",1601867010,1601867115,True,6,0,0.581552088260650635,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In klocki, your goal is to rearrange the squares in the puzzle so that all the lines either connect up in a loop or end in a proper terminal. It starts off simple, but as you progress further through the game, more mechanics are added on, such as squares that can't be moved but can be rotated, squares that slide around instead of swapping or the ability to move sections of the puzzle around.

The game never gets truly mind-bendingly difficult, but ramps up to a quite fun level, and solving some of the later puzzles is very satisfactory. Unfortunately, the game is also fairly short, and would definitely benefit from having more levels to it. Still highly recommended if you want to kill an hour going through the puzzles though.",1601789971,1601789971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

An ultra short simple puzzler that probably doesn't have a steep enough climb and then plateaus when the difficulty does show up. That's not to say you aren't going to get stuck on at least one puzzle. But the first half breezes by in the blink of an eye as the solutions are obvious. Then when the challenge shows up it never ramps up much higher even though new mechanics and twists are added. I think this is due to some mechanics leaving obvious orientation clues. Sure, you go from just swapping tiles on a plane to rotating entire sections of tiles on a side of a three dimensional shape. It seems like your brain should be melting but it holds form. Some of these more complex mechanics have the aforementioned obvious orientation clues though, and as long as you make those moves before sliding, rotating and swapping individual tiles; Well, you're set! You've already reduced the complexity back down to a previous set of rules. Or something like that. Maybe I'm just the dumb monkey who happened to type up Shakespeare. It all just made way too quick of sense to me. Either way, minimalist aesthetic, pretty colors, calm ambient music and an hour killed giving the brain a little wrinkle. All for pennies!

Just like the other puzzle games from this developper : you start with a simple mechanic and get several puzzles using this mechanic, the puzzles get harder and harder... then you get a new mechanic and the puzzles become really easy again to learn to use this mechanic, then it gets harder and harder... then you get puzzles using both of the mechanics you've learned... etc etc...

It's supposed to be relaxing so the puzzles never get too hard even if I personally always start getting annoyed and bored when I reach the last levels ( but that's because I have 0 patience =P ). If you are really stuck on a level, you can always check one of the many guides.

No real menu, pressing esc closes the game, you can't see at what level you are, you can't pick a specific level ( you can just go backward, one by one ).

[b][u]Gameplay :[/u][/b] Several things to do :
- You have to connect lines
- Move black squares so that they don't touch each other
- Connect forms
For these, you'll have to use the squares to move part of the lines/forms or black squares.
- Blue squares can be moved freely, switching one with another
- Purple squares have to be moved by sliding them to a free spot
- Blue circles cannot be moved but you can change the direction of the symbol in it
- Yellow circles move parts of the puzzle

Однозначно рекомендую! 
Какая же там музыка ламповая и звуки приятные, помимо геймплея отдельно радует.

Играем мы в знакомого ""водопроводчика"", разных версий которого среди браузерных игрушек лопатой не перекопаешь, но эта отличилась тем, что в ней собрано сразу множество механик. 
Ну и оформление приятное.
Однако, все получилось очень коротко, нет меню внутри игры и нет прямо сложных задач - все на уровне простеньких пазлов, которыми разбавляют экшен-игры.

An interesting puzzle game that combines sliding blocks and line puzzles with geometry (and towards the end, the geometry gets pretty abstract). The music is relaxing and the puzzles were fun, but the game is pretty short. There are puzzles towards the end where the colors kind of make it difficult to discern what you're supposed to do, but it's easy to work out after toying with them. It took me an hour to finish the game. I would recommend this title.",1587567137,1594566452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Don't expect anything too difficult, you'll finish this in 30-60 minutes.
As someone who likes puzzle games (ranging from the very simple abstract stuff like this, to full productions like Talos Principle), I actually picked this one up because there was a game I had on Windows 3.1 called Klotski (a block slider that had some pretty difficult levels especially for a small kid).
I realized from the screenshots this was not a remake/update of that, but I was still intrigued.

So is this game good? It's fine. Like I said, you'll finish it in 30-60 minutes. I was considering quitting early on because the first 15-20 levels were so simple (no problem solving, just switch all the pieces into an obvious spot without any problems to overcome), I wondered if the whole game was going to be like that. Luckily, things started to change with new mechanics spicing things up.
I'd say this is probably a good game for children, but if you're an adult who enjoys puzzles there are enough non-trivial puzzles to justify the very low cost of this game (low money cost, and short time investment).
If this cost $5 I'd say no way, but I think I got this less for less than a Canadian dollar, so sure.

If you end up getting it, know the dev forgot to include a menu/settings option (just the ability to mute audio, and previous/next level skip): Hold shift when you press play on the steam client to start the game with settings (so you can set it to windowed) -- the game forces full screen and there is no menu to open settings, ESC just exits the game. Annoying, since even games with minimalistic UIs have a clean way to include a basic menu with basic features. The levels also should have been numbered -- just really basic stuff.",1581892765,1581892765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My biggest complaint is that it's far too short. It's entirely worth the $1 USD (or less) that you'll get it for, of course -- but once you hit the beautifully satisfying final puzzle, you'll be yearning for more.

Można, bo jak się okazuje Polak potrafi. Klocki - niby prosty tytuł, niby prosta gra, ale... jaki miód... I ten minimalizm, który zapewnia relaks dla naszej głowy zmęczonej tymi wszystkimi przeładowanymi wodotryskami grami. Klocki są proste, ale trudne, minimalistyczne, ale piękne zarazem - wszystko tu jest we właściwych proporcjach, a każdy detal jest przemyślany. Dwóch Polaków udowodniło jak można zrobić wielkiego indyka za psie pieniądze.

Plusy:

+ bardzo estetyczna wizualnie grafika
+ wielka siła minimalizmu (jest tylko to, co naprawdę działa)
+ uzależniające efekty dźwiękowe (zwłaszcza ta satysfakcja po ułożeniu właściwie klocków)
+ zróżnicowana i przemyślana mechanika gry
+ bardzo zasysająca rozgrywka
+ bez niepotrzebnych wodotrysków
+ jeden achievment za przejście gry 
+ dobra optymalizacja
+ bardzo niska cena 

Minusy: 

- momentami gra potrafi być dość trudna (zwłaszcza w finale)
- brak zapisów gry w Steam Cloud

Komu polecam? / Komu odradzam?

+ polecam graczom, którzy lubią dobre gry logiczne 
+ polecam graczom lubiącym układać rożne puzzle
+ polecam tym, którzy chcą zobaczyć , że Polak potrafi
+ polecam tym, którzy chcieliby na chwilę oderwać się od reszty gier
- odradzam graczom, którzy nie lubią główkować nad zagadkami
- odradzam graczom, którzy nie lubią zbyt wymagających gier 

Rada: 

W Klocki warto zagrać na raty... Włączając ja na chwilę dla relaksu. Bo to rzadka gra logiczna, która nie obciąża mocno naszego mózgu... A ten efekt, gdy ułożymy klocki na planszy jest bezcenny i daje nam czystą satysfakcję. Podobny efekt i styl robienia gry został zastosowany w innej grze, zręcznościowej Race the Sun, którą także polecam fanom minimalizmu.

There's not much I can say about the game, it does its job as a minimalistic puzzle game. It guides you through some different puzzles and opens up the possibilities of the different colours and different shapes all coming together in the end. One achievement and it isn’t busted makes it great for achievement hunters as well!

Pros:
- Simple
- Easy to play and learn
- Slowly pushes the game at you and its never overwhelming.
Cons:
As much as I liked the game there’s still some bad things that I found about it in ways.
- A little too simple in its menu. Forward and backwards arrows for level control while nice leaves a little to be desired. Perhaps a level menu would have helped.
- No real way to know you’ve completed the game. Looping back after “completing” the last level makes you have to wonder if you missed something or not, a little bit of a credits roll would be nice instead of the sudden end.

Overall though, for the low price point and the good puzzles found in the game I definitely recommend it! A solid 8/10 game in my books, and a must for your inventory!",1572667905,1572667905,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

然后就是各种想方设法理解旋转交换和华容道啥的如何配合，本身解法并不唯一，而且缓冲空间相当大，几乎不会卡关，肯花时间也不会特别难，如果卡关就用穷举法。
音乐中规中矩，画面中上，同类游戏里完整度可以的。

Плюсы (Наверное такие же, как и в Hook):
1) Интуитивно понятно что и как делать. Сразу начинаешь проходить уровень за уровень без всяких обучалок и т.д.
2) Красиво выполнена графическая часть. Плавные переходы и управление, а также музыка расслабляют во время прохождения, за это отдельный респект.

Review written after 1 hour of gameplay, game completed.
My score: 8/10 - one point less for not being too hard, another one for not having more levels.
Pros: Easy to learn, minimalistic but nice graphics and relaxing music, great gameplay.
Cons: Short - game can be completed in 1 hour. It can also be too easy for some players.

Abstract: Klocki is a spatial puzzle with wonderful background music, another game in the same vein of the rest of the Relaxing Puzzle Box bundle. It has simple but not plain silly graphics, rather pretty and functional, varied mechanics, and not a single word of how to play the game - learning the mechanics and rules is part of the gameplay. And it's relaxing: no timers, movement count, achievements to get here and there by having to repeat the same level until perfected. Instead of that, just relaxing game, focused into solving the levels peacefully without worrying about anything else.

Graphics: 7/10 - While the graphics are simple, they don't need more. The animations are smooth, everything is in shaded 3D isometric surfaces, and again, while being simple, they're nice graphics.

Sounds: 9/10 - Ambience relaxing background music, and minimal & elegant sounds. A little variety on the music would have made the sound department just perfect.

Gameplay: 8/10 - The basic of the game is to slide, rotate or swap tiles, located on the three planes of isometric surfaces, to satisfy certain required rules. For example, lines must have a beginning and an end; black squares can't touch other black squares; colours must match. How to achieve that, and what pieces and mechanics are available depend on the level. In some you can't swap, but you can rotate and slide; in others you have limited swapping and group rotation, etc. What must be achieved and how, is for you to discover, and that is a good part of the gameplay.

I don't think I'm specially good with 3D spatial puzzles, although I tend to be better in them than other kind of puzzles; that said, I found the game quite easy, with rarely getting stuck for more than a few moments to complete a level. Easy with 81 levels (more or less, maybe I counted wrong) makes the game too short, specially after such a good time playing it. And that's my only 'but' in the gameplay. Other than that, it's a really nice game to play. The rules are easily understood by a gradual introduction of new elements and mechanics, making the difficulty progression really smooth. And when you thought you've seen it all, new pieces or a different rule come into play.

UX: 9/10 - It's an excellent user experience, that not many games can provide with so few elements. The game felt very nice from beginning to end. The UI is totally barebones, with just the needed elements and nothing else. Not a single word, just four icons and the gameplay. Controlled only with mouse - click or drag, without any complications. So, exceedingly simple, but nothing else is required. Near perfection.

Special stuff: Have I mentioned it's short? The game has little replayability value, maybe after a long hiatus but it'll be even easier then, unless you have a reset button for forgetting how to play a game. 81 Levels are just too little, and often I found frustrating that once a certain mechanic was being mastered and ready to expand on difficulty, it moved forward to new mechanics. While the game is great and I enjoyed it so much, I feel it has more potential.

Warnings: 81 levels.

Summary: Polished, three-dimensional spatial puzzle that you will probably enjoy if you like puzzles; including if you make it in 1 hour like I did (57 minutes). One of the puzzle games I've liked the most in a long long time. I strongly recommend it, with or without a sale; I got it with the Relaxing Puzzle Box bundle and I don't regret that purchase, so you might want to look into the bundle if you think this kind of game is your cup of tea.

[b]klocki[/b] talks to you with lines, shapes and colors - exactly what our brain ""sees"" first.

New mechanics are introduced the right way: from the very simplest examples that you yet have to solve by yourself to gradualy harder puzzles where new mechanics blend with already learned old ones.

Clean distraction-free visuals, minor audio-visual feedback on each action and ambient music create zen-like puzzle experience.

P.S. Minor technical side note: if you run it on Linux - go with windowed mode. At least that's what I had to do so that the game registered my input.

For a few levels I could only solve them by random clicking. I gave after completing about 2/3 of the levels because the game wasn't fun anymore.

For the money, it is reasonable value. However, I'm a completionist, I like to finish games that I start - so I didn't like the game.",1561242744,1561243167,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

From launch to finish, it's nothing but puzzles. Discover by trial and error how to connect its various broken circuits across a couple dozen stages.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Polished design
+ Ease of play, one mouse button control
+ Logical progression, mechanics introduced before increasing complexity
+ The color choice and line variations make this accessible even for the colorblind
+ Soothing music, never intrusive
+ Suitable for all ages

[h1]Cons[/h1]
All are minor complaints:
- The lack of menu means manually clicking backward through every puzzle
- No level numbering
- No resolution or window options. (Actually hidden, press shift when starting the game)
- Exiting the game is Esc, which is intuitive for most, but doesn't tell you anywhere.
- Game loops on completion without any on-screen message, you might wonder if you missed something
- No stage reset button (but you can click back to previous puzzle to do this)
- 30~60 minute length, little reason to replay.

All in all, good value for its low price.

This games interface was a lot less polished, too.  There was no obvious way to tell you had done all the levels, it just cycled back to the first.  Unlike hook, this one could have benefited from at least a menu showing how many puzzles there were. I found myself wanting to quit toward the end, but not really wanting to give up, and it would have helped knowing how many were left... maybe a number?  Again, not really a need, more a result of the game getting tiring after a while.

Aside from the ability to hold my attention, there really isn't anything wrong with the game to NOT recommend it. The game is finished, bug-free, kind of simple graphics, and not that complicated.

klocki gives you a ton of puzzles (about 20 or so more than Hook) and with that they introduce a ton of new, but simple mechanics and this is definitely a good thing, but I also find this to be a somewhat bad thing. A lot of times in this game it seems to focus on new mechanics and mixing them and while that is good it also gets repetitive and tedious at times to complete them as it will give you a couple levels or so without really changing the format of a group of levels. Overall it's still a really good experience, but not as good as Hook imo. 

The game is graphically way superior than Hook, it seems like they actually wanted to give the game some actual looks as opposed to some minimalistic white background with the wires and hooks and the soundtrack is good too, but I don't feel like it's actually existent at times though and the sound effects are pretty nice too. The game definitely puts you in a relaxful environment and sure the game does get tedious and repetitive it also helps when you have a nice atmosphere to not feel like this all the time.

Do I recommend klocki? It's a hard yes and while I don't think the experience is as good as Hook it is still a fun group of puzzles if you like Maciej Targoni's previous title or any of his titles. I'd say it's definitely worth the 99 cents to get it, or if you're like me you could also buy it through the Relaxing Puzzle Box bundle to also get some of Targoni's other titles.",1556205268,1556205268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Klocki ist ein smartes, kleines Rätselspiel, das uns Knobelstoff für etwa eine Stunde liefert. Die Puzzles fangen sehr simpel an und erklären erstmal behutsam ihre Besonderheiten, bevor es stetig komplexer wird und verschiedene Rätsel-Varianten kombiniert werden. Die Lernkurve ist meines Empfindens nach gut gelungen - mehr als zwei Minuten habe ich für kaum ein Level benötigt, doch auf der anderen Seite haben mich die Puzzles trotzdem in den meisten Fällen angenehm herausgefordert.
Der sehr minimalistische Grafikstil ist zwar nicht besonders spannend anzuschauen, doch die ansprechende Farbpalette, der frische Soundtrack und die satten Soundeffekte sorgen dennoch für eine gefällige Rätselstimmung.

The game has a couple of different types of levels, with the type of puzzle required changing. Most of it involved connecting lines or blocks together in order to form a non-broken line or pattern. You can do this by moving blocks, turning it, turning the whole platform, etc. in order to get it to connect. The game really does a good job of making the levels seem intimidating, but at the same time plausible and solvable. This game is the definition of simple but good. The only gripe is that it is a bit short and lacks a menu (the game just restarted after I beat it).

Overall, great simple game that only costs you only a single dollar (99 cents to be exact).

[code]Казалось бы, головоломки нужны нам для того, чтобы подпитывать наш мозг мыслительным упражнением, так же, как физическим мы следим за состоянием мышц. Бывают сложные, бывают простые - разноплановые в общем-то говоря. Но в обоих случаях им переодически нужно отдыхать.[/code]

[i][b]klocki [/b]может показаться ужасно простой, отчего назреет вопрос: «Что-то здесь  не так?» Почему? Потому что это правда, признайте это и всё. Юлить незачем, вы сами это осознаете, когда пройдёте все уровни до конца, а кто-то признает это уже походу игры. Меня лично это расстроило, потому что я ожидал большего. Это моя ошибка, никто в этом не виноват.

Многие признают, что смена игровых механик, их комплексное смешивание - идёт игре на пользу, иначе становится скучно. В подобных играх это усложняет процесс, застав игрока врасплох. Интуитивно проходить становится тяжелее, приходится быть внимательным и вникать в процесс. Как только ты привыкнешь к одной механике - сразу же появится другая.

Меняются они довольно часто, приятно разбавляя рутинный, на первый взгляд, процесс. Правда сложности от этого не прибавится, думать придётся крайне редко. Всё это похоже на зарядку для глаз. Почти на каждом уровне визуально ясно, как и что должно выглядеть в итоге. Нам же нужно только всё соединить, а здесь это дело плевое. Грустно, честно говоря. Да, нечего ждать за такие деньги, но от других достойных головоломок, стоящих наравне по цене - я получил гораздо больше удовольствия. 

Красочная палитра цветов - радость для глаз. Здесь идеально выполнена работа. Никакого раздражающего эффекта и полное погружение в процесс. Музыкальное сопровождение, конечно же,  тоже не оставит вас в печали. Здесь, как и в визуальном плане, постарались. 

За klocki я сел раздраженный, повязший в болоте мыслей и чувств посреди ночи, с головной болью. У меня было навязчивое состояние - пройти всё не останавливаясь, будто бы мне от этого станет легче. И правда. Глаза мои расслабились, уши отдохнули, да  на душе стало полегче.

[b]  К чему это я? Учитесь отдыхать, Друзья. В первую очередь от самих себя. Эти головоломки идеально для этого подходят.	[/b][/i]",1532993139,1533026616,True,18,0,0.694633007049560547,9,True,False,False,False,,,

Für Puzzle-Anfänger gerade richtig und für kleinen Preis ein guter Einstieg in die Puzzle-Welt.

Schlichte Grafik und ein bischen Sound sorgen eher für volle Aufmerksamkeit an den Puzzles.
Das Spiel hätte zwar gerne länger sein können, aber dann hätte es mehrere Puzzle-Variationen geben müssen.
So lieber ein gute Stunde gut unterhalten, als öde & nimmerendende Klickerei.

Gut, aber halt auch nicht mehr.

Bought for 20% off in the sale, would happily have paid full price.

Despite there being no text/instructions, the mechanics are very easy to pick up and are introduced gradually, and then slowly combined to make for a decent learning curve. I enjoyed this a lot - some moments to make you think once multiple mechanics are involved in the same level but nothing that took much more than a minute or two's thought. Hour and a half playtime includes full completion, messing around trying to see if any menu options, and wandering off to make/eat a sandwich halfway through.

Pros:
Simple, easily understood mechanics.
No text, so perfect for any language.
Suitable for wide ranges of ages.
Background music/sound effects unobtrusive but clearly indicate success (and can be turned off).
Simple but pleasing graphics/colours.
Decent learning curve.
Doesn't feel repetitive.


Cons
There's no level reset as far as I can see, but I don't think you can actually get to a point where you're irretrievably stuck.
Not really sure about replay value, perhaps after a couple of months have passed?
No level select - once you've completed all levels you can click through them in sequence, but you can't go directly to the one you want.
More levels would be nice. (No idea how many there actually were - felt a little on the short side, but not too bad given the price point).",1530464844,1530464844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Cheap

Cons :

- Only bad point that I have is the fact that to change the resolution you need to hold down the ""Shift""-key while launching the game. This should be added as a feature in game when you press the ESC button. Nothing major but still quite annoying when it launched in fullscreen mode.

Klocki 는 플레이어에게 아무 것도 가르쳐주지 않습니다. 게임에 새로운 요소가 들어가는가 싶으면 그때만 난이도를 살짝 쉽게 보여주는 듯한 퍼즐 게임이죠. 하지만 이것이 이 작품의 최대의 백미입니다.

플레이어는 아무것도 모른채 우선 화면에 보이는 것을 이것저것 조작해보기 시작하죠. 그러면 알게 됩니다. 보이는 각 블록간의 구성들이 '막연하게 뭔가 짜임새 있게만 보이면' 스테이지가 클리어 된다는 것을 말이에요. 나머지는 다양한 퍼즐 요소가 등장하며 끝까지 짜임새 있어 보이는 모습을 만들어주기만 하면 끝나는 아주 간단한 작품입니다. 전반적으로 몽환적 분위기를 띄기 위해 그래픽을 단색처리로 표현하려는 경향이 강하며, BGM 연출도 비슷하게 흘러갑니다.

이 작품은 가지고 있는 점이 단 하나밖에 없을지도 모릅니다. 바로 '규칙' 이죠. 그래픽에 크게 무언가를 투자한 것도 아니고 특별한 인터페이스나 시스템 요소도 보이지 않고 무엇보다 게임에 대한 텍스트가 단 한자도 보이지 않습니다. 그런 점에서 이 작품은 사용자가 스스로 호기심을 갖고 게임의 규칙을 알 수 있도록 한 '튜토리얼' 부분 연출방식에 아주 높은 점수를 줄 수 있었습니다. 이 작품만큼 퍼즐게임 그 본연에 충실한 작품을 보는 것도 쉽지 않겠지요. 대신 그만큼 게임의 전반적인 난이도는 낮은 편이며, 콘텐츠 소비속도가 매우 빠르게 흘러가는 점이 있습니다.

특별한 인터페이스나 텍스트의 안내 역시 전무하기에 이 작품이 총 몇개의 스테이지를 지원하는지 육안으로 식별하기는 힘드나 필자가 알아보기론 약 80개 정도가 있습니다. 일반 유저 기준으로 약 1~2시간의 플레이 시간이면 게임의 끝을 볼 수 있다고 보시면 되겠습니다. (필자는 47 분 걸렸습니다.) 그만큼 게임이 짧고 간결합니다. 특별한 엔딩도 없이 그저 마지막 스테이지는 엔딩을 암시하는 듯한 퍼즐이 등장하는 정도입니다.

I am a big fan of another of their games, called Hook. I discovered it about a year or so ago. Since I like to support indie developers and love a good puzzle game, it seemed like a small risk at 99 cents to try that game out due to the positive reviews.

I was, ahem, [i]hooked[/i] immediately. The game features simple, clear graphics combined with interesting (and yet still simple) mechanics, introducing new concepts along the way and then later combining concepts to create more elaborate puzzles.

Klocki follows in this tradition, but with all new mechanics. It begins with needing to switch tiles around to match up patterns and complete what resemble circuits. Honestly, at first I thought, ""man, this is a little too simple. If I'm just switching tiles the whole time, this is going to get old quickly."" Fortunately, right when you feel like you've mastered the puzzle, a new mechanic of rotating tiles in place is introduced. This is still nothing earth-shattering, but then the two mechanics are combined to create a more interesting puzzle.

This continues where more new mechanics keep getting introduced: rotating large sections of tiles with a ""handle,"" broadening the solution surface from a flat space to a 3D shape (where the solution requires you to connect pieces across the surface), separating black squares to leave white dots which cannot be next to one another, sliding tiles, and a variety of ""blob"" shapes (for lack of a better term) which have to be assembled in such a way that the resulting shape has all smooth edges.

That's a lot of different things, right? Yep, and when all of these get combined toward the end, the last few puzzles get pretty fiendish, although you should still be able to solve even these in a matter of a few minutes. That's another thing that makes this game work: the puzzles are challenging, feel fair, are satisfying when you solve them, but never turn into such frustrating head-scratchers that you want to rage quit. It's evidence of excellent balance in a puzzle game.

It's entirely possible that you'll solve the whole thing in one sitting like I did, and that this will take less than an hour. Hey, the game's only a dollar, and you pay more per minute to go see some mediocre movie. In the end, your entertainment value here is much higher. 

I'm impressed enough with the two games I've played from these developers that I've purchased the other games they've made and look forward to trying these out as well in the near future.

TLDR: this is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys original puzzle games and likes to support indie developers. At only a buck, you should just stop reading, buy this game now, and spend the next hour playing it instead of reading reviews.  :D",1517989539,1559334874,True,8,0,0.576954901218414307,0,False,False,False,False,,,

我确实感觉到，这个开发商非常擅长制作这种益智小游戏，流程和难度都拿捏得十分到位，BGM听起来也十分舒适。
不过画面虽然清新简洁，单是某些关卡的颜色实在有些刺眼了，建议大家长时间玩耍的话，亮度还是调低点吧=。=

剛開始遊玩時還想說這這解謎方式能有多難的關卡..
結果當然是以更多樣的解謎方式呈現
初期的畫面很美，紫色滑動方塊出現後畫面就開始有點醜了
遊戲整體難度不高，摸索一下都可以過關
就這一點來說很對我胃口
不過還是要列幾個小缺點
1.沒有註明關卡數
這樣對想找解答的人來說很不方便
2.結尾有點潦草
不是說劇情的那種(畢竟也沒有劇情)
而是關卡都還沒結束成就就已經解鎖了..
3.過關時的特效有點醜
雖然以發亮/放大做為過關的提醒很有效
但對於遊戲本身的美感卻沒有加分的感覺
什麼都不動反而更適合F12

首先是游戏内容方面，通过旋转、平移等拼接插头，构成富有美感的闭合图形。

不足的是很多关卡都属于教程关卡（裸题），综合关卡（综合题）太少，也就导致整体的解谜难度不会太难。

(Developer gifted me the game when I contacted him after purchasing the Android port of this game via Humble Bundle to find out whether or not there are any differenses between PC and mobile versions. He suggested that I see for myself and sent me a Steam key for free which was pretty nice of him. The game has no achievements on Android but seemed to be easier to control via touch)

Honestly at first I had thought that I was not going to recommend this game but after completing it (which takes between an hour and two if you're as bad as I am) I decided that it is definitely worth playing. It's a puzzle game where you have to turn, twist, switch places of planes of different types to make the picture composition flow. The game did not have any options menu so I could not change the resolution to make the game run smoothly on my weak ultrabook which is why the game's framerate was a bit low. I could not keep the sound effects but switch off the music because it got a tiny bit repetitive. The menu to chose the level wasn't designed well making me go through all the levels between the one that I wanted to play and the one that I was currently on. NEVERTHELESS the whole experience just got to a point that it made me adjust to its' meditative wave which made it enjoyable. The gameplay itself is quite nice with levels starting very easy and getting a bit harder level by level while introducing new mechanics where the game becomes a bit easy again so there is this nice wave of difficulty which doesn't make you feel stupid and frustrated even if you are as bad as I am with puzzle games but it remains challenging enough throughout the whole game. Also the pictures you create with the planes and the music complement the overall wavy and meditative feel of the game. The achievements are perfect to my taste. It was fun. Might be a bit too easy for veteran puzzle enthusiasts.
___________________________________

(Игру мне подарил разработчик. Я спросил его есть ли разница между версией на Андроид и версией на ПК в Стиме после покупки её в Хамбл Бандл, а он в свою очередь посоветовал мне проверить самому и отправил ключ для Стима. Разработчик очень мил, а разница между версиями в том, что на Андроид нет достижений, но управлять игрой удобнее касанием, нежели мышью, на мой взгляд)

По началу я не собирался рекоммендовать эту игру, но после полного прохождения (что займёт между одним и двумя часами, если у Вас всё также плохо с головоломками как и у меня) я решил, что в неё стоит поиграть. В этой игре Вам предстоит вращать, крутить, менять местами плоскости разных типов, чтобы в конце концов сделать из них визуально красивую композицию. К сожалению, в игре нет меню насторек, поэтому я не мог изменить разрешение, из-за чего на моём слабом ультрабуке частота кадров в секунду была довольно низкой. Также я не мог выключить музыку, но при этом оставить звуковые эффекты, потому как она стала немного надоедать своей однообразностью. Меню для выбора уровня было неудобным, потому как для того чтобы добраться до нужного уровня, приходилось пролистывать все уровни между тем, на котором я находился и тем, на который я хотел попасть. ТЕМ НЕ МЕНЕЕ, процесс моей игры дошёл до того, что я настроился на правильную медитативную волну и осознал, что мне этот процесс нравится. Он был построен подобающе, так как начальные уровни были очень лёгкими, но в процессе становились сложнее уровень за уровнем, добавляя больше разнообразия в механику игры и в эти моменты игра становилась снова лёгкой, таким образом прослеживалась прятная волна уровня сложности, которая не позволяла мне почувствовать себя глупым и фрустрированным даже учитывая насколько я плох с головоломками, но при этом игра оставалась приятно сложной на всём протяжении. Также картинки, которые Вы создаёте, и музыка отлично дополняют так называемую волнообразность и медитативность игры. Достижения в игре подобраны идеально. Мне понравилось. Но для опытных энтузиастов головоломов игра может показаться черезмерно лёгкой.",1514315947,1515009791,True,10,1,0.664346635341644287,4,False,True,False,False,,,

Eu comprei porque estava muito barato. 
Comprei porque tinham sobrado uns troquinhos da Summer Sale.
Peguei esse jogo porque sim... não esperava nada!

[h1] Pontos Positivos: [/h1]
[list]

[*] O desafio! Confesso que nunca imaginei que o desafio seria tão interessante

[*] A forma como o jogo reinventa sua própria mecânica e te desafia no próprio desafio. Você começa movendo pedras para formar as figuras. Depois você move as pedras e gira blocos. Eventualmente você move três tipos distintos de pedras com comportamentos diferentes, além de mover blocos inteiros e outras coisas mais

[*] O teste de paciência e atenção que os desafios vão propondo à medida que você avança nos estágios próximo ao fim

[*] Pode parecer negativo para muitos, mas existir apenas UMA conquista (a de finalizar todos os desafios) foi pra mim um ""gás a mais"".
[/list]

[h1] Pontos Negativos: [/h1]

[*] A trilha sonora enche ""os pacovás"" depois de um curto tempo (eu mesmo mutei o jogo e fiquei ouvindo minha playlist)

[*] Apesar de bastante desafiador, não posso negar que me surpreendi com a rapidez com a qual terminei o jogo (1 hora e 1/2)

[*] Alguma coisa (talvez no design, trilha ou algo mais) fez com que eu, apesar da diversão, me sentisse cansado com o jogo e nunca de fato fisgado.

Despite being a short game, it all feels well-paced. New types of tiles and spaces come up very often and really make the hour fly by. You never feel like you didn’t get enough time with any ideas either.

Every time a new piece was placed, it feels great to move it around for the first time, discovering its simple function. From here you begin to see how a piece moves with other groups of itself and what patterns emerge from there. Klocki then progressively becomes more and more rewarding as you see your skills with each type of piece combine until you’ve created rules and patterns that you apply on a final gauntlet of bigger puzzles

Meanwhile, an ambient soundtrack keeps your mind clear and the occasion lower tone played after finishing a puzzle provides a nice boost of endorphin.

Klocki is inexpensive and a great brief yet complete game worth picking up for an hour of meditative tinkering. It’s also got trading cards and an easy 100% if you’re into gridding up your steam profile.

Errungenschaften: Ja (Einfach zu bekommen)

Positiv:

- Für jede Sprache geeignet

Negativ:
- Keine Herausforderung (zu einfach)
- Zu kurz
- Nervige Musik

Fazit:
Klocki ist ein kurzes Puzzlespiel. Die Rätsel sind keine große Herausforderung. Tatsächlich sah es auf der Shopseite besser aus, als es eigentlich ist. Zugegeben: Es hat Potential, aber dieses Potential wird nicht richtig ausgeschöpft! Für 1,5 Stunden Spielzeit, ist es etwas zu kurz geraten. Es gibt keine Menüs, Texte oder Sprachausgaben, was dazu führt das dieses Spiel für jede Sprache geeignet ist. Das Spielprinzip ist leicht zu lernen und selbst wenn was neues hinzukommt, fuchst man sich schnell hinein. Nervig ist die Musik, welche ich nach ein paar Minuten abgestellt habe. Der Kostenpunkt lag bei unter einem Euro, was gar nicht mal so verkehrt ist. Es gibt 3 Sammelkarten, die man nicht in der Spielzeit bekommt (Man muss das Spiel etwas länger laufen lassen, wenn man die will) und es gibt 1 Errungenschaft, welche beim letzten Level freigeschalten wird. Es fällt mir schwer dieses Spiel positiv zu bewerten, da es wie schon gesagt Potential hat.

[h1][b]TLDR:[/b][/h1] 
Very well made, the puzzles get more difficult the farther you go. Great casual/relaxing game. 

[h1][b]Basically...[/b][/h1] 
A puzzle game with different ""abilities"" as you progress. You click to shift pieces on the puzzle and try to connect the lines  (pink line with pink, yellow with yellow, blue with blue, etc). Pretty simple

[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1] 
Really creative and minimalistic look, which is what everyone is lovin' now. 

[h1][b]Controls:[/b][/h1] 
Click pieces to shift them/rotate them

[h1][b]Overall...[/b][/h1] 
It has great art and is worth buying, especially if it is on sale. 

[b]Pros:[/b] 
- Great art/graphics
- Creative and difficult (kinda) puzzles 
- Easy to 100%

Released on the PC platform on Jul 13, 2016 and is also available on Iphone,Ipad. There are no user reviews yet as of this writing. (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/klocki). 

On steam page, it shows klocki was developed by Maciej Targoni and Wojciech Wasiak. The same people who brought us Hook. klocki is also available on Linux.

To say klocki is just ""a puzzle game"" - it is a unjust description on this product. 
For me, I would describe klocki as creative, innotive puzzle game. Because it introduces mechanics/multiple combination of methods to solve a puzzle. This is what makes klocki interesting & fresh. It stand's out from the rest of the other puzzle genre games.

Controls, Audio and Visuals
It only uses Mouse control. No video/sound options. There's feedback sound on every block/click you make. The background music is light and relaxing - something very soothing.

Visually, its bright & colorful. 

Game Mechanics
klocki uses mix n match, rotating, reversi-like, number slide-like elementals to solve it range of puzzles. The difficulty gradually rises. So it does *not* shock the audience of the product. There's a little surprise at the last level puzzle. It shows this  is a labor of love.

My personal thoughts:
I don't really  play a lot of puzzle games because of my horrible past experience with them. The excruciating pain & frustration you put your mind through. The time and effort ..It feels as if my brain would [b]BURST[/b] if I continue further. 

Luckily, klocki does not put you through that sort of horrible gaming experience. There were some very tricky-crazy puzzles but it's still manageable. Overall, I was impressed with this simple, polished product. Good work with klocki, devs. Kudos. Keep up the good work.

I do have 2 points to share, hopefully the developers will take them into consideration for their future products.
[list]
[*]I would love to see a simple level design because there might be younger audience or people who are stuck in a particular level and unable to advance. It's a painful experience for them and at least with this design, they are given the option to skip a level and come back in the future to complete that particular level. This also serves as a replay-ability option and people would have an easier time making videos, showcasing klocki on youtube,etc.

I understand this request comes with revamping the whole level progression and unlocking achievement triggers. If you are unable to make all the changes for klocki, do it for future products. =)

[*]Video option: I would certainly love to play this in a window mode. It doesn't have to be full screen all the time.
[/list]


My Summary:
klocki was surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable - for me. That's not usually the case when I am playing puzzle genre games. lol. Creative mechanics, soothing audio, clean bright visual designs, I couldn't ask for anything more. It also has a fair pricing for this small scale of product. It's really worth it. I am pretty sure kloki has enough challenge for everyone; kids, teens & adults. On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for klocki is a solid 8/10.

The ambient music is calming and not distracting. The puzzles were interesting, but not terribly difficult (there was only one that I got stuck on for any decent amount of time - the rest of them I could move around and sort of figured it out as I went).

I think, overall, it was a decent puzzle game that is worth its price if you are just interested in a casual puzzle experience to keep your brain active. One thing I wish they had was some sort of level counter and/or a menu where it showed all the levels by number, because as it is now you don't know how much content is actually in the game until you finish it and even then if you wanted to know how many levels there actually were (like I did for this review) you would have to page all the way from the first puzzle to the last counting them yourself.

Good timing on switching things up to keep the levels being too repetitive
Really nice and relaxing music to help focus
So pretty and lovely to look at
Good challenges here and there, nothing too difficult but hard enough to get the gears turning
It also now has cards and an achievement

CONS :
Only options are for sound (on/off)

The short length means the game never outstays its welcome, I never found a level tedious, or having to deal with too much of the same thing. All very varied and well designed puzzles that make you think. In the early levels you can get around by doing random moves but that's not going to fly later on. Good soothing music and sound too!

I have just started the game, but I feel I already want to review it for the one's who might be equally convinced by the positive reviews.

I have played similar puzzle games before (LYNE, Hooks, Hexcells, and those I would recommend all). And yes, this game has nice relaxing music, but the colours are a lot stronger than they seemed in the video. And that was not really relaxing for me actually. The games I mentioned are doing a way better job in creating a relaxed atmosphere with music and visuals. 
Now the puzzles are also kind of boring, at least there are too many easy ones. You only need one or two to understand the rules of a new system, but not 5 or whatever. Some more difficult puzzles were interesting, but then the colours were too strong for my taste and I just wanted to get it done to get a change of colours.

Maybe for a person who doesn't play other puzzle games and likes strong colours it might be interesting, but for other players who know this type of game, I would not recommend it.",1499032657,1499032657,False,0,0,0.49751242995262146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But the fact of the matter is, the game is very good for its price.

klocki is a simple game: Make all the tiles activate by swapping, rotating, sliding, etc. Some tiles are 'wires' that need to be connected with no loose ends. Some tiles are black boxes that will turn into white circles when they're isolated from other tiles of their kind. Some tiles are circular and rotate on their axis; later levels will have you rotate entire chunks of the level to connect the lines.

It's a short game, so don't expect to spent a whole day playing klocki. And it's not massively challenging, either. All the levels can be solved with a little critical thinking and a solid thought process. But for a dollar it's a pleasant little experience and more than worth the money if you like simple puzzles and have nothing else to use that spare buck on.",1496816751,1496816751,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Normally I'll try to brute force my way past this point or simply give up out of frustration. This game, klocki, resulted in the same experience, and while that mechanic introduced is one I have particular trouble with (slide puzzles), I stuck around because of what came before it. The first twenty-ish minutes of this game were a delight, very relaxing while remaining engaging, likewise surprising and impressing me with new mechanics and elements that were rewarding when overcome. So, looking for more of that, I kept trying and trying to get past the bits that stopped me, and after a good ten or twelve minutes, I was able to do so, learning from the experience, and the rest of the game flew by, not quite as hard as the initial roadblock but not quite as rewarding as the first stretch either. 

And that's what this game was, really. There's not a ton to write about. The graphics are fine for this sort of thing. The music is pretty good, reminding me a lot of A Winged Victory for the Sullen. Moving around various knobs and levers looks, sounds, and feels great. It's short enough that it doesn't feel daunting while also giving you a good chunk of game to get through (apparently I spent nearly two hours with this game, though it felt like quite a bit less). So what you're left with, after all that, is a game that is mentally and emotionally rewarding, which is what puzzle games should be. I'm no expert in the field, but I've played my fair share of puzzle games, and I can't remember one that delighted me quite like this one. Come to think of it, I cant think of one in a long while that I was able to beat before giving up out of frustration, which might be a big part of it. I was a bit let down by the final puzzle, though the ones that came before it sure were a challenge, so I suppose I should think of it more as a soothing epilogue than the final climax. 

In any case, this is a hell of a cheap game and it packs more of a punch than you'd think for that price.

[u][b]SOUNDS[/b][/u]
With an ambiant music the game feels relaxing, only the sounds doesn't fit in that category.
[u][b]GAMEPLAY[/b][/u]
The first levels are really easy : you need to switch the pieces until you made one or several closed tracks. After that the difficulty is increased. You have a 3d-view and unlock also some tiles that can only be rotated. Then the harder ones will have both rotating and moving tiles at a time.

The game will also features some black & white tiles, the aim is to have all of them white by separating them. That type of tile can't touch another in any adjacent side, if you want to solve the this puzzle. As previously said, the game will also these 3 mechanisms : sliding, rotating, separating.

Finaly in the later levels you'll have some bizarre shapes that you need, like the lines, to create a closed shape.

Autor gry jest jak widać pasjonatem- stworzył minimalistyczną, aczkolwiek bardzo udaną grę logiczną, która ma na siebie własny pomysł. Klocki przypominają pod pewnymi względami puzzle, lecz tutaj zadanie jest utrudnione- należy tworzyć abstrakcyjne wzory, dopasowywać kształy co nie jest takie łatwe na późniejszych eapach gry.
Grafika w tej grze to estetyczny minimalizm, sprawiający jednak bardzo dobre wrażenie, nie ma tutaj przeszkadzajek i innych zbędnych elementów w tego typu grach.
Muzyka to istny majstersztyk- ambientowo relaksująca, z (moim zdaniem) optymistycznym przesłaniem.

The visuals are clean and the background music is relaxing if you want it on. 
It's easy to save your place because you just hit Esc...done, and the program will remember where you left off when you return.
It's a great little puzzle game to have on your desktop to 'fiddle with' when you have a moment or two to kill.
It also has replay value. It's something that you can constantly come back to from time to time.

Quizás destaca negativamente la sensación inevitable de estar frente a un título inacabado. Sin menú de inicio, sin un final (por sobrio que sea), tan solo volveremos al primer nivel en un bucle infinito. Su ausencia de marcador, ni de indicador de nivel... en fin, sólo los niveles, y poco más. Además, la dificultad es muy baja para este estilo de juegos, por lo que nunca representará un reto, y eso lo hace empobrecer demasiado.

Плюсы:
1.Стоимость.Цена довольно маленькая.
2.Не самая сложная головоломка,лично я никогда не играл в такие игры и не интересовался головоломками,но игру я прошёл довольно быстро,что говорит о её лёгкости.
3.Музыка на заднем плане,расслабляет и не напрягает мозг.
Минусы:
1.Сложность.Кому-то покажется что игра слишком лёгкая,кому-то слишком сложной.Так-что сложность неоднозначная.
2.Длительность.Игра ну уж СЛИШКОМ КОРОТКАЯ.Лично я прошёл её два раза за полтары часа (100 минут).За свои деньги конечно длина игры нормальная,но как по мне слишком уж короткая игра.
Игру я советую как убивалку времени,когда нечем заняться,то уж 10-15 минут она у вас займёт.Не советую проходить игру сразу,ибо вы не сможете прочувствовать игру,эта музыка на заднем плане очень расслабляет,и не напрягает мозг,а на против,не напрягает его.

Overall, this is a short but pleasant puzzle game, with a minimalist design that speaks to me, and a great set of game mechanics. The tiniest quibble I have is the introduction of the black squares—a mechanic that took me a little longer to figure out than the rest. Still, I cannot fault the game design for that. This is well thought out and worth your time, as brief of an experience as that might be.

I initially played this through Kongregate, and was quite pleased to see the game for sale through Steam. 

Simple, minimalistic, no instructions.

Make connections, light up the lines and shapes, spin and swap blocks about, and that's pretty much the premise of Klocki. 

The gameplay is easy and smooth, the ambient sound track is great and there's no text. 

There's just over 80 puzzles (at this time) and some can be a little challenging, and all of them, I enjoyed. 

I took my time on this, and spent about 90 minutes getting through them, so, although not a lengthy game, it can get your grey matter thinking about things.

There's no massive re-play value, and for less than a quid, what do you expect?

Only a few of the tiniest niggles. Level selection and mayby acheivements. That's it. 

If you enjoy a minimal game, that sometimes gives a challenge, then for the princely sum of 79 English pennies, this one's a winner and should be in your library right now.",1489222600,1489222600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

beautiful and minimalist visuals
nice ambient soundtrack
puzzles are great
The mechanic that isn't great (the sliding block part) doesn't take up a huge chunk of the game

CONS:
The sliding-block puzzles. 'Nuff said

CONCLUSION:
While it's short and has no replay value, the (mostly) great puzzles, beautiful visuals, nice and unintrusive background music, and overall great minimalist aesthetic made that short amount of time very enjoyable, and you should buy it if you like puzzle games and liked the online prototype/demo.

Pros:
-It is almost perfect minimalistic puzzle game. There is bright colours but not overwhelming, the music and sound effects are not intrusive and are relaxing, the puzzles are challenging but not frustrating. This leaves me enjoying the game, rather than ""grinding"" to get to the next puzzle
-The game itself is really cheap for the amount of content. For R12 (~$1) you get a good amount of time out of it. (I finished the game within an hour)
-It is easy to pick-up and play, not difficult to figure out what you have to do

Cons:
-I honestly don't have anything to put here.

This impressed me just as much as HOOK did. If you love puzzle game with a minimal feel to them, definitely give this a go.

The graphics and audio are simple and clear, which is something I like a lot in this genre.

The goals and controls are easy to understand.

One gripe I have is that a lot of early levels present no challenge and are intended as tutorials. Only late in the game the puzzles get interesting force you too focus.

I've beaten it in 1,5h - which is really short (c'mon LYNE is a similar game and I've put 200+h in it). A cheap person could even refund the game after finishing it due to that. Bear in mind it costs only 0,99€ - you could buy a beer for that much and it would take you less time to drink it.

Todella mukava pulmapeli askeettisine värimaailmoineen ja käyttöliittymineen

Peli alkaa helposti ymmärrettävinä palikkapeleinä, joihin tulee lisää pelimekaniikoita joiden toimintatapa selviää vain yrittämällä. Yleensä pulmiin ei kulu tuhottomasti aikaa, joten pelattaessa ei turhaudu nopeasti, mutta vaikeustaso on silti viihdyttävä.

Plussaa:
+ei turhia menuja, siisti käyttöliittymä
+ei turhia tekstejä tai opasteita
+saat itse oivaltaa, eikä yrittämisestä sakoteta
+muuttuvat pulmat, ei saman toistoa liian kauan

Miinusta:
-kovin pitkiä pelisessioita ei jaksa, peli kun ei kovin radikaalisti muutu
-lyhyehkö
-ei saavutuksia tai pistetaulukoita
-et voi ""parantaa"" suoritustasi. Kun kenttä on pelattu läpi, ei ole mielekästä palata vanhoihin pulmiin.

Described as minimal puzzle game, ""klocki"" (literally ""bricks"" in Polish) is exactly that.
Game is so minimalist, that it doesn't even have menu, not even level selection menu - after you finish last level, game cycles back to first one and you can switch between completed levels by pressing next/previous level.
There is no text in game, rules are never explained, instead, progressively more complex levels are built in such a way that player will figure rules out on his own. First level has only two tiles that can be swapped, and from there, game carefully builds very complex puzzles, with myriad of possible combinations, but always solvable purely by logical analysis. Trial and error is never necessary. I very much enjoyed watching how game starts with very simple rules and then, builds something complex.

Graphic style is minimalist indeed. Simple  shapes, simple shades, and simple gradients give it clean and clear look. Music doesn't get in the way, instead works to build mood of serenity. I liked ""artistic"" side.

The gameplay involves sliding, rotating and otherwise manipulating tiles into pleasant patterns. Different tiles can be manipulated in different ways, with more complicated levels requiring tiles of different types to be interlinked across orthogonal planes. The gameplay of some later levels can feel a little noisy, but I rather enjoyed the process of navigating a convoluted process in search of a visually simple solution.

Она без слабых мест. Можно ругать, что мало, но, с другой стороны, ее очень много - часов 50 для первого прохождения. Просто в такой шедевр хочется играть и играть, чтобы он вообще не заканчивался.

klocki - глоток свежего воздуха. Это действительно ""игра"", а не, как принято выражаться, ""кино"". Не ждите здесь роликов или диалогов как в Mass Effect. Это олицетворение классической puzzle game, а не тем, во что превратились puzzle game в этом поколении. 

Самое поразительное в klocki - это ощущение ""роста"". И речь идет не столько о прокачке персонажа в цифрах, сколько об улучшении самого игрока. Это поразительная история проб и ошибок: сначала кажущаяся просто непроходимой, но потом - очень понятной. 

Говорят, что klocki - игра для мазохистов, что это чрезвычайно сложная игра, в которой хочется разбить контроллер. Но так говорят не игравшие или игравшие недостаточно. Здесь просто нужно забыть правила, которым вас обучили в других играх. Это медленная игра, в которой нужно оглядываться и совершать обдуманные действия. 

Научившись этому понимаешь, что ранее непроходимые места теперь не так страшно посещать. И пройти их очень даже реально, хотя первичные попытки доказывали обратное. А самое смешное, что осознаешь это не когда цифра уровня персонажа зашкаливает, а когда уверенность в собственных умениях доходит до определенного уровня.

I like games that throw you into gameplay with no explanation, but allow you to figure out the ""rules"" by trial and error. Klocki is a very pleasant game to play, with beautiful smooth graphics in soothing colours. There are a variety of mechanisms that get introduced as you progress through the levels: rotation, swapping, etc. and it's fun to figure them out. After a new mechanism is introduced, it starts you off easy, and then begins to combine them into quite complex puzzles that are challenging but not frustrating. It's not entirely clear whether there is only one solution for each puzzle, or if you simply have to find a solution that meets the criteria, but it's fun to think about different ways you could solve it. I could play this game for hours, and was just thinking ""I hope this game never ends"" when it brought me back to the beginning. Aww. This game is similar to Zenge, which was equally calming and entirely too short for my liking. As with that game, I would love to see some Achievements to make the game even more replayable. For example, complete a puzzle in under X number of moves, or complete a puzzle without triggering the error buzzer, etc. Overall, this is an absolute bargain, and either a good way to kill a few hours, or a nice way to infuse your day with a few rounds of brain teasers.

A charming little puzzle game for a super cheap price.
Klocki is about as simple as they come, with lovely minimalist aesthetics and a nice bit of ambiance in the background for you too. But don't be fooled - there's a decent amount of levels to keep you entertained, and the game boasts a well-implemented system of progression that'll keep you interested with new mechanics every other stage to constantly test what you've learned so far.
The only issue i really had was that it touched on the potential to be a lot more challenging but never quite got there, and the lack of any menus whatsoever meant the you were constantly in the dark about how many puzzles you've done/how many you still had to complete. But i'm nit-picking here, it's still very enjoyable, and i guess a bunch of unnecessary menus would have spoiled their smooth, super-clean look.

게임을 시작하자마자 가운데에 판때기 2개가 놓여있고 주변에는 배경밖에 없으며 쓰는 버튼이라곤 게임 나갈 때 쓸 ESC하나 뿐.

그 박력넘치는 시작덕에 몰입도가 급상승했고, 그 영향인지 새로운 풀이법과 형태의 퍼즐이 나올 때마다 놀라움과 신비로움이라는, 마치 콜럼버스가 아메리카 대륙을 발견했을 때 느꼈을법한 감정을 느꼈다.
난이도 자체도 크게 어려운 부분이 없어 어딘가에서 너무 오랫동안 막힌 나머지 게임에 대한 몰입도가 떨어지는 일 또한 없었다.
그래픽또한 난잡하지 않고 깔끔하게 만들어져있어 퍼즐 몰입도를 높이는 데 한 몫 하였다.

중간중간 퍼즐 만들기가 귀찮았던건지 비슷한 생김새 혹은 쉬어가는 정도의 난이도의 퍼즐들이 섞여 있는데, 마치 퍼즐 갯수를 억지로 늘린 듯한 느낌이 들어 그부분은 아쉬웠다.
그리고 회전이 빠르다. 새로운 퍼즐 요소가 나오니 이전에 나왔던 퍼즐 요소 몇개가 좀 있다가 사라져버리는 것이다. 중간에 나온 6방향 회전 동그라미가 특히 그랬다. 거의 나오지도 않았다. 돌릴 때 소리하고 효과가 굉장히 박력넘치는데 안타깝다.

This is extremely good sliding puzzler with a lot of great mechanics. Mostly amazing graphics (the type of things from the last level should be smoother when combined).

The main problem is — small levels, which are very easy, and there are not much of them. You can blitz the game in less than half of an hour. Well it costs slightly more than one loaf of bread (in our local pricing), and 30% of that money goes to the valve's pocket. By itself these several minutes of gameplay were worth the price. But if we consider the current meta, where you can buy for the same amount of money old full AAA release (or two) [like, for example, two great Commandos games], then this seems extremely expensive.

The aim of the game is to complete lines or loops, where they can be wiggly across one surface, or wrap over corners to cover the faces of a cube.  It's all presented in isometric, with no need to rotate the whole play-space to get use of the three dimensions. It's really nicely done.   It doesn't use the isometric playfulness of ""Monument Valley"", for instance.  It just uses the flatter perspective to keep the game clean and puzzle-like.

The puzzles start out really simple, and stay very simple for the first dozen levels.   Every so often a new play device is thrown in, but usually it's pretty obvious what to do with it... There's one thing ""the hourglasses"", which occur, and it can be a little bit of a headscratcher, but after a bit of experimenting, that turns out to be one of the funner devices in the game.

I had a lovely time playing it on a plane, and then just in the evening once everyone had gone to bed to while away the last hour of the day. Each 'level' can take between 4 seconds and several minutes.  The sliding-block puzzles can take a couple of goes at them to get the right sequence, but none of them are particularly difficult.

You just play around with a loose plan in your head, and you will almost always get there.

I value puzzle games that require no guessing, and reward (enforce, actually) a pure logic think-it-through approach (ie. [i]Hexcells[/i]). While there are much worse offenders out there, this is probably where I'd say [i]klocki[/i] loses out from being really brilliant.

Like many modern puzzlers, [i]klocki[/i] has a minimalistic interface and design approach, which is nice. It is on mobile too.

The problem here is not that klocki isn't full of good ideas, or even that the puzzles are dumb. The problem is that this game spends nearly all its time introducing its elements, a little time combining some of them, and almost no time using all or even many of them at once.

For a comparison let's look at Blockwick 2, where the completion time for many reviewers looks like about 6 minutes per puzzle. Given my experience with Keifer Bros games I'd say this is about right. An unfair comparison, since Blockwick 2 is the work of a veteran three-man studio, but here's the thing. Klocki is more interesting, more original, and sometimes more clever. What went wrong here is that the sum of the parts never adds up to more than the sum of the parts.

Trudność gry jest niewielka, plansze mają poziom od kompletnie banalnego, do średniego, w tych najtrudniejszych musiałem parę minut pomyśleć. Rozgrywka sprowadza się do zmieniania położenia i obracania elementów planszy tak, by utworzyły wymagany wzór. W tych trudniejszych planszach chodzi o nadanie priorytetów konkretnym ustawieniom. Najpierw wykluczamy pewne ustawienia danych klocków, a potem inne ustawiamy tak, by pasowały do wcześniej podjętych kroków. Moim zdaniem autor nie wykorzystał odpowiednio potencjału takiej mechaniki rozgrywki i nie stworzył trudnych, rozbudowanych poziomów.

It’s quite short, as it took me just over an hour to complete, but it was still quite enjoyable in my opinion. 

It plays with various mechanics to mix the game up a little and make it a little more challenging. It also does a good job of introducing each new mechanic gently before incorporating it into all the others and giving you harder puzzles to solve. 

Difficulty wise, I would say that it’s not at the “mind-boggling” level, so you won’t have to think too hard about it. But with that said it’s not too easy either. It’s kind of a middle ground that I would say still left me satisfied enough to have liked the game. 

The graphics are simple and nice on the eyes, which gives the game a chill kind of feeling despite the fact that some puzzles towards the end look a little visually chaotic.

This game came after the developer’s previous puzzle game “Hook” which is another unique short little puzzle game that I quite enjoyed. If you have played and enjoyed that I think you would enjoy this one too, and vice versa to people that have played this and might enjoy that.

I look forward to any other little puzzle games that this developer comes out with and would say it’s definitely worth spending an hour on for under £1. 

EDIT: The dev added in an achievement after I had finished it for completing the game, I re-installed the game ready to go through it again and was pleasantly surprised to know that despite it saying that it’s not on the cloud, it had saved that I had already completed it. As you can scroll left and right through the levels and it was where I left it last time, I automatically got the achievement. So an easy 100% if you haven’t played the game, but an even easier 100% if you have.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

I was expecting harder puzzles - maybe not hardcore but the screenshots looked like they had some challenge in them at least - but I was surprised to find such easy gameplay. A few levels put up a couple of extra minutes' resistance but most I just sped straight through non-stop.

[h1]Pro[/h1]

It's a pretty, casual puzzler to spend a couple of hours with. I did enjoy the time.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

No level overview, no names/numbers for the levels. You can't tell how far you've progressed in the game. It turns out there are 82 levels but you have no idea during gameplay, you just carry on and then suddenly find yourself on level 1 again. Game over.

Windows only. I know I'm harping on about this, but how hard would it be to port such a simple game over to Linux, really?

[h1]Value[/h1]

Being a $1 game doesn't automatically make it brilliant value. You have to consider the amount of gameplay and compare it with other games. I'd say $1 is correct for this game but not outstanding. You have to bear in mind there are a bazillion other $1 2-hour games, most of which have trading cards so you can get half your money back.

[h1]Steam[/h1]

No achievements. No cards.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I confess I had pre-conceived high expectations for this game but it didn't live up to the hype. It's a perfectly nice short puzzler and deserves a recommendation but it's forgettable and I've had better. Examples? OK then:

Zenge is the same price/length/difficulty but it's prettier, has better music, trading cards, an achievement and Linux; Meld costs more but has 50 times the gameplay (time-wise) with difficulty from easy to hardcore++, making it far better value.

Go on then, downvote me. You needed a reality check amongst all the enthusiasm though. You know it.

At first it appears too simple and hackneyed, but I'm glad as I stayed with it, as it quickly introduced puzzle variations that kept it interesting and engaging till the end -- to the point I was disappointed it was over and went looking for more levels. 

The puzzle designs feel a bit amateurish -- in that there isn't a consistency to the difficulty ramp (it can jump from easy to hard to easy), and some of the innovative puzzle mechanisms aren't employed to their potential (e.g. the brilliant dominoes mechanism isn't used beyond a couple of puzzles).

And well, here we are. I understand that nobody likes a party pooper who buys overwhelmingly positive rated games just to leave a negative review on them, but I have a few important points to make.

Before anyone starts to think otherwise: In no way do I hate puzzle games. In fact, I would say puzzle games are my favorite genre. The feeling of satisfaction when one solves a difficult puzzle, the 'aha!' moment, is one of the best experiences one can have playing video games. But, for me at least, klocki fails to deliver on this experience.

The goal of each level in the game is to rearrange the pieces in it so that there are no ""loose ends"" remaining. It's a very simple concept and the game communicates it to the player without using any words, which is one thing I'll give it credit for. Unfortunately, the depth that this system is supposed to allow for is sorely lacking.

When I say that, part of what I mean is that the puzzles are easy in this game. Quite easy, in fact. There weren't many puzzles that took me more than a couple of minutes to solve. Now, I don't demand that every puzzle game be Snakebird levels of hard (even if I prefer it that way), but there's no satisfaction to be had in solving an easy puzzle. Puzzles are supposed to challenge your mind in a way that makes you feel smart when you solve them. If there's no challenge, there's no smart feeling when you solve them. There are a few challenging puzzles in the game, but even those don't really give the game much depth.

Most of the game's difficulty comes through complexity - you make the levels harder by making them larger. This is poor puzzle design. A puzzle game's difficulty should come from exploring the strategies that the ruleset allows for. But in this game, there really isn't much strategy in solving the puzzles at all. When you discount the possibilities that obviously won't lead to a valid solution, each puzzle can be solved through pure trial and error. If a particular piece has some loose ends, you move it around to a different place, and if that messes up the connections of a different piece, you adjust that piece also, and soon enough with this process you'll end up with the solution. The game frequently adds new methods of moving pieces such as rotating handles and sliding tiles, and also new types of connections such as abstract shapes, but these fail to change the basic strategy of trial and error. In the end, they feel like a cover-up for the inherent shallowness of the core game mechanic.

So, if you're looking for a puzzle game that requires clever thinking and intimate knowledge of the game mechanics, you're probably convinced by now that this is not the puzzle game you're looking for. But I suspect that most people here don't really care about difficulty and depth of mechanics - they just want  something that can pass the time while also being simple and relaxing. That's perfectly fine; life can be exhausting at times, and you might not want to play super-demanding games after you've had a long day. But even considering that, this game is poor value for your money.

Some people are going to look at me weird for calling a 99 cent game ""poor value"". But yes, this game is poor value for your money. It took me 45 minutes to complete this game, so that's 0.75 hours of gameplay per dollar. Which doesn't look too bad at first, but let's compare it against my favorite puzzle game, Stephen's Sausage Roll. (I'm sorry, I just can't help but be a zealot for that game. It's soooooo good.) Stephen's Sausage Roll is $30, and it took me 32.5 hours to beat, giving over an hour of gameplay per dollar. Just think about it: a game thirty times the price of this one [i]beat[/i] it in value! And Stephen's Sausage Roll's puzzles are much more involved, so you could even say that each hour is more ""densely packed"" than an hour of klocki. Even worse, you could play free online logic puzzle games such as nonograms or slitherlink, which I would consider to be around the same complexity as this game, giving a hours per dollar ratio of *gasp* [b]infinity![/b].

Now, I don't think hours per dollar is the best measure of a game's value, as the previous (ridiculous) example shows, but if you're playing games solely to pass the time, then most puzzle games are pretty much interchangeable for that purpose. And in any case, the ""good value"" angle seems to be what developers try for whenever they release an absurdly low priced game like this, so I wanted to get that out of the way. If you want to spend money on a relaxing logic puzzle game on Steam, I might suggest Everyday Genius: SquareLogic, which provides thousands of procedurally generated Sudoku-like puzzles that actually have quite a bit of depth to them. Or maybe you could try the Hexcells series, which has over 100 handcrafted Minesweeper-like puzzles over three games, plus a random puzzle generator in the third game. Both cost significantly more than the 99 cents klocki costs ($5 and $9 for the entire series, respectively), but hopefully this will reinforce a point that too often goes ignored in this era of cheap indie games and Steam sales: you get what you pay for.

Really soothing, and addicting if you think you are good at puzzles. The early stages prepare you for the later stages. every few levels it introduces a new mechanic so it doesnt get boring fast.

I personally am more of a fan of spacial puzzles rather than number puzzles. I also enjoy solving ""rubik's"" cubes, 4x4's and the megaminx. This is a great ""app"" type game and works well with a mouse. 

The music is great too. Totally worth 99 cents if you want something to waste an hour on in your down time. I give this a 9/10, because there was no level counter, which could have been left out for asthetic purposes, but is still a feature i value in a level based game. :)",1470886714,1470886714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It took me an hour and a half to finish it but it was for a buck, so the content/price relationship is fine. However, it aint really replayable. You will be done with it after the first run.
