De nouveaux gadgets font leur apparition et, comme dans le premier jeu, la partie générée lorsque vous le lancez peut être très différente, le jeu vous proposant une solution au hasard pour votre partie pour résoudre l'élément perturbateur.

Ce qui est très positif, c'est que ma nostalgie ne pouvait pas jouer avec cet opus, contrairement au premier.

Etant donné le public-cible assez jeune et pourtant le fait que j'aie vraiment pris mon pied, on peut dire que c'est un vrai succès et que ce volet plaira à la plupart des joueurs !

While Spy Fox in Dry Cereal is filled with witty one liners that will keep even adults entertained throughout a playthrough, the vast majority of dialogue in this game seems to be directed towards explaining basic things to the player. The game relies far too much on making obvious, lazy jokes about the S.M.E.L.L.Y. corps instead of writing real dialogue.The setting is a bit drab and lacking in creativity as well; without a cast of interesting characters to interact with, the fairgrounds feel noticeably empty. The villain is an obvious reference to Napoleon, even sharing the same name and hang-ups about being ""short."" Without humor and faith that the player can figure things out alone, the game comes across as a really bad kids commercial--the kind not even kids would want to listen to.

Honestly, the thing I liked about Spy Fox as a kid in the 90s was the lack of dumb ""haha it's funny because the word smelly is gross"" jokes found in other games. This isn't it. Fortunately, it's not the only other game in the series, and Spy Fox 3 returns to its more entertaining roots.

As with most of these Humongous Entertainment games, there are multiple possible paths for the game.  I have played one path and enjoyed it. The puns are actually often pretty funny.  Thankfully the writers put in multiple desultory comments when doing things.  However, the ""that's not going to work"" comment gets a wee bit old eventually.

In my 4.something hours of playtime, I played through most of this in one sitting, forgot to save, restarted and played through until the end  (I also had it minimized for a while).  I expect it is about 1-2 hours per game if you click on everything and have not seen the cutscenes before.

TLDR: Cartoony DOS collection of activities aimed at you with a mystery solving fox spy. Pixelated and possibly not enough clues on what to click at times.

Spy Fox is voice acted and features plenty of animations around the game to interact with. The interactivity does not feature puzzles but there is a logical sequence to follow for progress and there is sometimes no inherent feedback on whats required. There are multiple items and a non blind run is somewhere around an hour. Guides are often required for games of this era and subgenre. Altogether it may or may not fit with a very small niche of young gamers but it is not quite worth keeping on display in permanent library and is best kept archived. I can see what this is going for but really it is not that special or interesting. The niche of gamers would have to be familiarity with point&click and ages 3-9.",1550677995,1550677995,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played the demo of this game on our copy of Spy Fox Operation Ozone, but I never actually got to play the full game then. Don't know why I never bothered to buy it back when I was a kid. I guess I was too busy spending money on Bionicles. Anyways, let's talk about Spy Fox 2 Some Assembly Required. 

So this time you're sent to the World's Fair, to stop Napoleon Le Roach from unleashing a giant robot dog out onto the city. Depending on two different pathways, you'll use different spy gadgets and a whole lot of suave. You'll also interact with many characters as you find items to deactivate the robot dog. And like the previous game, the game play will change. However, sadly, there's only two different pathways. One with a venus flytrap, and one with a sort of futuristic vacuum device. You'll still however get to experience a bonus ending, that I forgot to mention in my previous review. 

To be honest this is not my favourite out of the main trilogy. The World's Fair seems small, and only having two pathways doesn't add a lot of replay value much. But that's not to say that the game lacks! It still has what made the first game so much fun. Like the music for example; it's a miz between jazz and suave that always gets you jammed up. The music in the Apls is also really good, as well as the ice rink has very fitting hockey music. Also the humour is pretty much spot on too.  There's some really funny moments; such as Spy Fox getting caught on security camera, to Professor Quack trying to fix the ID Maker, to my personal favourite of Spy Fox trying to skate in the Spy Skates without an ice skating diagram. That one cracked me up as a little kid. I'd just sit there for an hour doing that. xD

Also in my previous review, I forgot to talk about the spy gadgets that you use! This game doesn't have my favourite gadgets in the series though; like you'll get a gadget that is really just those things you use on cars to jump start them, but then you will get some cool gadgets along the way, such as the Spy Skates to perform ice skating moves like a boss, and a set of utensils that can replicate fingerprints. 

Well that's basically about it. If you never got to play this game as a kid like me, you should pick it up right here on Steam! Or if you've never played any of the games at all, you should try it out!",1530945322,1530945322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Это первая в моей жизни игра от Хумонгус, первый квест и наверное по большому счёту первая полноценная ПК-игра. До этого я играл в...

Как все квесты Хумонгоус она яркая, необычная, полная прекрасной музыкой и колоритными персонажами, необычными, но не слишком сложными загадками и имеющие две альтернативные ветки сюжета (вторая запускается при повторном прохождении), что немного увеличивает её реиграбельность.

 В этот раз старине Лису предстоит посетить Всемирную Выставку где есть всякие удивительные штуки типа клонирования еды, знаменитого каскадёра Кейп Карда, восковых фигур и прочего и помешать коварному таракану-французу Наполеону ЛаРоучу расплющить всех гигантской собакой-роботом... ну да, игра достаточно детская, хотя и не совсем для младших дошколят, к этому вы должны быть готовы. Но если отбросить в сторону предрассудки и дать игре шанс вы не пожалеете. И детишек она увлечёт надолго.

Ever. I always wanted to as a kid, but the furthest I got to playing it was in a demo attached to Spy Fox 3. So, there are absoulely no nostalgia-goggles on me for this review.

But, unfortunately, like the first Spy Fox, I didn't enjoy this game either.

As a follow-up to Dry Cereal, this game is a little bit better in a few ways. It doesn't just show the villain and give him screentime at the end. LeRoach is given some fleshing out (though it doesn't make ANY sense, how a kid denied entrance to a fair and getting laughed at would lead him to join an evil organization and want to take over the world). The humor is much better in this game as well. Spy Fox was still annoying as hell with his snide comments, but I enjoyed the other sight gags and the repeating joke where a chatacter would slide into the screen and say, ""S.M.E.L.L.Y. Oh yes. Our arch-nemesis,"" had me laughing several times.

But with those positive comments, comes my slew of negative ones. For one, I think this choice of location is MUCH lazier than Dry Cereal. It's a cool World Fair, but there's so little to it and it's so aesthetically uninteresting that it got boring to me really fast. 

Also, similarly to Dry Cereal, the villain's plan seemed really stupid to me. How would relying on precisely 1,000,000 people cranking a turnstile to enter a fair which would crank a giant mechanical dog could possibly work. How would you know if the stadium could hold a million people? How would you know a million people would come? How do you know your robot is durable enough to destroy an entire planet? Doesn\'t world domination require a successful leadership instead of... rampant destruction? In the words of Tony Stark, ""Not a good plan.""

The whole S.M.E.L.L.Y. plot didn't really go anywhere either. They mention it several times, and it made for some good jokes... but really in the end it's just LeRoach doing his own thing. 

However, the whole ""ticking clock"" plot allowed for a very Pajama Sam-esque plot development influenced by the gameplay itself. It's not as linear as Dry Cereal. Every piece you get to deactivating the robot dog increases the drive for completion. It's much more organic for a player to get involved in the story, and I prefer it to the archetypal Humongous plots.

But, you saw the thumbs down. And because you liked the game and saw I didn't, that means you're going to downvote my review, even though I gave my legitimate points for disliking it. Even worse, you won't leave a comment telling me why you disagree with my review. I'd happily accept arguments, but this is the internet so ho hum. 

In spite of everything, Some Assembly Required is a better Spy Fox installment than the last game. But I still personally didn't enjoy it. I'm not saying that you shouldn't enjoy it because I didn't. I'm saying that I didn't for my own reasons. I'm giving Spy Fox 2 a 6/10.",1464753942,1467301515,False,6,2,0.460400164127349854,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On a more serious note, great sequal to the series. Get it individually or the Spy Fox Complete Pack (Or H.E. pack).

Spy Fox is a cult-classic series from H.E. back in the late 90's. He is at his best in this game, better than the first ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/283980/]still good too[/url]), and far better than the third ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/292260/]which I don't recommend[/url]).

The plot is great, the background story of the villan as you progress answers ""who, why, and how"", the true ending is about the same as the first game's in terms of concept, but different approach (redirect their escape route and sent them to Spy Jail).

In Spy Fox 2: S.A.R., you're headed to the World's Fair (somewhere in western America) to disable a giant mechanical dog based on a toy model, both made by S.M.E.L.L.Y. (Society for Meaningless Evil, Larceny, Lying and Yelling). You need to figure how to get inside the robot, and disable it before it 'causes a rampage.

The game is longer than the first, but with two fixed alternate paths instead of many possible alternate paths in the first game. Both paths are challenging in their own way (and the Spy Vending Machine can tip you off of which one.)

New characters to meet that are memoriable: Elmo the Cape Cod fan (don't get him started), Le Roach, and the Wax Museum Security Guard (poor guy has it rough). Along with returning characters: Monkey Penny, Prof. Quack, and Walter Wireless. (Sadly no Russian Blue...)

There's apparently a song reference that I partially gotten as a kid, but fully gotten now.

This is a must have game whether you're new to adventure games, nostalgia, for your child, or want something witty and humorous.

SPY Fox 2 Theme Song:
He is a Fox whos beyond LeRoach
Gizmos & Gadgets Galore

When the Bad Guys come to fall on him
You'll know he'll even the score

When Times are uncertian and Mischief's afoot
And Baddies are Moving about

The Fox in the Tux will give Evil the boot
SPY Corps' a comin' to call...

SPY Fox!
He's the guy with the Moves & smarts to solve every crime

SPY Fox!
He's the Fox with the Gadgets you know that he'll win every time

SPY Fox!
So run & hide you Baddies
Here he Comes for you

He's SPY Fox!
SPY Fox!
