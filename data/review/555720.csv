The puzzles aren't super tough but require you consider what your doing rather than run blindly through the level.

The gameplay is not only fluid, but really great for a 2d sidescrolling puzzle game. I'm not gonna lie I did in-fact get stuck on a few parts of the game, it was really thought out and I really enjoyed the challange. Since each of the characters do different things/different abilities, I found myself really getting into that intrinsic part of the game. I can't remember the last time I've played a game quit like this and thought that in order to progress you need use Dante, Malice, and Elliot at different times just simply neat. 

I would say one of my favorite things in Grave Danger was the banter between the characters, it wasn't over done and actually quite funny.  The music was also really fun and really good. One last thing I would like to comment on was the fact that I ran into very few bugs, considering this was from what I can tell the first game from this developer.

I would highly suggest playing this sweet little game.",1484026809,1484026809,True,12,1,0.589872241020202637,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Dante the cowboy can climb walls, Malice the Grim Reaper can glide to cover wide gaps and Elliot the wizard can double-jump to the high spots. As you progress along the level each character has to gain access to pressure plates, switches, dynamite etc to open up passages for the others to eventually reach the exit. Of course, the combinations of these things become more and more complex. At the start and end of each level there's always a short conversation between the 3 protagonists, and sometimes the evil characters who appear, to progress the storyline which involves baddies who have taken over the bakery and are plotting dastardly deeds. It has a distinct Scooby Doo vibe. You get fabulous lines like ""overclocking the magical sweetness infuser"". Brilliant!

It can be played with keyboard/mouse but I would highly recommend a controller which feels natural switching between the characters and using their special moves.

[h1]Death[/h1]

When one of your characters dies everything turns grey and your 'ghost' gains super movement, letting you to roam around the level wherever you like which allows you to plan your route and try to work out the best way to solve the puzzle. Once you've done that, you go back to the last graveyard you reached where you're resurrected to carry on with your pals.

There are enemies all over the level that drop food items which you can pick up to replenish your health. These enemies respawn if you die or there are no other players near them. People have said this can be annoying, but they are generally quite easy to kill, and it's fun to keep killing them while you try to solve the puzzle. It gives you something to do instead of just wandering around trying to find the next switch.

[h1]GD vs Trine[/h1]

This game will inevitably be compared to Trine since it works on the same concept, but it's a totally different beast. Both have a storyline but where Trine takes itself quite seriously, GD is full of fun and cheeky wit. Trine is physics based and because of this there can be many ways to solve the puzzles, with or without all three characters. GD is pure platforming, no physics. There's only one way to solve the puzzle and you must use all 3 characters at different sections of the level to achieve it, by taking it in turns. For me, this makes it the better co-op game of the two because everyone has their part to play.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

Runs smooth as silk on both Windows and Linux. No problems at all. The hardware requirements are low so I suspect this would run well on a potato-class computer.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

There is a wide range of difficulty, and I started to struggle exactly halfway through the game which shows a perfect balance. The scoring for the levels are based on the number of deaths, so you can repeat and get to know the level until you reach 'S' grade. To get the ultimate S+ grade you have to speed-run to beat a specific time and also collect all the Wanted posters which just became a thing in the latest update.

[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]

This is where GD really shines. The cartoony graphics are bright, colourful and fun. There are so many enemies and food items to enjoy and collect via achievements and it's all accompanied by a catchy background tune. One detail that never gets old for me is they way they do a little burp every time they pick up a food item.

[h1]Steam[/h1]

The achievements for this game deserve a special mention. Most of them are gained after picking up a certain number of food items and they pop up at satisfyingly regular intervals in the early game, with wonderful names and artwork. Others are at the 'hard' end of the spectrum of the game involving speed runs and Wanted poster collection. Easy to get most, hard to get them all, the way it should be.

No trading cards yet but at this price point I don't think they are the reason you would buy the game.

Steam cloud, which I can confirm works cross-platform. Nice.

[h1]Value[/h1]

You'll definitely get your money's worth here, even at full price. It's a high quality game with plenty of challenge and replay value.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

This is a perfect puzzle platformer. I don't have a bad word to say about it. It oozes quality and fun, with steady difficulty progression leading to a hard challenge in the later levels. I've never seen a better game to play with your kids. Great for adult single-player too.",1484004468,1484004468,True,14,0,0.607833504676818848,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The second I saw the fact you play a cowboy, a wizard, and a skeleton at the same time, I was sold. I'm only a few levels in, but so far the gameplay feels nice and solid, and characters feel varied without actually changing too much of their moveset.
The cowboy, who you start as, has wall climb and a nifty -if kind of tricky to time- dash jump.
The wizard, who you add to the party second, has a double jump. I also find his attack my go to if I can.
The Skeleton, who comes last, has a hover, though it does not last forever and it's more like a slowed down fall.
And just with those, the level design works perfectly to give each of these characters completely different ways to cover terrain. This is a fun platformer, but it does get pretty tricky!",1482482457,1482482457,True,13,1,0.551343977451324463,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It’s an action-puzzle-platformer game about three heroes. These are Dante (the cowboy), Elliot (the wizard), and Malice (the reaper). Each of them uses his special unique abilities to get through each level. For example Dante can perform dashes and can climb walls, the wizard can double jump and the reaper is able to float above an area for a time. Each of this abilities has to be used wisely to solve the different puzzles and lead them through the story. 

For a better experience I’d recommend to play this game with your friends co-op. This makes things easier and more fun, you can help each other, if someone gets stuck and doesn’t know what to do next. And well, this game has some tricky moments! But if don’t have the opportunity to play it with your friends you can simply go to single player mode and switch between the characters, solving each part of the puzzles step by step.

I really love the art style of this game and the music. And there’s one more thing. If you take yourself some time to read all the dialogues, you will notice quite a big amount of jokes and funny phrases, making the game even funnier.

And if “just going through the story” is too boring for you, try to get an S+ each level. That should be quite hard, I think!

Any problems with this game? I had some small. I tried to play it with my controller, but for some reason it didn’t react to my Logitech controller, so I played it with my keyboard. The keyboard controls are quite okey, too! And there is that moment, when you realize, that you’ve forgotten to make something and go back, the monster respawn again and again. Sometimes killing the same Ogre 10 times is quite annoying, but maybe it’s just my impatience :D

Positive:
+ nice art and music
+ jokes and funny phrases
+ makes you think very much at some moments
+ Controller support
+ Co-op mode
+ very challenging

Negative:
- too frequent monster respawns
- had problems with my Logitech Controller

So in brief this game is really cool and definitely worth playing, grab some friends, give it a try and spend a nice time playing Grave Danger!

8/10 wanted dead AND alive!
