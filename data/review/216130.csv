Pros:

o The core concept is engaging, with a quick base-building system that allows for potential comebacks when resources are available.
o It's easy to grasp and get into.



Cons:

o Ships often experience severe shaking when attempting to move, and there are instances when they won't respond as expected, especially when part of a larger group.

o The AI's performance in skirmishes is lackluster, as it sometimes makes peculiar decisions that lead to swift defeat, such as sending its starting construction ship into harm's way.

o Gameplay largely involves waiting for resources and ships to accumulate, while the AI fails to present a meaningful challenge. However, if you encroach on their territory prematurely, they send overwhelmingly powerful waves to crush you.

o The game is plagued by various glitches that can lead to game freezes, necessitating relaunches.

o Research points are scarce in the early stages, but later, they become abundant, yet there's often an insufficient number of useful research options.

Это космическая RTS с долгой, достаточно интересной и более чем сложной кампанией.

Игра подзаброшена в плане заплаток, и хотя мне удалось посмотреть-таки финальные титры, путь к ним был тернистым. Особую радость мне принёс баг с запретом на строительство дредноутов там, где это, по идее, разрешено.

По порядку: 3 стороны, планетарные и орбитальные сооружения, флот от крошечных до гигантских кораблей. Наикрутейшие - дредноуты - имеют активируемые способности, прокачиваются и вообще ведут себя героически. На корабли каждого класса есть ограничение по количеству, но итоговый размер флота может быть весьма впечатляющим.

Ближайшие аналоги игры, приходящие на ум: Sins of the Solar Empire и Haegemonia: Legions of Iron: для увеличения численности войск и притока ресурсов вам необходимо колонизировать планеты, хотя в Gemini Wars бывают разноплановые уровни, и не всё привязано к околопланетным действиям.

Главную ставку игра делает на продолжительную историю, где нам предстоит сопровождать, атаковать, строить базы и флот, даже сражаться с ""боссами""-кораблями. Общий масштаб истории очень впечатляет, задания по-хорошему сложные, часто приходится мучительно, пробами и ошибками, искать единственно верную тактику. Не раз мне приходилось пользоваться багами, чтобы хоть как-то прорваться (вроде задания с одинокой космической станцией в последней трети). Даже стелс-миссии встречаются, всё как в лихих стратегиях из двухтысячных.

Экономическая составляющая примитивная, но сложная в том плане, что ресурсов очень мало. Одно из первых заданий, где вы возглавляете оборону планеты, исключительно сложное именно потому что вам необходимо бережно тратить свои средства, и выбор между оборонительными турелями и истребителями довольно непрост.

Внешне игра очень скромная, звуковое оформление не очень запомнилось, поэтому не стану комментировать.

Как мне показалось, интересная история, от начала до конца которой вы проведёте главного героя, многое искупает.
Здесь не самое удобное управление - скверный, кстати, недостаток, - немало ошибок и очень высокая сложность, но сыграть всё равно советую, тем более, что космических RTS в природе немного.",1649532953,1649532953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But in 2019 the game got a large patch that fixed a lot of the reasons people gave it a thumbs down. The game is stable now and no longer requires a registration. Is it worth $15? No. I think if the dev lowered it to $5 he'd probably make a lot more money. 

The story is not original, pretty much follows the exact storyline and game mechanics as Haegemonia. Though, I will say Gemini Wars was a little easier to get into. Both games involve wars between humans in space and having to unite to combat an alien terror. Pretty much the same story as Descent Freespace or dozens of other games, movies, TV shows. It's a well-used trope and Gemini Wars didn't bring anything new to it, except maybe a small twist at the end which sets up a DLC or sequel that'll never come.  I like this trope though, it's one of my favorites. But the alien threat never felt mysterious and never felt personified making it kind of meh.

The UI is workable. My biggest complaint is camera angels. Maybe I just missed it, but I couldn't figure out how to rotate the camera. The second to last mission was definitely the worst with it almost impossible to see things correctly with only being maybe 15 degrees above the plane it was hard to click on the right objects.

The unit shaking is still there after the 2019 patch but not as much. I noticed it only a few times. Often though units would warp to the wrong point on the map. I can't tell you how many times I lost a ship because it went to the wrong warp point. Unit building allows a queue of 10 units, which is okay, but you have to manually find the structure to build more and when the maps began to take on multiple systems it got difficult to do so in a hurry. The last level for some reason many of the mining sectors I couldn't build mining facilities on, not sure what was up with that. Also, at least two of the achievements are bugged.

Overall a fun little campaign. Some UI issues detracted from the game. Graphics it's about what you'd expect for a 2012 indie game, which is fine because space with ships gives you more to work with. Unit roster is fine. There's really no reason to build frigates but destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and carriers each have a distinct role-- if there was a formations button I'd have built smaller missile frigates but they just raced ahead to die too much.",1635448059,1635448059,True,5,0,0.583876132965087891,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I like that you don't have to restart searching everything during the campaign. Technology you already researched in a previous mission is still available.

The screenshots and the trailer will show you big ships and big fleets and big battles, trying to make you think that's what this game is about. They're lying. This game is about waiting for your resource counter to uptick just enough to build another tiny ship that will ignore group move orders to go check out some incredibly interesting space dust.

About 80% of my time spent on this game was spent just waiting for the resource counter to uptick to the point where I could afford another [i]basic unit.[/i] That wait time might have been tolerable if they'd included a variable game speed option. They didn't.

There was a lot more playtesting needed here, because there's something very wrong with the basic setup. It's either that ships are too expensive, or resources just take too long to gather. Given the relative fragility of most units and the intolerable wait times between being able to build stations as well, I suspect it's actually both.

単純クリック手動作業のRTSとかダルすぎでクソとか

俺はそうは思わんよ
んなことねぇよ
昔のRTSなんてマニュアル操作に頼り切ったゲーム腐るほどあったし
別にタイトルなり勘違いでコンセプト違うとか見た目詐欺だからつったって
ストラテジータグがついてるゲームであるっていう事にはかわりないんだし
ある程度は面白けりゃ納得行くし文句つけたって意味ないだろ
そもそも色んな操作項目があってよくわかんねえなんて言うような
脳死野郎は最初からストラテジーゲームなんてするんじゃねえよハゲ
チュートリアルめんどくさがるぐらいならゲームそのものをやめろ
俺も人のこと言えんけど、どうせそういう奴って利用規約よまないで後からキレるタイプだろ
長すぎる分かりづらいとかならまだしも、1分1秒たりと読まずに評価下げるとか論外だろ
それに単純作業が嫌だとか内容が完全に分かり切ってる奴がやりたいってんなら
それこそ無難な人気AAAタイトルとか調べりゃすぐ出て来るし、それでもおとなしくやってろって話
そもそも贅沢すぎるんだよ
ここの開発なんと2ヵ国同時ほぼフルローカライズ
操作自体はマニュアルで単調に見えるけど、長く遊ぶ分には飽きさせない工夫してるよ
このゲームよりよっぽど酷いクソゲーなんて、Steamに何百何千タイトルあると思ってんだよ
そこらへんのクソゲーと違ってシナリオもそれなりに力入ってるし音楽も良く出来てる
しかも突然ミッションはじまるゲーム多い中、このゲームは一応簡易ブリーフィング画面が用意されてんだぜ？
大手販売のコンシューマ手抜きゲーでもブリーフィング抜いてるカジュアルストラテジー珍しくないのに
ちゃんと雰囲気を重んじて、愛着込めて一生懸命作ってるのが感じ取れた
つうか他のゲームを例にするとさ、ローカライズ6か国語対応とかで6000円8000円ぼったくるってか
（ちょっと言い過ぎか、ローカライズの手間考えたらぼったくりじゃないけどさ…）
なんていうのかな
まあ大変だけど値段相応だからキツい文句は言えんけど
金払って買って遊んでんだから、ある程度は意見しても良いレベルみたいなところあんじゃん
それが高値で売るってもんだけど
このゲームなんと母国語と英語の対応有りで1480円だぜ？
セール時とかちょこちょこやってるバンドル入りで計算したらワンコイン以下で買えるぐらいの値段だぜ？
俺が昔に見た時はもうちょっと高かったから、それである程度の評価下がってMixed（賛否両論）なんのは分からないでもないけど
これインディーズだよ？SquEniとか2Kとか有名どころが作り売りしてるわけじゃねーよ？
それでNegative（不評）超えるとか、開発が悪いんじゃなくてプレイしたユーザの脳味噌がどうかしてるだろ

やめろよな
エアプで評価下げるの…
いくらゲームに不具合が多かったりローカライズ完璧じゃないとは言え
安く買って適正な値段で遊べてるなら文句言われる筋合いないだろ
インディーズの開発だって一生懸命作ってんのに

最近のSteamはユーザのせいで質が落ちてるストラテジーゲームが多すぎる
そんなにゲームの質を自分たちで落として何がしたいの？

The User interface is clunky at best. Theres no way to build units from a base structure except by zooming in to said structure and building it. Takes precious time, and is difficult to do if the building is surrounded by swarms of your own ships. No shortcut to select it, no empire tree or similar manager.

No hotkeys whatsoever and no settings for controls.

This is in space. SPACE. Despite that, unit maneuver are severely limited since there seem to be only two levels they can fly in. They cannot really fly over each other. Yes, this means that in a space game, you're restricted to x-y movement. No z-axis movement. It is odd to see that cruiser class ships are able to turn around on a dime in a short span of time... then not be able to move becuase of his two wingmen. Then all three of them try to figure out how to move for the next 30 seconds straight. 

Ship models are basically bricks with different lengths and very low detail. From what I've seen so far, most ships do not even have more than one weapon system (ie all the firepower from a destroyer comes from a SINGLE cannon).

Everything in the game screams overly simplistic. From the combat mechanics to the resource mechanics, to the user interface and the graphics (I'm usually not too concerned about graphics if the game is good, but on max graphics, weapon projectiles are VERY low resolution TEXTURES. COME ON. Homeworld 1 in 1998 had better projectiles with higher resolutions. For the Homeworld fans: One of the projectiles looks exactly like an energy weapon projectile from Homeworld Cataclysm, but lower resolution. This is 2012, not 1998).

As a long time fan of Homeworld, Sins of a Solar Empire and the space RTS genre in general, I cannot really recommend this game unless you enter with rock bottom expectations. Anything higher and you will be dissappointed. I didn't even have any expectations and then it disappointed me.

Risk it only if its on sale. Thats luckily how I got it, so it wasn't too much of a waste.

Die Story ist kaum der Rede wert und irgendwie hat man alles, was das Spiel bietet, schon sehr viel besser gesehen.
Scharmützel machen Spaß - Ein oder zwei Mal, dann hat man alles gesehen, alles gemacht. Wenn man den Bogen einmal raus hat, sind die Partien recht kurz. 
Der Forschungsbaum ist kaum als solcher zu bezeichnen. Es gibt nur ein paar Verbesserungen und immer größere Schiffklassen. Man forscht sich also zum Super-Schlachtschiff und zwingt den Gegner mit einer Armada dieser Großkampf-Pötte in die Knie. Allerdings sogen bugs dafür, dass ein einziges gegnerisches Jägergeschwader ausreicht, um unsere komplette Flotte aus Großkampfschiffen in Weltraumschrott zu verwandeln. Wer also keine eigenen Jäger hat und sich auf die FlaK der Kampfschiffe verlässt, wird sich wundern, wie schnell die von ein paar kaum sichtbaren Jägern zerschreddert werden. 
Sichtbarkeit ist ein gutes Stichwort. 90% der Zeit sieht man die taktische Karte, auf der die Flotten als kleine Symbole dargestellt werden. Da die Kämpfe allerdings höchst unspektakulär in Szene gesetzt sind, lohnt sich selbst kein zoom in die Schlacht. Große Finesse erfordern die Raumkämpfe nicht. Masse statt Klasse reicht völlig und dann kann kan die Flotte auch sich selbst überlassen, einen Kaffee in der Küche holen gehen und zum Sieg wieder zurück sein.
Theoretisch kann man einzelne Systeme der Schiffe gezielt angreifen und Gegner kampfunfähig schießen, um ihn dann per Angrifftrupp zu übernehmen aber das klappt in der Praxis dann nur im Handbuch. 
Ein wenig mehr Zeit der Entwickler mit ihrem Spiel hatte aus Gemini Wars sicher noch etwas machen können. So jedoch ist es beim guten Willen geblieben.
Was mir hingegen gut gefällt, ist die Musik während der Kämpfe. 

Fazit:
Für ein schnelles Gefecht zwischendurch sicher geeignet aber die Dinge die Gemini Wars anpreist sind einfach viel zu oberflächlich umgesetzt, um lange fesseln zu können. Dazu gesellen sich störende bugs und schlechte Übersichtlichkeit. 
Der Preis ist, für das was man erhält, völlig überzogen. Wer einen Blick riskieren will, der wartet besser darauf, dass Gemini Wars im Angebot ist und schlägt dann zu.",1410136132,1410136132,False,28,0,0.791545987129211426,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
    Good concept. I enjoy how quickly bases can be built if you have the resources which makes comebacks not entirely out of the picture. Easy to pick up.

Cons:
    Ships will shake violently when trying to move and sometimes won't even move when part of a large selected group. AI is horrible for skirmishes. I played a skirmish where the AI player sent its starting construction ship to where I was building my fleet about 5 minutes into the game and it was destroyed easily ending the game.
    Gameplay mostly involves waiting around for resources and ships to build up while the AI does nothing to stop you and then easily winning, but if you move into their space too early they send massivly overpowered waves to crush you.
    Full of glitches that simply freeze the game and make you have to re-launch. Research points are hard to come by at first, but then there isn't enough to research and you have an abundance of unuseable points.

Good premise, horrible voice acting, and very buggy gameplay.  Things like orders, shields, and selection boxes often don't work.  Production queues often fail to build in proper order as well as unbalanced missions.  This game had a great idea and epically failed to execute.  I hope this gets patched to hell but for now it's a failed title.
