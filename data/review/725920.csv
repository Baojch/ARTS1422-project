It's the Steam Summer Sale pf 2021 and you come across this little gem. You begin in a little hub surrounded by cascading water. There's a sign that explains the event lasts three minutes, and a light portal to warp inside. Once inside you may do as you please. I was pretty sure I needed a place made out of floral patterns, very spiffy.

So, you can change the lanes and building materials, play with bubbles or hang out with pigeons. The day to night cycle is pretty, and you can warp around the location using the light portals. I liked watching the neon accents come on at night, and the lighting really is pretty.

Then you end the day by watching the stars while fog rolls in. Super nice for free, though I'd love to see free locomotion as an option.",1625427106,1625427106,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,
