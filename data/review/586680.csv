Bugs aside, this has the weakest, most generic story with almost zero ties to the original and the worst, ugliest animation out of the Awakening series' games.

It's a prequel to the series, but doesn't connect with Sophia's story aside from a brief mention in the bonus chapter. I found this a bit disappointing as [i]Awakening: The Redleaf Forest[/i] had a good setup for more sequels at the end.

Speaking of the bonus chapter, as others have said, it is a part of the game that can't be completed. This is due to a progression-stopping bug that prevents picking up a crucial item that's needed to move things forward. This game was released in February, 2017, and more than three years later, the bug is still not patched. It seems to affect only the Steam version, however, as someone in the discussions mentioned they were able to contact customer support for Big Fish Games and were allowed to download the game through their client where the bug didn't exist.

Overall, this is one game in the series I can't recommend, especially due to the progression-stopping bug. Considering it's also a prequel to the series and doesn't really tie into the main story, it's not something that needs to be played to understand the original story.",1607743127,1607743127,False,8,0,0.572498857975006104,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Die Rätsel sind gut, die HOP-Szenen machen Spaß.
