[h1] 游戏的体验 [/h1]
游戏的画面不是很好，看起来有点古老，若你是对画面拥有高要求的玩家，我不是很推荐，然后玩法上还是比较容易上手的，只要是RPG游戏的爱好者，地图的制作还是比较精良的，看起来很规整，观感还是不错，但是还是有一些不是很好的地方，像剧情的对话可能会显得很繁琐与冗长，长时间阅读可能会比较无聊，致使兴趣逐渐下降，然后就是任务系统的问题，记录方面我认为不是很好，战斗方面还是传统的回合制，虽然难度不大，但是这个过程会比较漫长，让体验不是很好。

[h1] 游戏总评 [/h1]
总的来说，这部游戏我觉得体验不佳，希望可以优化以提高游戏体验。

update: i just got to the first battle inside the Forum in town, now there are 3 mobs against two and they are individually stronger than any party member and still get two moves to my 1. so even with the dedicated healer (warriors are wasted as healers) my weakling rogue cannot kill them fast enough. the best way to stay alive in this fight is to have both party members heal with items or techs exclusively, but that means the mobs do not die. but if you do not heal then you do not get to hit them more than twice.

final fantasy and other old-school rpgs were hard but beatable. this game gives you lots of practice at loading saves. so save often if you play it. but my recommendation is to not play it.

dev - check your balance, hardcore should still be beatable. you say this game is about strategy and tactics. well there are not lots of tactics or different strategies to employ with two characters with a single heal and a single damage skill between them. after using ""speed up"" the rogue just hits things. the damage spread for mobs is way too large to be reasonable ~15 to ~60 without crits counted. oh and 60 is half the health of the warrior at level 1 so if both mobs attack the same character in a turn there is a good chance that character dies. and the next turn the player gets has to be used to heal the mostly dead character, then the mobs get to go again, and again. ohp dead! and that is with just two mobs. your game needs some serious rebalancing.
if you want to promote strategy give the player some clue as to which enemy is which in the turn-order indicator. have the red skulls there is great but, players need that information to make good choices of who to hit, their life may depend on it.",1469813482,1469815640,False,5,0,0.566579461097717285,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But this game feels extremely rushed and unpolished. I expected more of this game. I'd like to make this review short and to the point so I'll just dive into it. 

STORY
Compared to the first game this game feels more like a spin-off story than a completed sequel. Although  the storytelling and the writing is very good i still feel that alot more story could had been mashed in there. I cleared the final dungeon at around 12 hours at level 19. This was just after picking up my last party member. For obvious reasons this left me with a feeling that the game was not really complete. One bonus is that there is quiet alot of optional content in the game that provides more story. That's all fine and dandy but personaly i would had liked to see the main story expanded instead. Out of the six main characters only two of them have any time at all to see any real king of character development. With that said the characters are still very well written and atleast a couple of them are genuinly likeable. 

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is solid but nothing out of the ordinary. The battles are hard at times and can be quiet annoying but the game offers loads of different ways to tackle them. You can for example play a battle slowly with one heavy damage character and three Clerics if that floats your boat. The upside to the difficulty is that i found myself satisfied when i defeated certain bosses. Battles aside the puzzles are mostly frustrating and kinda feel placed in the game to expand the playtime. 

GRAPHICS
I like DarkGaias mapping alot. I really feel that he makes the most out of the built in Graphics in every RPG Maker engine. He has a real knack for making all areas feel unique and full of life. 

MUSIC
Some really good choises here. I especially like the fantastic battle music from NemesisTheory. There is not much to say about this really. The soundtrack as a whole does it's job well and provides even more atmosphere to the areas and battles of the game. 

MINOR POINTS
There are some bugs in the game. It's one of the things that makes the game feel rushed. Overall it's nothing game breaking though and it does not really lower the overall experience that much. 

OVERALL
The game is still worth the price in my opinion. You get 10-15 hours of really solid old-school gameplay out of it. But you better be sure that you enjoy the SNES era of JRPGs because this game is not for everyone.

Neutral, I guess? I don't really know whether to recommend or not recommend, honestly. I guess based upon the fact that I've played for 10+ hours and haven't thrown in the towel would count as a recommend. This game has a lot of flaws, so play at your own discretion.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

[list]
[*]A class and sub class option. Nice. I've never seen this. This essentially gives you the power to have a character major in one class and minor in another one. Good when you can make all of your characters clerics if you want. Makes me feel like I can play God a little bit.

[*]Encounter rate is decent. It's high.. but not insanely high. Which is good, because you do battle a lot and it can be tiresome if you're actually trying to make some decent progress. Or, if you're in trouble and you're trying to escape.

[*]Dungeons are all a respectable and comfortable length. Not too long.. not too short. This makes it easier to retreat to town if you need healing or items. You can go back in and retrace your steps pretty quickly and make progress at a good pace.

[*]You can save any where and at any time. Phew. This is a real life saver. They didn't take a page from the ol' ""save point"" book. 

[*]Most tihngs are inexpensive. Reviving your character from the dead is costly, but it's relatively easy to avoid this when you can buy large quanities of items for cheap to help you restore your mp/hp. Inns are also cheap. With all the enemy encounters, you'll also have a hefty amount of cash to buy new equipment in each new area. You have a lot of opportunities to heal/improve yourself BEFORE you die, saving you a headache while also saving you some cash.  

[*]The music is pretty solid. 
[/list]
[h1]Cons[/h1]

[list]

[*]Your party's hit rate is atrocious. This is a real problem. Seriously. Even my incredibly speedy Rogue character misses every other turn.. and that's with no added debuffs or status effect. This is frustrating and makes battles more drawn out than they need to be. It doesn't seem to matter your stats, what class you are playing, what equipment you have.. it's just a whole lot of missing for no goddamn reason.

[*]Little to no warning when you're about to run into a boss. This can be remedied by saving frequently.. but come on.

[*]No quest log. Another serious problem. This makes it really difficult to track quests. There's not even any point in doing them because it's so easy to forget. A real shame.. I feel like side questing should play a big part in RPGs. 

[*]Takes forever to level up. This seems to be a weird scaling issue they didn't fix.. because you fight a RIDICULOUS amount in this game. 

[*]There is no ""warp"" option (so far) to leave an area quickly. This makes traveling/exploring really quite painful. I mentioned above that dungeons aren't terribly long, but it is still a pain in the ass regardless when you have to drag yourself out of the dungeon instead of using a simple spell, item or ability to get yourself out quickly. 

[*]There are a lot of unique sprites, which is nice to see... but what's lacking is portraits next to dialogue boxes when sub or side characters are speaking. This bothers me. All the main characters have portraits next to their dialogue (as they should), but not a single other character has one. Ever. Would it have been so hard to add in? It really puts a hamper on the story telling aspect when they make every other character seem not at all important.

[*]Unpredictable character pathing. When you're in towns, for example, NPCs can box you in and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Sometimes they don't even move, or don't move in a direction that gives you room to get out.

[*]No voice overs at all. You have to read all of the clunky and extremely drawn out dialogue. Most of which, over time, you could care less about. I understand this game was most likely a low budget RPG maker type of game to come from an independant/small developer.. but having it read aloud would really make the experience a bit better. 

[/list]

Now, unfortunately my computer's hard drive died and I lost my save data.. so I never got to finish this game 100%. It wasnt worth restarting just to finish and see the ending in my opinion, nor is it something I'd seriously recommend to a friend. However, I've seen some pretty terrible RPG maker games out there, but this one at least tries a lot of unique things and makes an honest effort.

Well, one of several endings.  I have to say that this game is an exceptional turn based RPG.  Here are a few reasons that I personally enjoyed the game:

The class system is way more balanced than Final Fantasy ever achieved.  With the right combination of skills and equipment, you can make every class a useful one.  Every character can be developed however you see fit.  There is a lot of replay value in just trying out differently developed characters.

There are a lot of side quests, but nothing that you have to devote hundreds of hours to complete.  

The story line is fantastic.  It's not over saturated with juvenile snark like most modern games in the genre.  Its a story that grabs you, and compells you to keep playing.  Apparently there are several endings, and decisions you make can affect the endings and storyline.  That also adds to the replay value.

The difficulty is hard, but reasonable.  You have to apply thought and strategy to get through it, which means it doesn't get very repetitive (except for later dungeons, where the switching mechanisms can drive you nuts!)  But not so nuts that you throw the controller and give up.  A lot of people complain about the difficulty, but if any of you remember playing final fantasy 1 and getting off your ship at the wrong port, or playing Dragon Warrior 1 and crossing one too many bridges, the difficulty doesn't even come close to those days.

The soundtrack is really good.  I'm not a musical person, but I appreciated the variety of background music.  It set the mood for the different scenes very well.

I'd give this an 8/10, and I personally can't wait to see another Legionwood game.

But for every enjoyable part, there seemed to be an unequally annoying part that made me forget it shortly after. I often felt that I was playing a contest entry NOT a published product.

Enjoyed: --------------------------------------------------
- The simple, but well thought class/job choices. 
(One of my annoying list was slightly mitigated by the ability to sub-class everyone as a Cleric.)

- The availability of a multitude of items, with actual utility.
(making up for possible bad class choice in battle, and when out of mana.)

- A reasonably believable story line.
(Much less suspension of disbelief is necessary to enjoy it, unlike many JRPG stories.)

- Competent map making.
(A little boxy, but for RPGMakerXVA default tiles, the attention of variety is acceptable.)

- Market pricing.
(It is nice that the price of goods and acquisition of money are relatively painless, but not excessive.)

Annoyed: --------------------------------------------------
- Complete lack of any quest log.
(It's nearly impossible to keep track of side quests without writing them down on paper.)

- Painfully linear game play.

- Long winded and RAMBLING dialogue.
(To each their own, but after the third 500+ word story sequence, with dramatic pauses and area transitions to boot, I had to FORCE MYSELF to push through them without quitting. Your story is NOT bad, a little cliché but not bad. Do yourself a favor and try not to spell out every detail in WORDS. Leave some of it up to the reader to intuit from setting, animation, and music. It reduces the tedium of reading it, and respects their intelligence at the same time.)

- WTF Difficulty curve!?!
(I realize that you added a difficulty slider to the options menu, and it works, but the difficulty goes from laughable on CASUAL, to randomly deadly on NORMAL, to survival? ROFLCOPTER! on PURIST. It seems that you are using a random troop member replacement script for battles, and that results in some battles where you MUST escape, or die. Period. And if you aren't using a random replacement script, you must enjoy pissing off your customers. -- While I can accept this in a scenario where battles are visible, and I have at least a chance to 'chose' them, the default random battle mechanic makes it downright infuriating at times. Ex: The difficulty spike, in NORMAL, inside the second dungeon/cave was enough to finely make me rage quit for the day.)

- What? That was a puzzle?!?
(At least a few times, I was left to assume that I was looking for an item to 'pass' an obstacle. Neither the obstacle itself, nor the item I found that allowed me to do so, had any indication, in its description or dialogue, of its actual purpose. I either randomly returned, or hoped I was right in back tracking, to discover how they related.)",1420191498,1420199570,False,42,1,0.714813053607940674,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The two biggest issues I have with the game are:
- How often you miss or the enemies evade. Might just be me not grinding enough (apparently I was about 6-8 levels below what's ""recommended"" when beating the final boss), but the last couple of bosses were still easier than a few of the normal encounters.

Legionwood 2 is a very difficult game in which requires more planning and quick thinking than traditional RPG games. It offers extensive character customisation, allowing you to choose the class of each character given to you. Legionwood 2 offers non-linear gameplay and gives many optional side quests to explore and conquer as well.

Legionwood 2 has a morality system as well whether you will be hailed as a hero in the end or be dispised by many for your cunning acts. Apart from the morality system, certain actions and decisions and completion of quests would also contribute to the final ending. Simply saying, Legionwood 2 is not a 1 time affair. It has great replay value in that aspect.

It offers around 21+ hours of gameplay if you are to finish the game once through and it is a fully enjoyable 21 hours of gameplay.

But seriously, seriously , really, THIS GAME IS A GEM OF AN RPG. 
If like me you're a nostalgic of old snes jrpg era you'll freaking LOVE IT. The customisation system of characters is good (you can chose their class and sub-class which allows many different strategies), difficulty so far (i'm at 4 hours of play, finished three bosses) is well balanced.

Darunter fand ich auch ""Legionwood 2 - Rise of the Eternal's Realm"" und da ich finde, dass so ziemlich jedes RPG-Maker Spiel aus der Hand eines Laiien rezensiert sowie kritisiert werden soll, habe ich auf dieses Spiel mal einen genaueren Blick drauf geworfen!
Nun, was mich zunächst positiv überrascht hatte (und was auch nur eine Kleinigkeit darstellte, mich aber dennoch irgendwie positiv einstimmte) war die Auswahl, die mir die Wahl gab das Spiel im Vollbild oder im Fenstermodus spielen zu können. Das gibt meiner Meinung nach einfach einen viel komfortableren Einstieg in das Spiel. Im Titelmenue angekommen gibt es weiterhin kleine Einstellung, die das Spielerlebnis verändern lassen. Somit bietet dieses Spiel schonmal mehr Einstellungsmöglichkeiten als so manches bekannte Spiel an (Die aber im Endeffekt nun doch nicht der Rede wert sind...!) Wie schon in so manchen RPG-Maker Spielen wird hier auch wieder ein Intro angepriesen, dass man zur Bequemlichkeit auch wegdrücken kann, um sich somit mit einem eher pessimistisch wirkenden Söldner in einem von Barbaren eingenommene Stadt... - Dorf... halt wo Menschen leben, wiederzufinden. Das Spiel gibt dem Spieler Anfangs die Wahl, ob er das Tutorial sehen möchte, oder ob er mit dem dort benutzen Kampfsystem schon klar kommt.


Kampfsystem
Das Kampfsystem ist meiner Meinung nach nicht der Rede wert: Klassisches rundenbasiertes Auf's-Maul-geb-Konfrontationen, in dem der Spieler meist zusammen mit Gehilfen eine Auswahl aus einem basischen Schlag, einer Fähigkeit dessen Tribut meist eine Handvoll Magiepunkte(oder der hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass dieser Angriff fehlschlägt...) darstellt, oder der Benutzung eines bestimmten Gegenstandes gegenübersteht. Also wie ich fast jedem anderem Action-RPG vom Ursprung RPG-Maker auch. Die einzige Änderung betrifft das optische Design des Kampfes, das von der Seitenperspektive aus gehandhabt wird. Während eure Figürchen originalgetreu auf dem Kampffeld wiedergegeben werden, mutieren die Wiedersacher im Kampf meist zu großen Artworks, die nur darauf warten euch mit Kritschaden oder Debuffs zu überheufen.
Hier stellt sich gleich schon das erste Problem heraus: Das Spiel ist schwer! Zumal der Anfang, der euch nach rund 5 Minuten im Keller eines Gebäudes auf Gegner stoßen lässt, die es mit einer guten Priese Glück in die Flucht zu schlagen gielt. Dieser Gegner stellt sich als zwei Spinnen heraus, die eine Fähigkeit besitzen um euch langsamer angreifen zu lassen. Das Resultat besteht nun daraus, dass diese Gegner in der Runde mehrmals angreifen können und somit zumahl diese Fähigkeit erneut einsetzen können. Einmal kam ich kaum zum Zug, da mich diese Gegner unglücklicherweise in zwei Züge umgebracht hatten. Ich konnte einen Angriff setzen, als diese Gegner drei mal hintereinander angriffen. 
Es ist seltsam, dass diese Angriffe so gut wie immer treffen, da die Spezialschläge meiner Verbündeten sehr oft in die Hose gehen. Vorallem Debuffs, die auf Gegner gecastet werden scheinen irgendwie verflucht zu sein, zumindestens bei mir! Ich bekomme schon am Anfang den Verdacht, dass der Entwickler bei der Stats-Verlegung nicht wirklich wusste, was er da macht. Primal nach Gefühl zu sortieren ist zwar ein Anfang, aber... wurde dieses Spiel nicht getestet?
Natürlich kann man die Kämpfe im Spiel als Art herausforderung sehen, aber ich muss gestehen, dass viele dieser Kämpfe nur auf Glück basieren! Viele Kämpfe entging ich nur knapp und das nur, in dem ich den Protagonisten als Heilerschwein taufen ließ... keine gute Idee, denn neben seinem Heilzauber war er einer der einzigen mit wirklichem Damage! Außerdem möchte ich den Protagonisten nicht wie einen Arzt begutachten, sondern wie einen mutigen Kämpfer etc, aber doch nicht als Dauer-Sanitäter...
Bei den drei Stunden stellte ich mir eine gewisse Frage: Gab es denn keine Betaspieler? Nicht mal irgendwie beim Publisher, der schon so manche RPG-Spieler herausgeben ließ?


Gameplay & Optische Aufmachung
Naja ohne viel von der Story erklären zu wollen: Das Spiel ist in manchen Punkten ziemlich hässlich. Mir persönlich gefallen die Gesichtszüge der CHarakter überhaupt nicht. Sie sind mit dem typischen Facemaker, der beim RPG-Maker dabei liegt, gemacht worden und ich persönlich finde sie einfach überhaupt nicht stimmig. optische Fehler fand ich zumal am Anfang in einem Söldnercamp, in dem schlafende Menschen beim ANsprechen zu mutieren schienen und auch nicht zu selten ihr Geschlecht wechselten (Der Action scheint mir langsam zum Mistery-Thriller umzusteigen.) Die Gegend ist einfach nur leer und so wie ich es sehe, viel zu symetrisch aufgebaut. Da hatte wohl jemand im Entwicklungsteam einen Ordnungsdraang, auf jeden Fall: Sieht nicht atmosphärisch aus, und das ist das schlimmste an der Sache. Ein RPG-Maker Spiel muss mit etwas glänzen können. Eine schöne Story, oder nebenstorys, interesannte Gespräche/Persone, Atmosphäre die mir vermitteln soll, dass ich um jeden Preis in diese Welt hineingelangen möchte... dass ich von der Geschichte erfahren möchte. Aber dem ist leider gar nicht so.


Kurze Übersich Pro & Cons

Pro
+ Die Musikstücke passen zum Geschehen!
+ Eine große Auswahl an Gegenstände
+ Das Inventar wurde hübsch sortiert und bietet Features wie z.B. Informationen zum Charakter
+ Kleine Events, die die Routine im Spiel auflockern (Ein fremder Mann, der von dir gehört hat und dir einfach mal ein Bier spendiert ;) )

Contra
- Facesetting ist wirklich nicht gut gelungen und hat mich persönlich nur abgeschreckt
- Das Kampfsystem frustriert zu stark, als das man für dieses Spiel Ausdauer aufbaut
- Interesannte Charakter? Die habe ich nun wirklich nicht gefunden...
- Kaum interesannte Nebenstorys, die einem näher gebracht werden.
- Menschen sterben, zu denen man einfach nicht die Chance hatte, persönliche Beziehungen zu empfinden von dem her, geht einem der Tod der Nebenchars wirklich am A vorbei ;)


Kurzes Fazit
Im Endeffekt habe ich nun drei Stunden gespielt. Drei Stunden Frust... leider! Ich bin ein großer Fan von RPG-Maker Spielen, die in diese Schiene gehen, aber ein Goblin Endboss besitzt eine Erdbebenattacke, die meinen Leuten 200 Schaden abziehen und sie haben nur ungefähr 300 Leben - Dagegen kann man leider nicht anheilen. 

Spielspaß sieht irgendwie anders aus und dabei habe ich wirklich versucht, dem Spiel eine Chance zu geben. Ein RPG-Maker Spiel braucht unbedingt etwas gewisses, was es auszeichnet, da heutzutage die Ausdauer bei den vielen Indie-Titeln schon om Keller hängt und man in dem Sinne schon zum Spielen gelockt werden MUSS mittels guter Story, echt netter Charaktere (Die aber ohne guter Story wiederum untergehen) oder einfach netten Features!
Ich testete einmal eine wirklich schlechte Demo von einem Spiel, dass sich via Kickstarter in die Marktbranche katapultieren wollte. Das Gameplay war uralt und das Spiel eintönig, aber ich fand zu meinem Glück ein Minispiel, dass mir InGame als ""Arbeit"" beschrieben wurde. In diesem Minispiel musste man Gäste bedienen und ihnen das richtige Getränk geben - das war einfach nur der Hammer und hat irre viel Spaß gemacht. So etwas frischt das Spiel wiederum auf und motiviert mich dazu, dem Spiel eine weitere Chance zu geben, wobei ich von diesem Spiel soetwas nicht gesehen habe. Selbst das Questen war stupide: Die erste Quest war eine ""Töte X und bring mir Y""-Quest... 
Also dann kann ich mir auch frei nehmen und WOrld of Warcraft spielen...!

Ihr könnt es testen, wenn es im Angebot ist, aber... Einsteigerfreundlich oder abwechslungsreich ist leider etwas anderes.",1409529118,1409529118,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Honestly, this was what the designer intended judging by their other posts, and that is fine, some games aren't for everybody, I get that.  The real reason that I am hanging up the playthrough for this is just that it seems to not generate fun for me.  This game really requires the player to focus on turn order, defense strategies, and many other complex things that just don't seem to fit in to my particular playstyle.  Aside from the mechanics, there are some real positive ideas that went into this design, including the ability to change your class whenever you choose without permanent losses, a dual class system to spice things up, and some sort of moral choice system that I cannot attest to because I'm throwing in the towel early.  The nitpick things about this game are fairly comical from what I've see, they include the sprite possibly changing when you talk to an ""idle"" character, which another review indicated was a simple missed checkbox in RPGMaker.  A few typos here and there that give a bit of a guffaw.  The biggest detractor aside from the needlessly difficult fights, however, is that these characters suffer from ""Dragon Age syndrome"" in that they choose to expound the story by murdering your brain with text (says the guy with the long review).

The story and characters are standard RPG fare, with an interesting if somewhat ambiguous class system.  If you play this game and get frustrated I recommend reading some of the class guides and planning ahead.

Pros: Again, has everything an RPG needs to work well enough to be worth the purchase cost if you have the stones to finish it. This game is hard enough to be a challenge to even the most hardcore RPG fan.

Cons: This game is PUNISHING.  Nearly all fights, even the every few second random battles, are quite hard and cannot be plowed through as in most RPG games.  Your characters are extremly weak early in the game, and require some grinding to strengthen yourself each time you progress to new areas/enemies. Most of the random enemies have some combination of brutal evasion rates, damage type immunities, multiple attacks per round, spellcasting, AND status effects linked to those multiple attacks, and in some cases ALL of the above (Im looking at you Dire Wasps!!!)
Honestly most of this wouldnt be all that bad, except that you do not get a truly dedicated healer, and must rely mostly on items and ""guarding"" to regenerate health and mana in combat.  This will FORCE you to spend alot of your time whittling down enemy groups to the last enemy, and then blinding/silencing it so it cannot damage you while you slowly regen your characters up for the next fight.

Tips: Save every 2-3 battles in most areas, as the end can come unexpectedly with one unlucky ambush by multiattack enemies.

Stock up on status effect cure items at all times.  You will be curing 2-3 times a fight or more against some enemies (Curse you Dire wasps!!!)

Do yourself a favor and read some class guides, the tips therein will save you many tears and much hairpulling.

Although I was able to analyse the battle mechanics and world design to quite some depth, I also pointed out weaknesses in the character development, and how information about the world was conveyed to the player. Thankfully, as I played further into the game I found that these problems were addressed, and I felt it would be necessary to re-write my review, and hopefully help the developer in the process. I will avoid all spoilers beyond the first two hours of this game.

If, like me, you have never played a Legionwood game before, you may wish to brace yourself for the first few hours of the game. The player is assaulted with world information and lore over the first few hours, and I found it very difficult to actually understand what was going on. Naturally it was difficult to become invested in the events of the game at that point. The character development showed similar problems - the main party members were able to supply the player with large quantities of information to keep the story moving, but showed little personality (I was convinced that some characters lacked any personality traits whatsoever - Felix frequently made snide comments or light jokes, and Lionel showed some signs of mourning for Clara, but Aelia and later Marcus showed no detectable emotions or character). Thankfully, as the player progresses further into the story, some of these characters have their background explored, and their personality expanded upon. The story itself becomes easier to follow, too, as characters start to respond to recent events instead of bringing up pieces of lore that the player feels little relation to. The player is able to undertake many side-quests as they progress further in the story, which offer opportunites to improve your party, better pace the events of the main quest, and learn more about specific corners of the world. It's a shame that all of this only picks up after a few (5?) hours of gameplay, but what is present is very well-written, and a definite strength of the game.

The meat of the game, the battles, are both challenging and satisfying. It is rare to find an RPG with such enjoyable battles, and I'm not just talking about RPG Maker titles. Bear in mind that they do have a high level of difficulty from the start, so if you have never completed a Final Fantasy game, you may want to steer clear from this one to avoid frustration. Personally, I really appreciated the difficulty, and it forced me to think tactically whenever I encountered a strong opponent. The battles are viewed from a side-on perspective (a big plus for me!) with a conditional turn-based system similar to that of Final Fantasy X. This lends a lot to the strategy, as you must consider not only strength and weakness, but also timing and order of the moves you execute. Characters may be assigned classes (think of the jobs systems of the earlier Final Fantasies) that roughly describes what functions they may serve in battle. And since you are unlikely to win all your battles by just repeatedly attacking, there is real value in choosing classes that inflict status conditions, or reduce enemy statistics, or have a higher critical hit ratio, etc. Although I may be asking a bit much, it could have been fun to see the characters develop within their chosen classes and not just as a whole, but the system is fine as it is and I would not wish it to become unbalanced.

The graphics and sounds are pleasant but not outstanding. The developer has achieved much using the resources supplied with RPG Maker VX, and this is in no way a criticism. The environments are richly detailed - moss growing on cavern walls, tufts of grass amid the odd flower on bright mountain paths, broken furniture and bones littering grey halls in untouched ruins (but who ever heard of doors rotting shut?) The only criticisms I do have are minor, and refer to graphical elements added by the developer: face portraits generally look a little odd, but such should be expected when using the in-built editor, and some components of the user inferface when in a battle are a little difficult to work with (highlights could be a little difficult to see, and icons in the CTB gauge do not specify which enemy they may represent). I find it easy to overlook such niggles, though, as the rest of the game world is presented very well.

I have yet to complete the game, but I have encountered a few bugs or small mistakes as I have played the game - they are almost always benign, thankfully.
* In certain cut-scenes, if Lionel has the wound status when other party members are removed, the game may cut to the Game Over screen and force the player to load their previous save.
* The CTB gauge occasionally gives incorrect information, in one of two ways: a character's turn might not start when it is stated to on the gauge, and enemies might take their turns earlier than suggested. These may be symptoms of the same problem, which I imagine is due to the way the CTB system is implemented.
* This might not be a bug, but upon learning a new spell when already knowing 8, Marcus forgot one of his previous spells. If this is not a bug, it would be nice to be prompted with a choice upon attempting to learn a move that will cause you to forget an existing one.
* Some skill descriptions differ when comparing the item form and the learned skill form (debilitating shot).
* Some of the metal chests appear to be closed after the player has opened them if they leave the screen and re-enter.
* Some of the sleeping characters change sprite when they are interacted with (they might need to have their direction fixed to prevent this?)
* Some speech contains spelling mistakes.
* Upon meeting one of the kings, he describes the Queen to be on his right. She is actually on his left. (I found it quite amusing to imagine him, with his eyes closed, gesturing to empty space while introducing her, and everyone in the room being too afraid to correct him!)
I stress that these bugs do not irritate me when playing the game - most are harmless, and I list them in the hope that they might aid the developer in identifying and fixing them in future updates.

In summary, I would recommend this game to anyone who has previously completed a Final Fantasy title and is prepared to play through the first few hours before they are able to connect with the world and its characters. Combat is very much enjoyable preciely because it presents a challenge and is well-balanced (when did you last play an RPG where you felt you had to stock up on potions when you left a village?), and there is a large amount of content available between crossing the land as part of the main quest and completing many side-quests along the way, with the occasional well-written cut-scene to break up the action. While I am not humming the tunes outside of the game they are certainly not boring to listen to and overall the world is well-presented. Previously I had criticised the game quite heavily for having so many good features that were not tied together well due to poor character and story development; now I find I am eating my words as I play further into the game.

1. The dialogue has clearly never been read out loud before. It's awkward, long-winded and bad.
2. The battles at the beginning are infuriatingly long. Not so much difficult, but long. Also, dear god but the main character misses a lot.
3. The art for the first boss is out of place, blurry, covered in artifacts, and just plain awful. This game would have been better served by a stock RPGMaker enemy that at least fit the look of the rest of the game.
4.  When you talk to the sleeping soldiers from different sides, they take on different sprites - an old man, a young girl. This is because the sprite sheet for ""fallen"" characters have sprites for every character, rather than different directions, because corpses don't turn to look at you. Preventing the fallen sprite from changing when you talk to it is as simple as checking the ""Direction Fix"" box in the event menu.

However, that being said, to enjoy this game, one would not have to play through the First Legionwood.
I really do think it would enhance your experience though!  There are some changes to how you develop your characters this time around, but the overall feeling is still there I think with the new class system.  It's a blast.  The battles are fast & fierce!  Everything is so much smoother!  I grew up playing RPGs and the Final Fantasy games as they were released in the US, and old school RPGs are what I crave these days.  The story is great, and there are many nods to the events in the original.  I find myself never bored at all, and quite honestly, I thought it would be hard to top the first game. But I feel as if Dark Gaia has achieved it! The script is phenomenal, the dialog is fresh, very well written, and the soundtrack for this game is breathtaking.  Now over 13 hours in I can say this game is a masterpiece.  This is such a unique way to continue the story from Legionwood: Tale of the Two Swords, I found myself in awe.  The characters in this game have real personalities, and characterization is a key for good storytelling.  This game has it all.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.

If this game was released during the 16 bit generation it would of been held up as one of the great classics of that generation. If you like turn based RPG's, then this is a game for you.

[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]
The gameplay is classic turn-based battles and over world exploration. Basically everything you would expect from an RPG from the 16 bit generation. The game can be difficult at times and require some grinding, I personally had to do very little. The game allows you to change your job/classes to better suit a situation, a lot of times reclasses will be far more effective than grinding. 

[u][b]Music and sound[/b][/u]
I found the music and sound effects to fit the theme of the game nicely. I am no music aficionado but I can say this, both the music and sound effects kept me immersed in the game world. 

[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u]
The graphics in this game look similar to the RTP, but they are modified in various ways. I enjoy this better than most of the original graphics styles that popular RPG Maker games try to put out. The RTP graphics are done in the style of classic RPG's and so our these, which is just perfect. The mapping in this game is spot on just like in the first Legionwood. Everything feels natural like it should, trees look like they are growing where trees would naturally grow. No odd ball out of place map items that I can find. 

[u][b]Story[/b][/u]
The story in Legionwood 2 is its strong suit. Dark Gaia is writer first and a game developer second, and it shows. The story is the focus throughout the game and its enjoyable all the way through. They're are lots of surprises and unexpected events that occur. I don't want to spoil anything, but it doesn't dissapoint. The characters are all unique and you form story opinions about them. Personally Felix is my favorite one, he will come of a little douchy at first but that is what makes him so great. If you like characters that redeem them selves, you will also love Felix. The others are also fantastic in their own right. Lionel is more of your traditional RPG character, but he quickly breaks out of that mold with all the interactions he has with the other characters. 


Legionwood 2 is glitch free from what I can tell, the game runs very smoothly for me. Don't let my play time fool you, I have played this game via direct download before it was available on Steam. I plan to play this game in its entirety again, thats how good it is. If you are sick of overly hard or overly artsy RPG Maker games give this one a shot.

Unlike in Skyborn you can't see the monsters - battles occur at random moment and unlike in Deadly Sin 2, you aren't able to 'turn off' monsters respawns, so any kind of walking and/or exploration is tedious as it is continously interrupted by fights. Combat isn't balanced well, at least not in starting areas (first farmland quest), where some of the enemies seem to have much higher abilities than you are. 

Unlike in Skyborn or Deadly Sins 2, fight difficulty isn't adjustable at all, which, considering how unfair fights feel, is a big letdown. I don't care about 'old-school nostalgic hard difficulty', I want to be able to play a game as _I_ want it, so having an option of easy difficulty on fights would be much more fun to me. Alas, it is absent. 

As debuffs are expiring so slowly out of combat and as I'm not sure if characters have any sort of health and SP regeneration over time, most of the times I was fighting well under full power and losing over and over again, which was just frustrating. With all battles occuring at random, it is just too much frustration in general with exploration and walking around. 

And 300+ of money just to resurrect the character after yet another death, _in the city I've saved_, _on a quest_ on behalf of town? Just ridiculous, like those people don't have any sense of gratitude. And as I didn't notice any items that can help with resurrestion while in travels, every time the character is killed it is a track all way back to church - through random, out of blue battles - and all way back into dungeon.  And there is no visible threat management, so monsters seem to attack party members in random.

The only interesting mechanic thing is a subclass system but it is such a minor detail in a big picture of frustration that I didn't feel it worth my time to shamble through bad unfair-looking combat. 

I do appreciate the ability to skip intro, although vanity label with the name of the studio in the beginning of the game can also use some screentime trimming. Also, I don't know if it is a glitch of a feature, but sometimes when you 'talk' to sleeping characters their sprites flip to some other sprites, which would be fun if flipped sprites remained the same - sort of you like peek into their dreams; I found it very amusing. I also liked Aelia portrait (others are ok) but won't it kill developers to maybe make several different emoting portraits so characters won't have same stuck expression all the time? 

As it is at first hour of the game, the writing seems to be uninspired at best (why Clara run to The Hero just to die at his arms when _he knows First Aid spell_ by default)? Although I like that barbarians were given some slight depth in Boudica, instead of 'just evil people out to kill us' label.

It makes you consider your resources carefully.

Engaging in a battle, and just attacking while paying the minimum amount of attention will likely get you killed more often then not. It takes a little planning and some real thought on how to approach the groups of monsters. More then once have I delved into a cave full of monsters, earned a substantial amount of money, just to lose it all on resurrection costs and inn stays. Think about the fight and utilize your characters' abilities. For a while I was using Lionel primarily to First Aid allies that were getting crushed in battle. After a few levels, they easily best groups of enemies.

A lot of reviews make this game out to be bad and hard, and I just didn't think it was fair. By today's standards, yes it could be considered quite brutal at times, but that doesn't make it bad.

[b]Combat & grinding[/b]

Most of the fights in the introductory sequence were routine (and boring!). The exception was a set of spiders which seemed entirely luck-based. My chances of hitting them were low, while they could deal either half my healthbar... or about 10%, depending on mood. They also had an attack which would slow my characters to the point where they had 4 moves to my 1.

I didn't even manage to [i]hit[/i] them until my third reset - that time they just died easily, as I had better luck.

From comments on the forums, this continues, and the only solution is to grind.

[b]Poor programming & resets[/b]

I spent three minutes unable to progress because a guard had (randomly) walked into a 1-square-wide corridor and blocked it. Eventually I had to reset the game.

The story is potentially interesting, but is ruined by bad writing. I've already witnessed the (cliche) opening tragedy, but due to the writing, it had no impact at all.
