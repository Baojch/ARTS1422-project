Vom Kinderbuch-men√º mit Reimen als Tipps, bis zu den niedlichen Sounds wenn die Monster die Spielzeuge fressen - Hier sind sehr viele gute und interessante Ideen, die mehr oder weniger funktionieren. Der Sprintmeter als quasi Treibstoff, der f√ºr die gesamte Nacht aufgeteilt werden muss und das Spiel bei zu ofter Benutzung VIEL gef√§hrlicher macht, ist prinzipiell eine geniale Idee, aber in der Praxis nur frustrierend... denn wir sind einfach vieeeeel zu langsam ohne. Die Map wird gegen Ende der Woche SEHR gro√ü und ohne freiz√ºgige Nutzung der Sprinttaste kommt man nirgendwo mehr rechtzeitig hin, wodurch schnell eine Frustration entstehen kann. L√§uft es ungl√ºcklich und du musst vom Dachboden zum Keller zur√ºck zum Dachboden, kannst du dich von deiner Ausdauer verabschieden, solange du es √úBERHAUPT rechtzeitig dorthin schaffst. 

2015 war die Map noch etwas simpler, da hat sich das Problem noch nicht so gezeigt, aber dadurch war es auch alles etwas monotoner. 

Das ist auch eins der gr√∂√üen Probleme dieses Subgenres, sie werden einfach sehr schnell langweilig. Viel taktische Tiefe bieten die Games nie, oft ist es einfach eine Checkliste die man ohne Nachzudenken abarbeitet - einmal im Flow k√∂nnen sich die N√§chte ENORM langwierig anf√ºhlen.. bis man kurz vorm Ende stirbt und nochmal 10 Minuten im Kreis rennt.

Das Spiel versucht hier zumindest mehr als andere Games der Richtung, die Spielzeuge die als Futter dienen sind zuf√§llig auf der Karte verteilt und k√∂nnen als Vorbereitung in der Umgebung platziert werden - ist aber effektiv fast nutzlos, au√üer es spawnen alle auf der gleichen Seite der Karte.. hier h√§tte es helfen k√∂nnen wenn sp√§tere N√§chte zus√§tzliche Betten freigeschaltet h√§tte und nicht nur ""Klick hier drauf um nicht zu sterben"" Mechaniken.

2015 definitiv eher ein st√§rkeres Game der Richtung, mittlerweile eher eine okaye 6/10 mit viel Downtime und langweiligen Momenten. Die Sympathie und das liebevolle Design lassen es aber trotzdem nett genug wirken um zumindest einmal bis Donnerstag oder Freitag zu spielen - F√ºr Horrorfans gibt es wie gesagt einige nette Ideen √ºber die man sich interessante Gedanken machen kann.

the more nights you win, the more house to traverse.

With every new night comes a brand new mechanic
to further increase the challenge and panic.

The challenge is balanced and never too easy;
through trial and error you'll gain victory.

Should you make a mistake that leads to your doom,
you'll learn what went wrong and save you from gloom.

Many rare chances and events exist,
to add mystery and fear in the midst.

It's easy to learn, not easy to master;
you must succeed to prevent disaster.

Jobs in the game involve keeping wardrobes and the refrigerator closed, and doing some limited platform jumping to find and drag toys around to feed Night Blights hiding under the beds.   If you don't keep up with the various jobs you have, then the monsters eat you, your family, and give you jump scares.

After having beat the game twice, and getting through post-game (minus the survival mode that is currently unplayable, so if you care about your achievement ratio, then don't buy), I'm happy to say this is one of my favorite games on Steam. It's a very skillfully made horror game with a unique concept. This is achieved through combining familiar mechanics from other games. These include: increasing the number of things you have to manage throughout the night as levels go on (FNAF) a faster kind of movement that decreases the more you use it (Slender) and, most importantly (in my opinion) jumpscares that still scare you even though you 100% know they're coming (most of the time). This is also present in Outlast. Of course with any horror game said scares will become dull once you go for beating and completing the game, but they are pretty good initially.",1523839201,1603657648,True,3,0,0.521887600421905518,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It pulls off being simultaneously cute and stress-inducing so well, as the things you must manage drastically increase with each night. If you like jumpscare-based games, this one might be for you.

You play as a child who must defend yourself and your family from the gremlin-like Night Blights prowling around your home. You do this by closing doors, pressing various switches, and many other things each night. The game relies heavily on audio and sound cues, so playing with headphones is very much recommended. 

No matter how much I've played that Survival Mode to get that top score, the game still manages to make me paranoid when I do play it. My favorite part of the game is the amount of random little things there are to troll you; random things may open or appear to freak you out, or to open areas that you might not get a chance at on a different attempt. There's also many, many Easter eggs to other horror games and movies as well. The dev did a wonderful job on this cute little game, and while it may get a bit frustrating at times, it's overall quite silly and fun; I think it deserves a bit more attention than it gets here on Steam.",1480563563,1480563563,True,9,0,0.600840985774993896,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not only has the game somehow disabled itself?!- it says that a newer game version is available and my copy has been disabled- the email I sent to Night Blights support has been bounced back. The email account simply doesn't seem to exist. It won't update, I've spent about 4 hours verifying and making sure it wasn't an error on the account of my computer. I deleted and redownloaded the game files, restarted my system, cleared out some uneccesary data. 

Then I changed the update for Night Blights to high priority, but it won't work and what I wanted to be fun has become severely frustrating. Until this issue is fixed, I feel obligated to warn people away from downloading the game. Stick to the demo version over on GameJolt for the time being until this gets fixed.

UPDATE:

The problem is now fixed. Kudos to the developers for responding so quickly to the problem, although, seeing how their update system penalizes people possesing older copies of the game, it does detract from my overall enjoyment. Regardless, I think it's time I talk about what I love about Night Blights. 

Although one could draw comparisons between this game and Five Nights at Freddies, it's clearly paved it's own path from it's horror-genre cousin. Playing this game always keeps you on your toes, as you listen to audio cues signaling which location you'll need to quickly visit. Constantly bombarded by creatures called Night Blights, keeping you or your family safe is no easy feet.

In this game, you control and direct the movement of a child. Level game play is also directed by a mysterious book detailing your gruesome encounters in common storybook fashion. Our poor protaginist seems to never be able to catch a break, since staying awake all night to fend of murderous and mischivious creatures must be quite taxing.

All around, it features a unique style of game play, with penalizing consequences for ignoring gameplay ques. Although lacking player custimization, it does boast an immersive environment with hidden suprises to continue its underlying sense of dread. Overall, I would recommend to a friend. In this game, it helps to be strategical, and keep the fire lit.",1466297430,1466405189,True,1,0,0.483137190341949463,1,True,False,False,False,,,

You take the roll of a child at night, trying to protect your family from the Night Blights. To do this, you need to keep wardrobes closed and the blights fed using your toys. As you progress through the night, this is going to become more and more difficult with more mechanics being added. To add to that, the more you run..the more tired you get. If you let yourself get too tired, you will fall asleep. Ending the game and everyone dies.

With that said, I can recommend this game in good conscience because I think it's genuinely fun, challenging and well-designed. It has a lot more content than many of its survive-the-night peers like Wick, Emily Wants To Play and Sophie's Curse, to boot.)

""Night Blights"" is a survive-the-night game that combines Five Nights at Freddy's time management with 3D exploration. You play as a child, seeking to protect their family from home invasion by pesky, hungry Blight monsters who would love to eat your family but will settle for eating toys instead - provided you feed them in time. The game features seven levels in the core campaign, plus a survival mode and unlockable extras via a star rating system for each level.

I've played a lot of games in this style, some of which I mentioned in the disclaimer. Night Blights is, by far, the most content-rich of all of them. Each level brings new threats to the fold - on the first night, you'll have just a couple things to keep track of. By the second, you'll have a couple more. By the third, a couple more. 

The objectives stack as new areas of the house are unlocked, and it provides a decent challenge curve without growing repetitive. With each new challenge comes a wrench to your previous strategy, and winning subsequent nights requires adjustment. 

Like any game, Night Blights is not flawless. The platforming (Yes, there is platforming - one of the many ways this game stands out from its peers) is a little rough, and grabbing objects like toys or stools can feel too slippery. Minor complaints and personal frustrations aside, the game controls magnificently overall for a two-dev game that tries to do as much as Night Blights does.

Couple things before closing out: 1) This is not supposed to be a super-serious horror game. The main attraction for the game is gameplay and fun. 2) If you played the free GameJolt version of this game released last summer - Yes, the Steam version is MUCH different and is definitely worth $5.

Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who like this style of gameplay. Come one, come all, disenfranchised FNAF fans! In all seriousness, ""Night Blights"" is much more than its time-management mechanics. At its core, it is a fun, light-hearted B-movie homage that was treated with plenty of care and attention to detail, and features more than enough content to warrant the price tag.",1460878244,1460878244,True,167,6,0.820767045021057129,2,False,False,False,False,,,

I like it.  It's honestly not quite as ""scary"" as I'd hope for, but its pretty fun trying to survive the nights and protect your little baby bother.  Each night of the week gets progressively harder with more things to watch for being added each night such as shutting the toilet if a blight tries to come up through the toilet, and bellowing the fire to keep them from coming down the chimney.  Gotta stay alive each night from 11pm to 7am, and it keeps you busy!  ..No just standing there waiting like in the first FNAF.  It's fun!

Also the book that you read is awesome and fun to read as it talks about the new threats each night in a cool poetic fashion.

This game has a good and in depth story line in which you have to defend your home and family against the dreaded Night Blights until the morning. But be carefull! They will try and get in from every window and escape from the cupboards and under your bed to eat your family.

The art work in this game is awesome, their are a lot of Easter Eggs for you to find but the theme is deffinatley scary and it does make you look behind you a few times. I have had some scary moments playing this game as well as great fun. I dont want to give away a lot of details.

I've originally played this game when it was released on Gamejolt, and it was a really great experience. The Steam version is a lot more polished, has more features, and is in general a lot better, that's why I recommend buying it.

Now, the ""horror"" here isn't supposed to be taken COMPLETELY seriously. The game can be scary, however it focuses more on gameplay mechanics, that being scary. So if you're looking for the same horror experience  like in Amnesia or SOMA, you're out of luck.

Now, each night of the game, it becomes harder, and more ways for the Blights to enter your house are added. You will have to take strategies to where organize the toys, which path should you take first if a Blight is about to enter from 2 different entrances, and such. The fact that you have to constantly do things, or you will die, is giving a lot of tension to the game, making it more exciting, and adds to the scary factor. This game, I can guarantee, is not a jumpscare fest. 
During the nights, various things can happen, such as a painting falling, or a Blight just staring at you from the top of a staircase. These little things add a lot to games like this, and make it a lot better.
There's also a Survival mode and Free Roam mode here, which gives the game more replayability, so you can come back to it just to play for fun and try to survive the longest.

In other words, Night Blights is a Horror game which focuses more on the gameplay factor than the horror, and in result provides great gameplay, with simple, yet good mechanics.

So if you like the FNaF Games, or just want a small bit of scares, I recommend this game greatly. I only have less than a hour on Steam as of right now, but I spent a lot of time on the Gamejolt version, and I definitely say its worth it.",1460755733,1461596330,True,45,2,0.76561349630355835,0,True,False,False,False,,,
