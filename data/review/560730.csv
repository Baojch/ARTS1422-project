played it with my nephew and we had a blast. 

for some reason the voice acting stops halfway through, like they run out of money to pay the actors.
so i had to read it for him, don t know if it s a bug. very strange 

story is reeeeally rushed after the first act, but the kid did not mind. 
he got the closure he needed, just wanted to see more of the underworld. 

nice artwork
relatively fun easy puzzles
ok voice work, for as much as we had it present
run of the mill hidden objects gameplay

Hidden object adventure from 2014.

In Esoterica: Inside the Earth, the legendary land of Agartha awaits your discovery. Join young Stephanie in her search for clues and help her activate one of her grandfather's machines that digs a tunnel to the underground land of Agartha. (Developer)

Ahead of you is a small, good adventure with an interesting story. The implementation was very successful to my taste. There are hidden object pictures that are not that difficult with a tap function. There are various mini-games and they are actually much better than the usual standard games like this. You can skip them. It will be a celebration for lovers, but really difficult for everyone else.
Finding the route is challenging and without tips you have to search a lot, but there are tips, so it's all good.
In my opinion a good old school search game.

[h1] The Esoterica: Hollow Earth [/h1]
Hidden object Abenteuer von 2014.

In Esoterica: Im Inneren der Erde wartet das legend√§re Land Agartha darauf, von dir entdeckt zu werden. Begleite die junge Stephanie bei ihrer Suche nach Hinweisen und hilf ihr, eine Maschine ihres Gro√üvaters zu aktivieren, die einen Tunnel zum unterirdischen Land Agartha gr√§bt.   (Entwickler)

Vor dir liegt ein kleines, gutes Abenteuer mit einer Geschichte die Interessant ist. Die Umsetzung ist sehr gelungen nach meinem Geschmack. Es gibt Wimmelbilder die nicht so schwer sind mit Tippfunktion. Es gibt diverse Minispiele und diese sind echt mal deutlich besser als der sonstige Standard bei solchen Spielen. Du kannst sie √úberspringen. F√ºr Liebhaber wird das ein Fest, f√ºr jeden anderen schon echt schwer.
Die Wegsuche gestaltet sich als anspruchsvoll und ohne Tipps musst du viel Suchen, aber es gibt ja Tipps, also alles gut.   
Meiner Ansicht nach ein gutes Suchspiel der alten Schule.

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen eine junge Frau namens ""Stephanie"" und wollen unsere Gro√üvater retten. Dieser wurde von einem verr√ºckten Grafen entf√ºhrt um ein Portal zum Land Agartha zu √∂ffnen

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es ist ein klassisches Wimmelbild Adventure. Wir l√∂sen die √ºblichen Wimmelbilder & R√§tsel/Minispiele. Dabei m√ºssen wir so gut wie jedes der Wimmelbildszenen jeweils 2 mal machen. Beim ersten mal das klassische suchen von Begriffen und beim zweiten mal sehen wir die Silhouetten der jeweilig zu findenden Gegenst√§nde. Die R√§tsel haben Spa√ü gemacht und einige waren auch recht originell, die man nicht so oft in diesem Genre findet. Allerdings hat das Spiel einige Technische Schwierigkeiten. 1 mal hatte ich einen CTD und mehrere male hat sowohl das Voice Acting in den Cutscenes als auch die Musik ausgesetzt. Zudem habe ich die Story kaum verstanden weil die Texte sehr schnell ausgeblendet wurde ab der Mitte des Spiels, so konnte ich nichts mehr lesen. Musik hingegen war ordentlich

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 8 Erfolge. Hierf√ºr muss man das Spiel beenden ohne einen Tipp zu verwenden (auch keine Tipps au√üerhalb von Wimmelbildszenen & R√§tseln), ein Minispiel/R√§tsel unter 1 Minute schaffen, alle Wimmelbilder ohne Tipps l√∂sen, alle R√§tsel l√∂sen ohne eines zu √ºberspringen, alle Cutscenes anschauen und durchgehend 1 Stunde spielen

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Musik ist ordentlich
+ Nette R√§tsel/Minispiele
+ Nette Wimmelbildszenen
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten

- Einige Technische Probleme (CTD, Musik & Voice Acting aussetzter)
- Story fand ich pers√∂nlich etwas langweilig (zudem verschwanden gegen Ende die Texte in den Cutscenes super schnell, so das man nichts mehr lesen konnte)

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein eher Mittelm√§√üiges Hidden Object Adventure mit Mittelm√§√üiger Story und einigen technischen Schwierigkeiten. Die Minispiele/R√§tsel & Wimmelbildszenen hingegen waren v√∂llig in Ordnung. Deshalb gebe ich dem Spiel gerade noch so einen Daumen nach oben. ich kann es nur wirklichen Hardcore Fans des Genres Empfehlen

[b]Cons[/b]
+Game breaking bug
+‚ÄùFilm critic‚Äù achievement is tricky. Includes intro video.
+Rushed ending
+Bad voice acting
+All voice acting stopped halfway through the game
+Some extra backtracking

Hmm, a tough game to recommend. I‚Äôve been going back and forth but ended up with a thumbs down. I didn‚Äôt mind the game too much, but losing all voice acting halfway through the game, a game breaking bug and a ridiculous rushed ending put me over the edge.

The game is what you‚Äôd expect from a HOG. The puzzles are ok, some are tedious. ESPECIALLY the helicopter blueprint one. The HO scenes are all easy. The game will have you re-visit some of them but on the second time you‚Äôll be given a silhouette of the object to find rather than the name. 

The visuals and art design are great! One of the best parts is the changing environment. The music is also above average. However, the voice acting is super cheesy.

The journal you have has a surprising amount of content that it gets filled with. Same with the gold card collectibles. There‚Äôs no achievement for collecting them all (why not?) but they do give you lots of information, well worth finding them. 

Let‚Äôs talk achievements. There‚Äôs one ‚ÄúFilm critic‚Äù that requires you to watch every video without skipping. I figured ok easy enough, but after completing the game it didn‚Äôt show. Turns out it INCLUDES THE INTRO VIDEO. This is played every time you launch the game. Why the devs thought this should be included in the movie achievement is beyond me. I played through the game another time on easy in one sitting and it showed up at the end. 

Ran into a game breaking bug where I couldn‚Äôt collect a bottle in a HO scene. Had to restart the game. I‚Äôm not the only one, other people in the discussions had the same issue.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Fans of the genre that tame their expectations will be fine with this game. For the average person, no. If it‚Äôs on a cheap sale, grab it but otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

While the Hidden Object puzzles are as fun as in almost any other game of the type, the mini-games are what lets the side down here.

Interesting adventure story. Good cutscenes done with comic book style text boxes. Moderately challenging HOGs that you get to play twice (once with words and again with silhouettes). Lots of different puzzle types, some are quite tedious. 
There is no map and a lot of back travel. The voiceovers, which were good, stop at chapter 4. So they only last half the game. There is a lot of extra reading (the journal and gold punch cards) that is optional.
There are some puzzles and HOGs that are quite finicky. They all work, so there is no need to skip. It's just hitting the right spot sometimes (ex: 3 statues, you have to touch the bottom right of the skirts when finished). For the film critic achievement, you can NEVER skip the intro or that ruins it. Even if you have already watched it, it will switch to missed if you skip it at all. 
If that doesn't scare you away then I recommend this game.

Quite a few players have had issues throughout the game but I was lucky and somehow avoided them.  Check out the Steam discussions here:

There are 8 achievements of which I got 7. I missed the film critic achievement which is earned by watching every movie and cutscene. I watched all said movies etc, got all collectables and read them, so am unaware of the issue. One player said he got it on the 3rd time through after making a new profile and doing all the above. I don't think i'll do that but will send my save files to Alawar.
Overall still a good game even with the issues. Shame its a singular game.

Even worse is the fact that there a several HOPs where you have to find an object (e.g. gun, statue) but there are multiple versions of those objects (there were four guns!). And too often it's overly vague what your next move in the game is supposed to be. Normally possible actions would be shown on a map, but this game doesn't have one even though you constantly have to backtrack.

[*]The 1920's art deco concept of the game is very well executed.
[*]The artwork for the locations, hidden object games and mini-games is beautiful.
[*]Some of the mini-games are [i]extremely[/i] tedious.
[*]I found three of the mini-games to be really cool with rotating elements in offset positions that needed to be aligned carefully.
[*]Some of the hidden object games have bad clues - like ""watering can"" when it should be ""funnel"".
[*]One of the hidden object games has a show-stopper issue if you are unlucky enough to get an impossible object - (the bottle in the storage locker).
[*]Some of the hidden object hot spots are very difficult to hit or are in counter-intuitive locations relative to the image on the screen. Alawar should issue a patch to address this issue - hour glass at the escape pod for example
[*]There should be an achievement for finding all of the gold cards but there is not.
[*]The film critic achievement is broken.  If you skip the opening video once, it logs that against your profile.  The only way to get the achievement after that is to start a new profile.   What it should do, is clear the flag for having skipped a video when you start the game again with the same profile.  It also should not count the video in the opening credits towards that achievement- who wants to watch that every time they start the game?  I had a similar issue with [u]The Saint[/u] by the same developers.

To get through this game and get all of the achievements, I had to monitor the saves.xml file and watch whether there was a value of 1 for the clip_skipped variable in the active profile.  I used 7-Zip to archive the saves folder so I could reinstate it from a good location.

I rate [u]Esoterica: Hollow Earth[/u] as 4 out of 10 - I would have given it 7 out of 10 had there been no issues.

Ouais, ouais, encore une fois on a un monde perdu, une substance surpuissante, des gentils, des m√©chants et patati et patata. Oui, mais d'une part j'aime ce genre :) d'autre part c'est plut√¥t bien racont√© et cette pr√©sentation m'a charm√© avec ces cin√©matiques style r√©tro √† mi-chemin entre BD et vieux films qui ont un petit quelque chose de nostalgie d'une autre √©poque et cette chasse au ""lore""  √©parpill√© sur des supports d'information que l'on ramasse au fil de l'aventure qui a un tout petit go√ªt de rpg old-school dont je me suis d√©lect√©.

Je m'√©gare dans des consid√©rations subjectives. Revenons √† du plus concret. The Esoterica Hollow Earth c'est de l'aventure/objet cach√©s. Notre h√©ro√Øne qui s'inqui√®te pour son gentil savant de grand-p√®re, trouve sa maison vide et en vrac et va voler √† son secours. Comme usuellement dans ce type de jeu elle se ballade en suivant des indices √† base d'√©nigmes type point&click, sc√©nes d'objets cach√©s ou mini-jeux. A un moment de l'aventure on va basculer sur un autre point de vue en jouant le grand-p√®re puis revenir √† sa petite-fille.

Avec des SOC que l'on joue avec une premi√®re liste par nom puis une autre par forme un peu plus tard et des mini-jeux tous diff√©rents (assemblage, labyrinthe, coloriage, puzzles...). Globalement c'est vari√© et pas trop difficile. J'ai fait le jeu en un peu plus de 4h effectives en mode normal sur un rythme fluide sans utiliser d'indice, √† mon avis en expert ce ne doit pas √™tre franchement plus difficile. Parce qu'on a que 3 ou 4 lieux et quelques √©nigmes actifs en m√™me temps, je n'ai jamais eu le sentiment de perdre le fil comme √ßa peut arriver dans des jeux  qui nous font parcourir beaucoup de salles en laissant pleins d'√©nigmes interd√©pendantes ouvertes. De plus le journal trace beaucoup d'informations.

Donc si vous cherchez un HOG coriace ce n'est peut-√™tre pas le bon.

Techniquement je n'ai pas rencontr√© de souci majeur, juste quelques rares impr√©cisions au clic. Pour 3 ou 4 objets de SOC il m'a fallu cliquer √† 2 ou 3 endroits dudit objet pour qu'il r√©agisse. 

Le point n√©gatif maintenant. Il est dommage que ce jeu n'ait pas de VF, ce qui l'√©limine de la cat√©gorie produit familial pour nous francophones. Dommage parce que certains jeux, dessins et coloriage, font tr√®s jeune public, √ßa fait un bail que je n'avais pas fait un dessin en reliant des points (en m√™me temps la pr√©cision du clic est discutable sur ce genre de trip, pas si √©vident de comprendre o√π placer le curseur, dans mon cas je devais recouvrir enti√®rement le point avec la pointe du curseur sans le d√©passer). Bon d'un autre c√¥t√© je ne suis pas sur que les tr√®s jeunes s'amusent car d'autres jeux demandent plus d'abstraction dans la r√©flexion mais surtout on est dans un univers qui parle aux gens de ma g√©n√©ration mais peut-√™tre pas √† celle d'aujourd'hui (sans d√©c, des cartes perfor√©es !? C'est quoi p√©p√© ?).",1555305798,1555333630,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was very disappointed not to be able to complete my 100% run through thanks to a couple of slightly buggy and/or oversensitive puzzles.  It's not that I couldn't solve the puzzles - most are honestly too easy - but one puzzle refused to respond to the solution in my first run-through, and when I tried again, that puzzle worked but a different puzzle just would *not* ""finish"" and click into place.
Speaking of the puzzles, I never want to connect the dots for that stupid helicopter blueprint ever again.  Maybe it's straightforward with a different input method, but with a mouse it's tedious beyond words.

Bottom line?  I had fun, and then I got frustrated.  I'm still recommending because there was a lot good about it.
Fun (if campy) story, very nice art, good voices.  It really felt like a period piece - and the movie clips were cute (though triggering the achievement is a problem).
Don't buy it if you are set on your 100% unless you bring some patience - you might get lucky, you might not.
Also, in one of the last HO scenes there is one bad translation and one bad ""hit zone"" for a required object:  the ""watering can"" is actually a funnel; the hourglass CAN be collected, but you'll want to click several times to get it.

I really truly wish the devs would just fix the last couple of things wrong with this game.  Buy on a deep discount and play for the HO scenes and the story/animation.",1554277238,1554277238,True,5,0,0.596763312816619873,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Had the potential to be a great game but a few things screwed it. 
After a while playing the video scenes didnt have a voice anymore atleast we have it written but it felt incomplete. The story started interesting even more after you played as another character and learned even more but it got more and more complicated and boring. A few HO scenes were buggy where I had to clicka few times that it would register but the thing that killed the game for me and stopped me from finishing it was a problem which a few people seem to have.

The ""BOTTLE"" problem. In a HO scence you have to find a bottle which isnt that hard to find but it wont register you clicking it even after reopening the game. I read that it could fix the problem after restarting the game but it is at a part of the game wher you are already far into it (around 2 hours playtime) adn i dont want to start it from all over again.

If you dont have the problem and are an achievment hunter like me and are lucky that you dont have the BOTTLE problem, there is a tricky achievment. One of the achievments is watching all cutscenes but even if you watch all you wont get it if you skipped even once the intro after reopening the game.

The story of the game is quite interesting, i believe its better on that part than most of the other hidden object games. Sadly the last part, ending included, is a bit disappointing.

The game is well drawn, hidden object scenes are ok. The minigames felt sometimes more complicated than in other hidden object games, the paint puzzle is very hard. There are some other issues with some more minigames, which not annoying if you can skip these but if you like to get achievements then you need to keep suffering on it while you sometimes think the minigame is bugged. (hints: quit to menu and click play if the minigame at the guard room looks bugged and at close to the end click the right very bottom part of the statues once you done with setting them to the right position).

Sadly the game dont have a map function, so you cant check in which zone are you eligible for some actions. On other hand the whole story is episodic so you never have more than a few active zones at the same time.

The best part about this game is the collectibles. Its total optional but each of them provide lore about the world, characters and so on. This offers a quite unique atmosphere to this HoG as other games from this category usually not providing such background informations.

Do i recommend this game? The answer is easy, yes (even if few minigames felt very annoying) If you like HoGs then this is a decent and cheap choise. 4-5hours entertainment with the nice extra lore provided by the previously mentioned collectibles is definetly worth the usual 0,99eur/usd sale price or even the full price if you dont want to wait for a sale.

[b]Hey, iam an achievement hunter! [/b]

The completion of the game takes about 4-5hours. You wont find any written guide on the internet just videos and well, you know, thats a waste of time as those are too long. But you dont need any! You just need to complete the game without hints and skipping minigames or video cutscenes and you can do that on any difficulty. Some minigames are challenging tho, especially the painting one. Its not required to collect the collectibles for the achievements.

It looks good, it looks really good, and starts off interesting. I could tell this product was a labor of love by the developers, unfortunately stunted by likely budget cuts hence the hurried conclusion and limited voice acting.

It had the potential to be a longer game, it seemed like it was planned to be a longer game. I greatly appreciated the additional lore via collectibles. The entire visual department of this game was phenomenal; Both HO scenes and puzzles were detailed, blended together satisfyingly. Even the normal backgrounds had so much to take in, it's almost a shame that the last chapter was so crammed, you hardly stayed in each room. Really, it's a pretty game. It can contend to the quality of art in more well-known HOG developers.

Honestly, I didn't mind that the voice acting disappeared because most of them were a little mediocre in my taste. It would have worked better in the game's favor if it had been scrapped altogether. It's fine, really. Had the game got full voice acting, it would only add to the polish the game already had. 

Two negative aspects come to mind with me:
1. Some puzzles descriptions were too vague to fully understand what you need to do.  (There's also an issue of some objects being mislabeled i.e. a milkshake being a cocktail but it was too far and few in between to be a hindrance.)

2. There was a bit of confusion where you had to push buttons/pull levers to see if you were correct in your solution. It turns out I'd already solved it, only that I failed to turn the mechanism on.

There's no map, but the map only really seemed necessary at the last chapter. That was the only one that stung a bit in the backtracking department for me.

Overall, I really liked this game. Yes, the plot is a bit cheesy, and the character archetypes have been done to death but the art direction blew me away, and there were some interesting new puzzles I hadn't come across before (Warning: Some will test your patience). It's mostly wishful thinking, but if they could come back to this (with a better budget) to fully realize the game they had in mind, it would be great.

I liked this game far more than it deserves. The story is fun though predictable as you play as both a professor and his granddaughter. The hidden object scenes are crisp and varied and there are lots of point and click elements and puzzles to be dealt with.

The downsides are some minigame puzzles that are badly explained, badly executed (for example the dot to dot puzzle which should be easy is just painful) and some that are buggy (ring puzzles sometimes not registering their positions etc).

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Expert.

The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.

There is no map available in the game. Plenty of backtracking from location to location.

There is no padlock feature available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary. The inventory panel is stationary.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items and Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction.

The puzzles are fairy easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.

There is a collectible item in the game, Golden Punch Cards, they are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.

There are six different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.

Miscellaneous

There are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1521044804,1600731457,True,2,0,0.523744940757751465,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game has some nice art, good character design, good voice-overs, well made hidden objects scenes which you visit twice, one with a list of the words and the second time they give you silhouettes to spot. (although I had to click twice on some of the objects to get them). 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1327555301

My problem was the story. It was nice in the first part with the main character who had a strange dream about her grandfather then woke up to find out she received a letter from him. When she arrived in his house, she realized that dream was actually a sign of what is going on, and that alone made her set up for an adventure. After she reached her destination the story became so rushed, I couldn't even read most of the sentences in the final cutscene! I didn't understand what happened at all. 

One of the characters suddenly disappeared with no explanation, and the other character who was sent to help didn't actually do anything [spoiler]unless it was the portal he opened to let her escape[/spoiler]  
The story has a good potential, I enjoyed it if I ignore the ending which I had to watch some videos to be able to read it. It would have been easier if the rest of the cutscenes were voiced like the first half of the game.

I've encountered a glitch in one of the puzzles which you had to rotate some emblems, I solved it but the game didn't register the last one. I had to quit the game completely and re-launch it, thankfully it worked since I wanted to get all achievements. There is also another issue with one of the achievements which require you to watch all cutscenes without skipping it, including the intro cutscene which always plays whenever you launch the game. If you are after the achievement don't skip the intro cutscene no matter how many times you've watched it. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1328691766

Music was OK, nothing special but they are not bad. What I didn't like is the lack of map! There is some backtracking, not always though but still, a map would have been a nice addition but on the other note, I liked the journal so much as well as the punch cards which give you extra information about either the area or the characters.

Pros:
+Beautiful artwork.
+Good soundtracks.
+Good voice overs.
+Good journal.
+Well made hidden object scenes.
+Good story with rushed ending (You need to read quickly in the cutscenes, especially the ending)
+Collectibles. 
+Steam achievements. 

Cons:
-No map.
-Rushed ending.

There was one of the mini-games which were really hard and took me a while to finish it! The game is OK overall. If you have it give it a go and play it, if you want to purchase it, I recommend you waiting for a discount or a bundle.

First of all, the game has some great graphics and sceneries themed in the 1930s. For a HOG, the puzzles are also very well done.

However, in the second half of the game it gets somewhat erratic and confusing, and the ending left a feeling that the developers just got bored with this game and cut it short, making the good potential of the story utterly wasted.

I don't understand the bad comments. Besides it's quite cheap so one shouldn't wait for a HOG such as Artifex's games, for instance. 
As far as my playthrough is concerned I did not encounter any bug. I was able to complete the game and get a 100% achievement during a unique playthrough, without using any cheat, any other gamer's saves or any other tricks of the sort. 

The Esoterica: Hollow Earth deserves to be known and played, for it has many positive aspects and some of these are quite rare in the whole game industry.
Above all, the general idea is quite good : storyline and game ambiance are great. They are well rendered by beautiful graphics and nice musics. 
-The story is interesting and very catchy. I don't want to spoil it, I'll only say that it reminds me a bit of Syberia and Sokal's universe, to some extent. Thus it really should please Jules Verne's novels' fans as well. 
-The atmosphere is gigantic from a human point of view. It's somewhere between magical hopes and robotic performances and it's full of mysteries.
The historic period looks like the Belle epoque and the art style of the game really reminded me of the Art Nouveau style. Many background drawings and decorations look like Alfons Muchas' paintings and posters. Architectural shapes are round, using metal and glass such as those during the Industrial Revolution. My guess is that Industrial Revolution, an important chapter in history, is the period that inspired the story. The plot might take place in the period just afterwards. Being a great period for scientific discoveries and creations, in those times when science was trying to meet most human dreams, when crazy and ambitious inventions where trying to reach the infinite human imagination, many things which until then were unconceavable became real and many other things seemed possible,even magic.  One can sense this humankind greatness while playing The Esoterica: Hollow Earth. 
The art style of the game goes along with it, especially the graphics. 
Voice acting is fluctuating. Whereas the feminin main character voice is ok, others, such as NPC's voices, can be rather shoddy. 
Puzzles difficulty is from easy to medium. Some of them might be painstaking or tedious and hence require patience, but they're not hard to beat. 
HOS are beautiful and depict many objects accordingly to the whole art style of the game. I liked them, except for 2 points:
- They are a bit repetitive since many scenes use the same place with only slight modifications. 
- There are several silhouette HOS, which I personnaly don't enjoy. I play HOG mainly to improve my English vocabulary the funny way, since English isn't my native language, so when it comes to finding objects from their silhouette i quickly get bored.  

Sadly the end comes a bit abruptly but I finished the game with a very positive memory for it was an enjoyable and beautiful experience I'm willing to share. 
I wish there were more games with such a great ambiance.",1507891015,1514889292,True,3,0,0.566666662693023682,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Jules Verne meets 1930s pulp adventures in this very short and often tediously slow hidden object game, which takes us on an exciting race to reach a mysterious civilisation living at the center of the earth.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
If you like adventures, then the introduction video of The Esoterica: Hollow Earth will captivate you instantly. It promises an exciting race between our heroine and her grandfather‚Äôs greatest nemesis to reach an ancient underground civilisation; imagine something akin to Verne‚Äôs Journey to the Center of the Earth, if it was adapted to a pulp adventure novel with steampunk elements. The biggest difference is that the story in our case focuses on the preparations, where the promised destination is just the pay-off (and the sequel bait) at the end of the game.

While the writing was good, the gameplay fares a lot worse. Many parts‚Äîincluding the traditional point¬†‚Äòn‚Äô¬†click segments and the conventional puzzles‚Äîare slow, repetitive, and often take forever even when the solutions are obvious. The rest of the game, including the hidden object scenes, fare better, but Esoterica still asks for far more patience from its players than any casual game ever should.",1501831235,1501831235,True,15,0,0.655552506446838379,1,False,False,False,False,,,

To the story: You are the granddaughter of a scientiest, who tries to proof, that a small city in the earth exists. Some people want to reign this city, so they kidnapp him and try to force him to show where the city is. Now you have to be there first and rescue your grandfather.

The video achievement is buggy and everytime you open the game you have to watch fully the introduction video in order to get it. Another major drawback is the repetitive HO scenes, that is you keep viewing the same room three times (!) and you keep revisiting the same locations a lot.

I really do.  The art isn't bad, and the puzzle mini-games feel somewhat original.  The problems are everything else.

Pros:
Somewhat original story
Puzzles that feel fresh for a HOG

Cons:
Voice acting for the 'main' character, ok.
Voice acting for the villains and narrator, terrible.
Voice acting for Professor Stone, sounds like a gameshow host.
HOG objects are not properly mapped, area you can click on for it to register a pickup isn't properly mapped
Multiple minigames fail to register completion on a successful answer (community verified) which can result in needing to replay, or restart if you're a completionist.
Sometimes achievements just won't register (ex, Film Critic is a community noted one).
Short and abrupt ending
No map (maybe I'm just used to Artifex Mundi games)

Considering I got it for about 20 cents in a bundle deal, I'm not complaining about the cost.

The game actually starts off OK, with good graphics, artwork & reasonable story. Then it seems to run away with it's self, loose the plot, and the end is the ultimate anticlimax.

The same with the mini games. They start off OK, nothing challenging, then they to seem to loose the threadof the story.

What finished it for me was the join the dots game. The mechanics of this made it like painting fine art with a 6 inch brush & poster paint.

Ob eine b√∂se Macht/Drache/K√∂nig/Zauberes aufgrund eines Siegels/Rituals/Maske zur Bedrohung wird und von der Heldin mittels einer Maschine/Waffe/Buch/Medaillon besiegt werden kann... iwie klingen die meisten Spiele sehr √§hnlich und es gibt wenige neue Szenarien. 
In The Esoterica: Hollow Earth erinenrt das k√ºnstlerische Setting mittels Art D'Eco an Bioshock bzw. wird eine gewisse ""Atmosph√§re"" geschaffen, welche gut zu der Story ""Reise zum MIttelpunkt der Erde"" passt. Der Rest der Story ist jedoch leider wieder sehr d√ºnn gestrickt...

Die Atmosph√§re wird leider extrem durch die Texte gest√∂rt, welche in den (an sich auch sch√∂nen) Zwischensequenzen mittels Comic-Textfeldern erscheinen... Da w√§ren Schriftrahmen mit passenden Ornamenten deutlich besser gewesen.

Die R√§tsel sind einfach gehalten, besitzen jedoch andere T√ºcken. Anstatt eines sch√∂nen R√§tselbildschirms wird leider stets nur ein kleines Fenster eingeblendet. Topp wenn es darum geht, gezielt Punkte anzuklicken oder Dinge zu verschieben. Des Weiteren sind die Hitboxen der Objekte bei den Wimmelbildern auch recht grenzwertig. Man kann den Gegenstand 100 mal anklicken und erwischt nicht das eine perfekte Pixel. Auch ist das eine Spiel mit der Konstruktionsskizze weder benutzerfreundlich, noch originell. 

Des Weiteren stelle ich die Sinnhaftikeit des Film-Sequenz-√úberspringen-Buttons (Man erinnere sich an den ""Speichern""-Button von Titan Quest oder Quicksave-Buttons in Spielen mit Spawnpunkten...) in Frage, wenn ein normaler Klick in den Bildschirm schon alles beendet. Toll vor allem, wenn man f√ºr das Ansehen aller Filme einen Erfolg bekommt. Ebenfalls ist die Schriftart nicht f√ºr verschiedene Bildformate optimeirt worden, sodass die Texte dadurch teilweise unlesbar werden.

Fazit: Ein Wimmelbildspiel mit interessantem Setting aber groben Technikproblemen. Wer diese alternative Welt mag, dem empfehle ich eher: The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams.

The story seems promising and interesting at first and has a lot of potential. However, the implementation is lacking, feels rushed, a lot of elements have no logical meaning and the overall feeling is that of a brainstorming of ideas that are loosely put together without a definite purpose whatsoever. 
The ending is extremely abrupt and after spending a good amount of time to play the game you end up wondering what the heck was all about. 

The game has a lot of bugs and many times you need to close the game and restart it in order for the puzzles to be able to be solved because the click detection and in general the event detection are quite awful. You might think that it's hard to mess up the controls in a HOG game. Well, they managed to achieve that.
Some of the puzzles even if solved correctly they fail to register until you close and restart the game. The achievements are broken and in order to be able to get all the achievements I had to play the game twice. The ""Film critic"" achievement, that you get for watching every video without skipping any of them, fails to register. I had to create a different profile, restart the game and replay it in its entirety for the achievement to be recognized.

There are many puzzles that are beyond annoying and have no logical reasoning behind them nor any connection to the story and if you aim to get all the achievements you cannot use any hint or skip. And when you finally solve such a puzzle you end up wondering why the heck the puzzle doesn't recognize your solution. Then you realize you must close the game, restart it and apply the same solution for it to be recognized.

All in all, a game is supposed to be enjoyable and this particular game is not. The story is bad, the gameplay is broken, the achievements are partially broken, the controls are very bad and some of the puzzles are annoying at best and that is when they work properly.

That said, there are just too many things wrong with this game to make the pretty art worth it.

Starting with the biggest issues, the game seems to suffer from a lot of bugs: at least one achievement is buggy, halfway through the game the voice acting suddenly stopped during the cutscenes and I have no idea if that was a bug or a ""feature"", many puzzles are quite temperamental (I had to restart my game to get a couple of them to work), and a lot of the time, during HOS you have to click on the correct object repeatedly or on a specific part of it to get it to register.
A lot of the puzzles are also very confusing and their description/info is just not adequate enough to explain how you should solve them (that damn helicopter blueprint puzzle). Also, my pet peeve is when a HOG wants to send me ten areas back to a random room where a HOS has reactivated with absolutely no hint or reason why I should go there (and no map showing active areas). 

As for the story, it starts out interesting with a lot of potential, but it just turns into a mess as you proceed, and it gets so random and nonsensical that it almost feels like a big chunk of the game is missing. Especially the final cutscene, boy was that a cop-out. This, combined with the relatively short gameplay time, the disappearing voice acting, and the declining puzzle quality makes the entire game feel very, very rushed, as if it was abandoned halfway through and the second half was just hastily thrown together.

You do have this one guy who follows you around but basically doesnt really do anything. Not sure why he is needed. Also their is a punch card system that gives you some back story.
