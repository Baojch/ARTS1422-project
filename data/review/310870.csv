This game is not nearly as bad as the 15% rating on Steam implies.  I can name literally dozens of games with 70%+ that are far worse.  Most of the reviews seem to be referencing the original version of the game, which I've never played. The new version has (apparently) been completely remade.

The atmosphere in particular is extremely well done. The sound effects and visual effects could easily be from a triple-A game.

Unfortunately, the game still needs a lot of TLC before I can recommend it:

• The intro video is five minutes long, and unskippable. The game does not save after the intro, meaning if you need to restart for some reason, you need to watch the entire intro again.

• The game suffers from an old Unity bug where if you have a controller plugged in when the game starts, the character looks up and spins in a circle nonstop. The only workaround is to unplug the controller [i]and[/i] restart the game.  Because of this, I had to rewatch the 5-minute intro video :(

• The game frequently wrestles control away from the player to force them to sit and do nothing while the character gives a monologue. This is annoying and unnecessary.

• The game is EXTREMELY dark, to the point that I literally can't see [i]anything[/i] sometimes, even with the brightness brighter than they suggested in the setup.  They need to add more lighting.

• There are a number of invisible walls, which can only be navigated through by crawling. The game gives no indication you need to crawl at these points, or even that a ""crawl"" button exists (it's ""c"").  The ceiling is a normal height so this was completely unexpected.

• The first time I lied down and got to a save point, the game opened the 'save' menu.  Unfortunately they still kept the mouse locked to the center of the screen, making it impossible to actually save.

• Apparently the game expected me to save, because the invisible wall confining me to the first save area never disappeared.  If I tried to save again, the character would lie down, then complain ""I don't need to sleep again"" before standing up, making it impossible for me to save.  Since there was no way I was watching that entire intro video [i]again[/i], I stopped playing here.

Overall, there is a good game hiding in here somewhere, and with a few months of extra work, I would happily recommend this game.  However, as it stands, it's literally unplayable.",1611035718,1611035971,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: This is basically the original thief game, in pitch darkness, without weapons, without the ability to douse or light torches, without the ability to save your game, episodic, with only one episode, and that episode being all bugged to high heavens and amputated of any logical progression. Go play Thief instead

Review: Cutscenes are unskippable. Which is unfortunate as they are drawn out for no reason and very easy to zone out on. This is meant as a realistic historically inspired horror walking simulator set in some kind of historical setting in some tower, I presume the tower of london but I could be wrong. What this means in practice is that every character talks like he is from your nearby community theatre. The plot takes itself very seriously but the rest of the production value is at an odd mismatch with that which creates a very hollow impression. The game is corridor like and narrates the escape of yourself, a convict of some ilk. Progression is very linear, and mostly involves navigating the pitch dark environment, finding the occasional key, or dodging being intercepted by a scripted insta-death event. There are laterns scattered about which open a menu for you to save, but no windows within that menu open up, and the only available button is resume play so that feature is broken. Annoyingly after starting a new game because ""Load Game"" was grayed out it asked me if I wanted to overwrite. Overwrite what if there is nothing. Very frustrating. I had to quit the program altogether and restart it as by then the main menu was too wonked out to even start out a new session. An interesting thing to point out is that the game will show you a brightness scale when launched, asking you to adjust so that you can barely see the image on the left. But there are no sliders or buttons to interact with, pressing anything on the keyboard or mouse will simply screen to the main menu, with your screen being way too dark. I would say this is for the worst, but in the few well lit area you can appreciate just how much filter, and grainyness is applied to this game's textures and perhaps it is better in the dark. Especially since there seems to be rare moments of clear focus, as well as a lot of motion blur which all put together sounds like a sickening experience. There is no real music track to speak of, the voice acting is decent but overplayed. There is a voice coming out of the protagonist which is different from the narrator's voice, yet the narrator talks about what is happening at the first person as if he is accounting for events in his own life which all makes no sense. You go though a corridor when you crouch a lot, a broken save point, an area where you gotta wait for guards to kill each other over a game of cards and then you talk to what I assume is your wife in an another jail cell. But after two words of dialogue, before that character even comes into focus in the camera, the game abruptly shuts down to some kind of landscape, with the sun of a new day at the horizon, and the end credits start rolling out. The tower episode 1. I think this might be a bug but I did not have heart to restart to try test extensively since I had already died to the guards twice by being spotted. All things considered this is a terrible game, even if it was not all broken up and abandonned. But in this current state it should just be pulled from the store.

Anyone thinking to pick up this little gem should pay extra special attention to a line in the description.  “The Tower features an unforgiving and permanent death system.“  That statement is 100% correct!  How does it accomplish this feat?  By having a save system that is utterly broken!  That’s right, you can save your game at a lantern, but any death (and *spoiler alert* a chance at one is approaching seconds later) brings you right back to the title screen… where the load button is greyed out.  Hitting “New Game” will helpfully tell you that it will overwrite your previous save, but it certainly doesn’t seem to understand that one exists to load it.

Other than the broken save function, the rest of the game seemed passable.  Graphically, it looks fine, when you can actually see what’s happening.  Don’t trust the brightness settings as it starts – there are sequences where it is almost too dark to see.  The atmosphere doesn’t really get a chance to get going, due to Elliot spending a large portion of the time speaking.  And as far as the actual gameplay, the early portion is marked with long stretches of non-interactive clips.  And with no indicators as to whether or not something is actively dangerous, prepare to die with seemingly no warning.

I don’t like giving up on a game too quickly, but after dying immediately after the initial save point once, I was a bit frustrated.  Having to replay the entire sequence leading up to it, just to get another attempt to succeed was not fun.  Dying to a different event, just a moment after completing that sequence successfully, has me walking away from The Tower.",1498364360,1498364360,False,4,0,0.534345030784606934,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I thought it was odd they were not going to work on The Tower, but as I found out Polarium was going to be on Xbox live Arcade. I know that sometimes you have to take funding where you can get it. So I thought maybe after they finish Polarium and get more money they would finish The Tower. Well after testing and sending my feedback on Polarium, everything went quite for a while. 

Then out of the blue I saw Dante has posted that there was a Kickstarter (or indigogo, I don't remember) for The Tower. Again I thought this was odd because I thought they would have more funding. I backed this though because I really like this project (granted this was a mistake on my end, not learning from the past). I was following the steam discussions on the game and NM was giving out keys for people to play test it. I said I would love to help (again me being a moron). They sent me a key... and it did not work. So I posted that my key did not work. I didn't hear anything back and didn't see anything more posted from NM. It seemed the game was dead again. 

With this whole Tower issue out of my mind, and me counting the game as a loss (which was a disappointment to me, and still is because the IDEA is great) I saw this private eye game on steam called Sam Glyph: Private Eye! (I'm a sucker for a detective Noir theme). At first Glance it looked interesting, so I scrolled down the page... then I saw it's developer was NM. I took a pass because from what I knew of them, and the posts in the comments it sounded like another unfinished game. I did happened to buy it when it was on sale for a dollar so later. I played it, and again, the idea is interesting, but I was correct, it is just another unfinished game. 

Again I pushed NM out of my mind, and tried to forget them. Then one day I noticed that Dante had posted another crowdfunding project for The Tower (again I can't remember which one). I laughed and told myself I wanted to back this and help the project, but they lost my trust long ago, and it seemed like they were nowhere near reaching their goal. So I brushed this off and went on with my life. Then today I just happen to notice that The Tower was fully released on steam and I had it in my library. I played it, and it was different than the old game. New engine and voice acting and story. The idea seemed to be the game (which I still think is a good idea). The game looks ok and runs better than in the past. Though the game right now, just seems to be walk ten steps and have a dialog part where you do not feel engaged and feel bored about. 

Sadly as Tryyton says in this review of the game, it seems NM is just trying to scam our money and I have been a sucker more times than I should have. Don't buy this game, don't buy any of NM games, they are just unfinished.

This game really wasn't ready for release and should be tagged as an early access title.

No problem there as it is only the first 10 minutes now the problems arises when you get to a man in a cage in a room where you can hardly see anything with a 1 hit kill guard lurking about. The mechanics leave no room for error whilst trying to evade this guard. (I found no way to). So this is essentially where the gameplay ended for me. You die and have to waste another 10-15 minutes meandering back to die again. And with the save function in a state of disrepair you are looking at a CHORE an absolute waste of your time and money. Take your 3 dollars elsewhere and buy up something worth your time. 3/10 The tower hath fucked up. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link.

Was this the ""2015 edition"" I just attempted, or are there improvements to come?  No mention whatsoever on the Store page of it still being an Early Access title, so...anyway, let's attempt to review what I've played so far...
 
   The Tower, from what I have thus far experienced/endured, is an awfully good premise which has been executed...well, I'm obviously tempted to say ""rather awfully"", but it's not ALL bad.  The idea of having to find one's way through some tunnels with MINIMAL lighting, and mostly sound to guide oneself by, is undeniably genius.  The problem here is...there's nothing ""minimal"" about it.  Much of the time, we're just talking a black screen with a tiny white cursor dot in the middle of it.  So in other words, unless you're Mr Precision himself with the mouse, you honestly don't even know if you're staring straight at the ceiling or the floor half the time.  And the sounds are...well, I'm not sure they helped ME that much, but I am admittedly the kind of person who needs his ears syringed of wax every so many years, so maybe I just need to visit a doctor sometime.  Or maybe...just maybe...the devs thought of a brilliant way to create a sellable ""product"" with very little need for, y'know...those things that they call ""graphics"" (which aren't particularly awesome when you DO seem some daylight, I might add).  
 
   So does this mean that this is yet another ""walking simulator""?  Oooooh, GOD no.  We have COMBAT, believe it or not...in the form of pressing ""quick-time"" keys in aforementioned total blackness and hearing the guard we are allegedly attacking say things like: ""Oy, would somebody 'elp me?  Somebody's ATTACKIN' me 'ere...oy, 'e's just punched me in the FACE, so 'e as...is anyone goin' to 'elp me?  Cor blimey!"" or words to roughly that effect.  Fortunately the voice acting is fairly reasonable, so one must be grateful for small blessings, and yet...
 
   Honestly, it's hard to even review what it is we have here.  Even if this qualifies as a ""game"" per se - and not a ""con"", as some other reviewers on the Store page have posited -  it certainly doesn't appear to be a completed one, or even a semi-polished one.  It's more like a demo with (questionable) promise.  Henceforth I cannot, in all good conscience, give this anything resembling a recommendation, but who knows?  Perhaps one day this game will be: a. complete, and b. rather good.  Even on sale it's a pretty dubious proposition at this point in time...

Заранее оговорюсь - в игре порой не работает ни одна кнопка на клавиатуре, мы даже не можем выйти в главное меню (поймете о чем я, если решите сыграть)...
Отмечу сразу - играл на ультра настройках в высоком разрешении. 

Полное описание игрового процесса игры:
Начинаем игру в полной темноте, и ничего не можем сделать пока наш гг не проболтает пару минут, и пройдет еще полторы минуты текста... 

Далее  идем вперед, но тут опа! неожиданно еще пару минут чтение текста, что нельзя никуда не двинуться не пойти вперед! И далее, о чудо! Мы можем ходить! Неизвестно куда и зачем - факел наш гг не хочет брать, поэтому смотрим на свет вдали и идет пятой точкой вперед, ориентируясь в полной темноте с помощью этой самой пятой точки главного героя, нащупывая стены...
Затем, о снова чудо! Всплеск воды, и факел! Щелкаем на факел - и снова зависаем на пару минут текста, еще пару минут болтовни издалека - далее следует qte (в кромешной темноте, просто нажимаем на кнопки и слышем охи взохи), спустя пару минут снова полная темнота и хрен поймешь что надо сделать.... Поворачиваем камеру и видим что у нас светится факел!!! О_О  Нажимаем на факел - и снова попадаем в ж.. полную темноту, и с помощью жопницы нашего гг снова протаптываем себе путь в неизвестность...  и попадаем в комнату с фиолетовым факелом! О__О +
Щелкаем на факел - щелкаем на проход и попадаем в дом...

В доме встаем с кровати - спускаемся вниз, читаем записку, берем ключ около двери и выходим во двор.
Дальше - НИ В КОЕМ СЛУЧАЕ НЕ БЕРИТЕ ЛОПАТУ СЛЕВА, иначе гг попадает на небеса и игра намертво зависает в воздухе. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=361573527
Дальше игру пришлось вырубать Alt + F4 и повторно доходить до этого места.

Берем иконку молотка, минут 10 разбираемся, что от нас хотят - идем в сарай и находим на стене молоток, того-же цвета, что и стена. 
затем собираем доски в сарае, и идем заколачиваем забор и кладем молоток обратно.

Далее берем иконку топора, берем в сарае топор
(соответственно на скриншоте топор)
И идем рубить деревья, затем кладем их недалеко с другим поваленным бревнам - кладем топор на место.

Затем! Берем иконку лопаты и о чудо - мы не попадаем на небо. 
Выкапываем сорняки, идем в сарай берем саженцы - закапываем саженцы (можно удаленно с расстояния 10 метров к слову всё это делать).

Затем идем в сарай - кладем лопату и берем лейку
Наполняем её водой из водопада и поливаем наши саженцы.
Затем кладем инструмент в сарай и возвращаемся в дом.

В доме - гг необходимо сделать ужин.  Берем со стены справа кусок рыбы (точнее чешуи кусок и кожи) и немного укропа.  Кидаем в котел - и ЖДЕМ ПЯТЬ МИНУТ РЕАЛЬНОГО ВРЕМЕНИ пока у нас сварится суп. 
Как только гг поел - идем спать.

Просыпаемся от криков, ударов в дверь (вот тут я стал надеяться, мол неужели наконец-то началась игра!.. угу...) - мечемся по дому, гг штормит , он не замечает в упор ключ около двери. Наводимся куда-то в левое место - и он берет  ключ Оо. Открываем дверь и попадаем в пещеру.

В пещере гг дико штормит - картинка замылена на 90%, ни черта не видно (хотя ввокруг все окрашенно фиолетовыми цветами), и гг никуда не идет снова... Чудом находим силуэт факела - кликаем на него, затем на выход из пещеры.... ииии... КОНЕЦ ИГРЫ... конец мать его, игры..

-------
Если оценивать по стандартным параметрам игру:
Геймплей 0.2/10
Графика: 1.0/10
Звук и музыка: 4.5/10 (хорошая музыка и озвучка главного героя)
Сюжет: 0.0/10

Вердикт: мусор, это самый настоящий мусор! я не понимаю, как ЭТО попало в магазин steam. Забагованная, неиграбельная, недоделанная, и бесполезная абсолютно игра, которая проходится (если знать что делать) примерно за 15 минут, 13 из которых нам приходится тупо ждать пока гг проболтается, либо пройдет текст снизу.

Финальная оценка игры: 0.0/10.

UPDATE 3: ANOTHER SCAM OF NW IN THE SHOP? SRSLY? please stop this developer from scamming even more and more... guess why there are no negative comments in the forum? they get deleted and the poster banned. 

UPDATE 2: the next scam from NM is on sale now... STEAM SUCKS

UPDATE: all games of NarrowMonolith have been deleted from greenlight, thanks to valve/steam (GOOD JOB!). they looked into this, after i reported this scamming behaviour. hopefully ""the tower"" can´t be bought anymore soon. too bad that i can´t write in the forum of this comedy of a game...


DON`T SUPPORT SCAMMERS - NarroMonolith needs to be stopped! all they do is starting a game, taking money, starting a remake, then another game...nothing gets finished by them.

""Ambush. Hunt. Survive. Extinguish torches and create diversions to overwhelm guards and create shadows"" - are you kidding me? at this sequenze it means standing at one point and extinguishing one torch. then you listen to what happens in the fight and press two keys. that´s it! you can´t move or use stealth to get past the guards. damn, you don´t even see anything, that is described from the fight. you see the torch, a table and a bit of a tunnel. that´s it.

It starts out and looks so fun, so good, almost reminding me of a Grimrock art style.

But then it happens, you walk into the pitch black corridor and you think to yourself ""This is awesome"" and then it hits you... Wait a second, I can't get anywhere but via a guess. 

So you might say ""That's what this game is, you have to listen via the sounds""

That's the main problem, For a game pretty much 90% dependent on sound, the sound isn't that good. I think of games like Thief: Deadly Shadows and know what surround sound should be like and how good it can be. This game utterly fails with sound, even though good headphones (I'm not talking Beats headphones, I said good headphones.)

At one point you get a flashback to your farm... My God... The farm...  the amount of invisible barriers in this well lit, non threatening area is ludicrous. At one point I had to get a watering can from the shed, a shed with no door just begging to be entered. No can do, no way in heck you're getting in. Better idea go outside the shed, on the side of the shed where you see a watering can, get close to the wall and left click, left click like you never have before. Boom, I got it, now repeat with a shovel, an axe, and a hoe. And I can even describe the rage inducing harvest gathering, click on the poorly animated wheat until you get it. This game should be called ""Rage Quit: Tales of the Anger Managment class.""

At one point I see a enemy... If I had to sneak past or fight, I didn't care, I was just hoping for something fun. Instead you blow out a candle and a quick time event happens, which you don't get to see by the way. I have never seen a more lazy game then this.

On the short side of pros these are these:

Pros: 

Voice acting is great

Original idea for a game

The graphics in some areas look pretty good...


In short, this is a game both so full of promise, and yet so full of teribad... Yes I said it, teribad, no go out and buy a game that's fun and awesome and is actually worth cash.

The Tower is an adventure action-horror game.  This is a low-budget 
indie game that despite being funded on Kickstarter, and was on Early
Access, is selling on Steam with the addendum that any further 
production has been halted due to lack of funding.  They state that 
they will only add more to the game if they have enough sales.  What?!

The game runs poorly, and the sound is reminiscent of an early 2000 
game.  The ambient sound overpowers the character narration and plot
details.  Bugs proliferate throughout, and the plot wanders in 
pointless directions.  The horror aspect of the game is simply in
being unable to complete the tasks that you are asked to do.  
It wastes your time, and lies to you.  
I would rather hug a porcupine than recommend this game to anyone.

For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of 
what I cover in my video.

They took the visuals of this game miles further which I definitely appreciate. The fact that it's made in Unity is no longer obvious and the lighting in the game is actually pretty decent. My biggest gripes with the game now are there UI and the length of the game. 

UI: The user interface is pretty clunky and it would often times require me to go to my desktop then back into the game before my cursor would move. For some reason whenever I went to the pause menu it would do this to me. The save feature isn't obvious enough, and neither is the load feature. I couldn't tell If I actually successfully saved my progress or not. 

Length: The game is too bloody short. They improved so much of the game, but now it's wicked short. It took my all of 20 minutes to look around the Tower's playable space and then I found my wife (I assume) which triggers the ending of episode one, I don't know how to access any additional episodes, frankly I just don't think they exist. 

All in all the 2015 update is a huge step forward, but it still falls very short of what it should be, or even could be. 
________________________________________________________________________________
This game is based on an interesting and rather underexplored concept in video games; sound, and the potential mechanics involved in the proper usage of sound.

Unfortunately this game does not succeed in utilizing sound in the right ways. The idea is to use the sounds around you to navigate the darkness of this prison that you are trying to escape from. An interesting gameplay concept, but they didn't pull it off. Rather than using sounds to navigate the black corridors, I just blindly walk around until I find the right place to go. It's easier to do and takes less time. 

Also, it's a little too obvious that this game is made in Unity. Some of the effects had little to no work done on them and don't add to the game but rather take away, which is also unfortunate. 

All in all, I love the concept of using sound as a gameplay mechanic, but I don't think this game does that correctly.

So i'll try keep this concise and to the point. The tower is an early access game that blends story, adventure and horror all into one.

First off, I'd like to thank the team for building and continually adding to this game. It is much appreciated, from Developer to another.

Whilst I didn't play a very long time from time constraints, I would like to point out, that the only ""creepy"" moments I had was the first hallway (because jumping into the unknown is scary) and every time after that, just the initial creepy effect of going from a lit room to a non-lit room.

But being in complete darkness with limited sound fx, no music/score, and I'm sure I hit every wall in the dark room at least 6 times, was not fun. I was not creeped out, it had no atmosphere to give a creeped out feeling, and it didn't feel like a ""darkness of The Tower"" so much as ""The Annoying Bumping Into Walls and Pools of Water Tower"". 

Now, I know, the whole relative point is to run around until you find the torches, which are your save locations. Might I ask, make the ESC key to bring up a menu to quit the game? I just had to quit now to go, and I had to tab out to hurriedly quit. Sure, I lost all the time I bumped around in the annoying darkness, but it's not like I'll miss it anytime soon.

=====
Pros:
Beautiful graphics
Runs smooth
Great FPS
The torches are not cheaply made
Unity was a good choice


Cons:
The heat simmer from the torches is a little much. It might look like that if a jet fueled engine were next to it: sure
Bumping around in the dark... I guess its the point of the game
No Score/Music during the running around to give off a feeling of space and atmosphere

So very different than alot of dungeon crawlers yet so very simplistic. I used a very high end headphone setup consisting of a $200+ tube amp, $100+ DAC, and $300+ headphones which makes this game shine greatly. During the dungeon sequences I just closed my eyes and listened to the sounds and when I found my way using the sounds the character even yelled out ""oh thank god light"" or something to that effect which was delightful because I knew then to open my eyes and continue on with a lighted sequence of events.

That being said I'm pretty disappointed in how far or rather the lack of how far the developers have got with this game. According to the Steam page this has been a work in progress since 2012?! Really?! I'm not sure if this is a development team of one or two people, but really that would be a mute point as games like Space Engineers have grown leaps and bounds in the last year with a scant development team. The game has alot, and I mean ALOT, of bugs still. I found myself stuck against a physics wall numerous times during the farm sequence that should not have been an issue; for instance when trying to head back to the crops to plant seeds or water if I came to close to the tree next to the crops I would hit said physics wall and would have to back up and take a more sceneic course. 

I really like the game and the what you're trying to do with it, but for now I'm going to have to go with a thumbs down for purchase at this time. The game is simply ""not where it should be"" for how long it has been in development. I'll continue to check in every 6 months or so and hope to right a better review then. As for some points on the other negative review, I found everything to be in place where I thought it should have been with a little bit of calculation, I don't think thats a point of development need. More effort put towards the bugs, gameplay, and getting the story to a solid length I believe would make this game more ""complete"" for more to purchasae. Crawling through the darkness on the edge of insanity and starvation was most enjoyable(such odd things we gamers find enjoyable).

PS. At one point during the farm sequence I hit a physics wall in front of the shed and when trying to back up and reenter the she I fell out of the world and was left with the following screenshot. I was unable to enter the menu and had to alt+f4 and then reenter the game. It did not happen a second time. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=280970810",1404484277,1404485057,False,24,0,0.457625150680541992,1,True,False,False,False,,,

However it is in Early Access Alpha so there are a lot of problems with it. Minus the bugs and the glitches, I am having quite some fun with this game.

Pros: 

. Audio in the game is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, the sounds of water trickling from the top of the cave or the sound of stabbing a guard in the head... Amazing. 
. Lack of sight makes you traverse the pitch black caverns entirely by sound, which is very fun and interesting.
. Very intriguing storyline right off the bat, instantly had me drawn in. 
. Voice acting is pretty good.

Cons: 

. A LOT of bugs and glitches. (As to be expected in a early access alpha.) 
. While the voice acting is pretty good, there needs to be more emotion in the voices. 
. Some of the script needs modifying, at times I just sat there thinking ""That sounds quite odd.""
. Worst bug I have encountered is MANY invisible barriers in the flashback of your farm, there are a lot of invisible barriers that restrict you from entering the tool shed and other areas of your farm. This makes it unplayable for me.

All in all, with all the bugs and other issues of the game, for $5 you really can't go wrong. They have done quite well with this game so far and I am so eager to see more of it (after they fix the bugs that is)",1404456590,1404638114,True,43,2,0.541314363479614258,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Already though, I can tell it's going to be amazing. A first person - doungeon crawl  action meets puzzle game. The fact that sound is what leads you through this game is just purely amazing to me.

Справедливости ради надо сказать, что сейчас вам едва ли удастся полностью погрузиться в ту атмосферу, которую разробочтики здесь создали. Причины две - очень слабая оптимизация (в следствии чего низкий показатель FPS) и баги, которые встречаются довольно часто.

Even if u look past the bugs the game has i would still recommend it because the game has so much going for it.It has a great story and u get a good sense of what is happing through the story as it is told of the unfortunate events that has lead him to the tower in the first place.The tunnels as they are described to the player its almost like i am there in the tunnel myself.
The DEV'S on here are just great they take notice of what you are saying they reply to you they give updates on whats going on in the game through out the day and as for the content.Well they have said there will be new content each week i think thats great how many of you guys have played a game burnt through the story and was like i can not wait for the next   one abit like a tv series it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next and keeps you one the edge of your seat.For me i kind of like that idea as i like to enjoy my games i like to feel like i am in the story and i feel that this game brings that.  

hope this helps you guys
