[i]  [b] Ariana Grande Ft Nicki Minaj - Side To Side  

I've been up all night (Altitude Anthem)
And boy, got me flying side to side
(Let them planes know)
I'm talking to ya
See you gliding over there with your jet
Feeling like I wanna chase you in the clouds
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
I'm soaring at ya
'Cause I know you got a rad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me elation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')

These pilots keep chatting way too much
Say I should let you go
Can't hear them no, 'cause
I've been up all night
I've been up all day
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)
I've been up all night
I've been up all day
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)

Been trying to climb higher
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Making everybody think that we're solo
Just as long as you know you got me (You got me)
And boy, I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the clouds
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

These pilots keep chatting way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause
I've been up all night
I've been up all day
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)
I've been up all night
(Been up all night, baby)
I've been up all day
(Been up all day, baby)
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)

This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Jet stream, flying, feeling like I'm unstoppable
Come through, yo, get you this type of flight
If you wanna squad up, I got a co-pilot
All these birds, they just follow me
Altitude's rising, so they call me the king of the sky
Pilots in their feelings 'cause they feeling me
Uh, I-I give zero crashes and I got zero chill in me
Flying high, copped the blue wings that say ""Winning""
Looping with the shot, just tell 'em to call me the flying genius

These pilots keep chatting way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause
I've been up all night
I've been up all day
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)
I've been up all night
(Been up all night, baby)
I've been up all day
(Been up all day, baby)
And boy, got me flying side to side (Side to side)

This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Jet stream, flying, feeling like I'm unstoppable
Come through, yo, get you this type of flight
If you wanna squad up, I got a co-pilot [/b] [/i]

[b] In the vast expanse where heavens meet,
Altitude reigns, a visual feat 🌌.
Jets streaking by in trails of light,
Beneath the stars, an epic flight ✈️.

Wings ablaze with neon hue,
Diving, soaring, the sky's debut.
Thunderous roars and engine's whine,
In Altitude's realm, we intertwine 🚀.

Through arches of clouds, we gracefully glide,
In synchronized dance, side by side.
Explosions of color light up the night,
As we conquer the skies, in pure delight 🎆.

Mountains below, their peaks aglow,
Rivers winding, like ribbons they flow.
Sunset's embrace, a painter's delight,
Altitude's spectacle, a wondrous sight 🌄.

In this aerial ballet, we're players bold,
Crafting stories in skies untold.
Altitude's canvas, a masterpiece grand,
A symphony of flight, across the land 🎨.[/b]

""Altitude"" ist ein kostenloser 2D-Multiplayer-Arcade-Shooter.

Mit Flugzeugen geht es in die Arenen, Team gegen Team. Es gibt einige Spielmodi. Neben den erwartbaren Klassikern auch zum Beispiel einen Fußballmodus, in dem wir einen Ball einsammeln und in ein Tor bringen müssen. 

Die Steuerung ist dabei auf den ersten Blick ungewöhnlich und irritierend. Wenn man sich aber mal an die Mechaniken gewöhnt hat, kommt man gut damit klar. 

Im Verlauf der Partien können wir uns neue Flugzeuge, Waffen und Defensivsysteme freischalten und dadurch unser Fluggerät deutlich verbessern. 

Die Grafik ist recht simpel, aber zweckmäßig. Die einzelnen Teams sind gut zu erkennen. Manchmal wünscht man sich allerdings, einen etwas größeren Bereich des Spielfeldes einsehen zu können. Die Sounds sind eher schwach, passen aber zum Arcade-Charakter des Spiels. 

""Altitude"" überrascht kaum. Lediglich die Steuerung ist zunächst ungewöhnlich. Es macht aber dennoch Spaß, ein paar schnelle Partien zu zocken, vorausgesetzt man findet einen Server, auf dem sich noch Spieler tummeln, denn die Bots sind nicht die Intelligentesten.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Nimbly Games has crafted an instantly accessible, rewardingly deep, and ravishingly fun multiplayer action game. The sirens have sounded, bogies are coming in hot…
Jump into the fast and agile Loopy and drop your enemies from the sky with a tactical EMP blast - but hit your afterburners before your Biplane support tears them to pieces with 20mm cannons blazing! Barrel roll through the enemy minefield and arm your nuke as you enter the drop zone. There it is - the enemy base - but two Mirandas just warped in with lasers hot and an Explodet is lumbering into position over their hangar decks — will you carry your team to victory?
Multiplayer Done Right: Altitude combines Call-of-Duty style perks with the gameplay variety of Team Fortress 2 in a fresh multiplayer experience. Carefully refined controls, netcode, and balance make for hundreds of hours of deep, rewarding gameplay.
Seven Engaging Game Modes:
Plane Ball's constant action makes it a favorite among new and casual players while team-based tactical maneuvers like passing and blocking provide a fun challenge for veterans.
Team Base Destruction offers an intense, competitive experience where coordinated pushes and strategic loadout decisions turn the tide. Try a friendly pickup game or join a clan and play in the ""Altitude ProLeague"" - a competitive tournament scene run by hardcore gamers from the Starcraft and Counter-Strike communities.
For the ultimate test of dogfighting skills try 1-life Deathmatch or compete in Demolition for a more tactical, objective-based experience.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
✅ Five planes, each with distinct playstyles
✅ Modular weapons, armor, and energy perks
✅ Solo & Team deathmatch, a soccer-like mode, base demolition mode
✅ Completely Free, no microtransactions

[h3]Cons[/h3]
❌ Extremely slow startup on Windows 10. See official forums for manual patching required to get it to work
❌ Can't run windowed mode without losing mouse tracking
❌ Skins are unobtainable since the currency needed to earn them has been discontinued
❌ Low player counts. There is an active community, but to get full matches requires research and planning. Most veterans play in password-protected rooms

[i]Altitude[/i] is one of those quick arcade games that's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. You'll have to master the physics, in which your plane can stall, and carefully ration your energy between boosters and weapon fire. Each plane has a different weight, and therefore handling, to adapt to, as well as unique primary and secondary fire that serve both offensive and defensive purposes. Plane handling feels just right, slow enough to give you ample response time, but fast enough to pull of quick evasive maneuvers.

In terms of content, you can duke it out in classic deathmatch maps, or try something different with the sports-themed air ball, or team demolition modes. The latter involve carrying the ball (or payload) to the enemy side, hitting the target with a well-timed shot. There are enough maps to keep things fresh, from asteroids in outer space, to underground bunkers with narrow tunnels. Some maps are easier than others, but they make for good fun any time you're head-to-head with an opponent.

Because of the game's age, it has trouble with modern architecture. Win 10 will hang at a handshake step unless you overwrite key files in the java library, for reasons unknown. And although the game is just a bunch of 2D sprites, the loadup time can take around 2 minutes or more just to launch the game. There's considerable lag trying to switch over to the options menu (it freezes for a time), and the UI doesn't work properly with the mouse, especially towards screen corners. The keyboard Alt commands work fine, however.

[i]Altitude[/i]'s greatest weakness is its lower player population. There are full rooms, but these vary heavily by time of day. If you want to hook up with seasoned players, you'll have to make a reservation on the forums, since many of the serious games are restricted from the public. One other point worth mentioning is that if you're expecting to jump into a match with randoms, there's a big chance you'll be outgunned. Unless you grind to unlock higher level weaponry, certain planes are at a distinct disadvantage with default loadouts. Nothing that a bit of grinding wouldn't solve, though.

Compared to much of what gets thrown up on Steam daily, [i]Altitude[/i] is a real steal. Free, fun, and family-friendly, there's no reason not to give it a spin.

[u]Achievement Hunters[/u]: All achievements are tied to in-game ones, found in the hangar menu. Play all tutorial maps, then earn 4x chain, 10 kills without dying, and 50/100/150 cumulative downs with each plane. That's 300 enemies total, so it is a grind, and must be done on any multiplayer map. Host your own (complicated, check the forums), or join the XP server for a wide map and easy bots to finish solo. I believe it can be done in as little as 6 hours.",1615586053,1615598319,True,8,0,0.64168846607208252,0,False,False,False,False,

Весь игровой процесс сводится к баталиям на различных серверах, в разнообразных режимах. Играете вы самолётиками, коих в игре 10 штук, но большинство из них недоступны вначале. Открываться они будут по мере прокачки левела. Каждый самолёт уникален внешне и имеет своё вооружение, отличающееся по мощности урона (ракеты, бомбы, лазеры и т.д.), к тому же, в процессе пострелушек вы можете подбирать различные бонусы, улучшающие его параметры. А повышая свой уровень, за счёт побед, естественно же, вам будут открываться апгрейды. Чем больше навык, тем проще будет побеждать. И, кстати, много достижений идут на количество побед. Если захотите их сделать, то приготовьтесь к нудному мытарству. Затянется сей процесс надолго. Хорошо, что не обязательно искать людей для этих целей. Вы можете зайти как на сервер с ботами, так и свой создать. Достижения сможете получить и таким образом.
Что ещё можно сказать об игре? Вас ждёт 7 режимов. Есть классические (дуэль, дезматч) но есть и более интересные. Один из них представляет уничтожение базы противника, это как в Batlle City (в простонародье танчики)
на NES (Денди). Только тут не просто расстрелять базу нужно, а донести до неё бомбу, на борту своего самолёта. Но не так-то просто это сделать, ибо мешать вам будут не только самолёты противника, но и турели, расставленные на вражеской территории. К тому же, противник так же стремится уничтожить вашу базу. Довольно интересный режим. Но ещё больше мне понравился другой режим, схожий с небезызвестным Rocket League. Вы, по сути, играете в футбол. Да-да, летаете самолётами, отбираете мяч у противника и отправляете его в ворота оппонента. Геймплей в данном режиме драйвовый и динамичный, карты разнообразны, и именно здесь наибольший шанс встретить живых игроков, а не ботов.
В общем, игра неоднозначна. Сначала может затянуть, но потом довольно быстро надоедает однообразным геймплеем. Людей крайне мало, а с ботами играть, сами понимаете.... Графика и музыка посредственны, т.е. вполне подходят к этому бесплатному инди-проекту. Поиграть можно, тем более, раз бесплатна, но я уверен, что надолго игра вас не затянет. Разве только, если не решитесь на выбивание ачивок, чего я вам не советую. Затянется это не на один час.

Весь игровой процесс сводится к баталиям на различных серверах, в разнообразных режимах. Играете вы самолётиками, коих в игре 10 штук, но большинство из них недоступны вначале. Открываться они будут по мере прокачки левела. Каждый самолёт уникален внешне и имеет своё вооружение, отличающееся по мощности урона (ракеты, бомбы, лазеры и т.д.), к тому же, в процессе пострелушек вы можете подбирать различные бонусы, улучшающие его параметры. А повышая свой уровень, за счёт побед, естественно же, вам будут открываться апгрейды. Чем больше навык, тем проще будет побеждать. И, кстати, много достижений идут на количество побед. Если захотите их сделать, то приготовьтесь к нудному мытарству. Затянется сей процесс надолго. Хорошо, что не обязательно искать людей для этих целей. Вы можете зайти как на сервер с ботами, так и свой создать. Достижения сможете получить и таким образом.
Что ещё можно сказать об игре? Вас ждёт 7 режимов. Есть классические (дуэль, дезматч) но есть и более интересные. Один из них представляет уничтожение базы противника, это как в Batlle City (в простонародье танчики)
 на NES (Денди). Только тут не просто расстрелять базу нужно, а донести до неё бомбу, на борту своего самолёта. Но не так-то просто это сделать, ибо мешать вам будут не только самолёты противника, но и турели, расставленные на вражеской территории. К тому же, противник так же стремится уничтожить вашу базу. Довольно интересный режим. Но ещё больше мне понравился другой режим,  схожий с небезызвестным  Rocket League. Вы, по сути, играете в футбол. Да-да, летаете самолётами, отбираете мяч у противника и отправляете его в ворота оппонента. Геймплей в данном режиме драйвовый и динамичный, карты разнообразны, и именно здесь наибольший шанс встретить живых игроков, а не ботов.
В общем, игра неоднозначна. Сначала может затянуть, но потом довольно быстро надоедает однообразным геймплеем. Людей крайне мало, а с ботами играть, сами понимаете.... Графика и музыка посредственны, т.е. вполне подходят к этому бесплатному инди-проекту. Поиграть можно, тем более, раз бесплатна, но я уверен, что надолго игра вас не затянет. Разве только, если не решитесь на выбивание ачивок, чего я вам не советую. Затянется это не на один час. Ну а, в целом, это простенькая мультиплеерная игра, ничем сильно не выделяющаяся от подобных инди-проектов.

[h1] ▀▄▀▄▀▄ Altitude ▄▀▄▀▄▀ [/h1]

It's been some years since I played Altitude, back when they were still charging money for it and the player base was somewhat larger. In 2014, they've offered the game completely free to play, so naturally I revisited Altitude in....2019. Anyway, you play as a plane in a 2D map in usually teams or free-for-all. It was fun for what it was in 2009, now it's looking a little dated but still plays well with a controller. Of course it also supports keyboard and mouse, but see what you prefer. 

For the price of free, it's not a bad choice to play a few matches with friends and there are also bots available to fill a team if need be. This also runs on pretty much anything these days so it's good for casual players too. It was a hard sell to charge people for this game, but as free, Altitude gets a thumbs up.",1571417119,1654187074,True,1,0,0.505456626415252686,0,True,False,False,False,

- Colourful Artstyle
- Fast Gameplay
- Different modes and planes to play with
- Easy to get into

The Bad:
- Community is small, going free did help it though
- The same things that make it easy to pick up, also make it something you may not play for too long

The Verdict:

To keep it short - this game is fun. You fly around in your 2D plane and try to score soccer goals or blow eachother up. Similar to a game like Worms, but not turn based, and with cartoon planes.

사이드뷰 슈팅게임으로, 마우스의 위치를 인식하여 비행기가 이동합니다.
마우스로 공격을 하는 데, 일반(좌버튼), 아이템(휠), 보조 무기(우버튼)을 실행할 수 있죠.
또한, 상하 방향키로 속도를 조절할 수 있습니다.
현재의 조작키들이 불편하다면 설정에서 바꾸면 됩니다. 저는 속도 조절을 ws로 변경했죠.

은근 컨트롤에서 힘든 점은 엔진 조작입니다.
속도를 최하로 낮추다가 또는 어딘가에 충돌할 경우 엔진의 작동이 멈추는 경우가 있습니다.
이때 어떻게든 엔진을 작동시켜보고자 하지만, 잘 되지 않더군요.

게임은 여러 모드 중 하나를 선택하여 할 수 있습니다.
Free For All : 맵에서 그냥 난투 벌이기
Plane Balll, Snow Ball : 축구와 비슷, 공(눈)을 들고가서 상대 골대에 넣으면 됨.
Nuclear Launch Detected : 핵폭탄을 들고가서 상대 기지에 투하하여 파괴하는 것이 목표
Multiplanar Maythem : 맵에서 난투, 비어있는 벽을 통해 반대편으로 이동 가능.

거의 싱글만 플레이할 수 있다라고 보시면 됩니다.

Altitude is my go-to game when I just want something fun to do for a few minutes... or a few hours.
While deceptively simple on the surface, it can be played at a higher level through some practice, and can actually take a good deal of skill.
The community is awesome, and I feel like I get to know my team during each match. The downside is, that is only when I can find a match to play on. There are very few active players, and often only one or two servers open with players participating. When those are full, you can join a game that has one or two players on it, if there is one, but it's hard to build it up to enough players to make a fun game.
The game is great, but due to it being the style of game it is, it simply doesn't attract masses of people, as it has more of a casual feel (in my opinion), and most casual players are just that: casual. Meaning, even those who do like the game, are often only on every now and then, leaving the playing field a bit empty.

This game, while offering high quality gameplay, doesn't require much in terms of processing power. I remember running this game on my laptop from about 7 years ago (i3, onboard graphics, not much RAM). For gaming on low-end computers, it really doesn't get much better than this. Sure, there are plenty of strategy games which aren't particularly demanding (even civ5 if you don't mind running it at 10FPS), but when you want something where you shoot a bunch of dudes and when you don't want to be able to count the individual pixels or surfaces of the models, Altitude is the game.

You basically try to fulfill the map objective. There is a free-for-all deathmatch where you try to be the first to get 10 kills, there is a goal scoring map where you try to get your team to 6 goals, there is a bombing map where you collect a nuke to drop on your enemy's base. These are all first person shooter objectives from games like Quake and Unreal Tournament. Relative to other games on the market, it's nothing much. However, the game is simple enough that you can easily pick up the game. You accelerate and decelerate with the Up and Down keys respectively, and you point the direction with the mouse. Attack is Left Click, Launch Object is Middle Click and Special is Right Click.

Conclusion, try it but it's not a big winner.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Free
Truly free. It has no Pay To Win Mechanism. All you have to do is play enough games to level up. There is no shorcut using cash.

2. Variety of Planes
There are quite a few planes to fly so you have a small amount of replayability. Each plane also handles differently.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Boring Gameplay
It's not exactly ""Oh Wow!"", it's more of an ""Okay""

2. Stalling
Why did you put stalling into this game? While I understand that planes can stall in real life, everything else in this game is totally unrealistic. E.g. Loop the loops for fat planes.

3. Boring Game Modes
Playing air soccer? Why? It's so boring.",1486124834,1486125558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

一共 60 级，到了 60 级可以选择 Rank Ace，你将升级自己的徽章，又从 0 级开始打。
如此往复，一共有 10 个徽章，可以 Rank Ace 9 次。
我不喜欢 Rank 10 徽章，所以停在 Rank 9 很多年了。
徽章的作用仅仅是徽章本身，纯粹的荣誉标志。

打了几年后才把官方 Wiki 几乎全部读了一遍（只有英文版本），还是有好处的，有些东西只有这里才能了解到。

Actual Review:  I'll start by simply saying this games incredibly entertaining.

Pros:
-Bug Free as far as I've found
-Nice graphics.  Yes they're 2D but they have a nice touch and are well made.
-Actual single player.  This is something many F2P games miss.  In Alt.  you can go up against bots as much as you want.
-Smooth, easy to learn gameplay.  It's simple but fast paced and exciting.  You can easily fly around without grief from physics while at the same time they take enough artistic liscense to allow Hollywood esquire  dogfight moves.
-Online play isn't absolutely caustic.  Most of the time the worst that'll happen to a new player is being told to practice offline.
-Map editor 

Cons:

The shit you will have to put up with in Altitude 2016:

Only one or two populated servers at a time

Both play a garbage afterthought gamemode played on the same shit map that has no walls in it, all balance thrown out of the window

Everyone teamstacking.

If the one populated server gets filled, they will rather kick you than try to populate the other 50, even if some of them might be running a sane gamemode for a change.

Everyone giving you shit for not having a high level and killing them, especially if you do so with a ""noob plane"" that would be balanced on a proper map.

-Dissapointed by lack of players

-Joined the only online server, football

-Got my first goal

-Nobody was being rude so far..?

-Nobody was competitive

-Everybody was passing, SWEEEET!

-Lost my first game :(

Altitude at first: Obstacle course!

Altitude later on: Varied fights with constant maneuvering. The layout of the area and the speed, position and angle you have relative to your enemy when you encounter them all affect how the battle plays out.



Some beginners tips:

The most popular map, ""Football"", has no obstacles so is easy for beginners.

The bots who sometimes fill out teams on public servers are mostly on difficult settings with perfect aim, and can give even experienced players trouble. Their main weakness is that they will focus completely on whatever target or objective they have at the moment, ignoring other enemies unless you go straight in front of them.

When on a server, press TAB and look at the player's levels next to their badges. If there's no number, they're level 60. Sometimes a level 60 will start over from level 1, for prestige, but you can tell them apart by their more complex badges vs a beginners cartoony blue and yellow ones.

Anyway, level 60 people are usually pretty good. Sometimes I don't even fire at low level guys, just circle around them dodging their shots, and they often crash before managing to kill me :) The game has a high skill-ceiling. So you might want to find a server with beginners, the servers with just a few players on them often are.

Now, get online and try to hit me :)",1455722510,1455722510,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,

The game has two big problems:

1. Lack of new players

Most of the servers are empty. The game is dead.

2. The attitude towards new players

Just check out these pictures for example

You guys NEED new players to keep the game alive. And you just keep pushing them away. You're killing your own community.

I played the game for a few hours and had fun. Until I got into an argument with some ""old veteran"" who liked to votekick noobs from the server to make room for his friends to join. I got votekicked and couldn't play on that server anymore. There were not many servers to play on. Maybe 2 or 3. I didn't touch the game since.

I really love this game. There is both single player and muliplayer. The solo missions are basically prep for multiplayer. Although you can play multiplayer at any level, it's best if you level up your plane to -level 21-. At this point you have an awesome ship that most players use. (It teleports and takes a beating.)

Since there are only around 50-100 people playing online at a time, you will play against all skill levels and planes. This means it's really wise to play the campaign fully before jumping into multiplayer.

Worth $10

I can easily say this is one of my top 5 favorite games, but, it does come with ample warning -- it is most definitely not for everybody. Let me explain... (TL;DR version at the bottom of the post)

Currently, the largest issue is the lack of new players. Within a week, you can usually catch about 50 or so veterans at least once (many every day). However, it is becoming rarer each day to find new players. This means that unless you're playing with bots, you'll probably have a hard time.

I'd suggest getting a few friends and hosting a server of your own in order to get decent at the game before hopping onto, for instance, ball dojo (the ""top tier"" open server). Who knows, you might become good enough to join a permanent team or recieve an invite to ranked. The hardest part of this game is most definitely the initial push to be able to compete with the big dogs of Altitude, and after that, it's always extremely fun (and many times equally frustrating) to play.

I do not claim to be an extremely great player. Sometimes, I can get a goal. On a great day, sometimes 3. However, much of the veteran community is much better than I am and sometimes it [i]really[/i] shows. I only bring this up to say that even when your team is losing and you're one of the last players on it (maybe because you accidentally passed to an enemy that zipped past you to score), it is still a very fun game.

Worst case scenario, you just wasted... 0.00 dollars/pounds/euros/colourful rocks. If not for anything but for the sake of the community, give the game a shot. It is very friendly and close, since most people know of eachother (and if not, somebody else that knows who they do not). Many people are willing to help teach you and give you pointers.

Oh yeah, and gameplay. The steering is tight (mouse+keyboard at least), there are literally 5 controls if you use mouse+keyboard (3 on the mouse, up and down on the keyboard), you rank up in order to unlock new planes then new parts for said plane, there is a prestige system in order to get a better graphical rank, and there are [b]absolutely no in-game purchases with real money[/b]. That alone is extremely rare for a free-to-play multiplayer game, and for these many reasons, I cannot recommend this game enough.

[b]TL;DR[/b]

It will be a very difficult game at first, but after getting used to it (no more than a week at most, really), you will wonder how you've never played this game before. Not a huge community, but it's hard to tell since there's always at least 2 viable servers. NO in-game real cash payments. Tight controls and gameplay that doesn't feel repetitive. And, it's completely free -- there's no reason it's not worth trying.",1441470533,1665262978,True,8,0,0.615454196929931641,0,False,False,False,False,

Однако игра была выпущена на компьютер, и я могу вам сказать, что это достойный 2D симулятор самолетиков. 

Базовую механику игры можно освоить секунд за двадцать: шумная эскадрилья самолетов носится по уровням, живо напоминающим локации из серии Worms. Единственное отличие локаций Altitude от локаций Worms так это разрушаемость. В Altitude вы не сможете разрушить никакой из объектов, кроме базы соперника, но об этом позже.
 
Управление осуществляется с помощью мыши и клавиатуры или геймпада. Клавиши со стрелками отвечают за подачу. Еще три кнопки отведены под соответствующие виды оружия. 

Первая особенность: целиться мышью нельзя! Стрелять можно только в том направлении, куда смотрит нос самолета, другими словами, врагу необходимо или сесть на хвост, или встретиться с ним лицом к лицу. 

Вторая особенность: физика. Для всех видов самолетов действует одно базовое правило – останавливаться нельзя. Потерявший скорость корабль быстро опускается на «дно» карты, где рано или поздно насмерть разбивается о камни. Чтобы выйти из штопора, можно включить ускорители, но для их работы используется то же топливо которое расходуется при стрельбе, так что приходится выбирать между огневым потенциалом и скоростью.

Altitude имеет несколько режимов:

1. Free for all

Этакий deathmatch для самолетов где каждый играет сам за себя. Побеждает тот, кто быстрее всех сделает 10 убийств.

2. Multiplanar Mayhem

Этот режим полностью совпадает с предыдущим режимов, но есть единственное отличие. Здесь нужно совершить 20 убийств.

Режимы перечисленные выше встречаются и в командных вариантах, где группе самолетов нужно набрать определенное количество убийств быстрее, чем соперники.

3. Plane ball

Это своеобразный футбол. Вашей команде нужно отправить мяч в ворота противника. Выигрывает так команда, которая быстрее наберет 6 очков.

4. Snow ball

Режим полностью схожий с предыдущим. Отличие одно и единственное – это зимняя тематика

5. Nuclear Launch Detected

Этот режим чем-то напоминает карту из Dota 2. Здесь также есть «вышки» и база. Вы спросите меня как уничтожить эту базу, а я вам расскажу. В самом центре карты появляется одна бомба, которую вы можете сбросить на базу противника. Также существует другой вариант этого режима. В нем дается две бомбы, то есть одна на команду.

Как и любая современная инди-игра, Altitude выглядит весело и дешево, но мигом затягивает всех, кто осмеливается ее запустить. Вряд ли Altitude надолго затянет тех, кто уже по уши завяз в Team Fortress 2 и Left 4 Dead 2, но если вам внезапно захотелось поиграть с кем-нибудь в мультиплеере и при этом не хочется терять время на вникание в процесс – лучше игры не найти.

You can play football in planes. (Admittedly with some pretty nasty tackles.) How freaking awesome is that?

Longer review:
While it may have a pretty small playerbase (at times <50 people online), most of the rooms are open, and overall it's pretty fun to play.
You need a surprising amount of skill with any of the five planes available to take down enemies without stalling and crashing into the ground.
You need to learn careful energy management so that, once you do have someone in your sights, you don't have to wait to be able to start firing.
You also need to learn how to avoid being ambushed while doing this, and how not to smash into a wall and die an embarrassing (and ignoble) death.

Joke Review:  WELCOME TO THE 9/11 SIMULATOR!!!


Real Review:  It's not a bad title.  It's a nice casual game about planes shooting each other down.

Modes include Free For All (Death Match), single life team death match, Ball (Football/soccer/hockey), and Team Base Destruction.


Not only is this a free game, but it has achievments too (If you're an achievement junkie).  So really, you're not losing anything.


The only real criticism I have is that the community is pretty much toast.  Though you'll find life in about 3-6 servers.  The rest are simply filled with bots.   So, you could say it has more life than Gun Monkeys.


Good game for casuals, though a little skill will be involved....so I guess hardcore gamers might like this title too.  Just don't expect it to be a stellar, award-winning title.

Altitude is 2D-Indie-""flight simulator"" developed in 2009 by Nimbly Games, the game implements different playable craft, different game modes, and fairly basic controls. [i](up, down, throttle down, throttle up, pew A, Pew B)[/i]

 [b][u]-Detailed breakdown review-[/u][/b]
 [b]Story:[/b]  There isn't really a story, this game is basically a 2D-indie-MOBA.

 [b]Game Play:[/b] As I said earlier, the controls are very simple, but it does take into account gravity, firing arc, and several other aspects that makes the strategies far more complex. For example, if you're flying higher than your opponent/target, you can dip lower and fly faster because of descending altitude (puns, ha!).
Unfortunately because Altitude is a MOBA, the game relies heavily upon other players. [i](This is the key downside to the game for achievement hunters; or people who want to unlock new aircraft)[/i] There are usually a few servers that are up with people playing, but for the most part the community has been shrunk down to a nearly-non-existent-size.

 [b]Achievements:[/b] There are three achievement categories: 1) Get tons of kills with this plane without death, 2) Get tons of kills overall 3) Do this training mission. Many of the planes you need for achievements aren't unlocked until you rank higher, adding to the difficulty of getting the achievements, with the prerequisite of ""ranking up first"". [i]With less words: It'll take a lot of time, and unless you're playing with friends the achievements are a skip.[/i]

 [b]Price:[/b] Altitude is Free to Play, so there's not much excuse to not trying it... Unless you're a normal steam gamer, and have hundreds or millions of games in your steam library... in that case... yes, that's a good excuse. But if you're cursed by financial limitations like the person writing this review, then free games are nice! :P

 [b]Conclusion:[/b] Since the game is free... you are probably only looking through the reviews to see funny comments. There's a good chance you won't even see this one; since there are those crazy guys who have 500-1,000+hours in the game who reviewed it when the community was still strong.
Still, I enjoyed playing it, and it deserves to be recognized as a fun indie game. This game will appeal to most people who enjoy other Indie games, but the people who enjoy MOBA's and flight mechanics will get the biggest kick out of the game.",1431100589,1431100589,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,False,False,False,False,

Los servers con mapas de co-op suelen estar vacíos, pero si pillas uno con 3 o 4 personas puedes pasar un muy buen rato destrozando torretas y muriendo 300 veces hasta que te pasas el mapa. [b][u]Literalmente[/u][/b].
+ Se requiere una cierta habilidad para jugar competitivamente, y es casi imprescindible pillarle el truco a todas las clases y configuraciones.
+ Los bots no se suelen andar con chiquitas y están bien equilibrados con respecto a los niveles de dificultad, lo cual es algo que falla muchísimo en los juegos competitivos de ahora.
+ Las especificaciones mínimas son bajísimas, tan bajas que casi seguramente el juego correría bien en un Raspberry Pi(de segunda generación, si, pero correría).
+ Gráficos decentes que no sangran los ojos. Punto. No es que haya mucha gente que quiera gráficos AAA en un juego competitivo que además es 2D...
+ Editor de mapas. Un poco complicado de usar quizá, pero hace su trabajo muy bien.
+ La configuración de servidores es muy customizable.

- Los servers en general suelen estar vacíos.
- Nimbly Games ha dejado de actualizar el juego tras ponerlo como un F2P, lo cual es una pena para un juego que tiene tanto potencial.

- FASES:
São inúmeras fases, que inclusive até hoje entro em salas que nunca joguei antes, mesmo com 400h de game. 

- AVIÕES:
Vários modelos de aviões, cada um com sua exclusividade. Arma primária e secundária. Você vai desbloqueando diversos tipos de aviões e escolhe o que mais se identifica.

- MODALIDADES
Existem diversos tipos de modalidades, tais como: 
* Destruição de Base: onde você deve levar a bomba, passando pelo time adversário e lançar na base inimiga.
* Futebol: cujo objetivo é fazer o maior número de gols durante o período da partida que pode variar de 10 ou 20 minutos, ou até mesmo trocar de mapa (fase) ao atingir 6 gols.
* PVP: cada player joga individualmente e quem fizer o maior número de kill (matar) até o tempo final é o vencedor. Os aviões são identificados por cores, onde cada cor representa um player.

A interface é bem simples e deixa algumas dúvidas, como por exemplo: como criar um server, ou adquirir pontos para comprar skin. Nesse ponto poderia melhorar bastante.

Aguardo por novas atualizações! Talvez com melhoria de gráfico e mais facilidade de acesso à informações.

Es macht eigentlich wirklich viel Spaß.

[h1]Pro[/h1]
-Grafik sieht gut aus
-Musik passt
-Sound ist gut
-Sehr gute Steuerung
-Kostenlos
-Einsteigerfreundlich
-Einzelspieler und Mehrspieler vorhanden
-Benutzererstellte Karten (Karteneditor)
-Jede Klasse spielt sich anders
-Jeder Spielmodus spielt sich anders

[h1]Contra[/h1]
-Nicht viele Mehrspielerserver mit Spielern vorhanden, meistens haben nur 3 bis 4 Server gerade Spieler online
-Es kann nervig sein, wenn man manchmal in einem Spiel mit absouluten Pro's spielt

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]
Altitude ist ein einfaches Flugzeug-Kampfspiel in 2D, das wirklich jeder mal testen sollte. Es macht einfach Spaß, sich gegen andere Spieler in 2D-Kampfszenarien zu stellen. Manchmal ist es zu schwer, gegen andere Spieler zu spielen, aber für den Notfall gibt es noch einen Offline-Modus (Skirimish).

Also, was lest ihr denn noch weiter? Hör auf damit und fang' an zu spielen! :)

[h1] 🎤 Вступление [/h1]

Весьма скромный инди-проект от двух разработчиков, которые на удивление, продолжают поддерживать игру, даже спустя такой долгий период после выхода и при фактическом отсутствии игроков на серверах.

[h1] 🎮 Геймплей [/h1]

Altitude - это мультиплеерные сражения на 2D-аренах с участием боевых самолётов с установленным на них оружием.

В игре доступно несколько режимов: классический дезматч, командный дезматч, уничтожение вражеской базы, и футбол. Пожалуй самым интересным получился именно последний, так как кроме уничтожения врагов, здесь нужно ещё закидывать мяч в ворота, стараясь уклонятся от атак противников, а в случае потери мяча, пытаться его отобрать. Также неплохим получился режим с нападением и защитой базы, где одному из игроков дают бомбу, которую нужно скинуть в определенную уязвимую точку. Дополнительным усложняющим фактором здесь являются турели, от огня которых, необходимо своевременно уворачиваться. Все режимы можно запустить как в мультиплеере, так и в одиночной игре. При отсутствии игроков в онлайн сессиях, свободные места заполняются ботами, поэтому сидеть в лобби с длительным ожиданием людей не придётся.

У каждого самолёта есть три базовых показателя. Скорость - можно как ускорять самолёт, так и замедлять, однако если он полностью остановится, то двигатель заглохнет и ваше воздушное судно начнет падать. Энергия - ресурс, который тратиться во время использования оружия и ускорения. Этот показатель довольно быстро восстанавливается, но всё же, создаёт определенные ограничения во время ведения огня и использования ускоренного режима полёта. Полоска здоровья - она отвечает за то, в каком состоянии находится самолёт. Все вышеперечисленные элементы, плюс, особенность физической модели, создают определенные сложности во время воздушных сражений и заставляют следовать определённому тактическому принципу: правильно рассчитывать время атак и знать особенности каждого самолёта с его текущим боевым арсеналом.

На выбор доступно пять видов самолётов, каждый из которых обладает своими характеристиками и набором определённого оружия. Самолёты довольно сильно отличаются друг от друга, как внешне, так и технически и для каждого из них необходима своя тактика управления. Одни более маневренны, но имеют слабую поражающую способность, другие медленные и неповоротливые, но имеют в своём арсенале более разрушительное оружие. Само оружие представлено в основном пулеметами, гранатомётами, минами и электрическими пушками.

За победы и уничтожения противников начисляются очки роста, которые повышают уровень, и открывают улучшения для самолётов. Система улучшений здесь получилась однообразной и состоит из одинаковых апгрейдов для всех видов летательных аппаратов: усовершенствование базового оружия, установка временного поля защиты, электрическая ловушка или самонаводящаяся ракета.

 [h1] 🚧 Остальное [/h1]

Визуально Altitude выглядит очень просто. Здесь можно провести аналогию с флеш играми. Сама картинка яркая и красочная, мне даже чем-то напомнило стиль серии Worms. Уровни состоят преимущественно из фоновой плоской картинки и нескольких крупных объектов блоков, об которые можно разбиться во время полётов. Недостатком геймдизайна, как по мне, является то, что в боях с большим количеством самолётиков в кадре, всё превращается в какую-то мешанину из взрывов.

Безусловно разработчиков нужно похвалить за длительную поддержку и оснащение игры базой необходимых инструментов. Периодически выходят фикс апдейты, до сих пор есть официальные рабочие сервера. В файлах игры доступна инструкция и все необходимые приложения для запуска своего собственного сервера. Есть ряд инструментов для создания карт и уровней. Также игра будучи платной, со временем перешла в статус бесплатной.

И всё же несмотря на неплохую проработку воздушных сражений на мини-самолетиках, игра выглядит слишком просто, а геймплей довольно быстро приедается. К этому, также стоит отнести и то, что в игре, крайне редко можно встретить живых людей и свой мультиплеерный потенциал Altitude давно потерял.

[h1] 🏁 Итог:

В целом, неплохая реализация аркадных, казуальных, воздушных сражений на самолётах, но с банальной прокачкой оружия, достаточно быстро приедающимся игровым процессом, неброским внешним видом и отсутствием игроков на серверах.

Altitude comes with a map editor that you can use, and the game can be played single player or multiplayer. I have noticed that it seems to have a decent amount of players most of the day as of me writing this review. So you should not have much trouble trying to find a game for a while (as of 9/13/14).  I would recommend this game to any of my friends looking for a free to play multiplayer game, its pretty neat but you will probably like it more if you are a fan of indie games or pilot games. Altitude is free now on Steam, so you should try it if you think it may interest you.

Si te gustan los juegos adictivos, que sirven tanto para rellenar un hueco de media hora de vicio, como para tirarte una tarde entera con él, hazte con una copia de Altitude en cuanto lo veas rebajado (suele estar a 2,5€ en los periodos de ofertas y a mi gusto debería tener un precio de 5€ en lugar de 10€ en los periodos sin rebaja).

Se trata de un juego multiplayer online en el que manejas un avión en planos 2D, las partidas suelen ser de unos 12-14 jugadores en diferentes modos de juego, se puede jugar solo contra bots pero estarías aprovechando el 10% de la diversión que ofrece.

Visualmente muy atractivo por la estética y colores de los fondos, de todas las paredes y obstaculos de cada mapa y sobretodo de los aviones. Pero lo que de verdad engancha es un estilo de juego muy arcade y de un engañoso sencillo manejo, pues aunque es facil hacerse con los mandos de cada uno de los 5 aviones que hay disponibles en el juego, cuesta  acostumbrarse al estilo de juego de cada uno de ellos, desde los más fáciles como el Loopy o el Bomber, hasta los más complicados: el Explodet y el Miranda. 

Hay diferentes modos de juego en los que siempre hay algo en común: destrozar los aviones rivales. Tenemos modos por equipos puramente de lucha aérea al estilo Quake (matar, morir, revivir a los pocos segundos, y volver a matar) o estilo Counter Strike (por rondas, en las que si mueres no vuelves a revivir hasta la siguiente tras uno de los equipos haberla ganado). En todos los mapas tenemos algunos objetos que se van generando cada cierto tiempo en unos puntos colocados en cada mapa, que sirven para darnos una ayuda tanto para destruir otros aviones (misil teledirigido), como para reparar los daños del nuestro (cura completa) o esquivar todos los ataques durante unos segundos (escudo).

Pero tambien hay otros tipos de juego en los que además de como siempre tener la posibilidad matar a los rivales, para puntuar hay que hacer otras cosas, como por ejemplo el Ball, donde hay un nuevo objeto, una bola, en el que el objetivo es transportarla hacia la portería rival, ya sea marcandose una jugada individual esquivando los ataques rivales, o pasandosela a tus compañeros de equipo para ir avanzando, mientras vas jugando con el diseño del mapa repleto de obstaculos. 
U otro modo en el que cada equipo tiene en un extremo del mapa una base que hay que defender y transportar una bomba que se genera en tu zona cada cierto tiempo, hasta la base rival arrojándola sobre ella que irá sufriendo daños con cada impacto dependiendo del acierto del lanzamiento hasta que sea destruida. 
La mayoría de modos son por equipos aunque por supuesto tambien tenemos un Todos contra Todos hasta llegar a X muertes, o hasta que se acabe el tiempo. Tambien hay algunos mapas creados por la gente que son estilo cooperativo de ir superando obstaculos en un laberinto de mapa.

Y en cuanto los aviones el medio con el que vamos a intentar ganar en todos los modos de juego, al principio solo tenemos disponible uno de ellos y conforme conseguimos experiencia al matar, ayudando a matar, marcando goles, destruyendo bases... iremos subiendo de nivel y obteniendo los otros 4 aviones, y después 2 modificaciones para las armas de cada uno de los 5 aviones para tener un total de 15 armas diferentes, y tambien otras mejoras para los aviones como por ejemplo una mayor capacidad de giro, o un blindaje más resistente o mayor recuperacion de la energía que necesitamos para ir disparando nuestras armas o acelerando el avión, hay 2 tipos de mejoras y 4 mejoras de cada tipo que son comunes a todos los aviones. 
Así que solo tenemos que elegir un tipo de avión, ponerle un arma, una mejora azul y otra verde (que son los dos tipos de mejoras que hay) y lanzarlo a la batalla.

En definitiva, un sencillo juego arcade muy divertido y muy adictivo, en el que nada más acabar una partida querrás otra, con una gran variedad de modos de juego y de mapas diferentes y 5 aviones que iremos modificando conforme subamos de nivel.

Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.

It was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.

Regardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.

Controls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).

Yeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!

You control cartoonish planes in various gametypes, which feature the standards you've come to expect: deathmatch, CTF, etc. There are a few spins on that, like Airball which plays much like a soccer game with shooting.

You start off with a basic plane, and can unlock more through leveling up. You level up by completing objectives in the games, or finishing matches. The gameplay is simple enough to learn, can control with a keyboard or gamepad, and features a tutorial to teach you about all the game typles. The visuals are very cartoonish, which match the arcade playstyle. This is by no means a simulation. The planes do not control realistically at all, so don't expect that.

Since this is a multiplayer game, you will have to rely on other people actually being online playing this game. On the occassions I've tried, there only seems to be one-two populated servers at any given time. You can play offline with bots, but that always takes some of the fun away from a multiplayer game. Plus, the bots don't really play like human opponents anyway.

Because of the lack of community (which frankly can be expected from a game a few years old without a really great hook), I do not recommend buying Altitude at this time. While it is fun enough in short spurts, you'll have to rely on there being available servers, which is not a guarantee at this time. Try it out if you already own it, but the pricetag is too high for newcomers.

Doesn't sound like much, does it?  I know, right?  That's what I thought too until I read what ELSE was in the box (and what wasn't, gosh!) - only these cryptic words:

""Altitude - Demo is not available on your current platform.""

*MIND.  BLOWN.* Why? OBVIOUSLYbecause like, literally RIGHT NEXT to the ""DOWNLOAD DEMO"" button is a picture of Tux the Penguin (mostly known for how much he urinates inside the house) - next to that is Eve's apple (Original Sin is such a B!TC#, right?  THANKS, Eve... NOT!), and then that folded-up napkin in the wind (does anyone know what that's for?  I have NO IDEA, but I tots LUV it!).  I mean, so you'd think that this game could be played basically anywhere - I mean, probably don't need more than a couple batteries and some lemons to boot this baby up - I mean, it says STEAMPLAY right there too...  So WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?

Anyways - I've been playing the demo for HOURS now on my mean bean machine (otherwise known as Linux, LOL) and I'm still puzzling it out...   Tux logo + unavailble on Lin(T)ux...  I dare not click ""OK"" when the answer must be so OBVIOUSLY staring me in the face - I mean, there's probably an achievement for a perfect runthrough (I mean, if I click OK i'd be admitting what?  That you shouldn't put pictures of Tux next to things that don't run on Linux?  Uh, DUH! So OBVIOUS, right?)

Anyway - you innocent fools can count on episode 2 of  my review of this demo as soon as I beat the demo in Linux...

BEST GAME EVER!

This was the first game I bought on steam, and to this day I think it's one of the best available. 

[h1]Positives: [/h1]

+ Great gameplay. Easy to learn but difficult to master is definitely the right way to describe this game. The gamemodes are extremely fun and diverse too, so if you don't like mindless free-for-all, you can still play other modes like football or 'team base destruction' (I can't rememer the actual name of the mode).

+Good variety of planes. Great as it allows players to play multiple roles. Don't like close range dogfights? play a bomber, etc.

+Good controls for KB&M users

+Steam achievements

+IT'S FREE NOW. GET IT!

[h1]Negatives: [/h1]

-I don't really understand the ship customisation system. I don't think you can get more skins without paying or something. 

-No controller support

[h1]Conclusion: [/h1]

Now, however, I can only barely recommend this game.

The game itself is fantastic. It's a 2D, side-view, multiplayer dogfighting game. The controls are tight, the gameplay intense, and the game plays so quickly (rounds last only a few minutes) that it induces ""just one more game"" syndrome. To keep things from getting too repetitive, there are variety of plane types and boosts that can be earned through an XP system. There are also a number of game types - of particular note is the ""ball"" game type where players attempt to carry and shoot a ball into the opposing team's goal without being shot down in the process. Scoring the goal is just as exciting as it is in any sports game.

So why can I no longer wholehearted recommend the game? Well, it has encountered the fate that any multiplayer-focused game that isn't as popular as, say Counterstrike, has met: lack of players. There are very few people playing the game now and the few active players left are INSANELY good. Even someone like myself who was half-way decent as a ball runner finds respawning to happen way too frequently.

That leaves two options for enjoying the game: either skirmish against the bots or round up some friends. As with most games of this ilk, playing with and against bots is okay but not a perfect substitute for live players. Perhaps the best way to enjoy the game at this point is to round up a few friends who also own it and host a private game.

Altitude is a great game whose lifespan has run its course. I recommend it for a group of friends or if it goes on Steam sale again (not extremely likely given its age) and creates an influx of new players. Otherwise, I regrettably recommend passing on a game that not enough people enjoyed.",1386657677,1386657677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

It's very fun for brief stretches of time, and the server options are customizable to favor both the experienced and the new. 

In a sense, Altitude's multiplayer reminds me of the feeling of old-school FPSes with the openness of maps and hectic gameplay. The flight and speed of the varying ships have a bit of a learning curve, but once you find that ship that's ""just right"" for you, you'll either feel like a aerial master or a bomber of death. 

The levelling system with perks do lock away some interesting abilities, but for the most part, we haven't seen an issue where the perks themselves overpower players. Thankfully, the only real determining factor is a person's piloting skill. Learn to fly, and you can get into this game without a problem.

Keep gameplay short, as playing it for long stretches of time will wear you down.

Veramente divertente, ma presenta delle pecche che ne rovinano molto l'esperienza. La modalità online è completamente buggata, spesso si viene catapultati fuori per eccesso di ping (in realtà è assai ballerino) e il 90% dei server sono vuoti. E poi graficamente non è proprio il massimo, per andare in 16:9 bisogna deformare l'immagine, quindi bisognerà accontentarsi del formato 4:3.

In ogni caso soprattutto per il problema online, non ne consiglio l'acquisto, ma era veramente sfizioso come gioco.

The good news is you can create your own games and play against bots, which achieves the same thing as if you were playing against human opponents.

Unlocks provide new weapons, tools and abilities for your various planes, and usually provide different options, rather than straight 'upgrades'. This means that beginners can easily stand toe-to-toe with hardcore veterens.

Various modes are available, such as a soccer-like team game, and good old deathmatch.

It's not my cup of tea, but one of the better indie releases out there.",1323318575,1323318575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Due to the tools available it has a multitude of gamemodes and maps.  The progression is rewarding and allows you to learn and modify your playstyle as you unlock more options for your planes.

Unfortunately for Altitude the servers are pretty empty even after becoming free, vets of the game will be mixed in with completely new players and can create frustrating matches for both parties.  It runs off dedicated servers so no skill based matchmaking here folks, sorry.

If you didn't have reason enough to play it before, do yourself a favor and play it now that it is free!

With fast-paced, in-your-face action, Altitude keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Pack in several game modes as well as a sizable collection of maps, and this indie title gives you variety that'll keep you coming back for more! 

Reminiscent of an old-school DOS game I used to play on my 386, Altitude brings back memories. The keyboard controls are as simple as in the good ol' days, but you can also control your plane entirely with the mouse. Instead of the black-and-white pixels of my memories, the graphics are simple, sleek, crisp, and stylized like Team Fortress 2's, giving Altitude a longer future than games that aim for ultra-realism. Games don't need much realism; they need the simple elegance that Altitude has, with it's solid gameplay and balanced variety.",1290500553,1290500553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,
