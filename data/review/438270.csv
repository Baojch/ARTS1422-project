And now... wamekitateru...

GAMEPLAY
This isn't the type of game you buy for gameplay. That doesn't excuse the gameplay being tedious and boring with clunky interfaces, godawful combat, a godawful world map, borderline pointless side quests, and a bare bones RPG experience, but it does mean the game has to BRING IT as an educational resource to be in any way valuable.

EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE
And... as an educational resource... it doesn't exactly fail, but it also isn't amazing. The primary goal of this game is to teach you the Japanese hirigana writing system, and for the most part, it does that. Mostly through repetition. Lots, and lots, and lots of repetition. It's exactly the same type of repetition you'd get through using flash cards, in fact. So... why not just use flash cards? There is nothing you can get from this game that you can't get from any other resource that teaches the hirigana writing system.

The battles themselves aren't completely worthless, as they do give you repetition that can help you learn the hirigana, but I don't think the battles/repetition are as effective as they could be. As you wander around the map, you engage in random encounters with hirigana that you must get correctly. The problem is that there are maybe six or seven groups of 2-4 hirigana that you encounter on any given map, always in the same groups with the same other hirigana, and it rarely mixes it up by throwing in characters from earlier lessons. Add to this that the responses you give are always listed in the same order and you can pretty much just muscle memory some of the answers by remembering where they are on the chart rather than actually learning that the symbol stands for ""ne"" or ""no"" or whatever syllable it's supposed to be teaching you.

There are also some side lessons that can teach you Japanese vocabulary, but they exist more as study resources until the godawful endgame. There are no quizzes for the Japanese vocabulary lessons, and aside from a few side quests where they are actually important, you are almost never encouraged to engage with them through the gameplay. (Having to go to a shop to buy a manga and having all the shop's items written in hirigana was a notable exception, as it was VERY effective and something this game desperately needed more of.) Yes, the game presents you with the information, but it does almost nothing to help you learn that information. You'd get the same impact, again, from flash cards, or just buying a Japanese/English dictionary and practicing through repetition. There is no point to putting information in A GAME if the gameplay is going to do nothing to help you learn the information. The literal purpose of an educational game is to teach THROUGH GAMEPLAY.

THE GODAWFUL ENDGAME
Which brings me to the godawful endgame. Up to the endgame, the gameplay has focused on teaching you hirigana through repetition. Not necessarily ineffective, but very boring. It presents the hirigana and expects you to translate a single syllable into romanji, or it presents the romanji and expects you to translate it into hirigana. Aside from a handful of dull side quests which occasionally have you engage in a more meaningful way and lessons that show you Japanese words, and then don't have you do anything with that information, this is the gameplay. 

Until the endgame. You are now expected to translate words written in hirigana... directly into English. I cannot overemphasize how awful this endgame is. Should you learn the basic Japanese words it's presenting you with if you want to learn Japanese? Yes. It's kind of a requirement. But THE GAME did NOTHING to help you get to that point aside from showing you the words and saying, ""Study these on your own."" Not only that... but the whole purpose of this game... IS TO TEACH YOU HIRIGANA! You would think that at some point before direct translation of hirigana words into English, the game would present you with the challenge of trying to translate full words into their romanji phonetic pronunciations, a culmination of everything you have learned thus far. But it doesn't. It just expects users to direct translate hirigana into English after doing the barest minimum of showing you what the word means in English once... ten lessons ago. That is NOT how an educational game should logically and rationally build up to that skill. If the game's goal was to get you to that point, it needed to do more interactive exercises with words to get the learner TO that point. Again, the purpose of an educational game is to use THE GAMEPLAY to teach, not to present the information and then say, ""Study it yourself."" If someone wanted to study it themselves, they would have just studied it themselves, they wouldn't have bought A GAME to HELP them learn it.

So once again, in its endgame, the game fails to be more useful than any other educational resource available for learning Japanese, and can be argued to be actively detrimental.

STORY AND CHARACTERS
Skkkkkiiiiiiiippppp... Never before have I been so enamored with the ""skip"" button.

THE GAMEPLAY INTERFERES WITH LEARNING
Not only is this game an awful RPG, but the RPG aspects interfere with learning. You can lose a battle not because you gave a wrong answer, but because you haven't bothered leveling up your character's armor and weaponry or you didn't buy enough health packs or revives. It has nothing to do with learning, you just lose because you can't be bothered to give a crap about the RPG because it's soooooooo mediocre and sooooooo bare bones.

There's also a problem wherein the gameplay becomes so repetitive and boring you actively don't want to keep engaging with it. It's not exciting to learn a new language when you defeat ""ri,"" ""ro,"" and ""ru"" effortlessly for the twenty-seventh f****** time.

GLITCHES
It ran fine.

OVERALL
I give this game a 3/10, which is a shame, because there aren't a lot of educational resources like this on Steam. Unfortunately, I love the idea of this game more than I love the actual game. To its credit... it CAN teach you hirigana. To its detriment, it's not a good game, and the educational aspects could be a lot more effective. I really only recommend this for kids aged 6-9 and people who REALLY need some kind of guided activity to help them study.

PROS:
- Interactive experience learning hiragana characters (RPG style)
- Constant battle encounters in which you have to practice your knowledge
- A cool story, to fight the final boss you need to get better at hiragana
- Most interactions with NPC are inspirational (motivating player to keep learning)
- Smalls details that make the game cuter (i.e. Ramune bottle that restores hp) 

CONS:
- The hiragana font could be simpler. It's a bit extra, making it hard to recognise strokes as a beginner
- The attack tab could be simplified (i.e. every k- character could have a subsection), because as you progress the game the list of answers becomes huge
- Some general UI issues (I can't choose the volume I want since it goes up by 20s, instead of conventional volume settings)

I would have liked an in-game drawing system to practice writing the characters as well, rather than on paper.

Overall this is a really cute, interactive game to practice hiragana. Very creative.

you choose action and then select an enemy and then select what they are.
say you fight a 💀
and you choose 🤓.
it does no damage 💀💀💀
if you chose 💀 that enemies cooked and takes damage though.

haven't played a lot because idk i thought id die of laughter not learn japenese like some weeb. but you live in a village and some evil dude attacks the place with hiragana for whatever reason, then someone who knows japenese teaches you and your friends japenese so you can win against them. thats the first 10 or so mins of the game in a nutshell
still better than doulingo

bought it off some cdkey type of website a while ago for 50 cents or so thinking the name was a joke, but this game does teach japenese (as best a game could ig) 
if you really want to learn japenese, than maybe buying their other games would be smart choice, since your missing out on the other ones that teach important things.

[b]Reviewer:[/b] Kiba Snowpaw, a 36-year-old Furry male Ice Wolf from the ice world of HowlStrom, endowed with potent ice magic.

[b]Review:[/b] 

In the vast gaming universe, where adventures and learning intertwine like the intricate patterns of a spider's web, a game like ""Learn Japanese To Survive!

As Kiba Snowpaw, a seasoned gamer of the furry realm with a passion for both gaming and cultural exploration, I embarked on this unique journey with eagerness and anticipation.

[h2]Storyline and World-Building: An Icy HowlStrom Touch[/h2]

The game unfolds like a mystical scroll, revealing a world where the Japanese language is not just a means of communication but a key to unlocking hidden powers and secrets. The narrative, brimming with drama and action, resonates deeply with my icy heritage from HowlStrom. Each character, a symbol in Hiragana, transforms into a creature of lore, challenging my linguistic skills and strategic prowess.

[h3]Gameplay: A Battle of Wits and Words[/h3]

The battles, set in the backdrop of my frosty domain, demand more than just brute strength; they require the intellect of a seasoned language warrior. As I progressed, my ice magic intertwined with the newly acquired language skills, adding a furry flair to every encounter. The game's RPG elements, from item collection to quest completion, are seamlessly integrated, making the learning process both immersive and exhilarating.

[u]Educational Value: More Than Just a Game[/u]

As an Ice Wolf, my journey through this game was more than a conquest; it was a quest for knowledge. The detailed instructions on reading and writing each Hiragana character were akin to ancient scrolls, unraveling the mysteries of the Japanese language. The visual and audio aids were not merely tools but guides, like the northern stars guiding sailors in the icy seas of HowlStrom.

[strike]Challenges and Quizzes: The Ice Wolf's Test of Knowledge[/strike]

The in-game challenges and quizzes were no mere obstacles; they were trials set by the elders of HowlStrom, testing my grasp of this exotic language. Each victory was not just a triumph in battle but a step closer to mastering Hiragana, bringing honor to my furry lineage.

[h2]Conclusion: A Howling Success in Language Learning[/h2]

""Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle"" is more than a game; it's a gateway to a new realm of understanding and cultural appreciation.

Hiragana Battle is a game developed by Sleepy Duck and released in March 2016 1. The game is an educational RPG that teaches players how to read and write Japanese characters (Hiragana) in a fun and engaging way 1. The game is set up like a classic 16-bit RPG, where you play as the protagonist who is learning Japanese from a teacher. The game has three chapters, and each chapter introduces a new set of characters to learn 1.

The game has several pros. It teaches Hiragana in bite-sized pieces, making it easy to learn and memorize. The game also has vocab lessons and basic grammar lessons that are helpful for beginners 1. The game’s use of repetition to help players remember Hiragana is also commendable 1. The game’s price point is also affordable, making it accessible to many people 1.

However, there are some downsides to the game. The music can be repetitive, and the storyline is not very interesting 2. The characters are not well-developed, which can make it difficult for players to become invested in them or the game 2. The game’s use of calligraphy-style Hiragana can also be confusing at times, as it doesn’t always match the font used in battle 2.

Overall, Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle is a great game for early or casual Japanese learners. It has its flaws but is still worth playing if you’re interested in learning Hiragana.

First to get the game part out of the way: it's a terrible video game. The plot is bad, the mechanics are bad, the interface is a hassle, and the type of game it is ultimately subtracts from its real goal.

As a tool to learn hiragana: I would not recommend using this as your sole or even main method. Because of the way the RPG enemies are each a hiragana, and therefore spawn in one location with one set of tasks, the game becomes a series of areas where you will be dealing with an extremely small subset of hiragana at a time. By the time you're learning ha/ho/fu/hi/he, you will never again see ka/ko/ku/ki/ke. You will also never have to draw the shapes. You will learn a small, seemingly random handful of words and grammar tips. There's a very strange escalation at the end of the game that feels like a surprise pop quiz on words, but otherwise you'll be fighting groups of 5-15 of the same enemy at any given time.

With all of that in mind, if you are using 1-2 other things to also learn hiragana and just want like a weird little experience that will ask you to remember some hiragana, this is fine. I'll probably still try the katakana one. I wanted it to be over about halfway through. My playtime is super overinflated by leaving the game running in the background while doing other things so I can't speak to the actual length, but it overstays its welcome. I thought that would be a strength, with JRPG grinding being the perfect excuse to spam hiragana practice, but because it's the same enemies in a given area, you sometimes just load the same fight you just fought and don't even have to think about what you're doing, because the characters still have the last thing you did selected.",1693243706,1694395317,False,9,0,0.546656668186187744,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Is such a good idea. I've dabbled with Japanese years ago, so this has helped me pick up things pretty quick. Re-learnt 35 symbols in 3 days. 

There are a couple of suggestions i have that would make this perfect though. I dont expect any to be implemented but id be remiss if i didnt mention them. 

1- I'd like the characters to move faster, particularly during a cut scenes, the characters move a little painfully slow. But also moving around in general. 

2- (The biggest issue i have) I'm not a fan of having to chose all the characters moves at once. Sometimes an enemy has perished (making a pre-chosen move a waste)  or a character has been injured and i need to instead heal or attack a different character than planned but cant. 
Or the main thing is having one enemy left with one hit left before being defeated. but you have to select a move for all 4 characters. This wastes a bit of time per battle that quickly starts to add up a fair bit when playing. Reducing the enjoyment of gameplay. 

I'd love it to let you choose an attack with each individual character when its their turn (like most turn based games) This would save a lot of time allowing me to fight more enemies in the same amount of time and therefore practice learning more. 

Great game though, i highly recommend.

The story is a bit silly, but not too bad. I wish there were a bit more variety on the ""classes"", like a mage would be nice, but that doesn't matter too much.

So, why a negative review? 
Beacuse while the idea is BRILLIANT, and works great in the start, at least for me, it quite quickly fell apart.
The combat works like this, the game plays like your basic RPGMaker game, however instead of normal enemies, you fight Hiragana, and the only way to damage them is by using ""Attacks"" that are their Romaji counterparts. So to attack ""が"" you would have to use ""Ga"", and so on. 
While this is a genius way to learn it, there is one VERY big problem with the execution...

Every single Hiragana, and Dakuon variant, have their own seperate Attack. 

This combined with that you have serveral characters, all of which you have to select the Attack with, means you'll be scrolling through Attacks more than you'll actually end up thinking and ""learning"", as your ""Attack"" list will be literally over 40 Attacks long. 

A few ways this could be solved would be...

1. You usually face a select number of different Hiragana per map, so one way would be if you simply only had access to the Romaji ""Attacks"" that would be relevant on that map. 

2. Again, since theres usually a select number of different Hiragana per map, some of the ""Attacks"" could contain 2-4 different Romaji, and then simply make sure most maps only contained a limited number of ones under the same attack. While this would still leave quite a few attacks, it would be easier to make than option 1 in regards to RPGMaker, and it would still cut the number of attacks and scrolling time in half, or more, which would be enough to make it feel worth the scrolling time.

If Option 2 would be too messy, to make sure everyone knew which Romaji it actually was, a way to make this easier would be to make the Hiragana's ""Take damage"" sprite show their Romaji, since you would only see if it you already hit it with the correct Attack. anyways.",1689891203,1689891203,False,2,0,0.498596608638763428,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I would say that the game is good for practising but not great at teaching the symbols very well. When I learned in school there were a lot of learning devices employed that made it easier to remember each symbol (for example: ""me"" is eye in japanese and the hiragana symbol for me looks like an eye, the symbol for a looks like an eye with a sword going through it so you remember it like ""ah! there's something in my eye""). I'm not sure how well I would have done had I not remembered all of those hints I learned as a kid. With that being said, if you have already learned the symbols, this game is really good for testing yourself instead of using flashcards.

Basicamente RPG por turno + aprender japonês... Oque é GENIAL, a melhor forma de aprender e memorizar algo é na base da repetição, e oque é melhor do que um RPG para utilizar a repetição e ser divertido ao mesmo tempo? A historia do jogo é simples mas divertida de ver: Um mago chamado Noburo tem o poder de criar guerreiros chamados ""Guerreiros Hiragana"" (Não preciso explicar que Hiragana é o primeiro alphabeto do japonês né?) que são indestrutiveis... Bem... Exceto se você souber o som que essas letras fazem. Após o mago destruir a vila da protagonista ela fica determinada a aprender japonês para impedir que Noburo cause mais destruição, nessa jornada tem uns mini plot twists aqui e ali então é... Para um jogo educacional a história é até que boa.

[h1] Perfeito para aprender do zero [/h1]

Se você mora em uma caverna e nunca teve contato com japonês na vida... [spoiler][strike] Recomendo você investir em uma casa [/strike][/spoiler] Esse jogo é perfeito para você... bem... se você souber inglês primeiro... Maaaaas ainda sim é um bom ponto de partida para se divertir e realmente decorar cada um das 46 letras japonesas do primeiro alfabeto. O jogo também ensina palavras e um pouco de gramatica no final do jogo, mas o real foco dele é introduzir ao idioma, ou seja, não espere sair falando japonês e assistir anime sem legenda logo depois de zerar... Mas você já vai conseguir ler algumas coisas uma vez que sabe o som que cada letra faz. Ainda há outros dois jogos na franquia que mostram os dois outros alfabetos e todos eles são necessários para o completo entendimento do idioma, mas decorar o primeiro alfabeto já é um grande passo para aprender japonês.

O jogo é realmente divertido então se você curte um bom e clássico RPG e quer aprender Japonês recomendo demais esse jogo.

My only quibbles are minor. I wish there were optional mini-games in order to practice vocabulary, and it would be nice if there were some for hiragana as well.

I used mainly duolingo and realkana.com to learn the hiragana characters while Hiragana Battle was a slower way to review them (which is sometimes a benefit). I would recommend trying those resources first before purchasing this game. real kana lets you select which kana you would like to review and if you know the kana you can go quite quickly with it. My initial impression of this game was much more positive when I started compared to later.

Pros:
-Works perfectly on the Steam deck - So could be great for offline on the go learning. If this is important to you, I would say it's worth playing probably.
-Kindof goofy charm in the story/characters
-Pretty good music that isn't too distracting
-decent art & graphics
- If you like turnbased JRPGs, the combat can be a bit fun. 

Cons:
-Introduces some things way too early. It teaches dakuten and hadakuten (characters that have slight differences that change their sound, like は vs ば) alongside the base characters, where I feel they are best learned later on and even help review the main characters that way. It also tries to teach you vocab alongside characters where really you should probably focus on your kana first. It even teaches you words it hasn't taught you all the characters for yet and at one point says something a bit misleading (which it explains the next lesson, but still.)
-The TTS voices aren't amazing (they get the job done though)

So all in all, I would recommend trying free resources first but if you find they aren't working for you personally, maybe this is worth a buy.",1682466671,1682466671,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Наверное, эта рецензия не будет совсем уж объективной, так как я уже сносно читал хирагану до запуска игры, поэтому мало чему научился. И сами битвы были преимущественно легкими по той же причине. Но мнение все же составил.

Удивительное.
У японских ролевых игр (JRPG) помимо своеобразного визуального стиля есть еще определенные законы игры. И один из них - гринд ради прокачки. Что удивительно и забавно, в плане обучения повторение наоборот является одним из краеугольных камней, так что можно смело говорить, кто конкретно в этой игре гринд оправдан. Что, однако, не избавляет игру от других неприятных особенностей, из-за которых я стараюсь обходить JRPG за километр. Например, нудной возни с параметрами и инвентарем, консольного подхода к управлению и условностей изображения битв. Последнее не так режет глаз здесь, так как сама идея сражения с абстрактными символами - уже условность. Другой интересный момент: даже зная хирагану идеально, вы можете проиграть из-за непродуманного подхода к прокачке и ресурсам. Потому что знание этой слоговой азбуки позволяет просто наносить урон, и дальше перед нами уже классическая JRPG битва. Исправляются авторы буквально на последней битве с главным боссом - там решают все исключительно знания языка, но и права на ошибку нет.

Плюсы.
- С основной своей задачей - зубрежкой хираганы - игра вполне справляется. Но я бы не сказал, что она подходит к этому творчески и задействует что-то помимо гринда.
- Из приятного - символы не только читаются как текст, но еще и озвучиваются, приводится начертание. Можно тренировать владение хираганой комплексно. Но в боях решает только текст, думаю, в силу ограничений самого движка. Порисовать мышкой и помычать в микрофон не дают.
- Основная часть игры - заучивание самой азбуки, но в конце дают немного разгуляться и со словами. Это воспринимается интереснее, но контента мало.

Минусы.
- В игре мало прав на ошибку. Ходы всей партии задаются наперед, а противнику обычно требуется больше одного удара, поэтому ошибка в интерпретации символа или слова приводит к пачке потерянных атак вместо одной. А если противника удается завалить меньшим числом ударов, оставшиеся в запасе ни к чему не приведут, так как не на ""свои"" символы они просто не действуют.
- Не дается никаких особых техник запоминания вроде ассоциативной памяти. А для меня это был ключевой инструмент в запоминании азбук. Без него все было бы гораздо сложнее.
- Монстры всегда нападают фиксированными партиями, из-за чего часто вас ждут однотипные сражения, а некоторые символы избегают зубрежки. При этом враги этими партиями появляются будто случайно. Я бы наверное привязал конкретных противников к узким местам согласно методическим рекомендациям.
- По той же причине игра почему-то не тренирует сложные случаи. Например, было бы классно сразиться с пачкой таких врагов сразу: われね. Или таких: ちきさ. Или даже таких: はまよほ. На повторных тестах я косячу именно в этих местах обычно.
- Символы дают и сразу проверяют в боях. А вот со словами не так. Их дают в течение всей игры и особо не контролируют запоминание. Но вдруг в финальных боях без этих знаний никуда. Так что да - я читерил в половине случаев.

В общем, как JRPG игра явно слабенькая и короткая (и на том спасибо). Как обучающий инструмент, она скорее подходит для повторения или сопутствующего изучения, нежели как основной источник знаний. Но сплав игровых и образовательных механик по крайней мере удался.",1680080429,1680080429,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

First, it is accessible to anyone, the game will never ask you do to something it didn't teach you.

The pixelarts and musics are nice, doesn't feel like a cheap game. The story is generic but who cares.

Note that it won't only teach you Hiragana but also quite a few vocabulary words and some very very basic grammar and sentences.

Apart from sprint turned off the main issue I had was lack of info on what the Hirigana character opponents do against you.

* Lack of basic stats on the enemy. Theres no encyclopedia of sorts in the game that records enemy stats before and after you defeat them.
* You dont know what skillsets the Hirigana opponent has and how much damage it does.
* Their targeting method seems to be random.
* The pattern on who gets to strike seems to be on who has the best stats in the fight?

Id appreciate the game more if the number of burst damage opponents are reduced and replaced with more skills that slowly drain your life per turn because whenever the player reaches a new level of the game they would face stronger opponents, and since the enemy's stats are definitely always higher they would always make the first blows resulting in heavy casualties despite the player getting all the answers correct. This results in repeatedly retreating all the way back to home base for replenishments until the your team slowly levels up to withstand atleast 5 fights or more before the area boss fight.

It was not challenging as I thought when it comes to damage numbers but all in all, you can learn fast because its a life or death scenario. Despite it all I had fun.

Besides Hiragana characters, the game also teaches about several everyday vocabulary, simple grammar lessons and some phrases that's being commonly used.

Tout d'abord, il faut le savoir, il s'agit d'un jeu réalisé sous RPG Maker. De manière peu étonnante, les mécaniques sont limitées et peu adaptées à l'apprentissage.

Mon constat sur 1h de jeu: des combats randoms, répétitifs et inintéressants, une sévère lenteur d'apprentissage, l'obligation d'utiliser feuille et crayon pour dessiner les syllabes (alors que les applications mobiles disposent parfois d'un outil pour tracer les symboles à l'écran), l'absence d'apprentissage de vocabulaire de base en parallèle du syllabaire... 

Personnellement, ce jeu m'a rappelé à quel point le japonais doit s'apprendre avec discipline et travail appliqué. On ne peut pas faire les choses à moitié. 

Quitte à utiliser une application, je recommande plutôt celles qu'on trouve sur mobile, qui permettent à la fois de tracer, lire, écouter, varier les activités, obtenir des conseils et disposer d'un minimum de culture (JA Sensei par exemple).",1673518885,1673518885,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,True,,,

it's a little clunky, enemy encounter rate can get pretty annoying, and going through the answers is a little slow late-game, but those can be chalked up to side-effects of being the first in a game series
it strikes a pretty good balance being educational and a game, and things change from time to time so it doesn't get too stale. something I appreciate is how the background always change to reflect exactly where you are even in battle, it makes battling feel more natural even though you're always getting jumped out of nowhere. there's also a lot of fun moments with your party mates and npcs, I really liked finding english learners in some areas
I like how things change late-game, and I really enjoyed the final boss
if you wanna learn hiragana and some vocabulary through this game I say go for it, with the constant battles the hiragana will probably be ingrained into your brain by the end of it, but you can always escape battles and save anywhere if you need a break (never skipping battles makes you quite hardy for the end of the game is what I found out though)

It has watered down mechanics from the original Final Fantasy, with the attacks being determined by your ability to recognize the hiragana characters. It's simple and effective, albeit a bit tiring after a while. It is a bit primitive (also similar to FF1) especially for a 2016 game, but really that didn't bother me at all. 

This game has the best writing I've ever seen in a Japanese language learning game. It's a genius work of ironic drama, where you cringe so hard that you can't help but laugh. This is the best work of satire that I have ever seen. (It is exactly as good as you would expect from an educational game.)

That aside, the story is as good as an educational story can be. Seriously, I could not imagine a story any better without leaving behind the point of the game, learning hiragana. But clearly it is not going to win any awards, story-wise. 

The soundtrack... was cool for the first few hours. Then it was a bit annoying up until the final boss fight. The tracks are not bad, but they are reused a lot. Though really none of the sound is necessary (except maybe the syllable pronunciations), so you could just mute it. However, after listening to the same tracks for hours, the new music for the final boss seemed all the more rad.

Speaking of the final boss fight. It was good. Relative to the rest of the game, it was excellent. It had a cool song, a relatively sufficient challenge, and it caught me a bit off guard (which is good). 

All in all, it is an okay game, and quite a good learning tool.

Super cute ad it's exactly what the title says, a little game that teaches you hiragana, some phrases and vocabulary. Your clichee RPG game which doesn't take away its charm. Sometimes the game is a bit self-conscious like on the clichee RPG parts or with your generic character personalities. You don't have to be a gamer to make it through the game. Game mechanics are all well explained or intuitive.

I just love it when games can also be educational. It is can be greatly implemented as a new learning tool (that is as of yet still underrated) since you are forced to repeat words or hiragana in order to proceed. Great job to the creators and I am glad that this kickstarter made it as a full version onto Steam! Little tip: finish all side quests in order to make a horse appear that will tell you a cute/helpful little thing. Might as well check out the homepage that they advertise for more resources, art-books and such. (I am not paid or anything to say this I genuienly am convinced as a consumer that the stuff they put out is good.)

Not sure if Steam Cloud works with the save files so just in case backup your saves by going into the game folder under your steam folder. Or just browse local game files via the Steam interface. There is a folder called saves. Make sure to just copy the whole thing.

EDIT: For people that use 120 (approx. 140 Hz) fps monitors the game will appear incredibly fast. Couldn't find a fix for that. Maybe if you temper with some config files you'll be able to lock it at 60 fps. Disclaimer: I did not change any files at all.

The good:
It's dirt cheap, especially on sale.
This game covers all hiragana characters, some basic vocabulary and touches on a few cultural points as well.
The old school turn-based combat should be familiar to anyone who's ever played RPGs like Final Fantasy.

The meh:
Loot could've been better and there could've been more of it.
The music and graphics are typical RPGmaker. Not bad, but nothing special.
The story is pretty silly, but as a framework for study, it gets the job done.

The bad:
I was honestly surprised at how punishing and tedious the combat is in the late game. You're unlikely to be able to handle 2-3 encounters before slinking back to an inn to recharge. This led me to run away from a lot of random encounters just to finish my quests, which meant later I had to grind more than I wanted to.
There are also some frustrating combat mechanics. For example, in Final Fantasy, if you use two characters to target one enemy, and your first attack ends up killing them, the second attack will reorient to the nearest surviving enemy. Not so here, that second attack ends up being wasted.
Finding the correct answers from a huge list of possible characters during combat isn't really that fun, to be honest. I wish there had been another way.

Verdict:
As a language teacher myself (and someone who has spent 15 years in Japan), I'd say it's a decent tool for beginners learning Japanese, and it's a cheap way to practice. But the game as a game leaves much to be desired.",1656422926,1656423522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Плохой баланс, где нужно хоть немного да погриндить (буквально час, может меньше), а то и пару боёв не выстоишь, сюжет посредственный, нету кнопки выхода из игры (что?). Саунд в городе и в меню игры такой, что очень быстро приедается и начинает негативные эмоции вызывать. Да, здесь в зависимости от локации меняются мелодии, но в целом посредственные. Боевка, на мой взгляд, даже смотря на то, что это JRPG, однообразная, умения практически не используешь. Сайд квесты слабые и по типу ""возьми-принеси"".

НО, это если смотреть на игру как развлекательную, в которую ты играешь для получения эмоций. Теперь я бы хотел рассказать об игре как обучающую, в которой ты учишь новое.
Данная игра, на мой взгляд, в целом неплохая для того, чтобы начать изучать японский и её систему писания, в этой части Хирагану. Тут нас проводят по каждому символу, рассказывают как правильно его произносить и как писать. Помимо этого пополняют наш словарный запас и учат простым, но полезным фразам по типу ""Меня зовут ..."". В то же время сайд квесты дополнительно дают нам новый материал для изучения. Из минусов я выделю момент, где учат писать символ. Мне показалось неудобным, что при анимации написания используется один шрифт, а после неё другой шрифт, приходилось мне несколько раз пересматривать. Можно, как вариант, было показывать оба шрифта: зацикленную анимацию написания одним шрифтом и другой шрифт. Ещё не понравилось, что был слишком тихий голос произношения символов/слов/фраз при том что музыка громко, а в настройках кнопки уменьшения громкости этой музыки я не нашёл, хотя вариантов там было много. Так же условно говоря через пару глав символы, что ты изучил, начинают очень редко попадаться и из-за этого можешь понемногу начинать их забывать.

Katakana War and I will be positively reviewing that game when I'm done with it.[/b]

[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b]: I played 16 hours on PC, but then I copied the game to my phone and used JoiPlay to play it since it's an RPGMaker game. I have 24 hours in total as of writing this review. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cyou.joiplay.joiplay&hl=en_US&gl=US

I did not read keyofw's review (https://steamcommunity.com/id/keyofw/recommended/438270/) before writing a draft of my own, but we share many of the same points.

1. No Vocalization when Selecting Sounds

In Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War, attacking with katakana plays the sound of that katakana. In Kanji Combat, when you select a kanji, it plays the kun'yomi or on'yomi of the kanji. This is fantastic game design because every battle reinforces these sounds and you begin to associate the sounds with the kana.

This game does not do that. The only time it plays the sounds of each character is during the lessons. Since the sounds are already in the game, it shouldn't take the developers that much time to have the players play each hiragana sound when attacking.

2. List of Hiragana Attacks is Unintuitive

In Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War/Kanji Combat, there are 5 kana on each row. The game should have had something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana#/media/File:Table_hiragana.svg

Instead it's:

a i
u e
o ka
ki ku
ke ko
ga gi
gu ge
go sa
shi su
se so
za ji
zu ze
zo ta
chi tsu
te to
da ji (d)
zu (d) de
...

You get it, it's a PAIN to scroll all the way up and all the way down. They should have used 10 columns with the dakuten and ん in rows below the main hiragana.

3. ん was not taught first

There are many words in the vocabulary that the game cannot properly teach you because it didn't introduce the most basic Hiragana, ん, first, but rather last. For instance, it taught that senpai is し-n-か-n-せ-n. No one is going to go back and actually re-learn/re-read the proper hiragana you're just going to have to learn it by hearing the word.

4. Hiragana enemies are not randomized

As keyofw pointed out, the groups of hiragana warriors are predefined instead of truly being randomized. Each group has the same hiragana so there's a weigh as to which hiragana you'll see most more than others, which leaves you with blind spots for the hiragana you see the least.

5. English enemies only show up twice

Reverse enemies only show up twice, once in the coffins and once on the boat. There should have been reverse enemies for EVERY stage of the game! I got very, very good at clicking ぬ nu, ね ne, no の, but if I just saw ""ne"" I couldn't actually picture ね in my head.

6. Small Gameplay Issues - Items and Map

You have to buy a mirror for a sidequest alongside several other items once you reach Tokyo, and none of the items seem to have a purpose other than you're supposed to guess which one is a mirror? It would have been better if each item had a purpose and then you'd have a need to memorize what the name of each one was. Doubly so, Ramune and other items should have been called Ramune (らむね) as a way of getting you used to the Hiragana characters before you encounter them.

When you leave Snowmass Village, you leave from the top but your characters spawn at the bottom, so if you hold down the Up button you just infinitely go in and out of the town. Several other locations are like this and just a complete pain to get in and out of, like Tokyo and Mt. Fuji.

7. The Plot Was Lacking

Without spoiling anything, what was the dynamic between Noburo and his sister? What were their individual objectives? If Noburo had said, ""I want to make the world fear and hate hiragana!"" that would have been more convincing as a bad guy. Or it would have been even better if he said, ""I've been sent by Japan to conquer your country!"" and then you find out once you travel to Japan that he's a lone actor. Basically could have made it where Noburo is carrying out false flag attacks and you have to prevent war by revealing it. Instead you get... *spoiler*.

8. No ""Castle""/""Treehouse"" or Endgame Content

Once again, in Katakana War/Kanji Combat, there is a a castle/treehouse where you can battle it out with all of the kana that you've encountered this far. This is NOTHING close to this in Hiragana Battle. There's no place where you can test your skill against each and every single hiragana that you've encountered. The best you get is Grim Tower where you fight whole words. The first level or two of the Grim Tower should have been random assortments of hiragana. I found that once I finished learning all of them, I started to forget all of the k-, g- s-, and z- hiragana, or confuse them for each other. I could have used a refresher towards the end.

Also, not all of the vocab words even show up in the Grim Tower.

Lastly, after you defeat Noburo, if you climb back to the top of The Grim Tower you cannot face him in combat again to test your knowledge of words, and your four spirtes are stuck on the top floor like doppelgangers. The game also deletes all items from your inventory (but not weapons or armor). Clearly bugs and quite depressing. I'm glad I didn't override my save from right before I beat him.

[hr][/hr]

tl;dr: If you want to learn Hiragana, grab a book and write each character once a day for several days while verbalizing them. You will learn Hiragana very quickly, much faster than playing this game.

This game has potential, but after 6 years it very badly needs an update. The audio files for each hiragana are already in the game so the devs could fix that, and they could also fix the UI to allow better selection of hiragana.

For those who say this is too much criticism for a $7 game, this game is for all intents and purposes a prequel to Katakana Battle and Kanji Combat, and should be played before the other two, so I have to review this game.",1653088512,1673128653,False,16,0,0.64826357364654541,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1] Story [/h1] Ein böser Japanischer Magier namens ""Noburo"" hat mit Hilfe von Portalen seine Hiragana Krieger auf unser Land losgelassen und die einzige Möglichkeit Noburo und seine Schergen aufzuhalten, ist es japanisch zu lernen, spezifisch ""Hiragana"" das japanische Alphabet

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Man kann dieses Spiel wirklich gut nutzen um tatsächlich Hiragana zu lernen. Zudem lernt man auch einige Grund Vokabeln & Sätze aus dem Japanischen. Alles wird sehr gut und verständlich erklärt, allerdings alles auf Englisch, also wenn man mit der Englischen Sprache nicht wirklich klar kommt dann bringt es hier gar nichts. Wir lernen nach und nach die Einzelnen Buchstaben/Zeichen. Es ist auch sehr wichtig das man sich alles notiert, denn sonst wird es schwierig werden voran zu kommen. Nach jeder Lerneinheit, werden wir irgendwo hingeschickt um die Quelle der Hiragana Krieger zu finden und Noburo aufzuhalten. Die Kämpfe sind Random Encounter und alle Gegner sind Hiragana Zeichen, diese können wir nur besiegen, wenn wir den richtigen Englischen Buchstaben oder manchmal auch andersrum (Gegner sind Englische Buchstaben und wir müssen dann das jeweilige Hiragana Zeichen auswählen). Gegen Ende des Spiels müssen wir diese mit Sätze bekämpfen bzw. übersetzen. Man kann natürlich auch ganz JRPG typisch, neue Waffen und auch Ausrüstung für seine 4 Party Member finden & auch kaufen um sie stärker werden zu lassen. Es gibt auch einige simple Nebenquests zu lösen. Wenn man diese gelöst hat, bringt der Auftraggeber/in uns Neue Wörter bei. Musik ist ordentlich wie immer bei diesen RPGMaker spielen

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Story OK
+ Musik ordentlich
+ Nette Einführung wenn man Hiragana und/oder Japanisch allgemein lernen möchte
+ Es wird verständlich erklärt (aber nur in Englisch)
+ Einige Nebenquests wodurch man Neue Japanische Wörter lernen kann
+ Netter Endboss Kampf
+ Sammelkarten
+ Xbox 360 Controller Support

- Leider keine Achievements
- Bei solchen Lern/Bildungsspielen wäre es schöner wenn man mehrere Sprachen als nur Englisch hätte

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein wirklich sehr schönes Lern/Bildungsspiel gemischt mit einem JRPG. Mir hat es sehr gut gefallen. Man muss sich natürlich für die Japanische Sprache oder Japan allgemein interessieren um hiermit Spaß haben zu können aber warum sollte man es kaufen/spielen wenn man es nicht lernen möchte, das wäre ja merkwürdig. Ich persönlich interessiere mich sehr für Japan und kannte auch einige Wörter/Sätze bereits. Wer lust hat zu lernen, der ist mit diesem Spiel gut bedient weil hier alles schön & verständlich erklärt wird und durch das JRPG Setting lernt man auch schneller bzw. intensiver weil man ja voran kommen will. Ich kann es also jedem Empfehlen der sich für Japanische Sprache interessiert und es immer schon einmal lernen wollte. Dieses Spiel ist ein sehr netter Einstieg

-ho più di 25 minuti poiché ho giocato quasi due ore da un mio amico 

-ho giocato questo gioco più per consigliarlo che per usarlo poiché so già a memoria sia l'Hiragana che anche il Katakana, inoltre conosco una buona quantità di caratteri Kanji. 

questo gioco ha solo una ed un unica funziona, ovvero insegnare nel modo più semplice (ed anche divertente) per imparare l'alfabeto più importante giapponese, ovvero l'hiragana. 

il gioco è fatto in rpg maker e ha una trama e una grafica assolutamente mediocri. 

il gameplay invece ammetto che è interessante, in breve si riassume in un viaggio dove i nostri nemici sono dei caratteri in Hiragana e l'unico modo per sconfiggerli è sapere a quale lettera dell'alfabeto internazionale corrisponde (o Romanji per i più precisini). 

devo dire che per il suo scopo ci riesce alla perfezione, riesce a rendere immersiva l'avventura e l'insegnamento di questo fantastico alfabeto molto divertente, apprezzo inoltre che hanno inserito anche i dakuten e le varie combinazioni.

consiglio il gioco solo e solamente a chi vuole imparare l'Hiragana,

I've been playing it for a few days. The only thing I wish is if it reads you the text instead of you reading it like it does when it reads you the letters, especially for someone like me who reads under average, this can slow me down a little bit when actually playing, I also don't like reading and prefer more visuals like a Disney movie or video games. So, I can't be in a class setting for learning a language (I already tried Spanish for a day in school, LOL) That didn't work, luckily, I got removed. The other thing I noticed in the game is that when it brings you to Japan which is normal when you go into Japan in real life (so that is understandable) is that it shows you Japanese words that have not been taught yet. So, I can't even buy them in the convenience store for not knowing what it is, LOL. That is how far I got into the game. 🙂

I also have a bad memory but hopefully one day I can fully read the language. I know most hiragana. But I have difficulties with katakana so far and I haven't even looked at Kanji yet. Learning it over and over again will help. It will also help if you surround yourself with the language especially from what you already know and take little steps at a time.

Like the JRPGs that inspired Hiragana Battle's gameplay, it can get tedious when walking through dungeons. Triggering encounters every few steps when you just want to explore/leave can be frustrating. The advantage Hiragana Battle has over other JRPGs is being able to tell yourself that you're learning from the infuriating frequency of the fights. You're going to know these Hiragana characters reeaaalllyyyy well! (Admittedly, this is undermined on the occasions when you get the exact same group of enemies multiple times in a row and just input the same response without thinking.)

A flaw in Hiragana Battle's turn-based system is having to choose every party member's actions at the beginning of the round, which prevents you from reacting to unforeseen events. For example, a particular enemy might be defeated more quickly than you expected, so one of your characters might end up looking like a right plonker by trying to attack them. It's easy to work with the system though because the fights are simple and therefore predictable, which I expect is intentional since this is a learning tool. The battles have some basic JRPG elements like status effects to keep it interesting, but the overall simplicity keeps your focus on recalling Hiragana characters rather than strategising.

Making the game engaging without distracting you from studying is well balanced throughout. The main storyline provides the motivation for your quest but it's basic enough that you will stay focused on your studies rather than pondering the plot. The game has fun locations to explore, side quests to complete and NPCs to chat to, and the majority of these contribute to your Japanese learning - which includes some beginner vocabulary and grammar as well as Hiragana. All the study materials and opportunities to practise are well integrated into the gameplay, and you are able to revisit them as much as you need to. I love studying Japanese this way :)

- I didn't complete this game. I think I got about halfway in? For anyone that's played it (very minor spoiler), [spoiler]I got to the part just before you leave on the boat to Japan.[/spoiler]

- I already knew hiragana before playing this game. Why even play this game then do you ask? Because I'm still a complete newb in my journey of learning Japanese. I thought this game would be a good way to help me continue to memorise hiragana. I also heard the game teaches some vocabulary, not just hiragana, which it does.

- I will mostly be reviewing this title from the viewpoint of it primarily being a learning tool, rather than a game. But I will touch on its actual gameplay value a bit as well.

Anyhow, now we've gotten that out of the way, let's get onto the actual review.

[h1]How effective is this game for learning hiragana?[/h1]

Everyone learns things differently; some methods may be more effective for some people, and those same methods may prove nightmarish to others. So it's always kind of hard to grade just how effective a certain learning tool or method is, because some people may find it difficult, others may find it enjoyable and easy to understand.

This being a review and all, I'll be judging its effective based on my own opinions and experiences. So your mileage may vary.

The way the game teaches you hiragana is primarily by showing you a character, describing how it's pronounced (accompanied by a rather robotic voice), and how to draw it. The game seems to expect you to be actually physically drawing these characters into a notepad as you go along.

I personally do NOT think this is an effective way of learning hiragana. I personally found it a lot easier to grasp by having mnemonics associated with each character, and using a SRS (spaced repetition system) with flashcards to drill into my head how each character was pronounced. I used a site called Tofugo for this, though there's probably other sites that have mnemonics for each hiragana character, or you can maybe even come up with some of your own if you've imaginative enough.

If you're unsure what a mnemonic is or want a visual example, then picture this: The hiragana し (shi) looks a bit like a [shi]eld, with an arm sticking out the right, holding it up.

But pushing aside my own views on what's the ""best"" way to learn and memorise hiragana, there's some issues with how the game presents its hiragana lessons.

First of all, as I already mentioned, it plays a very robotic voice to give you an audio demonstration of how each hiragana is pronounced. It can actually be quite hard to understand at times, sometimes it says things far too quickly, and being robotic, it just doesn't really sound natural.

Secondly, it displays a different font when showing writing animations for the hiragana. This can be confusing, especially when some characters look different as a result. For example, り is shown being written with a break at the top. Think of it like the number 4 when written with an open top (like on an old school calculator). It's not incorrect, but it can be a bit jarring for a complete beginner, especially since it doesn't explain these differences at all.

Thirdly, the game does teach you some vocab along with hiragana. A lot of this is learnt via doing side quests, which you can completely ignore if you so choose. My main issue with them though, is that a lot of them just give you the romaji translations for these words. Which isn't terrible early on, but the sooner you can actually read these Japanese words in their native characters, even if it is just in hiragana (as opposed to kanji), the better.

And finally, when the game does teach you some vocabulary in the mandatory, non-optional side quests part of the game, it has a weird tendency to teach you words with characters it hasn't already taught you. So いぬ (inu) will become い-nu. It feels very unnatural and I don't really know why they decided to do this. Maybe this is just a personal pet peeve more than anything though.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

This is a cookie cutter RPG maker game. The game on its own, judging it simply from the viewpoint of it being a game is... Not very good. You have several atrocious looking maze areas, a rather high rate of random encounters, generic music, art and presentation, a lacklustre plot and characters, rather boring combat, and frequently having to back track through an area to get something you couldn't get previously until the game told you you can.

A lot of this can be forgiven because, at the end of the day, the game itself is just a tool to teach. The main focus is not the game itself after all, but it is [b]still[/b] a game, so it's hard to ignore all its misgivings, especially once you've already logged a single digit hours into the game.

Anyway, as aforementioned, the game tries to reinforce the hiragana it teaches you in its lessons through the battles you face in random encounters. The concept is simple: You see a hiragana warrior that corresponds with the English translation NA (for example), so you browse through a catalogue of these hiragana translations, select the correct one, select the correct warrior and bam, you can deal damage to it. Get it wrong? You do zero damage.

How it usually works is: The game teaches you a set of hiragana characters, and then thrusts you into a new area where you have to do something or other, maybe defeat a boss at the end, and like any standard ol' RPG with random encounters, you'll encounter battles throughout these areas. The enemy hiragana warriors in each area usually correspond to the most recent hiragana you've learnt.

I did encounter a very glaring problem with this though. The ""enemies"" in random encounters seem to be preset groupings. I thought at first maybe it was coincidence but it happened far too many times for that to be the case. Say you encounter a group of へ, は and ぴ hiragana characters... But then you encounter this exact same grouping, in the same order no less, in the next battle, or maybe the next battle after. This becomes a recurring problem, and it often ends up you just mashing the exact same buttons you did in a previous encounter, in the exact same order, over and over.

This becomes kinda old, kinda fast. And with how frequent the random encounters were, sometimes entering a battle every 3 steps, and the game loves to waste your time with its horrible twisty maze areas that you have to navigate almost in their entirety if you want all the chests, you will be encountering the same groupings of hiragana over, and over, and over. It didn't even feel like I was really looking at the hiragana and recalling their English translations after a time, it was just going through the motions of clicking these same ""attacks"" (the English translations) on the same characters and then moving onto the next encounter within the next 5 seconds.

It became so tedious that I ended up dropping the game. I didn't really feel like I was learning anything any more, and certainly wasn't have any fun. This is my primary reason for the negative review.

[h1]Conclusion/Should I buy this?[/h1]

If you're interested in this game because you're looking for a fun game or a fun way to learn Japanese, you'll probably find yourself very disappointed (especially on the former by itself).

If you're looking for ""fast"" ways to learn hiragana, then definitely steer clear of this game. And if everything else I've described about it doesn't appeal to you, then that's another reason to probably avoid this one.

If what I described about how the game teaches you DOES appeal to you, then definitely check it out, but it goes on sale a lot, for dirt cheap, so I recommend buying it during one of its many discounts.",1647029839,1647030277,False,5,0,0.516516506671905518,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game has all the basics to teach you how to read and type hiragana.
I highly recommend you take pen and paper and start taking notes on them, writing them and how to pronounce them to help memorize them. Do NOT look at your notes when fighting hiragana, learn by practice and error.

Some things I did not like is when the game shows you new vocabulary with letters that have not been explained yet and when it shows you words in hiragana that are not typed actually in hiragana but in katakana. Yes, you can read them in hiragana but it is not correct and may lead to future confusion. Of course you will not know which ones are them if you don't know katakana.

Other than that the game is fun, I personally enjoyed reading the shop items in hiragana and translating them on my own. (You will find these shops when you travel somewhere else, to avoid spoilers...)

A few items that I did find frustrating: 
[list][*]There's no way to skip reviews, so if you want to replay it, you'll have to sit through the tutorials again.
[*]Having to lock in responses for the round: When my characters were on the cusp of being able to one-shot hiragana, it was frustrating to have them take it out, and then the next character to do no damage because they had to whack a character that they hadn't been locked in on. Could have possibly been circumvented by just doing a general lock/identification of each hiragana, and if it was correct, the characters did damage in sequence. 
[*]Written vs. font character styles: When doing the writing practice, you can see the stroke order animation, which is great, but in cases where the typed font and written styles differ (example: き　or ふ), I wish that they would keep the written style on the screen while you are practicing so you can compare without having to continue to click the animation. There was tons of free space on the screen, so they could have been side-by-side.
[*]Choosing words that should be presented in katakana. The game does acknowledge that words like ""coffee"" and ""pen"" should be in katakana, and wouldn't be written in hiragana. It would be better to not select those particular vocab words for this game at all, in that case.

[spoiler] After writing the whole opinion - so that was a lie [/spoiler]
After a month, I still have problems with reading Hiragana (e.x. sometimes misreading na with ra and vice versa; ya/yu not entirely remembered).
17 A5 pages. The worst thing here, probably, is pretty often break from train of thoughts. If you want to revise and bring the material to perfection, you should choose fights with Hiragana warriors. Concept of that kind of learning is really promising. Even mildly distracted, you may achieve a lot, but it's still too slow.
Fight (slow, btw.) -> over a dozen of seconds to meet another enemy -> maybe the same enemies (RNG in this game sux).

In 1-5 scale it lands in middle.
3/5
I know that this engine is quite old so I do not blame developer/s for that, but I don't get at least two things.
  1st: You have ""items"" to revise lessons (1-10) - why can't you use them during the fight. You have to lose/flee  from the battle to revise them, right? And because of that, I used them only once - to check them. They weren't even complete (didn't have handwriting revision or how to spell them - either one).
  2nd: Developer/s didn't have problem with putting 15 characters into one lesson, but did have problem with 6 characters, so they've been splitted to two lessons (9/10 lesson). At the end, you just want to finish the game so it would be nice to have w-'s, y-'s and n together.
  3rd: Alternative world parts are too short and you cannot return to them. The problem I'm having is that I can mostly read hiragana, but writing (you're already thinking in Romaji so it goes from Romaji to Hiragana) is pain and it requires more thinking/concentration from me than only reading Hiragana.

As far as I see, it took me 17,7h to complete the game (but I spent some time AFK so maybe 16-17h total)",1638464445,1638464445,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You're not required to write things down (although it may be helpful to jog your memory); you'll get plenty of practice far more than running into Zubats in caves on a Gameboy Pokemon game. There is a short storyline that guides you through what you will be dealing with, and so far it really just covers the basics of the kana and gives you a few words to learn. It does not, whether for better or for worse, go over all of the basics of grammar, beyond the few examples. That's just for informative purposes.

For me as a beginner, it wasn't stressful to learn, and thanks to the drilling in game, I was still able to manage it through the end. Mistakes and the combat become more forgivable with practice. In what it was lacking, I was able to find more practice from outside resources and be comfortable with reading the kana. I'd expect the same across the other 2 kanas, and combine that knowledge to be better at the language.

With that being said, for a beginner, this is a decent introduction to the language. It's simple, short, and to the point. While that can come with some caveats, there is no demand for high pace.

This first title is dedicated to Hiragana, which makes sense since it’s the foundation and most basic system of the 3, so the best starting point.
As an educational tool, it’s alright, but isn’t enough by itself. It guides the player in using a notebook for writing the characters and corresponding romaji, while gradually introducing the characters in lessons spread throughout the game. It teaches you how to write them, and the sound associated with them. Thing is, you’ll probably look at the notes a lot, which doesn’t help much with memorizing. For effective learning, you need other tools and find your own learning pace, but I suppose the game is limited in what it can do. It does what it can. It also teaches you some vocabulary and other rules, but they’re even worse because they’re barely used in-game, they’re mostly exposition.
As a game, unfortunately, it’s a generic RPG-maker title. The only main difference in combat is that there’s no generic attack. Instead, you need to answer with the correct romaji that matches the enemy Hiragana character. But that’s the main mechanic of the game to teach you. Sometimes it will reverse the matching, and only at the end you need to answer with words. Combat is repetitive, but I suppose it helps you memorize through repetition. It’ll get annoying though, especially because the random encounter rate is too high. You can escape most encounters at least. Everything else is just meh. There’re abilities and items you’ll rarely use, weapons and armor with stronger stats over time, generic dungeons with generic loot, and an alright story that lasts around 10 hours. At least there’re some side quests, but they’re nothing special. They teach you some more stuff though. As an RPG, it’s nothing you haven’t played before, the only difference is replacing generic attacks with answers. No, it’s even worse, because it lacks other elements, like AOEs and status effects on enemies (they’re only applied on the party), so combat lacks variety. It feels lackluster overall.
All combined, while I can see the potential of creating a game that is simultaneously a teaching tool, it lacks in both areas. In the teaching I guess it can’t improve much further. But as a game it could’ve been much more and be something more engaging. Still, I like the idea, and it’s engaging. And since it’s something I haven’t seen before, I can recommend it for cheap if you want to get introduced to the Japanese language and writing system. I would give it a neutral review, if possible, but I was entertained by it, and I’ve played worse before.

If you are just starting out learning Japanese and you're finding hiragana to be a barrier, you can't do much better than this game which turns something daunting into something fun. 

However, if you already know hiragana, I can only recommend this game with some reservations. I'm at the intermediate level, so for me it was far too basic to be educational. That said, it's a charming game with calming music and nostalgic pixel-art visuals similar to early Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest. It's not as mechanically good as those games though. The battle system is really clunky, and the encounter rate is ridiculously high, to the point where I began escaping from most of the battles. Playing this way caused me to complete the game in just under 7 hours.

I do wish the game had ramped up the language-learning elements much more significantly. For example, it could have taught a lot more vocabulary and changed the dialogue entirely to Japanese when you get to Japan, which would have made sense thematically and been more educational. I also wish it hadn't taught words in hiragana that should be in katakana, since that could instill some bad habits in first time learners.

And, the emphasis of hiragana stroke order with animations is excellent.  I love how it explains using particles, such as WA is written as HA and E is written as HE.

Also, the study or Japanese words was great.

My only complaint is that the game makes learning a bit clumsy.  On the other hand, I was able to complete the game in 3 days. And, this game punishes you for not getting the translations right. So, it forced me to learn the hiragana characters that I have always struggled with.

Now, I am moving on to Katakana and Kanji versions of the game. Those ones are much more difficult for me!

I thought that I'd need to know the basics before diving in, and it turns out this game really is for beginners with little to no knowledge at all of Hiragana. For that reason, because I pre-loaded with my own studies beforehand, I'm not planning on continuing the game, but I do intend to start the others (Katakana and Kanji) before I get into those lessons through other source material. I managed to snag all three on sale, so it was somewhere around $5 for the three games, so I'm really not upset that I'm dropping this one.

Overall, if you are just starting out, it seems like a great game. The RPG seems a bit slow, and since it starts out at the [i]very[/i] beginning of Hiragana, I wish there was some sort of proficiency test to speed the story along to where I wanted to be rather than relearning the basics all over again. When the villain showed up and I understood the very basic greeting and parting that he gave, laughing maniacally the entire time that I couldn't understand his strange speech, I knew I was in for a bit of frustration. The lessons are neat, but I wish they didn't have such fancy letters for us to copy and something more modern, because I'm certainly not using a brush, so the brush strokes don't need to be there. There are a lot of battles in order to progress the story, and that's all well and good if I needed the lessons. Since I didn't, I found it tedious and I don't want to sink my time into trying to catch up to what I need to learn. Perhaps a training area to test your skills before you set out so you can just pick up where you need to be rather than walk here, walk back, walk over there, walk back, learn a new lesson, walk around some more and face soooo many encounters because you have to trigger each next step before the next lesson.

I'm giving this a recommended rating [b]FOR BEGINNERS[/b] or for people who need the opportunity to drill the sounds.

Right now it is 90% off so I've bought this game at less than a dollar with 10+ hours of gameplay, its definitely worth the money if you are seriously keen to learn Hiragana as the game element makes it engaging even for a lazy person like me :P

[h1] What to expect from this game: [/h1]
-[b]In this game, you will learn the equivalent of ""ABCs""[/b] and thereafter you will learn to form words with it
They will teach you so&so character stands for C, so&so character stands for A, so&so character stands for T so eventually you will be able to form words e.g. C+A+T = CAT

- This game will teach you how to write and pronounce the Hiragana characters

- I've learnt about 71 Hiragana characters and 70+ nouns

Last but not least, It is an introductory to Hiragana characters so you wont immediately be proficient in speaking or understanding Japanese, nevertheless they have thrown in some common phrases & vocab / nouns  so there's other takeaways from it ^_^

Also, I think there was a bit of a missed opportunity with the vocabulary section: learning only words that could be composed with the characters already learnt at that point would have been nice. But, considering I did not expect to get any vocabulary with this at all, I am still impressed. The gameplay and plot are quite basic but enjoyable enough to keep me coming back to learn (or refresh in my case) the next batch of characters, which is kind of the whole point. I was glad for the little side quests, which add just a bit of variety (and vocab). I have used it as a refresher, and I think that made it a little less interesting for me (knowing the characters already makes you want to skip the battles quite often), but I would totally recommend this as a learning tool for someone who is starting out with Hiragana. Probably not best on its own, but definitely as a complementary tool. The tips on how to write the characters that are given during the lessons were very nice and I had not seen that before on other learning tools I have used.

I wanted to get to a point in the game where I can go against the Japanese words, because that's what I wanted to learn from this game the most, but that was so far out of reach for me. It just felt slow trying to get to that point, so I just dropped the game. One flaw I recognize is that no matter how well you recognize the first batch of kana during that section, it will still come after you with a high encounter rate, which is annoying, because you already know it at this point! and sometimes they would paralyse you to where you can't even answer that kana. Paralysis in this game sucks, and it's a terrible thing to add in a learning RPG game if you're familiar with it already.

A kind of reluctant recommendation here - the battle system is very basic, the way you select your attack would seem much more intuitive if they were set out in a table rather than two long lists, the levels are small and the encounter rate is correspondingly high (so if you're going from one end of a shack to the other you'll have five or six battles while crossing the room - only to be sent back to the side you came from, and *then* sent back and forth and back again, resulting in thirty or so battles just to get through one room).  Even getting all the attacks correct, the small amounts of damage taken adds up to you running out of healing items and MP if you use them.  Every time you visit the shop you've got to go through the same dialog on entering and leaving.  

HOWEVER... the repetition does help you learn, which is the point of the game.  And it provides a teaching tool that no-one else seems to provide - I can't say ""play [x] instead"" as there isn't any real alternative.  There are welcome little moments of humor.   You can just escape battles if you want - though that defeats the learning-by-repetition aspect of the game.

从头玩到尾的话可以记住全部的平假名，如果还做了所有的任务的话，还能学会150个左右的常用日语单词和句子。

游戏里的战斗机制是选择正确的平假名发音才能对怪物造成伤害，由于要刷钱、做任务，以及走各种迷宫推进剧情，所以游戏里的战斗数量很大，只要不跳过太多的战斗，[b]通关游戏后不仅能记住这些平假名，而且还能对平假名较为快速地辨识。[/b]

最终boss战不是选择平假名，而是从那一百多个常用单词选择正确的意思，可惜这部分比较短，因此那些单词记得就没平假名牢固了。

游戏虽然只有英语，但是难度很低，基本初高中生水平就能看懂大部分剧情了。考虑到游戏曾经多次进包，只要两三元的价格就能入手，性价比很高，[b]对于想学日语，但是怕枯燥 怕自己记不住的人，这个游戏绝对是个很好的选择。[/b]

Chiaramente non va misurato con il metro del videogioco, nessuno giocherebbe Learn Japanese to Survive per puro diletto, benché non sia terribile in assoluto.

I absolutely recommend this game for those who are learning Japanese. I'd suggest you learn a bit about Hiragana first, as once you're thrown into battle, it gets REAL.

And the ""battle"" system really drills each character into you over and over as you get deeper and deeper into the game, especially as points between lessons get longer and longer.
It also does a good job in teaching you some keywords in Japanese, but most of these words are written in Romanji (English, but written as it's meant to be pronounced in Japanese; which you can listen to until you are able to parrot it back, if needed, when you first learn each word, like each character,)

* I liked the soundtrack

Cons:
* The level design is annoying most of the time (although I liked the two temples near the end of the game)
* Always fighting the same groups of Hiragana warriors in one dungeon makes you remember the groups not the characters. Some variation would have been great (Especially in the dungeon after I learned や、ゆ and よ) and I would have liked to fight Hiraganas from previous lessons more often.

I am reviewing this as someone who now has memorised all hiragana, and I started with this game, that being said, I think this is not a good tool to learn hiragana, but instead to further memorise what you already know. 

In terms of game-play, as all the other reviews echo, the game is perfectly serviceable. Everything is meh. Don't expect much of a story, stellar game-play or a great soundtrack. In terms of difficulty you can expect it to range from slightly difficult at the most strenuous times to a cakewalk. I don't see this as negative because anybody who is looking at this game probably cares much more about the educational aspect than how fun it is.
 
From the perspective of learning hiragana, (Obvious warning, this is my anecdotal experience) I would try to memorise the hiragana, stroke order etc, and write it down on paper as the game suggested. However, when it actually came to the game-play I found there were a few major hurdles that make the game pretty inefficient. 

The biggest problem is that the game doesn't actively make you draw out the hiragana in any way. You see the hiragana, click on the corresponding sounds it makes, and win. As the brain is fundamentally lazy and looks for shortcuts, I found I wasn't really learning the hiragana at all, instead I remembered the general shape of the hiragana, so I'd remember ""me"" is a circle with a line inside of it, and ""A"" is a cross and detached circle. The only exception to this would be like ""Nu"" and ""Me"" as they're so similar. This system is fine for recognizing shapes in-game, but I couldn't write out any hiragana if I had a gun to my head. Add to this that you'll often deal with the same sets of hiragana, it's not randomized. In this way, I found I wasn't really learning hiragana beyond the overall shape. 

Second, while there are occasionally moments in the game where you have to produce hiragana, I found that I memorised the position of what each hiragana was, thanks again to my lazy brain. (Ex. The 2nd set of hiragana are the K's, and it always goes a i e o u, so the 3rd is Ke.) It's a shame it's like this. If there were an option to scramble the hiragana in the menu then this would be solved quite easily.  

Because of this, I stopped mid-way, learned hiragana through workbooks and robokana, then came back to this and finished the game. I think it helped me to use and apply the knowledge of hiragana I learned from workbooks, and so I think it's still worth the money. It also has a decent amount of vocabulary included and a small amount of grammar which is really nice.

If I had to make any suggestion, especially if the devs were ever make another game like this, I would recommend that you must draw out the hiragana in-game with your mouse instead of selecting the sound with a menu. I picked this game up on sale for $1, and recommend waiting for a sale. But I think this game is still worth the asking price of $7 Canadian (About $5 US) if you can't wait for one. I definitely do plan on buying the katakana game, but only after I've learned it first.",1609986319,1609986319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game itself is a very basic RPGmaker game where you have to identify hiragana characters in order to attack and defeat them. The progression through the hiragana syllabary is reasonably paced, introducing five characters at a time (plus dakuten). Writing the characters is not part of the gameplay, but the stroke order is shown and the player is encouraged to practice on paper. Some introductory vocabulary is also taught, though it is not the focus of the game.

However, the game mechanics have not been polished to work well with this premise, meaning menuing attacks is a chore, offensive magic is non-existent, and ""overkill"" attacks are simply wasted (since they will hit a non-matching character). Also, aside from the different characters identifying them, enemies within a given area are pretty much identical and all have the same attacks. The enemies within the encounters are also not randomized: there are just a few predetermined sets of enemy characters, and after spending any amount of time in a given area, groups of enemies will start looking familiar, which is not great for learning.

Level design is also rather tedious. Frequently, you will reach the end of a map, only to discover you need an item at the other end, forcing you to backtrack. Worse, you cannot even pick up the item until you've already reached the obstacle that requires it to pass. Furthermore, encounters happen randomly and do not even stop happening after an area is ""cleared,"" resulting in exploration becoming truly obnoxious. At least it's easy to flee battles, but that sort of defeats the game's purpose.

The economy is also poorly paced. There is no point in buying weapons past the first tier since you will find better ones before you can afford upgrades. Money is much better spent on armor, the top tiers of which will make you basically invincible.

This game needs a remake to bring it up to the level of the subsequent games, which are still RPGmaker games but have largely fixed the above issues.

[b]The dungeons are tedious.[/b]
The game frequently features locked doors that require backtracking to get the key or whatever Mcguffin to unlock the forward path. It's more annoying when you know it's coming, but can't push the button or find the key until you check that the door is locked. It's a lazy way to pad the gameplay and it's made even worse by all the random encounters along the way. I suppose you could argue in this case that more random encounters means more chances for learning the hiragana characters, but....

[b]The random encounters are tedious.[/b]
Random encounters are normally pretty tedious, but this game makes them even slower than a normal RPGs because only the correct answer ""attack"" will do any damage, so you have to scroll through an ever expanding list of characters as you progress. You are going to want to have ""command remember"" on in this game and possibly use a mouse instead of the arrow keys so you can somewhat limit all the scrolling you'll have to do. I can't come up with a better solution, but having to scroll through 46 characters and their variations, but it's annoying when you have to do it for four heroes.

To make matters worse the hiragana warriors are not lined up the same on the battlefield as they are in the sub-menus. Pressing down on the enemy list takes you to the right on the field and pressing right in the menu takes you down on the field. I’m not sure if this is an RPG Maker quirk or design flaw specific to this game. When you kill an enemy, if other heroes were going to attack that enemy, they will use their readied attacks on the next available enemy, which 100% of the time results in them using the wrong attacks and zero damage, since you will not encounter more than one of same enemy in a battle. These kinds of mistakes may eventually diminish as you progress and learn which heroes are faster, which are stronger and how much HP the enemies generally have, but this could have been remedied if the game simply displayed enemy HP so you don't overkill on enemies.

These two things often lead to the player fumbling the correct answer on the wrong enemy resulting in a wasted turn of no damage and unnecessary confusion, which takes you out of the game and out of learning mode.


[bSmall complaints:[/b]

Equipment
I personally never earned enough yen from the battles to even afford the second tier of weapons for all the characters, before I was handed the third tier for free by one of the dungeons, which also made the battles feel less rewarding. Also, since third tier of weapons was handed out mid-dungeon it made the issue with overkilling enemies more prevalent until I re-learned how strong the characters were.

Vocabulary words
The game teaches vocabulary, but it often teaches words that contain kana the player has not yet learned. Furthermore, most of the words taught are shown in a mishmash of romaji and hiragana. This is not good for someone learning the kana for the first time. While teaching hiragana is the point of the game, the vocabulary isn’t included in the combat (only in a few side quests or NPC dialogue), so it almost seems tacked on for no real reason.

Japanisch ist viel zu komplex um es so zu lernen, aber es kann helfen, ich lerne derzeit Japanisch per Busuu und da kommt mir aber das Programm gerade richtig. 

Wieso: 

Weil eine Sprache auch immer über die Schrift geht, es wie bei der Buchhaltung, die Basics müssen einfach sitzen, und Basics bei einer Sprache sind eben nun mal die Schriftzeichen, ob Hiragana oder Katakana.
Und da hilft das Spiel extremst, die Wiederholung der Schriftzeichen, es geht schnell man lernt neben dem Zocken und prägt sich besser die Schriftzeichen ein. 

Sicherlich, die Story ist ein wenig fade und es ist das Standartsetup vom RPG Maker  aber schaut einfach darüber hinweg. Ich finde es bisher klasse, gerade um Schriftzeichen zu üben, das diese besser sitzen. 

Erwartet aber keine Megastory oder das ich Zeichen schreiben könnt in dem Spiel, geht leider nur per Auswahl, aber das ist ok, sicherlich bei 75 Zeichen ist es dann schon mühsam zu suchen, aber dabei ist der Lerneffekt ja auch mit dabei.

But this piece of software fails in both way, as a game and as a teaching software.

The idea to mix both, playing and learning is good, but this game fails just cause the developers didnt put any effort in the interface. They just take the provided interface the ""rpg maker"" provides by default, and that is a very annoying interface. 

Here are the main points what make this game unplayable and fails to be a good teaching product:

1. You learn the hiragana syllables in little tutorials, and these tutorials have no repeating mode which ask you the new learned hiraganas, until your error rate goes under a specific value.
You learn by repeating and there is no switch in the tutorials or in the very short test that follows to do that repeated learning.

2. After you learned some hiraganas you go on mission where you fight against monster hiraganas. You have to fight them by selecting the right romaji (which describes how to spell a hiragana with latin letters). 
And this is the biggest negative point in this game. For example you see a か monster and now have to fight it with the right ""ka"" attack. So you have to choose this attack out of a list of 
5 in Level 1
15 in Level 2
25 in Level 3
(this will go up to ~75)
And with level 3 all the fun is gone cause you have to search the right attack out of an big list. There i stop to play this game. That is slow and not funny. Where is the point to play a learning game that has no fun.
I decided to use raw learning websites that ask you over and over again for the correct answer and see my success rate rising over 90% was more fun that the game. And that with less time. With ~30 minutes a day i learned the first 35 hiraganas (inc. dakuten) in 3 days with ~88% hit rate.
It really needs an interface where you can type in the right answer instead selecting it out of a list.

3. They dont support the learning rate with playing the vocal sound when you fight the hiraganas. With playing the sound you would be able to learn faster and learn the right spelling of it by the way. And the sound quality of the spoken hiraganas is not good at all.

For the main missions, you have to find various objects to complete an area, while facing random battles against ""hiragana warriors"" along the way. The way to beat these ""warriors"" is to correctly identify them - a fun way to learn and really drill the characters into you. You have four ""allies"" who take turns attacking the ""warriors"" and can be attacked in turn (there are various weapons and cures to help your ""allies""). If I have one complaint about these battles, it's not always very clear to me which ""ally"" is supposed to attack which ""warrior"". Quite often I will correctly identify a character, but the ""ally"" will attack the wrong ""warrior"". It's most irritating.

Still, if you want to get started in Japanese, this is not too shabby an introduction. Of course, you need to learn the katakana and kanji once you've mastered the hiragana, but these guys have made companion games for that! They have all the bases covered. I reckon by the time you're done, you should be able to read Japanese hiragana quite proficiently and be able to say at least some basic phrases.

[u]Jokes[/u] are boring too. There was one (literally one) dialogue so far, that made me smile but for whatever reason I can't take screenshots in game, so it's gone forever. And I don't even remember now what it was about, so probably nothing worthwhile.

1. select the hero
2. select if they attack or do other things
3. select the enemy hiragana sign
4. select the right sound that sign makes from a long list
5. accept
All that for one hero to attack a sign once. It wouldn't be too bad in a regular j-rpg style game, where these attacks can really vary and stuff, sure. But this game is supposed to teach you an alphabet and I can surely think of better ways to direct focus towards learning, instead of ""try not to missclick in the menu while doing the same steps four times"". 
Imagine how nice it would be if there would be only three steps: 
1. select the hero
2. Select attack
3. [b]type in[/b] the sound using your [b]keyboard[/b]. 
Revolutionary, I know, using the keyboard like that. It would improve the gameplay 100% and maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed with it.  

All the enemies are the same - so, hiragana. Their attacks don't really differ, it all falls flat and becomes boring very very early in the game.

Fights happen all the time. You enter the location - there are chests you want to reach and a passage north. Every few steps, a fight. Even worse, I reached all the chests, fought countless fights, reached the passage only to learn I need wood to build a bridge over it. And that I can get wood on the other side of that location (so basically, backtrack to the entrance). I try to do that and after two steps... a fight again. That was a spot where I ragequitted for the day. And let me tell you, these fights are not getting better, further in the game. 

Enemies don't have health bars!!!!!! Game, what the hell. How am I supposed to fight when I don't know enemies health, order of the attacks during the turn, anything useful? It wasn't a rare occasion when I scheduled attacks to defeat one sign and it died after the first and the rest of the attacks went to waste. However you square it, stripping gameplay of important information for no reason is just bad user experience. 

[u]Equipping items[/u]? Yeah, this is bad on its own. It should be transparent and easy to manage. It is not. 

[u]Game speed[/u]
Everything in game is SLOW. Animations are slow and unskippable, choosing any items or attacks is unnecessarily complicated, some of dialogues and quests are really redundant and only slow you down even more. 

[u]Pet peeve[/u]: game teaches you keyboard setting that doesn't work (like it cues WASD for walking but only arrows work) 

--

I don't feel I'm any close to finishing this game but I guess I'll have mercy on myself this time. It really makes flashcards and duolingo lessons [b]interesting[/b] and [b]fresh[/b]. Go figure. 

Also, by the way, I think that out of all these hours I've spent in-game, maybe 15% of it had anything done with Japanese. The rest is walking, fight's menu, managing items and boring dialogue. And none of that is appealing in the slightest.",1603757428,1603757473,False,7,0,0.539113044738769531,3,False,False,False,False,,,

I haven’t had any real practice of it in a long time though, so I felt like running through this game would be a good refresher and I was curious at how long it would take me.

That was just under five and a half hours, which included all the side quests the game offers. The in-game timer is greatly inaccurate though, showing double that.

As much of my previous experience with Japanese was from Slime Forest Adventure, a very similar Japanese learning RPG, I can’t help but compare this game to it.

A substantial issue I had with this game is that it’s running on an RPG Maker engine, which really showed some limitations of building this type of learning game around it. In Slime Forest, when needing to enter an answer, you simply typed it from your keyboard. This game though, you constantly are needing to scroll through menus for the attack you want.

It’s made worst as each party member keeps a history of their last attack. Although generally what you would want in a usual RPG, I felt it was more of an annoyance here. While playing, I did gradually become used to it though.

The whole RPG element makes this far more of a game then an educational tool, finding Slime Forest to provide a much better learning experience. In particular, the random battles here are exactly that; random. There’s no attempt to focus you on what needs improvement, and there’s also a factor of managing an entire party, rather than focusing on the Hiragana itself.

On a positive note, despite using templated assets, the graphics were nice, along with decent music. There’s a story but it’s very generic, along with its characters, not that you would expect otherwise on a game like this.

Overall though, I can’t recommend this as a learning tool. Slime Forest is the superior Japanese learning game, having a great deal more content as well, despite the poor graphics and lack of sound. Unfortunately, it doesn’t hold up much better as a game either.",1600613353,1600613353,False,7,2,0.57443845272064209,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You then get plenty of revision by fighting Hiragana enemies you have to defeat by correctly identifying them. There are also plenty of side-quests that teach you vocabulary - for instance, one side quest teaches you the names of food in a cafe and how to order them - and a lot of the writing for the side quests is legitimately hilarious. I won't spoil any of the jokes, but I laughed out loud at a fair few of them.
The game plays like old-school Dragon Quest, right down to the little details like the little musical chime that plays when you rest at an inn, and as a long-time fan of Dragon Quest this made it lots of fun to learn Japanese.

I learned Kana some 20 years ago for fun and this brought everything back on the Hiragana part. 
Overall, while pretty basic in almost every aspect, it's a fun little learning experience that doesn't outstay it's welcome. Of course, if you intend to learn it for actual usage, you'll need to keep going and the game offers you to go back to every lesson, even after you finished it. 

Pros:
- You can see the drawing of every letter and it's stylized counterpart, along with a soundbit to guide you to it's  pronunciation. 
- The music is not obnoxious and goes along well with the game. 
- Visually nothing special but pleasant to look at. I like the character-sprites and their animation. 
- You get basic phrases and words thrown in the mix you'd encounter in beginner courses as well. You'll probably recognize a lot if you ever paid any attention to anime, movies, series. 
- For difficulty you can utilize level-ups from sidequesting if the combat is too hard/tedious for you. I didn't find it difficult, but being able to speed things up at times is a nice qol-feature I appreciate.
- You cannot advance if you don't learn and remember. Less of a problem when you can simply look up things, but true to what a learning-game should be like.
- Characters are likable. Didn't throw me of my socks but I didn't dislike anyone. On top of that almost every NPC looks different from the next one. 


Cons:
- Basic features and little adjustability. Heck, you can't even turn it off in the menu. When you do  adjustments on sound, or turn the music off for a bit, it takes effect on the next screen. Things I would expect from a somewhat contemporary RPG-Maker build. I still wonder if I had ever made back into post-game Snow Leaf Village if I had Alt+F4'd out of the Kickstarter-Scrolling at the end...  
So, not state of the art by any means, but to be fair it never ever crashed, slowed down or froze on me. 
- The pronunciation bits are too quiet and sound clunky, muffled and chopped up, except at the very end for the basic phrases. Those are pleasant and actually sound what I would expect every sound clip to sound like. Budget issues, I guess. 

Overall it really does cover little but the Hiragana, but that's already apparent from the title. And they do make you aware of alternate script sytles and the like. Still, I can't get over how lacking I found the audio for the pronunciation bits... Then again, there are plenty of other online-resources and at the end of the day it will provide examples for beginners that don't have a clue how Japanese sounds like. 

Like I said I had fun and it worked well as a refresher, so a thumbs up from me.",1596572702,1596572702,True,8,0,0.62985914945602417,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Die unterschiedlichen Fonts führen leicht zu einer Verwechslung/Probleme beim schreiben, wenn man die Hiragana noch nicht kennt. Außerdem wäre eine echte Stimme wesentlich hilfreicher gewesen, als die computergenerierte Alternative.

1. This is an accessory to learning Japanese, the best way is probably by purchasing exercise books (I prefer Timothy G. Stout from Tuttle. You probably won't really learn Japanese as fast as you could solely by playing this game but playing it subsequent a session of self-study with an exercise book will hasten the process.
2. If you already have some knowledge of the Japanese writing system, the early game might be a little tedious. I recommend that the developers in future updates or products introduce a system that tests you first so you can play according to your knowledge level.
3. The gameplay itself varies. It isn't greatly in depth and the main focus does seem to be the learning of the language but I wonder if an RPG would be the best method. Perhaps there would be other designs that could function better. Maybe like Papers, Please where you're a bureaucrat or translator traveling through Japan and lending your services. Something of the sorts. Not to say it's uninspired but the gameplay feeling empty might attribute to players losing interest quickly. 
4. The gameplay is a little rough in the sense that there's illogical leaps where your character will answer a for the next hiragana following a hiragana that has already been defeated, thus answering wrong. Moreover, if the purpose was simply to learn Japanese, the gameplay could've been easier. It's not very simple to juggle winning the game and learning the language at the same time.
5. Some of the characters are really poorly written. The blonde guy is the stereotypical culturally insensitive gajin. Straight off the bat he's telling us he wants to learn Japanese to get it on with Japanese women. I thought the character was stupid and annoying. I am not learning Japanese to get it on with hot geishas but because it is an interesting language from an interesting country. Wish they had a different characterisation.

All things considered, a handy accessory to learning Japanese. It sure beats Du*Lingo, the ersatz tool for broke retards who will never learn the language.
If you want to learn Japanese faster, get this game and play it whenever you're through with your daily exercises.

So far I do think the game is solid, it starts out by teaching you the different Rows of Hiragana, and having you battle them, the one thing is I will recommend some supplementary flash card system, as the game have a bad habbit of only using new kana in the next area so the time before you ever get back to some of the earlier kana is a tiny bit too long, otherwise does the game slowly transistion from english over to using more japanese words and phrases written in hiragana, which is nice.

Overall I will recommend the game as I am enjoying it, but I would strongly recommend to suppliment it with

If you want to start learning Japanese, this is a pretty good spot !
You CAN definitely learn all of that on your own, but I think making it a game makes it more enticing to learn everything until the end (it definitely helped me !).
This game will teach you Hiragana one row at a time, along with quite a few useful words (a lot of them at the end of the game) and even a bit of grammar at the end.
As for the learning part, it works great !

However as for the game part, well, it's kind of basic.
The story / writing is extremely basic, but does the job I guess.
The balancing of combat difficulty was also a bit of an issue for me (I mean purely the amount of damage taken/received, not your ability to answer properly lol).
At the beginning, battles are a bit hard but not too much, it then becomes kinda hard to really hard, but becomes easy again when you are introduced to the side-quest system.
It is a system where you can exchange points that you get by completing side-missions for 1 more level for all members in your party. They tell you it is optional and you can supposedly beat the game without this help, and for middle-game to the start of the end, you would go through hell but yes it might be possible, but I have no idea how you would beat the last level without it...
Also, the visuals are kind of basic, but I don't find this a major issue.
Although, this game always kept me by surprise by switching certain mechanics around to keep things fresh. I especially liked the mechanics of the final level !

The in-game timer tells me that I took about 11 hours to beat this game with all side-quests.

Quick note: The pre-bundled executable did not work properly for me, the sound was really weird.
Hopefully, you can run this game in any web browser (yes, this is an HTML5 game) by temporarily disabling some securities (--allow-file-access-from-files option for Chrome) and it works just fine ! I used a Powershell script to run Chrome with the option and pointing to the index.html file.
That is why my game time is so low on Steam, just ran the actual executable to get the cards.

Don't think about my comments on the gameplay too much though. It is a very cool educational tool, that I would definitely recommend to anyone !

Is it a good game?
Is it a good study guide?

As far as a game goes, it's pretty weak. About an hour of extra grinding throughout the game in addition to just playing and I was able to one shot most of the enemies. Once I got to Tokyo, I had enough money to buy the best weapons and armor for all of my characters and the enemies couldn't hurt me for the rest of the game (about 1/3 of the dungeons). The combat is basic. You have a handful of spells that you will never use because killing enemies is faster. Your attacks are all just answering the Japanese (and sometimes English) characters that you encounter as enemies. That being the case, every attack is physical and only targets one enemy. However, as you progress, the amount of ""attacks"" you have to search through in the menu to attack gets to be very long. I found this tedious, but because it is being used as teaching tool, I understand why it was the way it was. The game crashes relatively often. I had a half dozen crashes over my 10 hour completion of the game and all of its sidequests. on top of that, there is slowdown in a few areas. I've noticed this type of thing with RPG maker games on a few different systems, from super high end to mid tier computer. It's some coding issue that some of these indy games have. It wasn't too common this time, but it was there. The config options are just bad. There are 4 audio sliders, of which only 1 does what you think it does and you only get 5 stages of adjustment, making things either way too loud or too quite. Music is there, but nothing special. Characters have no personality and motivations for villains are never covered. As a game, it's dull and boring.

As a study guide, I have mixed feelings about this. First off, I studied Japanese is high school many years ago and so I already have a very dated understanding of some of the vocab and the characters. I've forgotten most of what I learned so I wanted to use this game as a small refresher of some of the basics. For me, the learning of Hiragana was rolled out a little too slow, but for someone being exposed to it for the first time, I can see it being paced alright in that regard. However, the game also introduced some basic terms and phrases, but it did so slowly over the course of the game, then didn't test you on it until the final dungeon. So even if you were taking all of your notes, by the time they mattered, you likely forgot the early ones as the newer ones were more fresh in your mind. All of the bosses were just more of the same hiragana characters, so what I would have liked to see instead is that bosses would use those vocab questions and then give us more bosses so we could work on multiple aspects of the language at once. Some things, like phrases, were only introduced to help the player out in real life and had no impact on the game. This is fine and good, but I would have used those phrases a little more when it came to the sidequests. I also would have liked it you could select which phrase to say to NPCs to initiate dialogue. All in all, I think it works alright as a study guide, but it is nothing special. When I was learning, I printed off the romaji for song lyrics and then kept filling in the hiragana and later katakana until I was able to recognise which characters better. The advantage to doing this is being able to practise writing at the same time.

TLDR: If you think the fact that this is a game will help you learn Japanese as a complete beginner, then give it a try, but don't expect to get an interesting game out of it. For me, it wasn't a fun game to play and it wasn't a particularly effective study guide either.",1590890366,1590890366,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Es sei gesagt dass ich auch mit Videokursen und Büchern gleichzeitig arbeite, diese Spiele aber vor allem für das Einprägen der Schriftzeichen gekauft habe. Ich besitze nämlich alle drei dieser Reihe: Hiragana, Katakana und Kanji, welche auch jeweils das Schriftzeichen-Set lehren. Die Idee ist simpel und gleichzeitig genial. Man nehme RPG Maker oder ähnliche Tools und baut ein rundenbasiertes Abenteuerspiel mit Helden und gegnerischen Schriftzeichen und bei dem anstelle der typischen Angriffsfähigkeiten eines Gruppenmitglieds die repräsentativen Laute in form unseres lateinischen Alphabets (Japaner nennen es Romaji) gewählt werden müssen. Ein Hiragana-A kann also nur mit der Nennung eines lateinischen A wirksam getroffen werden. Neben üblicher JRPG-Mechaniken wie Heilung, Stärkung, Rätsel lösen und Nebenquests und der gleichen wird das lernen und trainieren wirklich vertieft. Als JRPG Spiel lenkt es gerne auch immer wieder ein wenig in der nötigen Dosis ab. Ich hatte nie das Gefühl im Konzept eines Lernspiels oder im Konzept eines Abenteuerspiels unter- oder überfordert zu sein. Mal muss man ein Gruppenmitglied heilen oder in die Stadt zurück um seine Figur besser auszurüsten. Dadurch bleibt man, in meinen Augen, jedoch höchst konzentriert, zu mal beim Aufenthalt in der Stadt stets die Lehrerin angesprochen werden kann um alte Lektionen zu wiederholen. Die Lektionen sind in den Fortschritt/Geschichte eingeflochten und werden Stück für Stück langsam an den Spieler und Lernenden ran gebracht. Diese Lehrerin ist auch der Hauptquestgeber in der Storyline wo man von A,I,U,E,O bis WA und N wirklich alles an Hiragana lernt und trainiert. Zwischenzeitlich gibt es auch Vokabeln, Redewendungen und etwas Kulturinfo über Japan. Zum Teil auch sehr nett in Nebenquests verpackt. Recht spät im Spiel muss man auch die ersten gelernten Hiragana beim Lesen einer Shop-Liste verstehen um eine Nebenquest zu schaffen. Auch gibt es später im Spiel zwei oder drei kurze Abschnitte bei der hiragana-gegner umgekehrt abgefragt werden. Man muss dann die Romaji Gegenstücke mit einer Hiragana Antwort besiegen. Echt gelungen, und ich glaube ich hätte mir ohne dieses Spiel nicht so viele Hiragana am Stück gemerkt. 
Drei wichtige Anmerkungen: auf meinem PC war das Spiel recht absturz-anfällig. Ich rate jedem, alle 5 bis 10 Minuten auf einem oder mehreren Save-Slots zu speichern damit nicht so viel Fortschritt verloren geht, falls euch das auch passiert. Trotzdem rate ich zum Kauf des Spieles und Support des Entwicklers, denm von allen Games, die ich jetzt auf Steam und am Handy gesehen habe, ist dies mit einer so enormen Tiefe und Liebe gemacht wurden, dass ich nichts vergleichbares nennen könnte. Außer KOE das jahrelang in Entwicklung ist und gefühlt nie kommt. Und sämtliche anderen Spiele bzw Lernspiele wirken alle nicht vollständig oder sind am nötigsten Punkt eher unausgereift oder nicht so tiefgehend wie diese JRPG Reihe von ""Sleepy Duck"".
Die zweite Anmerkung sei noch, sich tatsächlich, wie von der ingame-Lehrerin gewünscht, Papier und Stift zur Hand zu nehmen und reichtlich Notizen zu machen. Einerseits lernt man Hiragana auch durchs Schreiben noch effizienter (Muskelgedächtnis) sondern auch deshalb, weil die einmaligen Vokabelnotizen (bitte in Romaji und Hiragana aufschreiben) später essenziell wichtig sind um einen bestimmten späten Story-Abschnitt meistern zu können. Passned zum Thema des Spiels wird der Endgame-Abschnitt recht knackig, wenn man nicht gut mitgeschrieben hat und keine anderen Schulmaterialien besitzt. 
Dritte und wichtige Anmerkung: Natürlich -nicht anders zu erwarten- ist das Spiel auf englisch. Einerseits wird der Entwickler wohl kein Deutscher sein, andererseits ist englisch eine internationale Sprache, und damit ist dieses Lernspiel international zugänglich. Und für die ewigen Englisch-Verweigerer sei gesagt: lernt Englisch, dann Japanisch :)
und Ja, das Spiel sieht etwas ""alt"" (retro, pixel-look) und klischeehaft aus, und selbst wenn man RPG Maker als Grundlage für so etwas nicht mag, so denke ich mir jetzt nachträglich: es gibt aber auch nichts und niemanden der es bisher schon besser gemacht hätte und damit am Markt wäre. Viele pixelige JRPGs, sogar bei den Konsolenplattformen, gibt es ja zu hauf. Aber kein einziges mit Sprachen-lernen als ernstes Konzept. Und es gibt auch nicht annähernd etwas vergleichbares.
Da ich den Hiragana-Teil heute ""durchgespielt"" und ""durchgelernt"" habe, werde ich demnächst mit Katakana weiter machen. Das Spiel dazu heißt ""Katakana Wars"" vom gleichen Entwickler. Angespielt habe ich es bereits und ich muss sagen es lohnt sich, denn die Spiele bzw deren Editor-Grundlagen, mit denen sie gemacht wurden, scheinen sich von Teil zu Teil weiter entwickelt zu haben. Nach Katakana und dem dazu passenden Spiel werde ich Kanji angehen, und auch wieder das dazu passende Spiel des Entwicklers laufen haben.

Hiragana Battle prides itself to be a quality multimedia edutainment. What they, Majestic 12, don't want you to know is that it's neither a smart education nor a good entertainment.

Let me list the reasons:
Ladies and Gentlemen...
RPG Maker.


Which isn't to say that RPG Maker sucks as engine, for it gave an absolute awesome birth to OFF. But you know how years ago mentioning gaming engines was seen as showcase of graphics and powers yet in these years it just immediately brings picture of shovelware games into mind? Yea.

Ok, real list:
 - Every asset is RPG Maker stock asset. Aside from Hiragana, obviously. And I heard that the game had kickstarter.
 - Controls and interface and gameplay are all RPG Maker stock. Mouse users will sure to enjoy having to double click everything. And they didn't even include the exit game button anywhere. You will play the game forever and you will like it. Also, not a fan of RPG Maker MV version engine, it gives me nano-loading freezes whenever I go exploring into status menu.
 - The plot is cheese that nearly reaches a cringe level. Ebil wizard attacks your stock RPG town with Hiragana symbols that you can harm only with your Hiragana knowledge. Which would have been more fun if it was written in adult maybe self-aware, way. Then again, I want to strangle all the self-aware humor in 2020 and this cheesy plot probably allows kids to enjoy the game too.
- You would think that in order to reinforce Hiragana knowledge you will be shot many kana at high pace. Nope, devs took too much inspiration from JRPG of olde to the point where it doesn't fit. Each battle lasts like 30 seconds both because of slow unskippable animation and having to manually select the Romaji answer to kana from the ever increasing list of choices that doens't fit to a single screen and also leads mostly to patten recognition instead of direct learning and you will be sick of doing it for all 4 characters manually. At times battles last more than one turn which is pointless for learning. 
 - Enemies can apply status effects that seem at times to last only one turn and then normal combat lasts only like 2 turns so if you made use of antidote magic you just wasted a turn you dood.
 - If two characters gang on one kana but it dies in one hit, the second character will hit another kana with same, now wrong, answer, wasting your time.
 - There are only few preset sets of Kana squads you can encounter per area instead of being actually randomized, you will learn their patterns soon. Once again, more of pattern learning instead of directly learning. Gaming the system. Of course, I came here to learn Hiragana so I forced myself to remember the pronouncation of Kana first but you know, I brought a game and it should be a challenge that teaches you, otherwise you should just use flashcards and what not.
 - Developers didn't quite handle the intricate art of stats tweaking in RPG Maker. Once you get midway through the game when your characters will have like 100+ defence each, the game balance will be constantly hinging between whooping your ass and doing 0 damage.
 - Featureless mazes ahoy with no interesting things to explore, few misplaced tiles aside, that  make you run in circles while you pop enemy encounter every few steps that you have to grind, which I call grinding instead of learning reinforcement due to mentioned flaw of having only few preset kana possible encounters per area that you will exhaust real fast.
 - I have used the game along with unrelated book to learn Japanese but I must say that if you dedicate the whole game to Hiragana alphabet you ought to get real into it. Book says that in order to make long M in MA series of kana I should place N beforehand. Nothing like that in the game.
 - Combat where you translate Romaji into Hiragana was nice but too rare, should have made it common encounter.
 - The game teaches you vocabulary as a side content and I hate it. I am of a camp that believes that it's best to learn your words by translating texts and then reinforcing it with tests. Game here just randomly gives you separate semi-random phrases and words through a game out of context and then only reinforces that in the very final level, suddenly rushing down. I just tanked that part of a game through because I know that I will forget words in few days with this kind of teaching. Then again, the big idiot is me for tanking through game part I didn't like instead of watching walkthrough, heh.
 - Besides, you are supposed to remember words by their kanji (hieroglyphs) writing and I heard that devs made a mistake in Hiragana writing of at very least one word, so.
 - Lessons are so slow and clunky so I don't ever want to revise them. It's true that ""study guides"" you get as item are just a single screen but they lack info and you can revise vocabulary only at your femme sensei.

Overall, you are being sold real amateur RPG Maker project there and you ought to skip it. Hiragana is not that scary, you can do it yourself without gaming motivation that will just annoy you here.

It did help me to reinforce Hiragana memorization but then there are other ways to do it. I just had this game already purchased back when I was less grumpy.",1589804802,1590169748,False,5,0,0.499419659376144409,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That being said, there is room for improvement to increase the enjoyment of the game, as well as for learning purposes.

If I could make changes to the game, it would be this:

* Reduce the number of players in the battle. You spend most time selecting which ""attack"" (answer) to use, and most of the time you use all the players to attack the same enemy (logically so). Since there is no tactical advantage changing up the attacks, having multiple characters attacking the same word multiple times seem pointless (see my second recommendation for how it possibly could be solved).

* The attacks quickly become boring. The idea of having to select the words matching the hiragana is brilliant, but it does not feel like a good game. If we could mix in a few elements of Final Fantasy, say adding spells and attacks such as ""Fira Ka"", ""Fira Ki"", (...), ""Quick Attack Ka"", and so on, with abilities that could be unlocked as we go (as you do with each lesson), it would feel more rewarding. Each attack with different colors and effects to make the game feel less mundane, and make each attack stand more out.

A way to go about this would be to have a Spell type, Physical type, and possibly a Status type for every character. ""Fira Ka"", ""Slash Ka"", ""Sleep Ka"", depending on the character. This would change how you play, by using the different characters to actually affect the flow of battle.


------


If you are completely new to Hiragana, this game definitely wont keep you entertained while learning all the way. This would be best played in short sessions (perhaps once a day, every other day) while learning a set of characters. Even then, you will have to grind a bit to be properly adjusted, in order to battle the stronger ""Hiragana Warriors"".

Would I recommend this to learn Hiragana? ""Yes, but"". I would not recommend this as the sole way of learning Hiragana. This is a supplement. A way to practice without making it feel like a chore (which is very good). Just keep the sessions short, no more than perhaps 20-30 minutes (perhaps that is too long), to avoid getting bored.

Then I will boot up the game and follow its handwriting tips on a practice sheet. When it comes down to the battles I have that practice sheet squared away so I can't reference it and I haven't lost a battle yet. The battles are a great way to recall what you have learned. 
I try to aim for one new line of hiragana a day and this game really does speed that up.

But,
Has a game designer and level designer a saw 2 principale problem all along the game and a small 1 at the End.
1 The enemy partern.
I found out that the enemy patern was extremly repetitive inside the same biome. What i mean is that I pass throught a full chapter without ever encountering lot of hiragana that was the principale studies of that same Chapter. exemple: You learn the H b and P groupe. During the encounter for that exact 3 groupe I never saw must of the P and never I saw any ho, bo or po. In another exemple At a rediculous ratio of 60% chance i was encountering di which is very rare to use in japenese (acording to the person i know that know Speak Japenese)
Solution: making That the % rate of spawning a pecular Hiragana increase every time that you don't see it.

2 No retro study
So when you get in a new Chapter you learn new Pool of Hiragana wich is perfect. During that chapter you will mustly encounter those Hiragana (which is perfect). THe real problem is that i never saw a pool of Hiragana of 2 chapter prior to the chapter i was. 
Solution: 
Actual Studied Hiragana Spawn Ration: 60%, all the others 40%.

Solution 2:
 to fix both first problem would be to put enemy into the world map. Those enemy pool should be all the Hiragana Studied yet.

Problem 3: 
The End Game.
The game is quiet nice. Ultra charming (that is what kept me playing instead of starting to study without it), have a nice Story. Basicly the problem is that i don't fell confident enought to go after a bigger fish with my actual skill.

This game helped with both.

As far as a learning game goes, it worked well for me. The more you fight, the better you memorize the different hiragana and can read them more easily. One problem I had with it was the font used for them during battle. Sometimes it differs a lot from the font in the text, which can be confusing.

However there's a problem with the battle system. It's hard to explain it, but the way the attacks and valid targets work, as long as you have assigned more than one hero to fight an enemy and the enemy dies with the first strike, the second attack will be lost. This prolongs the battle and forces you to attack the remaining enemy next turn.

The game itself is not without flaws as well. In the second half there's an elevator door that's supposed to open so that you can progress in the game. Except that usually it won't. I got stuck there for a while and had to look up the solution. You have to leave and re-enter the building a couple of times, until the elevator decides to trigger.

This educational game seems to be inspired by games such as ""Lufia 2 - Rise of the Sinistrals"". The chests look very similar, especially the beautiful blue ones. And they had the same concept of focused energy as a weapon.
The story is easygoing and rather fun. There's a limited selection of equipment, armor and weapons. It features surprise attacks and ambushes as well as status effects. The later don't really matter, since they only last a round or so and the normal battles never took more than two.

As for the playtime, I'm a slow learner and I spent a lot of time grinding ""levels"" and ""money"" - but in truth I just needed and wanted the practice. It took me 21 hours to finish and I probably wouldn't mind replaying it at some point, just to refresh my knowledge.

I've finished the game in about 13 hours, within 3 days. I think I managed to memorise about 90% of the lessons in the game.
I strongly recommend approaching this as a class more than a game. The battle elements are like homework : you get presented with a character, and you give your answer to that character. You get it right, you damage it, otherwise you do nothing. I have hand-written the characters maybe a hundred times each to commit them to memory, and did not use a cheat sheet for battles (but I would write all enemies as if I was asked to write them down for an assignment).
The battle system is more than basic. After a while you can one-shot most enemies until the next lesson, ailments all wear off after battle, and enemies can't damage you that much if you get equipped. A little more depth, better UI, and more variety would have been welcomed. Often, you won't encounter much of the previous lessons' enemies in newer areas, which means that if you want to study them you need to go back in older (and laughably easier) areas. Still, there are a couple of nice surprises, but they're mostly in the last areas.

I generally have a rule not to review games I haven't fully completed yet. But I MUST write this review now, because I need to emphasize very important points of this game as someone who learns Japanese by himself. I will give this game a negative review for now (it may change in the future, I can't say this for sure). At this very moment, I like this game in general. But it has VERY serious issues when it comes to [b]teaching[/b] kana.

This game is perfect if you are searching for an educational game which is good for drill exercises. We'll talk about this later. But I have several pretty big questions about the lessons.

In each lesson we have a set of kana characters (one row from gojuuon table + (han)dakuon, if available). The first issue comes from the presentation. What we can see on screen is the calligraphic (printed) representation of the symbol from embedded Japanese font. It's being used both here and in the gameplay. But when the player asks for the animation to learn how to write this symbol on paper, these two versions (calligraphic and animated handwritten) do not match. It's natural, since we do not write letters exactly as they are printed in the book, but it creates a problem. When we are being asked to practice this character in our notepad what we can see on screen is the calligraphic version, not the handwritten one. And I, personally, couldn't understand from looking at my monitor, how exactly I am supposed to write it. BTW, [b]I know[/b] how to write these - I'm in no way a complete novice in learning Japanese, I considered this game being a nice short practice for me. But this is what confused me from the very beginning.

The second issue is the hints for writing. I couldn't understand from these hints whether I'm learning [b]calligraphy[/b] or trying to practice my [b]handwriting[/b]. Because some of these hints are useful for the former, but not for the latter. Also, to develop a consistent handwriting you need 1) an [b]exact sample[/b] of the symbol, it's usually presented inside a square 2*2 grid so you could understand the proportions and relative position of lines; 2) a working sheet with the same grid to practice (you can use checkered notepad or notebook); 3) hints for positioning of your hand (Japanese and Western styles of writing are different!). None of these are being featured here. The DLC study guide has the printed and handwritten versions of the character on the same page, though, but that's all. Oh, and also I want hints like how not to mix up some characters which are pretty much identical (I'm constantly reading あas お and vice versa).

The third issue. We are being constantly reminded about the order of strokes in kana characters. But it's probably a common question for everyone who is learning Japanese. [b]Why the order of strokes is important?[/b] It could be outright inconvenient for some people to write these symbols the way they are supposed to be written. For example, when we write Western letters (Latin or Cyrillic ones), we usually write the ""body"" of the letter and then add something, like diacritics. So why it's important to write kana and kanji in Japanese exactly like this? Here it's a question without an answer. I want at least a brief explanation of this, like: 1) When you write fast, wrong stroke order could make your handwriting incomprehensible, or you could easily miss a stroke and turn, for example, あ into め or き into さ or something; 2) When you'll start to learn kanji and their keys/radicals it's very important to write these [b]fast[/b], and fast cursive handwriting will be absolutely indecipherable with the wrong stroke order; 3) The stroke order is important in handwritten input for the right recognition of characters; ... Well, you got the point.

The fourth issue. You must not use a robot for voiceover in teaching! The right pronunciation is very important in Japanese and similar languages, and the voiceover must be done by a native speaker.

The fifth issue. The vocabulary, which is pretty out of place. I understand that you have to provide examples of the words with these kana characters just explained. But could you choose the words a bit more wisely or consistently? For example, do not mix romaji and kana in the beginning. It will improve the effect from learning greatly.

The gameplay. As I said, this game is good for drill exercises, when you repeat the same characters over, and over, and over, and over... The battles with the ""enemy"" kana characters (vulnerable to the right guess of its pronunciation) are literally every dozen of steps here. Also, it's good for training to recognize kana visually [b]for reading[/b] (but not by ear, it's not really relevant, but it could be a nice addition to write words in kana by ear). The gameplay itself is your mediocre ""educational"" story made in RPGMaker, the RPG element isn't really deep or something, it's more like it does absolutely everything to make the game longer. Which is understandable (longer gameplay - more enemy encounters), but sometimes just plain boring (the locked door is on the one side of the labyrinth you just went through, the key is... you know where). And it becomes bad when the RND doesn't work at all. I was forced to play the same battle with the same three enemy characters [b]three times in a row[/b]. I'm supposed to know 25 characters already, what about the other 22?

upd: And another thing which pretty much annoyed me here is that EVERY single menu button in this game must be pressed twice to work! First time for highlighting, second time for activating. It could be a legacy of RPGMaker, but seriously, what the...?

The game actually has nice hints and some basic trivia about Japan for everyone who is learning Japanese. It's useful, really. It's entertaining, and it's good. But if you want to actually [b]learn[/b] kana, not just for reading and understanding these characters in texts (this game is perfect for this task), but for using it yourself, then it will be much better to find a free kana course in Google, print materials and use these for actual learning. I used materials from one of these sites (I won't put the link here, since it's not an advertizing, but you can find it easily on first page by searching ""free hiragana self-study course"") and there are really good hints and examples for handwriting along with short examples with pronunciation on YouTube.

Absolutely. Especially if you try to complete all side-quests and to get the best armour and weapons in the game, you will have to grind a bit. And battles the same subset of hiragana dozens of times will commit their shapes to you memory like nothing else. 

Positive:
- It has exactly the right length, a 100% run will only take about 6 hours
- The visual are nice, nothing extraordinary, but pleasant to look at with no style clashes. The sequel is better, though.
- The mazes in the dungeons are not overly complicated. It's a learning game first, and a RPG second.
- If you complete every side-quest and try to grind just enough money to buy the best equipment you will have no difficulties whatsoever, the RPG part of the game becomes trivial. Your progress only depends on how well you can recognize hiragana, which is exactly the right gameplay approach for a learning game.

Negative:
- The music just OK. The battle theme kind of sucks which is a pity because you will hear hundreds of times. The sequel got this MUCH better.
- The battle system has built-in flaw. You have to provide commands for all of your characters at the beginning of a round and only afterwards the round starts and the commands are executed. Since your attack only damage enemies which exactly match your attack choice (hiragana) as soon as an enemy is killed and you have another character left attacking with the same hiragana the attack will randomly shift to the next target for which the chosen hiragana won't match (there are never more than one enemy of the same kind in a battle) and the attack will be wasted. This was fixed in the sequel.

RECOMMENDED.

Ill add a TL;DR at the end but this is gonna summarize my experiences and what I believe are pros and cons of the game.

So an overall summary of the game is that as a SIDE learning tool, it is really helpful. I am usually terrible at learning new things and maintaining the information, especially languages (took a German class 5 years ago and only remember like 5 words, but I remember the alphabet because its the basic 26 + 4 more letters) so learning all brand new 46 characters is and still somewhat is a tough thing for me. With the game being at a somewhat slow pace and playing about 45 minutes to an hour per session for me, it really helped me out with not being such a fast learner. I enjoyed the same from the beginning to about roughly to the end (Explained later in cons section)

[b] Pros [/b]

+ Good pace(for slow learners): If you have a hard time retaining information and/or don't have all the time in the world to study, this game is a good pace for you.

+ Study guides: The game has included study guides so in case you are having trouble with some characters, you can go back and re-learn a set of characters if needed. I personally never used it but I feel like if I ever needed to then I would have used it to better reinforce it to my memory

[b] Neutral [/b]

+- Story: the story is nothing AAA but that isn't what you came for here, it was to learn. The story is at least better than average In my opinion but not 100% memorable.

+- Side-quests: same thing with story, they are not terrible. Majority of them are just learning words in hiragana and that's it. 4-5 will make you fetch/buy items to then learn words. I THINK that probably 60-65% of the words you learn are not average day words that are used in a typical day in Japan. Also more of a con than a neutral, but side quest knowledge isn't implemented into the gameplay at all which sucks, but then the game would have been more difficult for non-side quest players so I understand.

+- Visuals: Nothing too special here. The game is created in RPG Maker so most interfaces and assets are nothing too special in my opinion.

+- Grind: Like most RPGs and JRPGs, there will usually be a time of grind. I will say out of my 8 hours, probably 30-45 minutes were spent grinding for levels and yen. I beat the end of the game without the highest tier armor because I would have probably had to grind for 1 hour or so, but at the end everyone was LV. 30+ which is enough to beat the game

[b] Cons [/b]

- Battles: While I can say that the battle do help you remember and put the characters in your long-term memory, the fights are not 100% random. From KeyofW's Review, the battles are predetermined 2-3 hiragana sets in each area, so basically just need to learn the combinations to remember what characters are in what group. The game as well said by KeyofW should have had a more flexible system that could have had 100% random encounters.

- Ending: So I will say this as the game will tell you this, but DO WRITE EVERYTHING IN THE LESSONS DOWN! While that seems like a no brainer thing to help you remember the hiragana, some lessons teach you words, which I don't see that as wrong, but 'SPOILERS' the final location of the game, [spoiler] the hiragana warriors you face are the words that you learn in the lessons. The final area took me an extra 30 minutes to complete because I had to re-look at my book that I was writing things in almost every fight to remember what combination of hiragana is what words. It felt very tedious and while I could look and say ""yeah I know the hiragana"" I couldn't remember what word they made. [/spoiler] Probably just a me thing but it really made the ending not the best for me.

So to summarize everything I just wrote: The game isn't the worst tool to use, but it could have been better in some aspects. I will take the knowledge I learned from this game and use it as a secondary tool for me to help remember the hiragana. I currently own all the games, thanks to a bundle, so my next game to play is the Katakana one so I might do a review of that one once I beat that, but I'm gonna drill the hiragana into my head for a while so I have this info in there and I don't have to keep looking up characters from time to time.

[h1] Overall score: 6/10 [/h1]

TL;DR: For a secondary tool, not a bad choice. good pace for slow learners, average story, but not the battle system or ending.

Update (3/7/2020): Lowered the score due to after playing Katakana War and at first rating it a 8/10, I realized that was a bit too high for what it was so lowering that to a 7 and this a 6 because in comparison that game was better in some aspects.",1580452690,1583608098,True,9,1,0.663187384605407715,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Combat can also change drastically with a single level up, with enemies that could 2 or 3 shot you if lucky now not having a snowball's chance in Hell against you after you ding. And yet the seemingly insane encounter rate makes the treks through the, thankfully, short stages take a while. However, since combat is how you learn Hiragana, the high encounter rate is kind of understandable. The story is pretty silly and cliche but it's self aware of it and just owns it. As a vehicle for a Hiragana lesson though, the game is perfectly serviceable and I came away learning the basics of Hiragana pronunciation and a few simple words. If you're curious about learning Hiragana and have the coin to spare, I can give this game a recommendation. I'll likely play it again at some point for a refresher, but currently I've moved on to the sequel, Katakana Combat.

Sidenotes: If you find yourself getting really roughed up after every fight, just buy Ramune in bulk and use that to heal up after every single fight until you out level the enemies. Ramune is like 1/9 the price of Deluxe Ramune for 1/3 the HP recovery. So as long as you aren't depending on it inside of combat it's a cost effective way to heal up.

##MINHAS RECOMENDAÇÕES##

---O Jogo está todo em inglês, para aprender japonês é interessante aprender primeiro ao menos até o nível intermediário em inglês, pois a maioria do material, e as traduções mais fiéis, são em sua maioria uma tradução direta de japonês para inglês.

---Usando um site, fiz uma lista para impressão com todos os kanas de hiragana em ordem, para treinar a caligrafia dos kanas conforme forem sendo aprendidos in game, a memória motora é tão importante quanto a mental, segue o link abaixo para o download.

First things first, reconsider learning Japanese. No, I'm not gatekeeping you. I'm just trying to warn you. Japan has shown time and time again its unwillingness for global cooperation, which is evident through strict border controls and xenophobic policies barring international students, among others. Passionate learners that have poured their heart into this language are mere statistics in the eyes of the LDP. If you're interested in East Asia in general, Korean and Chinese might be safer bets.

[h1] Review [/h1]
With that out of the way, let me explain why I gave this game a negative review. I found ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle"" tucked away in a steam sale, back when I couldn't speak a word Japanese. It's cute, simple, and delivers on what it promises. Yet it has no business being a video game.

Hiragana is a simple syllabary system that doesn't require 16 hours to master. To prove my point, most universities will breeze through both Hiragana and Katakana in the span of two lessons. A more efficient method to memorize the characters would be to write them down while looking at a hiragana chart. If you have trouble getting them to stick, try spaced repetition with programs such as Anki or websites such as Quizlet.

Whilst I agree that everyone has their separate ambitions and goals concerning language studies, I need to emphasize that Hiragana alone won't get you anywhere. In fact, this game might be worth picking up if you're content with that reality. If your purpose is to find out what Japanese is all about but not commiting to it, have at it! To everyone else, be prepared to put in a lot of time once you know how to write the characters. I promise you will have a lot of fun, though!

It's perfect for complete beginners to Japanese, and a fairly effective tool for committing the hiragana alphabet to memory. I had previous experience with hiragana before playing this game, and I knew a few Japanese words and phrases, which gave me a bit of an edge, but with study, review, and diligent note-taking, anyone could perform well and leave the experience with a great understanding of how to read, write, and pronounce hiragana. 

This game succeeds primarily because its educational components are so well paced, it doesn't go on too long, and it gets you right into the action. It's less than two minutes before you're learning your first five hiragana and you've been introduced to the entire plot and cast of characters. After only a short period writing, reviewing, and completing a quiz, it has you experiencing the turn-based combat that asks you to match the hiragana character with the equivalent English syllable. Once you've mastered those five, you receive a brand new set of five, and along the way you learn a bit of Japanese vocabulary, some grammar, and a few particles. Eventually, there's sidequests to complete that all have fairly unique gameplay challenges which I found simply delightful, and reward you with new vocabulary. Hiragana Battle even surprised me with the creative changes it would introduce to mix-up the sometimes tedious gameplay, which I'll leave you to discover for yourself (one example might be that when you arrive in Japan, a lot of text is now written entirely in hiragana without translation). In particular, I was a huge fan of the final dungeon and the last boss fight, which was remarkably exciting, challenging, and had a great tonal arrangement. 

As this is an RPGMaker game, it isn't as eye-catching as a stand-alone. The graphics are simple, sprite-based, and reuse a lot of assets. They picked a fairly good font for the hiragana characters and written text, and the character art is decently cool, mixing western and Japanese aesthetics. I enjoyed some of the more detailed aspects of the towns, background, and the setting for battles, and I thought the music was really good for a game of this size. There isn't much to say for the writing or story, as it's so direct and simply worded it's impossible to miss details, jokes, or what's going on. During the periods when you're learning new vocabulary and characters, it's very relaxing and easy to focus thanks to the visual and musical arrangement. 

I will say that I found some of their choices for Japanese instruction to be questionable (I believe that a few individuals pointed out a couple eccentricities in other reviews, which are a bit beyond my ability to explain), but I also thought that it taught WAY more than I expected, and that made me happy. My main gripe is that the font used for the hiragana is different than the stroke order animation, and it's not possible to keep the stroke order visible on the screen outside of a short video. Sometimes this makes it difficult to learn how to write a symbol, or you begin to associate a rather specific, fancy font with the character, when it's more common to see something simpler (the ""ri"" hiragana was an instance I found particular trouble with, and I eventually turned to writing it in another style that I had learned). That said, the stroke order is correct from what I recall from other materials and instructors, so it's a pretty reliable tool. 

On the subject of the gameplay, some may find it shallow, whereas I thought it was just simple. It's a turn-based RPG where ""attacks"" are based in matching sounds to letters, and you can also equip weapons and armour,, cast buffs and healing magic, and use items. The damage that enemies put out can be intense, so I found it's useful to have characters with strong agility and to make the correct decisions on attack order with speed to get rid of enemies without wasting your attacks. I hardly ever used improvement spells like +speed, +armour, or the block ability because battles were over quickly and the benefits wouldn't carry over. I tended to mainly use healing items and healing spells, but if you complete all the side quests it's possible to level up a ton and be able to avoid a lot of the damage while putting out enough to one-hit-kill enemies. It's a strategy game, but encounters are short, so it's not too difficult. I agree with the notion that perhaps the gameplay does not help your memory of hiragana (as compared to writing practice), because you can get into the habit of simply repeating patterns. I believe the notion that ""enemies appear in clumps where you end up fighting the same few hiragana over and over"" is a little dishonest as a criticism. Hiragana appear based on what you just learned, so each new level focuses on exposing you to what's new, and only rarely does it draw back on old material to try and slip you up. I think with the variety of dakouten marks, and how similar some hiragana can be, this is a suitable challenge that doesn't get boring or force you into patterns. The only time I felt that I was experiencing too many of the same encounters is when I had to ""walk back and forth"" over an area, since you had to complete objectives on one end of a maze, and then return to the end of it usually, and encounters would pop up too commonly for that system. Levels themselves usually only consist of one screen before they change the rules or hiragana you will fight, so I don't think it was horribly repetitive, and you have learning exercises and side-quests to break up the tedium. My tip to prevent repetition and boredom is to always go to the ""main objective"" of an area first, such as a supposed exit at a door or a building, so you queue up the next part of the quest, and then explore the rest of the level while you're fulfilling those objectives. Since you learn a lot, there's always new challenges that will appear, and the game will eventually even test you on extremely different, surprising material (which had my on the edge of my seat with excitement). 

Given the price, size, and satisfaction provided by Hiragana Battle, I totally recommend it even as a fun time-killer. I'm really excited to try out Katakana War and Kanji Combat!",1576844154,1576844235,True,2,0,0.489875912666320801,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is very well designed and I think the lessons are well paced and interesting. It doesn't only teach you the hiragana, but some vocabulary too, which was nice.
The story is actually interesting and you feel like a part of the world. I found it very nice that you're not penalized for skipping lots of encounters, so you get to decide how much you want to practice (you don't need to actually battle every single thing that comes your way).

I used this game alongside a simple guide on the internet (Tofugu) and 2 apps to practice the hiragana (KanaTown on my phone, realkana.com on the PC) and I found learning this was a lot easier than I had anticipated. It took me about 11 hours to finish the game (counting the time I left the game open while using my other resources), spaced out around 3 weeks, and I'd wager it'll take about 3-4 hours or so of more practice until I can get every hiragana right without thinking too much about it, so about 15 hours total.

Although you can use just the game, battling the hiragana warriors to boredom until you know them by heart, I would recommend using some else (like the app I mentioned), because even though the battles are fine and they do work to get you to memorize stuff, they are, of course, repetitive, so it does get REAL boring at some points.",1576103269,1576103269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Tem dois pontos que não curti, ambos relativos aos momentos em que são ensinadas palavras para criação de um vocabulário básico para os estudantes:
• São introduzidas algumas palavras de origem estrangeira com escrita em hiragana (eu sei, é informado que são estrangeiras no jogo e devem ser escritas em katakana, então porque ensiná-las em um jogo focado em hiragana?? Não fez muito sentido para mim, acho que a chance de ser memorizado errado é grande demais...);
• Mais no começo quando se aprende os silabários A-Gyō / Ka-Gyō / Sa-Gyō são introduzidas palavras com silabários ainda não aprendidos, introduzir as palavras assim: HA-い ou けｰN-PA-い não ajuda muito, o japonês é uma língua rica, com certeza tem palavras que podem ser aprendidas utilizando somente A-Gyō ou A-Gyō + Ka-Gyō ou A-Gyō + Ka-Gyō + Sa-Gyō e por aí vai...

Enfim, se você está buscando uma ferramenta de apoio, manda bala, de fato ajuda. Tome alguns cuidados com os detalhes que passei acima (pode ter mais coisa, mas como meu conhecimento é muito restrito ainda, não sei dizer).",1573767430,1573767430,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game was pretty entertaining and honestly pretty helpful in drilling the characters into my head again. I think it would be beneficial to both total newbies and to folks that just want a fun way to refresh.

There were a few game mechanics that were a little annoying (for example: you have to pick all of your team member actions at the same time, so if an enemy dies earlier than you expected, a character might end up giving the answer they intended for that enemy on a different enemy) but I've heard that many of these were fixed/changed in the next installments so I'm excited to try them out!

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t learn some things from [i]Hiragana Battle[/i]. Whether I’ll retain them is a different matter, and the experience certainly wasn’t entertaining. Combat consists exclusively of matching symbols to sounds or vice versa, with no attempt at utilizing the RPG mechanics beyond the barest possible implementation.

I didn't do this, so a lot of what I learned has dropped off in time. For me, this game was more of a refresher.

[b][u][h1]RPG Battle System[/h1][/u][/b]

As far as RPG elements go, this game is extremely basic. Standard attacking is all there is, and there is little to no difficulty at all to the game from a battle standpoint. I stayed a level or two ahead of whatever content I was zoned into, and at that level the mobs die in one hit, sometimes two, and when they damage you they often times deal zero damage. There are a few cure, antidote, awaken, etc spells, but they are rarely / never used. One major frustrating part is that for the majority of the game Eric and Leon are out of sync with the rest of the group in attack order. Until later in the game when you get a single item that can increase Eric's agility (speed), the attack order will always be Claire, Misaki, Leon, then Eric, despite Eric coming before Leon in the line up. This can get frustrating when lining up attacks, especially when you are doing a lot of one hit kills. All in all, just a bare bones battle system, but that's not what this game is about.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Simple battle system that doesn't take away from the learning experience.
[*]Extremely low difficulty to allow you to focus on the lessons and memorization.
[*]Leveling is quick, easy to out level a zone with just a few extra minutes of grinding, which is good for memorization anyway.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Battle system is a little bit too easy and can leave an experienced RPG player, or someone that has a minor level of background with Japanese already, wanting just a little bit more.
[*]The UI for selecting the right answers gets quite encumbered. In the early stages of the game it isn't too much of a big deal, but later on when you have 30+ answers to shift through per person it can become very tedious. A sub level system would have worked much better.
[*]If you've played any of the older Final Fantasy games, then you'll be familiar with the random battle encounter system. That in and of itself is a whole different level of discussion, but I personally put it in the con section.
[/list]

[b][u][h1]Teaching System[/h1][/u][/b]

The big ticket item for this game is, of course, teaching you Hiragana. It does so in a fairly ingenuitive way. Each enemy represents a letter of hiragana, and it is your job to attack it with the romanji equivalence to deal damage. If you don't have it written down or previous teachings, this is a great way to beat it into your head. Each zone focuses on a particular set of hiragana that you were just taught, with a few previous ones sprinkled in. You can easily review past lessons outside of battle. The lessons themselves are fine and do their job accordingly, but the difference in font used for the enemies and lesson presentations vs what they teach you to write can be annoying to first timers. The best English equivalent I can think of is the font used by computers and text for lowercase a vs how we are taught to write it using pen and paper. The vocal recording of each letter is almost robotic and often unintelligible, but the vocabulary words are just fine.

Speaking of vocabulary words, this game teaches you basic vocabulary (some of which is typically written in katakana, but written in hiragana for the purpose of the game) that you'd often find in an intro to Japanese text book. Unfortunately the game fails to utilize any of these teachings outside of the standard alphabet until the final zone, where they suddenly decide to test your vocabulary skills as well. There are two sections in the game where they flip the battle process and make you select the correct hiragana symbol to attack romanji characters. This is a brilliant system, but sadly it is under utilized. With a few simple UI corrections they could have integrated the two in order to make a much more robust teaching system.

An additional flaw is the repetition. Yes, repetition is part of learning a second language, but what I'm talking about is at the programming level. The way it is currently programmed to work is that there are battle sets, and when you encounter a battle you have a random chance of each set. An example of a set would be the following three enemies: ""ka"", ""ku"", and ""o"". It is possible to get this exact match up several times in a row. Add on the fact that the battle system remembers what the last answer you selected for each character was, it can make a grind very easy without much need to pay attention. After a while in each zone, you'll figure out exactly what each battle set is. The way it [i]should[/i] have been programmed, would be to have two sets of possibilities in each fight. First, a percentage chance for the entire roster to contain only new hiragana characters, and a chance to contain one or two previous characters as well. From there, each set is completely randomized with the parameters set for the possible outcome for each zone.

As you progress through the game, you run into the case where you will start to see less and less (if not none at all) of previous hiragana letters. Since the game isn't utilizing vocabulary to maximize the learning, or at least comprehension, of the letters you have to rely on memory and lists when the final zone comes around. In a traditional class / book setting, your exposure to previously learned letters would continue as you used your vocabulary. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Good job at repetition to help drive the letters into memory.
[*]Simplistic system teaching system that is easy to revise to refresh any forgotten previously earned lessons. 
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Repetitious (in programming) battle system allows you to naturally make use of pattern recognition and system design flaws to negate the teaching and memorization process.
[*]Under utilized vocabulary section that would have put this game on a whole different level. Even if you ignored the actual meaning of the vocabulary, using them as a reading and letter comprehension tool would have done wonders.
[*]Most alphabet letters fade out after one or two zones. You never / hardly see them again (such as the base vowel section, ""k"", ""t"", and ""s"" rows are a good example, meaning it makes them easy to forget.

[b][u][h1]Conclusion[/h1][/u][/b]

All in all this is a good game to use in tandem if you are learning Japanese through other professional means, or just trying to brush up stuff that you already knew but forgotten to time (such as my case). It's cheap enough when on sale, but for sub $10 at base price it's still a good deal. I haven't said anything about the story line because, well it's an educational game designed to teach you the alphabet... If you're here for the story, well then there is no hope for you from the start. All in all, despite some of the design issues it still does a decent job of getting the user familiar with hiragana and that's really all we're here for.

There is a story, a map to explore, and combat against the monsters; these are sufficiently entertaining but the main point to the game is teach you this Japanese writing systems.  The game teaches you to recognise the characters, it also shows you how to write them, though there is no assessment of writing, so it is entirely up to you if you want to practise writing or not.  

The combat system and combat map exploration have a number of flaws, such as not being able to go very far without being ambushed by monsters and having to identify the same monster multiple times to defeat it.  Most of these flaws are ironed out in the later games, which have much smoother game play, but this is a solid start to the series.  

In summary, while the game mechanics are somewhat basic and could have been improved, it is a fun game for learning hiragana, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn how to read the characters of this Japanese writing system.",1568509295,1568509295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Questo è un gioco realizzato con il motore di  RPGMaker al fine di insegnare al giocatore il sistema giapponese di scrittura Hiragana.

Ora, vorrei separare la questione giocosa da quella culturale.

Dal punto di vista del gioco si tratta, appunto, di un tipico prodotto RPGMaker, nel senso che prevede i soliti scontri casuali (anche se non tutti i giochi realizzati con quel motore li contemplano), con una trama di base, l’acquisto di equipaggiamento per rafforzare il party e l’ottenimento di punti esperienza per livellare i personaggi che devono portare a compimento una quest principale e una serie di quest secondarie (molto poche e spicce, spesso servono a imparare solo qualche sostantivo in giapponese come premio di missione).

Il problema è che è tutto molto scarno: la storia principale è appunto una scusa per l’insegnamento dei caratteri Hiragana, ma è brutta che più brutta non si può. I personaggi sono davvero insulsi e i dialoghi al livello dei Teletubbies. 

La frequenza degli incontri casuali è ossessionante. Forse è voluta per far sì che il giocatore abbia la nausea a osservare i caratteri Hiragana (sono loro i mostri che si affrontano nel gioco) affinché se li stampi ben bene in testa, ma dal punto di vista del gioco è poco divertente. Anche perché nelle varie locazioni i caratteri sono sempre gli stessi, propri di quelle locazioni, per cui si affrontano tanti combattimenti di seguito con nemici/simboli tutti uguali: non so se la frequenza sia un aspetto positivo, perché l’unica cosa che entra nella memoria del giocatore è il pattern ripetitivo della forma dei simboli che appaiono sul terreno di scontro a ogni battaglia. Una volta riconosciuti 2-3 pattern di base è possibile andare a memoria, meccanicamente, e risolvere i combattimenti. 

In pratica la battaglia si svolge così: ci sono due o tre nemici che hanno le forme dei simboli Hiragana e il giocatore deve colpirli riconoscendo la loro pronuncia/il loro nome. Il danno arriva solo se si becca il nome giusto dei simboli, altrimenti è sempre zero (quindi di base il sistema RPG è di tipo ON/OFF, ovvero è molto povero). Quando vedrete una formazione che si ripete, sceglierete le pronunce giuste solo perché eravate abituati a farlo, non chiedendovi più cosa sia quel simbolo. Peggio, a volte le formazioni uguali si susseguono in sequenza e i comandi rimangono quelli precedentemente memorizzati (anche se l’opzione nel menù è disabilitata), per cui la battaglia si vince senza nemmeno scegliere i nomi dei simboli.  In altre parole: è tutto talmente ripetitivo da non risultare più istruttivo, bensì solo meccanico, alienante, da linea di montaggio.

Io dopo ore di gioco ancora facevo fatica con l’associazione simbolo-nome (perché molti simboli hanno forme similari) e guardavo in continuazione sui miei appunti solo per distinguere la loro forma. Era la mia unica preoccupazione durante gli scontri. Non solo, quando si devono realizzare gli attacchi appare un menù con una lista infinita delle possibili pronunce dei simboli, tra le scelte di attacco, e bisogna scegliere quelle giuste: davvero scomodo dal punto di vista dell’interfaccia grafica di RPGMaker (sapete, no? Se avete una lista di 100 oggetti, per scegliere l’ultimo dovete scorrervela ogni santa volta fino alla fine), che per queste cose è davvero pessima. Verso la fine i simboli sono sostituiti da vere e proprie parole in Hiragana e bisogna attaccarli con la loro traduzione in inglese (quindi conviene scrivere su carta anche ogni parola imparata durante il gioco) e questo è già più interessante.

Non basta, parlavo RPG scialbo: è possibile usare anche le abilità dei singoli personaggi, ma è davvero tutto inutile, basta spammare in continuazione gli attacchi fisici della vostra truppa per terminare le battaglie in massimo due turni. Due turni massimo, perché basta salire di un paio di livelli in quelle stesse locazioni e acquistare le armi più potenti per instankillare i nemici.

Lato RPG: pessimo. 

Così come pessime sono le mappe: 

•	graficamente sono un lavoro davvero basico, forse utilizzando solo asset già esistenti del software RPGMaker (la sensazione è quella) nonostante i ritratti ben disegnati di tutti i personaggi e degli NPC;
•	dimensionalmente si tratta di mappe davvero piccole, oltre che poche in numero. Quando sono più estese di una paio di schermate si tratta comunque di labirinti monotoni;
•	lato esplorazione il gioco è zero: non c’è nulla da cercare e da scoprire. L’interattività con ogni oggetto dello sfondo è zero, tranne che per gli NPC e i negozi;
•	i personaggi che si muovono sulle mappe sono affetti da tarantella: schizzano come missili. Ed è possibile anche farli correre! Sembra di vedere un film in avanzamento al quadruplo della velocità base. Provavo fastidio alla vista. Posso capire che lo fai per non fare annoiare il giocatore durante gli spostamenti, ma a questo punto realizzate una visual novel, no (ma lì però ci vuole la storia, e qui non c’è)?

Rimane la questione dello scopo culturale.

Ammetto di avere imparato più di qualcosa, i caratteri base, che sono tanti, e qualche parola al volo. Durante il gioco vengono introdotti parecchi elementi però, per cui si tratta essenzialmente di impararli a memoria senza sapere come si usano. Il gioco però non sfrutta questo meccanismo a suo vantaggio, tranne una manciata di volte. 

Mi spiego meglio: mi si insegna come si dice “penna” usando i caratteri Hiragana. Ok. Ma che me ne faccio? Devo mettermi allo specchio e ripetere la loro sequenza a memoria? Il gioco non insegna nemmeno questioni di grammatica se non verso la fine e solo per dovere di cronaca, perché non nelle meccaniche di gioco. In rarissime occasioni viene chiesto di comprare un certo oggetto, scrivendolo in Hiragana, per cui al negozio bisogna stare attenti ai caratteri che formano la parola dell’oggetto (“portami la spada kotoro (nome a caso)!” e nel negozio devi capire di che spada si tratta solo dal nome in Hiragana degli articoli). Questo è un meccanismo interessante, ma sfruttato quasi per nulla.

In altre parole, anche se prendete appunti, alla fine del gioco avrete una lista di una sessantina di parole e una sessantina di simboli base di cui non avrete nessuna utilità, se non per piacere personale (a meno che non abbiate davvero intenzione di imparare il giapponese, ma seriamente e iniziando un corso successivamente). Verso le fasi finali dell’avventura (una decina di ore in tutto, circa) verranno insegnate alcune frasi di utilità mediante i caratteri imparati in precedenza, il che non è male, perché sono frasi riciclabili alla convenienza. Ad esempio, “posso prendere questo libro?” può essere utilizzata come frase generica per qualsiasi altro oggetto. Naturalmente permane il problema di imparare a memoria i singoli vocaboli.  Questi passaggi, però, non sono funzionali al gioco, ma sono più che altro intermezzi culturali indipendenti. 

Sul forum ho letto qualche critica ad alcune leggerezze (ad esempio alla pronuncia delle parole), ma per chi come me non ne sa un’acca non penso che sia un problema, almeno per sapere cosa è un dato simbolo e come si legge.

Dai, visto il prezzo basso e il valore didattico (anche se molto basico) mi va di dargli una sufficienza. Il gioco sottostante, come RPG, però è davvero pessimo. In giro con RPGMaker c’è molto di meglio, anche gratis. 

Perché mi soffermo troppo nella critica al gioco? Beh, perché proprio gli sviluppatori lo strombazzano. Infatti, nella pagina dello store affermano “This isn’t just educational software – this is a full-blown RPG specifically designed to keep you engaged.” Lasciate perdere, dategli solo il valore educativo che come RPG fa molto ridere.

Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle est avant tout, comme son nom l'indique, un jeu d'apprentissage niveau débutant qui introduit le joueur au système d'écriture japonais. Premier d'une trilogie, le jeu va ici nous enseigner progressivement les caractères Hiragana japonais à travers une série de courtes leçons nous permettant de maîtriser peu à peu le système d'écriture et leur prononciation, mais également d'apprendre un peu de vocabulaire, des règles grammaticales et des phrases utiles au pays nippon.

Pour mettre en pratique ces enseignements, on va affronter les terribles soldats Hiragana à travers les îles du Japon dans un JRPG classique rappelant les premiers opus de Final Fantasy. Mais ici, pas de combat acharné avec des armes où de la magie. Non! Le seul moyen de survivre à l'ennemi sera rendu possible par l'association des Hiragana à leur traduction (ou vice-versa). Notre meilleure arme restera donc notre mémoire, ou de nos fidèles papiers et crayons qui nous accompagnera tout du long.

Le jeu n'est pas en soit très difficile ou trop long. Les combats sont simples et ne demandent pas un grand fan des JRPG. On est avant tout là pour apprendre. Les combats ne font ici office que d'un système très bien pensé pour mettre en pratique chacune des leçons à force de répétition au cours de petites escarmouches. Il faut simplement faire des associations justes et l'ennemi va disparaître au bout de deux coups. Aucune prise de tête si on suit correctement les leçons et que l'on prends des notes.

Au fil de notre aventure, divers personnages vont également nous lancer sur de courtes quêtes nous permettant d'obtenir encore un peu de vocabulaire, mais également d'apprendre un peu plus de la culture japonaise.

Graphiquement, le jeu est très mignon, un univers légèrement pixellisé nous rappelant encore une fois les premiers Final Fantasy sur NES, mixé à une musique entraînante pour les combats et notre visite des différentes villes nippones. Le jeu est relativement court et se complète en 10-12 heures, variant sur notre capacité à mémoriser le système Hiragana et du désir du joueur à mettre en pratique chacune des leçons.

Seul petit bémol qui pourrait rebuter certains: le jeu est tout en anglais, mais ne demande pas pour autant une grande maîtrise de la langue de Tolkien.

Donc, si vous avez toujours voulu apprendre le système d'écriture japonais ou que vous vous intéressiez un tant soit peu à la culture nippone et que vous ne vous êtres jamais lancé dans l'aventure, c'est un jeu parfait pour faire le premier pas!",1566131503,1566131503,True,1,0,0.52692866325378418,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Quick Summary: While an ok learning tool for Hiragana focusing on repetition, it's focus on repeated non-random battles, cliche and dull story, barebones mechanics and superfluous information make me sad to say I can not recommend this to people learning japanese. If your SOLE focus is to learn to read Hiragana or you have focusing problems than this game might help but I think if you're truly planning on learning there are much better (free) resources out there.

LHtS is an old school focused Japanese RPG similar to the early final fantasy games featuring top down movement, sidequests, levelling up and turn based fighting. It's very clear that the gameplay takes a back seat to the learning so I won't delve on the gameplay for too long but suffice to say it's lackluster at best. The mechanics are simple, equipment upgrades are simply purchased or found within the mandatory dungeons you visit and overall this isn't meant to be a complicated game because it's focus is on teaching.

The story follows Claire and her friends on a mission to defeat a wizard named Noburo who (for no particular reason at all) unleashes ""Hiragana Warriors"" across the world and because they came to your town for 13 seconds, Claire sets out to track them all down. However they can only be defeated by learning their true names so a visitor from Japan named Misaki aids you and your friends in studying these characters to defeat them.

Let me state before I continue that before playing this, I already knew how to read Hiragana but I bought this game before I studied and ended up playing this much later as supplementary material so I am not the intended audience.

The game implores you to get out a pen and paper to write your lessons down (and you should, you won't be able to remember them if you don't). Learning works like this:
1. Before each quest, Misaki will teach you a set of Hiragana including stroke order, sound and spelling
2. Afterwards she gives you a small quiz to see what you have learnt
3. During the quest, the enemies you fight will be Hiragana enemies
4. To defeat them, you need to ""attack"" them by selecting the right answer in your attack menu to do damage
      So, instead of attacking with a standard attack, you select the correct answer depending on them enemy. Selecting あ for ""a"" will then deal damage to that character (damage is based on weapon and level). So, it's a pretty simple RPG but there are an enormous amount of flaws. However, let me talk about the positives first.

During your lessons, you'll be able to get all you need to each Hiragana including pronunciation, stroke order, the amount of strokes etc. You'll also get some extra tips on how to write them which I found pretty handy and didn't know before. The game also does a good job by separating each quest into certain Hiragana warrior so the enemies you fight will mainly be focused on the Hiragana you just studied instead of much older (or new ones). This way by fighting the forced repetition you'll learn all you need to know before moving onto the next quest. 

But now I need to list some of the various problems:
- Enemies are almost always faster than you for no reason. Claire always got the first hit in a battle, but all the Hiragana warriors then had their turn before the rest of my party could move. No matter how much I levelled this never changed and became frustrating because my party would ALWAYS take damage.
- Enemies aren't randomized. During each quest, the Hiragana warriors you fight will always come in the same groups, in the same order. So the first fight you might fight ""ga"", ""ka"", ""ke"" and ""ge"", then second you'll fight ""ki"" and ""ku"", and the third you'll fight the first lineup again. This meant instead of remembering what you've studied, you remember simply because you fought the exact same enemies before and you remembered which ones they were solely because you just defeated them.
- The encounter rate is RIDICULOUSLY high. Every 3 steps you'll run into an enemy. Once I got halfway through the game I just ran from every enemy because there is no penalty. You can complete sidequests to get points to level up so you don't even need to fight and still be on par with the enemies.
- You still have to fight Hiragana you know. Selecting the right attack for the right Hiragana doesn't mean they die, they just take damage until they do die. So not only do you have to select the right Hiragana, you have to do it multiple times every fight. If an enemy dies before your next in line gets to attack them, and you selected the now deceased Hiragana for them to attack, then they'll attack another Hiragana and do 0 damage because it's the wrong one, and the only reason is because you just killed it.
- The more Hiragana you learn, the more bogged down your attack menu becomes with answers/attacks so you spend more time scrolling for the right one rather than being able to pick it at a reasonable pace, artificially padding game time.
- Spells are useless, and I never used them except in the final fight where they made the fight impossible to lose.
- Halfway and beyond you'll learn some grammar, what some words mean and so forth but it's all irrelevant until the very final battle.

Otherwise, the general story writing is bad, the storyline is bad, being forced to fight every 3 seconds is annoying, the soundtrack is very average and honestly it really pains me to not be able to say you should buy this.

If you NEED to have interaction to learn something (maybe you have ADHD, or a super low attention span) than give this a go for sure. You have nothing to lose. But there's no point in ONLY learning Hiragana and if you need a game to study something than you're probably not ready to learn anyway. If you DO really want to learn Hiragana, there's plenty of (free) places where you can probably learn faster (I recommend Tofugu for Hiragana and Katakana) and still have fun.

Первая часть трилогии по изучению Японского языка, самая худшая по качеству. Крайне неудобное управление, посредственный сюжет, но это всетаки обучающая игра, которая учит и еще и дешева к тому-же.

И тем не менее здесь есть хорошие стороны:
1) меньше всего воды среди обучающих игр
2) обучение японским словам
3) повторение слов под конец и задания на поиск слов.

Следующие части стали лучше, но эта больше нужна для обучения, чем для развлечения. Тем не менее, вся серия Learn Japanese To Survive - наиболее интересный, дешевый и эффективный способ изучить Японские азбуки и базовые слова.

I picked it up super quickly, and the lessons included were amazing. Sure the story isn't amazing but obviously if you're playing it, you aren't looking for a particularly riveting story. However the trouble I had with it was the gameplay itself would sometimes be so frustrating. I could tell you all the hiragana characters on the screen but because I'd spent more time revising hiragana than I had grinding to get good equipment to beat said hiragana enemies quickly, any knowledge I had obtained was useless because the enemies themselves were wiping out my party super quickly which made continuing a bit tedious. I feel as though the RPG Maker side of things could have been better balanced to meet the needs of an educational game so that an amateur could still enjoy it regardless of their proficiency with RPGs.

Тем, кто не привык играть в ролевые игры, придется привыкать к интерфейсу. Каждого персонажа придется одевать и вооружать, каждый раз проходя через все подпункты игрового меню.

Tomemos la parte mala: Yo no habría elegido RPGMaker como base para un juego educativo.

Además, con un poco de ganas, cualquiera con interés por el idioma japonés (aunque solo sea movido por afición al manga) puede aprender hiragana y katakana en apenas unos días con ayuda de un librillo de mnemotecnia. Con este juego como única fuente, sin duda es más lento.

¿Pero tiene parte buena? Sí, porque la verdad es que para estar encajonado en los límites de ser un JRPG clásico, es una idea que se sale de los esquemas típicos, envuelta en una aventurilla ligera para todas las edades. También sirve de buena motivación para animarse a estudiar el idioma y no se limita exclusivamente al silabario, sino que por el camino va presentando algunas frases de conversación básica en japonés y notas culturales. Puede ser una buena base inicial, siempre que el inglés no sea un problema para el jugador.

The game plays like an old school JRPG, and knowing this I should have realised it wasn't something I'd beat in a couple of hours. Hiragana Battle is certainly not the most efficient way to learn or revise, but the game does ask you to get a pen and paper out to practise - which I did. The game does a good job of hammering the characters into your head through repetition.

There is one exception to this; the final boss battle. The game goes beyond just learning hiaragana writing and how it is pronounced, and includes some basic vocabulary and phrases too. Those might require a tool like Anki to help you memorise those, as you'll need to know a bunch of vocabulary to beat the game. Having said that, vocabulary is probably easier to learn than new characters for a lot of people.

As you would expect from an RPG, there are optional side quests that result in giving you even more XP (and extra vocabulary not used in the main quest). They didn't go stingy on content.

There are a few things I didn't like about the gameplay itself. The battles play out as follows: You have four characters, and there will be 2, 3 or 4 enemy hiragana attacking. On your turn, you need to decide the moves for all of your characters and execute them all at once. Hiragana warriors (the enemy characters) have health points, and you don't know how much health or precisely how much damage you will inflict per successful attack (where attacks are always successful but only if the correct romaji was chosen). No two hiragana characters on the screen will be shown at the same time. Additionally, you don't know the order your characters and the enemy hiragana will attack in - and sometimes it's a mix. eg. Two of your characters, then all of the enemy characters, and finally your last two characters.

Herein lies my biggest problem with the game; if two of your team members are attacking a hiragana warrior and the first one defeats it, the second one will send his/her attack to some other random character on the screen, which will always fail. since the answer was specific to the one now defeated. You'll get the message on the screen that the character was wrong and you did 0 damage with that attack, despite giving the correct answer. I would rather the unit simply guard, or even rather s/he did absolutely nothing and just stood there, rather than launch an attack which is guaranteed to fail and have the game tell you that you got it wrong.

The menu to select characters is also frustrating at times. The answers are presented in two huge columns that can require quite a bit of scrolling to go through to find the answer. If you have highlighted a column on the left column and press left again (or nudge left more than required on your gamepad), it will wrap to the right making selection accidents easy. However if you are at the top of the list and need to select something near the end, you cannot wrap vertically around by pressing up - you have to slowly scroll down the entire list.

Luckily the game remembers what your character had selected previously, and as you advance, hiragana warriors will more often require an answer from the end of the list. However if you selected something like `n` (a the end of the list) one turn, and then healed an ally the next turn, the turn after that will start you back at the top of the list again.

There are more little quirks of the user interface that I found annoying. For example, running (mapped to the right trigger on my SteamOS controller) only seemed to work if the mouse cursor was not at the edge of the screen - I always had to make sure the mouse cursor was completely visible. Fade-in transitions didn't work correctly and only partially covered the screen (I was running 2560x1440 in full-screen). This might be because I was using SteamOS and Proton (see the discussion forums on how to get that working as unlike the Katakana and Kanji games Proton does not work with this game without a work-around) but it's hard to say as I didn't play it any other way.

On my SteamOS controller, the Back key was mapped to the right menu arrow (normally reserved for in-game menus and the like) and both A and B seemed to be mapped to Enter. The left thumb pad did nothing, so you need to use the left thumbstick. The right thumbpad controlled the mouse cursor, which is completely unnecessary when using the controller anyway (but bumping it can move the mouse to the edge and cause running to fail). It's probably possible that this could all be changed through Steam, although I didn't spend the time to investigate. My point is that this game was not designed with controller support in mind, which is a shame because that's much more convenient when playing such a long turn-based game. Having said that, it can be made to work and that's how I played.

Equipping weapons, armour, etc. on characters was also slightly annoying, as each character can only use one weapon type. Since this is a fixed limitation of the game, upgrading weapons could have been made easier than it is. It doesn't help that there is also another quirk in the Equip menu whereby pressing back after equipping something backs you all the way out to the main menu, instead of just back one step to the equip character selection screen.

There isn't much of a story, and there's not a lot of depth to the characters. That's okay since the focus is on learning Hiragana, but also Japanese culture and lifestyle. It's great to see NPCs talk about different drinks, Japanese weapons, types of manga, explanations of what a traditional inn and hot spring (おんせん) is like, how to call people, etc. A lot of what was explained went well beyond Hiragana and was very interesting to learn.

The game music was actually pretty good (although that music on the main screen feels out of place IMO). The pronunciation audio quality unfortunately seemed very poor, and probably due to this, I had to question at least once or twice if the audio actually matched the text perfectly. There is a reasonable amount of reading in this game, and I only encountered a single typo throughout (and I 100% completed the game and all side quests). The text is often written in a way that aims to be entertaining.

I could go on, but I'll cut to the chase. Do I recommend this game? While it's not the most fun experience, it was enough to hold my interest and I wouldn't have spent so much time studying/revising Japanese if I wasn't playing this, so I'd have to call that a win. If you don't know any Japanese at all, I think this game could be a good starting point. I purchased the game very cheap at the 2018 Christmas sale, so I easily got my money worth. It won't teach you as fast as something like Duolingo, but it's more fun and more interesting. If you see it on sale, pick this up without question. You'll then be in a good position to continue on your studies using apps like LingoDeer.",1550992905,1550992924,True,28,0,0.779567837715148926,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With those aims in mind, this game was great.  It's simple RPG filled with silly asides and generic RPG characters.  Battle are simple, slightly tedious, but the game has a leveling mechanic to help.  The game is split into a Lesson>dungeon>lesson format.  Honestly, both the lessons and the dungeons can drag out.    To the makers credit, the lessons do have good stroke order illustrations.  However, each lesson you have to click through, and then there is a quiz. The dungeons play like slandard RPG dungeons, item here, random encounter there.  It's good for what it ise

If you want to learn the language though, this will not do it.  The Kana appear in set groups, and while the groups might be random (say 4-10 groups in an area) the kana within that group never very.  So that if I encountered ""Ha, Pi, and Fu"" in one encounter, then ""Ha and Ho"" my next encounter might be either ""Ha, Pi and Fu"" or ""Ha and Ho"" but never a random group of kana that is leveled against the party.

Gameplay is basic. Very basic. It's not bad. It's just not that fascinating either. There's no encouragement for exploration. The towns I've seen so far are small and boring. Clicking on random things don't earn you any interesting dialogue nor random items, except for a rare treasure chest. The battles are simple and turn-based. You can't attack the enemy as you would in a normal JRPG. You have to search the menu for the proper phonetic sound that matches each symbol. The dungeons, at least as far as I've played, are uninteresting. The random battles trigger way too often, but at least you can escape most of them at will.      

The story is incredibly, incredibly bland and even stupid at times, but that's okay. The point of this game isn't to tell you a good story. It's to teach you Hiragana.      

The graphics are basic RPG Maker MV assets that come with the engine. I'm not mad at it. I'm not an artist. I understand completely why they were used. I also happen to think it's pleasing to the eye. However, I do wish they had taken the time to use the engine's ability to use multiple expressions for each character. Having a character have the same bland smile all the time, even when the story's scene isn't happy at all, is just ... well ... lazy. And I own a copy of RPG Maker MV. I've personally taken the time to add multiple expressions to characters. I've even added plugins to make them blink! It's not difficult at all to do. Making them blink requires a free and simple to use plugin. Adding multiple expressions requires no plugins at all. It's a simple process provided by the engine itself.      

The sounds are basic RPG Maker sounds. I have no problem with that. I do wish they were a bit creative sometimes, though, like using a slightly unexpected sound effect for certain actions in the menu, but whatever. It's nothing bad. Oh, there are also recordings of each phonetic sound in the language in each lesson. I don't think they came with the engine.      

If you want a video game that teaches you Hiragana, then here you go. If you want a grand, artistic JRPG with a complex story, stunning original artwork, and clever gameplay and exploration, then you'd be asking for too much. I'd imagine this might be the developer's first RPG Maker game, and hey, it's a solid game for what it's intended to do. Go for it.",1546066389,1546739426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle goes like this: You get a few lessons, always hiragana characters (one of the three Japanese writing systems) and sometimes vocabulary or grammar bits at the same time, then you get a main mission to do. Depending on where you are you can also get side quests by the people there, such as using the correct greetings towards others. Only towards the very end do you actually get grammar lessons, and they're rather short, but since this is primarily about writing and reading hiragana and not about sentences that is all fine by me. It does make you understand simple sentences, which is quite important.

It definitely helped me get into Japanese easily, as its 5 characters per lesson are a comfortable number while still making you learn something substantial each lesson. I do wish there was more vocabulary and that reading words instead of single hiragana was required more often.
I also liked the way it teaches dakuten and handakuten (the little marks in the top right corner of some characters) directly with their normal counterparts, that makes the task of learning the entire hiragana system a lot less daunting.

All in all, Hiragana Battle was a great experience and is generally quite a nice game.

This game is the first of three games in a series of games from developer Sleepy Duck, the art style and game play feel reminds me of the old final fantasy games and the turn based play style they used, only not as refined or as deep.

The story is simple, your country is invaded by an outside foreigner and you must fight your way across the land with the aid of your friends and Japanese hiragana teacher who will teach you the language to defeat the enemies. The game is broken up into ten chapters, each chapter featuring a new set of hiragana to learn and as you progress you will need to search your vocabulary inventory to find and use the correct letter to defeat the current enemy. The vocabulary inventory is poorly layed out; this is a problem that is fixed in later games but in this version it can make figuring out where the correct hiragana to use a bit overwhelming.

I bought this game in a bundle with the other two games in the series and paid on average about £5 per game and after playing each game I would say that you can complete each game in about 12 hours if it's your first time and much less than that if you know what your doing.

The biggest problem I have with Hiragana Battle is that there is nothing to do when you complete this game other than start a new game and begin again which is definitely this games biggest mistake, this however is something that was fxed in later games.

The real question you want to know is; Did I learn anything? The answer in short is yes. If you are serious about learning the japanese hiragana alphabet and are willing to put in the time then I highly recommend this game for you, if you looking for a deep combat game in the style of old final fantasy games and don't care about the language learning part then this game will come off as a bit of a gimmic and I'd suggest looking somewhere else.

In short, this game looks good, the game play and story are simple and easy, the price is about right for the time invested and finally but most importantly this game will teach you if you let it. It has it's flaws but it is still a good indie game and if your interested, try it.",1537776074,1537776074,True,1,0,0.532467544078826904,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I know you can just ""go on memorise"" or find some other random place to study the Hiragana. And yes I know some people only take 2-4 hours to remember all the Hiragana. But that's boring as hell and so textbook. Once you've learned Hiragana and Katakana you're going to be spending most of your time with your face inside of a textbook, so why not enjoy the first few weeks of studying Japanese?

It's been almost two years since I first started studying Japanese and I still remember the fun I had when playing through both Hiragana Battle and Katakana War. Not that JPN isn't fun--because I find it a lot more enjoyable than wasting time in competitive gaming--but you're going to have a hard time finding anything else that hasn't been ""gamified"" that isn't Hiragana or Katakana. 

Anyway, enough about Japanese--lets talk about this game. 

It's not that good to be honest, well compared to Katakana War at least. If this is your first Sleepy Duck game then you won't notice the difference of course. If you've already played Katakana War then this game is going to be pretty disappointing because this game isn't even half as much fun as that game. But, it's a start. And it's still fun. So if you haven't played any ""Learn Japanese to Survive!"" games, then definitely pick this up. 

To be honest, even though Kanji Combat's characters aren't memorable at all, I still feel like I remember the characters from there better than here. Though it has been over a year since I've played this game so it's understandable but I still remember characters from Katakana War so then again, maybe it's not. 

I mentioned that I still listen to that soundtrack that plays during lessons which I put into a one hour loop and I still use it to this day when I'm studying JPN. I heard this soundtrack in another game but I can't remember which, so I think it's one of those royalty free soundtracks. Either that, or the other game I played stole the soundtrack from this game and used it in theirs. Nonetheless, I've uploaded a one hour edit of that soundtrack onto a site--just ask me if you want it.

- A lot of reading, There is no spoken instructions it is all text except for the Vocabulary and Character Pronunciation
- Took me only about 13 hrs to complete (which can be good or bad)

The Bad:
- The font used when showing the characters is next to impossible to replicate when writing it yourself

My Opinion:
Overall a fun and well made game that effectively acheives the goal of educating the player in how to read and write the Hiragana characters as well as giving the player a decent size of vocabulary.

One thing I do recomend is not using this game alone. This game is no substetute for a real Sensei ;) 
Tools I'd recomend. A chart of all Hiragana characters and a small drywipe board for writing practice. 
Pracice writing the characters without the game And without looking at your printed chart, then play this game to test how well you've done. 

If you're just looking for a gaming experance, then I'm getting my critic hat on so hold tight. 
The RPG elements in this game I think actually hurt the quality rather than further it. 
Enemies in this game only take damage if you use their uniqe and specific weakness. Their name. 
I'm going to describe a 4 v 4 battle to you, then a 3 v 4 battle. This will get complectated but I think it's imporant to read so you understand what I'm talking about. 

あ -(A) い -(I) う-(U) and え-(E) are attacking.  
You tell your team to attack あ with A, い with I, う with U, and え with E. 
Your attacks Are correct. Therefore, you Should pass them just like any written exam. 
But the enemies are higher levels. So you run the risk of losing, even though you did nothing wrong. 
We'll say you win this fight, but your team are all 1 hit away from fainting. 

Here's the next battle. 
あ い う Are attacking your 4 man team. Again, you tell your team to attack.
Keep in mind that this is a turn based battleing system, so you have to make descisions fisrt, and Then the attacks happen. 
Person 1 and person 2 attack あ with A. 
Person 3 attacks い with I. 
And person 4 attacks う with U. 
Right so. 
Person 1's attack kills あ in one strike, so person 2 defaults his attack to the next Hiragana in line by attacking い with A. Which is incorrect, so no damage is delt.  
Person 3 attacks い with I, but it turns out い is a bit stronger than the others, so it takes 2 hits to kill it. 
Person 4 attacks う with U and う is defeated too, leaving only い remaining. 
Now it's い's turn to attack. And it does something that hurts your whole team, killing all of them. (Not likly, but possable) 
So this means that even though YOU as a player correctly itentified the Hiragana Characters, you still lose the battle.

The enemies don't show their HP stats, so you have no idea who you can kill in one hit and who you should focus your attack on. 
If this inofmation was visable like in Pokemon games I'd care less about this and move on to my next point.
Unfrtunatly by the nature of this game, every enemy is ammune to all but 1 of your arsenal of attacks. You're basacally shooting a watergun at a tank if one in your party defaults to someone else. 

So in this reviwer's opinion, Every single enemey should die in one shot if hit with the correct answer. 
The point is to learn Hiragana. If your attacks deal any damage at all then you have learned Hiragana enough to know who you're fighting. 
The RPG stuff like levels, money, magic, armor, and weapons should all be removed. 
The lore of the game is you're Saying the sounds, so holding a spear as you say it won't make a diffrince. 
In Pokemon this leveling system isn't an issue because the whole point is to grow and be the best like no one ever was. 

A better system (Keeping all the elements in play) would be to have the player select each enemy and itendify them Before descidiing to attack. Then the player just tells the party who should attack whom, and since you identified the Hiragana at the start, if you're correct the attacks will always hit even if someone swaps targets. 
Right now the comand order is Who attacks, With what, and agaisnt whom. 
Where as it should Attack whom and with what, Then we move onto Who attacks them. 
The attacks are innerchangable if you make a mistake, but if you did right the battle will be over in one round anyway. 

So ff the game makers are by chance reading this, try a syetem where the player's party can take 5 hits each before fainting, and make it so enemies can only hurt you IF you get an answer wrong.
This will make the game less about grinding levels, and more about educating yourself about the launguage, which is the entire reason people buy this game. 
You have potential for spin offs if you havn't alteady. Kanji and Katakana. By then I hope the enthesis is more on learning and not on leveling up.",1535215134,1535215978,True,10,0,0.640447318553924561,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game itself is very simplistic, as you learn how to write, read, and pronounce 5-10 Hiragana characters per lesson and then you must choose the English equivalent when you go to various areas around the map to fight them. You also learn around 50-75 Japanese vocabulary over the course of the game, as well as some beginner phrases such as how to say your name or introduce yourself. You can revisit lessons at any time as well.

One thing I really like about the game is that you can save at virtually any time, and the fullscreen mode is more like borderless fullscreen. I found it seemless to alt-tab into other applications while playing this game.

I noticed a few comments complaining about certain aspects of the game so I will address them here:

Graphics - A lot of people don't like the basic graphics, but I found them to be quite charming, especially considering the incredibly low price for the game. The graphics don't in any way subtract from the main point and attraction of the game, to learn Hiragana.

Music - You'll find the same music almost everywhere in the game. The same learning theme music for all 20ish lessons, the same battle theme for all fights in the game except the last dungeon, and the same theme when walking around the world map. However, I really liked the music, and I didn't find it repetitive since I didn't try to rush though the game or play it all in one sitting.

Combat - There really isn't much to combat other than choosing the correct English equivalent. Each party member has unique abilities, mostly defensive ones, but these are practically useless since attacking the Hiragana warriors is the best way to avoid damage and end a battle quickly. Once again though, it doesn't take away from the game since you don't really buy the game for the combat; the point is to learn Hiragana.

Grinding - Even if you fight every battle you encounter, you'll probably have to grind a bit. Each lesson you complete introduces harder enemies with more health, damage, and stronger abilities, and even if you know the English equivalent you might find your party members losing 3/4 of their maximum health per hit. Luckily, by completing side quests you can gain bonus points that can give your party instant level ups, which is incredibly useful, and if your party is a high enough level the enemies will deal 0 damage. Grinding a little bit is good thing to help you memorize the characters anyways. Another strategy to avoid grinding as much is simply escaping battles. Unless the enemy gets the upper hand, which is rare, you can instantly escape from any battle without taking any damage. So if you know the set of characters in that area well and want to move on, simply escape from each battle as you progress through the dungeon. When you get to the next dungeon, the characters might hurt since they will be harder and you didn't grind as much, but you will have to grind less now since the newer enemies give much more experience.

All in all this is a truly fantastic game. You can beat this game in around 8-10 hours as many have done, but if you really want to learn the Hiragana characters, the vocabulary, and the beginner phrases well I would recommend keeping a notebook and writing down all the lessons. A more realistic game length would be around 15-20 hours if you do this, as I did.",1533844622,1533844622,True,14,1,0.695006430149078369,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Choosing answers is painful (because they are sorted in two columns, so you'll end up with more than twenty rows, which is long to go up and down to pick the right answer. It is not much for selecting 1 answer, but you'll have to repeat it a lot which makes it boring very fast)
- Even if you pick right answer for an ennemy, it won't always oneshot him (which should be the case, since the purpose of the game is learning hiragana, not playing a j-rpg, and I would even say that since you'll just select the same answer on next turn it's just boring to hit the enemy multiple times)
- Some of your characters don't attack before enemies (so when exploring a new zone you'll always take damage, and you might have to get back to the inn to recover, which just makes time longer before next lesson without really helping you to learn)

I think Sleepy Duck didn't focus enough on the fact that we're learning japanese. If you want, you can build a game system to wrap the learning, but it mustn't be taking too much importance, and every game design choice must be in the most efficient way for learning Japanese.

I just wanted it to be more interesting than a basic textbook, and this definitely does that. It's set to feel like a traditional retro JRPG with breaks of textbook studying. The story is kind of cringeworthy at face value, but if you treat it as a metaphorical stand-in for traditional magic shenanigans, you can reasonably appreciate the world it's setting up. As long as you go in accepting that the presentation is kind of a joke in itself, it's fine.

The gameplay doesn't serve any special function but to drill what you've learned into your head for the purpose of memorization. The spells here do not really mean much. It takes up most of my energy to do anything more than the basic healing. By the time I might have afforded to exercise some tactics, I had already earned the most powerful weapons/armor to the point that most attacks literally did 0 damage against me. Granted, this was with me taking all the sidequests along the way and almost never running from an encounter. The ""game"" part of this could've been fleshed out a lot better, or at least have the magic system ripped entirely.

However, I do feel this is a fine middle ground. Making the ""game"" more relevant takes emphasis away from memorization. Removing those unnecessary game elements would remove vital parts of the presentation. This game knows it can't really take itself seriously, but it's not Deadpool, either. There's just enough presentation here that someone interested in its kind of culture can feel comfortable without so much immersion you forget you're learning. I did appreciate the various references it makes to ""otaku"" culture.

For the price, this was a fine introduction to Japanese. As I already had a lot of anime exposure prior to this, I feel like I'm seeing a lot of it in a whole new light, and I'm ready to take the next step forward.",1531688428,1531688428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-  Execution is lacking though. Don't expect mind-blowing plot, drama, graphics, battle strategy, etc.
===================================================
Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle is pretty much what you expect from the tin: you learn how to read, write, and pronounce the Hiragana characters in the Japanese language, and you fight battles involving said Hiragana characters.  

The game consists of three parts: overworld (where you travel outside of lessons and battles), lessons, and the battles. 
- 

Overworld: 

Overworld is where you can move your character Claire to places and interact with the NPC characters where you can either just get some general dialogue or receive miniquests.
-

Lessons: 

Lessons are where you learn about the Hiragana characters in the Japanese language in sets (i.e. ka, ki, ku, ke, ko / ra, ri, ru, re, ro / etc.). These lessons teach you on how to read, draw, and pronounce the character. After you finish the lesson (~5 minutes), you are then given a basic quizzed on what you learned and directed to the next plot-relevant location (namely there is bad-guy activity here, go investigate / stop it). 

These lessons do occasionally have vocabulary sessions where you learn 10 words in Hiragana (not necessarily exclusively to the ones you’ve learned up to the point) and in Romanji as well as the English translation. They help to shake things up for variety and for you to learn some words to apply your Hiragana knowledge. You are not quizzed on these…..at least immediately, but more on that later. 

You can access these lessons later if you want to review them. 

The aforementioned miniquests do a similar function, either immediately dispensing the words or after a minor search-and-recover mission taking place at a plot location. These miniquests are unlocked as the plot progresses and offer special equipment (well ""special,"" but not particularly OP) and/or money.  You can review your vocabulary with these quest-givers later on.

Battles: 

Battles are where you are tested on your knowledge in Hiragana by battling these Hiragana Warriors, enemy entities that take the form of a Hiragana character and can only be damaged by choosing the romanji associated with them in the attack menu. These battles happen spontaneously at random in the overworld at a non-safe location (namely anywhere that's not a town hub).  

You have four options in these battles: attack, magic (buff spells, status effect removal, and heals), items (basically spells without a resource bar), and escaping. If you do defeat the enemy, though, you will earn experience points which allows your characters to increase their stats and money to spend on equipment and items. 
----------------------------------
With that said, here is my opinion of the game: 
-
Immersion:
A little bit of humor here and there in the dialogue of NPCs, a nod or two to Japanese culture (i.e. recycling), but there isn't really any world-building or sense of urgency to save your fictional home country and Japan from the big bad. You do not really see any signs of the conflict upon the world.

Lessons:
Lessons are alright. My only complaint is that you are not tested to draw out the Hiragana characters (stroke order, appearance, etc.), but I suppose it is to be expected for a game at this price to not have that kind of interpretation technology on it. 

Plot:
Bad guy wants to conquer (for generic power reason), go and stop him. That’s it. There is one twist, and it’s minor, and it’s basically the same generic bad guy with a different sprite who becomes irrelevant. Other than that, there is hardly any drama, and for the one time there was, you’ll quickly forget as you advance the plot.

Characters:
Not much characterization, save for a few personality quirks in dialogue. There are no individual motivations (aside from beating the bad guy), no bonding, etc. They are just…kinda there as combat meatshields. You have only four to ""manage"" (including Claire, your character), so you don't have to do any party member juggling.  

Graphics:
Simple, but it does its job as background fluff. 

Music;
Overworld music. It's alright. Battle music.....gets old really fast.

Length:
Roughly about 10 hours. Plot sections are about 30-40 minutes each to complete. A little extra time spent on buying and selling equipment. And the rest on miniquests and overworld travel. 

Pacing:
Plot missions are about 30 minutes each. Not too bad. Roughly 45 minute play sessions if you include gearing up and learning the lessons. Enough to feel you've learned something, but not too much to have information overload.

Battles:
Strategy is not a focus in this game. Gearing is mainly straight upgrades in stats. Min-maxing isn't really an option. Almost no interesting decisions in party composition, items, and equipment due to no offensive spells and crowd-control.

Items are nearly useless due to ineffectiveness of enemy status effects (low duration) and battle length (~2 minutes). Buff spells are hardly worth using due to battle length. Healing spells mostly supercede healing items for the most part and will carry you throughout the mission.

Typical strategy is mostly the same - just gang up on one Hiragana warrior and move on to the next one. Heal if someone's low in health points. Rinse-and-repeat. 

Battles are not responsive. You just kind of just sit back and watch after you assign your attacks until the combat round ends which can be a huge problem. If an enemy dies and you have an attack assigned to them, you cannot change it, causing you to miss. If your characters gets ganged up, you cannot do anything to respond. If you make a mistake, well, better have your IRL notes ready....

Except for the final boss mission, the battle music is always the same. You will get sick of it if you play in a marathon. Breaks are recommended, for your sanity, and to space out your learning to help retain your knowledge. 

Battle spawns can become really annoying though. You can literally move only three square tiles, and boom, a battle begins. This can happen again and again, further excrabated by maze-like level design and backtracking in the level.

...on the plus side, Hiragana warriors are not exclusive to the lesson; you will be reviewed of previous characters, albiet a bias to the current lesson. Encounters are pre-set though; you will see the same pattern of Hiragana characters in a given encounter. 

That being said, the game designers try to add some variety by switching the Hiragana Warriors with Romanji versions of themselves, forcing you to choose the Hiragana characters they represent to deal damage. And much later on, vocabulary words, but that will really take you off-guard as you weren't forced to review them beforehand. 

Battles are fast though; do it right, they should not take more than 2 minutes each, and you should have just enough money to buy some upgrades after you complete your mission. Grinding isn't really required in this game.....at least if you finish the miniquests as well.
--------------------------------------------------
All in all, this game does its job in teaching you the Hiragana characters of the Japanese language. Despite my complaints, it's fun as it is an interactive way to learn the language, and the attempts in variety by adding vocabulary lessons and miniquests is appreciated as well as the Hiragana Warrior swapping. However, its execution is a little....lacking, though I suppose you can argue the focus is in the learning and not the battles or the story itself.",1531527480,1531527480,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I can say that I have learned to sound out the 46 symbols of the Hirigana, and recall them for the most part, but the game did little to reinforce the symbols. 

Ex.: after you get done with the first set ""A, I, U, E, O"" it isn't brought up through the rest of the game till around the ending where they throw EVERYTHING at you. Including words that were brought up once during a training session. Be prepared with your notes! 

The problem with not reinforcing the symbols along the way is at the end you get them mixed up COMPLETELY with other symbols that look alike. For example: Re, Wa, and Ne. The only difference between these three symbols are the tail ends. Tucked in, normal, or flicked out. So, without reinforcement these are a lost blurr.

However, they have fixed this in the second game that is Katakana where they bring up previously shown symbols all the time. Along with the spreadsheet of symbols when going to attack. It's not all muddled together now, and each set has it's own distinct line. So, it is easier to find the symbols you want, unlike in Hirigana Battle. These are the only two things that bothered me with ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle"" that they fixed in ""Learn Japanese To Survivie! Katakana War."" There is one other thing that may bother players. It's the Hiragana itself. When fighting them the letters take on the more fluid nature of a brush stroke, and the answers you have to fight back are almost blocky. Ex: Fu which looks like ふ on the answers, but the attacking ふ looks all conntected. They say as long as you know the brush order you'll be able to make the characters out, but it throws people off who are just learning it. Though, I came to appreciate it, because like in everyones writing- it is all different upon the person.

Otherwise, this was a good game and it did as it said. It showed me how to read Hiragana. Now, as for understanding what I am reading...that's not what it says it does. Though it does teach you a few words, about 60 to 70 words, a handful of introduction phrases, and how to count to 10. It also teaches you about particles and what smaller symbols in a setence of larger symbol means. Usually including the Y's (ya, yu, and yo) and Wa, Ga, O, E, and No.

    Overall, this was an enjoyable game and I'd recommended it to anyone who is just learning the very basics of Japanese writing.",1531290979,1531445454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can't really say this game is the fun way to learn hiragana. The way it shows you the hiragana characters for the first time isn't enjoyable but then it makes you fight with those characters which helps you to shift away from the 'How am I supposed to remember all of these?' part of learning hiragana and focus on just playing a video game.

This game can teach you hiragana if you're ready to practice writing and study (play) on a daily basis. However, it is not perfect. I haven't played much but literally the first dialogue you see is faulty. Ha is pronounced as wa when used as a particle and they don't mention that, also the very first Japanese word you see is こんにちわ but this 'wa' is a particle so it should have written as こんにちは.

I already knew the basics, but bought it anyways to see if I'll learn something new and still enjoy the game (and I did) Game can be completed in about 9-10 hours (or less) depending on your skills and how long you want to study. 

✔ Good game for anyone who is debuting, but highly recommended to find various sources to increase your knowledge. It will not teach you [b] every [/b] basic thing you need/should know. Genki Book series, Tae Kim, NHK, Japanese Lesson, and Tofugu are all good sources I recommend checking out.
✔ Optional guidebooks for the Hiragana Chart and Vocabulary in gameplay in case you forgot and/or want to revision what you learned. 
✔ Keeps you on your toes for the correct word usage during a battle. You cannot deal damage to the enemy or win battles if you use incorrect terms.
Tip: try not to make guessing a bad habit. flee the battle and revision what you learned and live to fight another time to have the knowledge stick.   

✘ RPG combat is too tedious. You don't know who's turn is it next unless something pops up like ""Your party has the upper hand""  you get to attack first (and will most likely win) VS ""Your party was surprised"" which means the opposite. (paraphrasing a bit but you'll get a better understanding if/when you get the game) which was a pain in the ass.
✘ Mixture of Romaji and Hiragana during lesson breakdowns. It makes sense if the game did not teach you a certain alphabet yet along with a vocabulary, but it is a bit silly to show you ""えnぴつ"" instead of ""えんぴつ"" for example.

I have not completed the game. I wanted to, I wanted to enjoy it. I wanted it to be that no budget, cute game that wins you over with its charm, but I got too bored and frustrated. I wanted to write a review as I paid for this game and want to encourage children who may not have as much money not to buy it. 
Currently in game about to leave for Japan.
The story is extremely basic, I failed to care about any of the characters or plot. This stopped me enjoying the game enough to force myself through the grind.
The RPG gameplay was useless from a game design perspective. It didn't matter what class the character was, what equiptment they were using or what spells they learned. After a while the most effective strategy is to just use two attacks on one enemy so a party of 4 can beat two hiragana a turn. Spells do make it easier to win but you waste a turn setting up and it doesn't matter you can't really loose. I didn't die once.
The level design artificially extends game time by making most levels if not all into mazes. It's not fun it's frustrating as they are not hard to navigate but when you try get all the items littered around a maze the amount of encounters is too much. I eventually gave up and started fleeing all battles to see if the game gets any more fun.
""Side quests"" taught you new words but had no way to solidify them in your mind. Just had them read to you and that's it. They could have been fleshed out and had you doing tasks relating to the words.

I wanted to like this game, the idea was such a good one and there was potential for it to be great.
If they couldn't come up with a good story the gameplay could still have been easily improved.
Dakuten could have been stronger versions of the Hiragana.
As you learn new words they could have been replaced in dialog to help learning the new words.
I found myself craving flavour text as this game is so empty. Clicking on a box that simply says ""this box is empty"" and replacing some text with learned words could have gone a long way to give the player a feeling of achievement when they start to read and understand things.
I believe the encounters should have been scrapped for fixed position fighting, like trainer battles in pokemon. This way they could be tailored to in game characters. The trainers could have used certain groups of characters that made words without you knowing so you become more familir with Japanese. Have us fight the word Katana as a final battle before getting it as loot. Or some NPC chef could battle you with su and shi then some other food.
My issue is you just go about like a zombie battling Hiragana hoping repetition will ingrain them in your memory. Maybe it will but doesn't make the game fun. 
I wanted to feel like learning the language was as much an adventure as an RPG is. Slowly learning the language at a slow and effective pace preferably in line with a good story. What I felt i got was a lot crambed in in a short space of time. There are so many simple words made of the Hiragana that the game could have been longer and more in depth and still been more enjoyable than the current state.

Not to be hateful to the devs as I'm grateful someone is attempting things like this. I'd rather this be taken as constructive critism. I think we'd have been better off if this game was more like an existing game, like a rip off of Pokemon as there'd have been less pressure to do good game design and just find places where you can gimmick Japanese into it. Like I said with the trainer battles or having the HiraganDex(Pokedex) for hiragana you encounter as yu search for them all ors some dumb thing like that.

-Learn the Hiragana characters and basic vocab in a fun way. Includes how to write and pronounce.
-Revise lessons.
-Grinding is better than flash cards.
-Very creative and innovative way to learn.

-The calligraphy is too hard to duplicate when writing.
-No mnemonic devices to help you remember.
-JRPG, so yeah, you actually have to level up and buy equipment and follow the story.

Cara, quando vi esse jogo disponível na Steam decidi comprar no exato momento e só pude jogar depois de 2 anos, mas enfim a minha compra valeu muito a pena...

Para pessoas que querem muito aprender japonês, mas não tem dinheiro para pagar um curso ou não tem a disposição para aprender por outras formas, sites e etc... Esse jogo já é uma grande iniciativa.

[h1]Aqui você aprende:[/h1]

- Como ler em Hiragana
- Como escrever em Hiragana
- Como falar (pronunciar) os hiraganas
- Aprende vocabulários
- Frases muito usadas como ありがとう (Arigatou) ou おはようございます (Ohayou Gozaimasu)
- Algumas regras gramaticais sem muitos detalhes
- Números, objetos, lugares da casa, veículos e etc.

[h1]História:[/h1]

Em questão de história ele é bem padrão, um vilão quer dominar o mundo e você precisa impedi-lo a qualquer custo, para derrotá-lo, ele invocou vários hiraganas para ajudar na destruição do mundo, mas você como protagonista precisa aprender a qualquer custo Hiragana, para derrotar todos os guerreiros Hiraganas que foram espalhados ao redor do mundo...

[h1]Sistema de Batalha:[/h1]

Como no trailer mostra, para derrotar Hiraganas vocÊ precisa escolher a tradução correta referente aquele Hiragana em específico, até o ponto de vocÊ já conseguir dominar todos os hiraganas.

[Spoiler] Mais para frente no jogo vocÊ terá que derrotar palavras ao invés de somente hiraganas e muitas das vezes acontecerá o contrário, palavras em inglês irão te atacar e você precisa escolher o hiragana específico para cada situação. [/spoiler] 

O jogo conta com Sidequest, aonde você poderá ampliar seu conhecimento em Hiragana, algumas sidequests necessitam você a comprar items que estão em japonês, então resumindo se vocÊ realmente não sentar e estudar junto com o jogo, você não poderá ter progresso no jogo, basicamente isso.

Inclusive o jogo mesmo em si recomenda ter uma caneta e um caderno para acompanhar enquanto vai jogando. Para vocÊ terem uma idéia eu chegar do início ao fim do jogo, gastei 20 páginas somente escrevendo informações, mas é recomendável comprar um caderno de caligrafia, para treinar a escrita, pois será muito últil para ti no futuro.

[h1]Em resumo:[/h1]

Em resumo, por ser um jogo feito em RPG Maker MV, contendo personagens criados no RPG Maker MV e algumas músicas tiradas do mesmo, aprender japonês com um jogo de RPG Maker realmente requer muita criatividade e potencial. Especialmente, já que com o jogo vocÊ é capaz de ler e escrever em Hiragana tranquilamente, obviamente requer muita persistência da pessoa e sabe mediar estudos, mas com um bom equilíbrio na cabeça, você realmente aprende japonês com o jogo (Pelo menos a forma mais básica 'Hiragana').

[b][i]Minha nota: 8/10 - Muito Bom 
Jogo somente em INGLÊS
Depois de concluir o jogo é recomendável aprimorar os conhecimentos em outro lugar, existem vários sites que se dedicam a aprimoração de conhecimentos, um dos que estou usando para conhecer expressões do dia-a-dia e regras gramaticais é este: https://yesjapanese.com (Somente em inglês)[/i][/b]

Opinião Final: Falta muita coisa que poderia fazer com que o jogo tivesse nota 9 para 10, como mais sidequests e mais opções de frases e vocabulários, mas não vamos esquecer de que esse é só o primeiro jogo da série, a continuação da série é aprendendo Katakana e Kanji (2 requerimentos para saber japonês de verdade) e a medida que eles foram lançando esses jogos foram melhorando a qualidade cada vez mais. Eu não pude jogar ainda, quando escrevi esse review o Katakana War, mas pela qualidade no que o jogo oferece só na loja, eu daria 9/10 e Kanji deveria dar 10/10, mas vamos esperar até eu puder tocar nesses jogos e fazer o review, ok?

J'ignore pourquoi, mais le nombre d'heure joué n'est pas correct, j'ai avec mon steam sur 2 pc différent (2 sauvegarde différent) et ca a pris la sauvegarde la moins avancé. J'ai en réalité +- 10/15h de jeu.

Je n'ai jamais pratiqué le japonais avant de jouer à ce jeu.
Et maintenant je peux lire sans trop de difficulté en hiragana.

Le jeu est en anglais mais très facile à comprendre. Pas besoin d'être bilingue pour y jouer.

je reproche 2 choses à ce jeux :
1) Les ""ennemis"" (des hiraganas) sont en écriture un peu artistique, du moins pas exactement comme l'écriture qu'on verrait sur un ordinateur ou dans un journal. Du coup quand on pratique un peu sur le côté, c'est légerement perturbant. 

2) Dans les donjons, on rencontre trop souvent les même groupe d'ennemi. Il y'a trop peu de variété de groupe d'ennemi par donjon. Plusieurs fois de suite vous vous ferez attaquer par le ""ro"" ""ru"" ""re"" et ça lassera un peu votre apprentissage.

je suis content du jeu car :
1) C'est un vrai petit rpg
2) On y apprend égallement du vocabulaire
3) on apprend à s'amusant
4) L'histoire est simpliste mais quand même présente

+ includes basic RPG systems and content, like an overworld, dungeons, npcs, shops & sidequests
+ low price for some fun >10 hours of learning through playing

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
~ just scratches a tiny bit on the topic of grammar or word order in a sentence
~ okay, though generic story, but it wraps the learning process up
~ flat characters with low character progression, but I didn't expected it anyways..

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- technical implementation could be better (but as a budget learning-game, the RPG-maker framework has to do the job I guess..):
besides the low resolution, missing quit button in main menu (like wtf?) the menu and player are really clunky to navigate/move around
- reaaaally repetitive fighting music. Had to mute it halfway through the game..
- fighting concept is very simple and repetitive (through the nature of learning vocabulary, there are not many options arguably, though I think a bit more would be possible)
- the RPG and game aspects pretty weak: difficulty curve is unbalanced, dungeon-design really dull, random enemy encounter rates are frustratingly high
- enemies in an group build-up consist always of the same 3 to 5 enemy types, more ""free"" randomness would have been apreciated

[h1]All in all[/h1] a really enjoyable learning experience, as well as entertaining as a ""game"" if you don't let yourself get annoyed by the fighting repetitiveness and lack of a deeper narrative. Just keep in mind it's more of a learning software than an actual game and you will have fun with it!

---
Teaching: Outstanding 6/6 - The game did its job, I can name or write every Hiragana without much thinking (1-3 sek).
*** Every other category below didn't really matter to me but I will give my oppinion if people do want my oppinion. ***
---
Story: Good 4/6 - The story was prety basic and somewhat predictable, (for an educational game, it was good, as it progressed the practicing of Hiragana).
---
Graphics: Very Good 5/6 - The character images were an outstanding 6/6 for me, really well made, the character sprites and the overworld were a good 4/6, pretty standard for an RPGMaker type of game.
---
Music: Very Good 5/6 - The overworld/town/area music was different so it never got stale, I enjoyed listening to it, the combat music was also good, I really liked the victory theme (after the jingle I usually continued, never letting it play, because I assumed it will be a loop).
---
Gameplay: Good 4/6 - The combat was pretty standart, the only skills your party has are support/buff skills, only the enemy had debuff and special attack skills.
---
Overall:
As an educational game: 6/6
As a turn-based RPG: 4.5/6


Long version:
This review will consist of 2 parts, a long part looking at the game as an educational game, and a short part looking at the game as a turn-based RPG. 
***I won't go much into the story to avoid spoilers, though some minor spoilers might occur.***

As an educational game, the goal of ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle"" is to teach you Hiragana. In the end, you will know how to read, write and pronounce every Hiragana. As the game suggests, do have a notebook and a pen ready so you can take notes and practice.
- Lessons:
At the start of each lesson, the game shows you (with minor exceptions) 5 Hiragana characters and tells you one by one,  how to pronounce, read and correctly write each of them. In those lessons, you can take your time to repeat the pronunciation and practice how to write each character in your notebook. Some characters were easy to write and I needed only 1-2 tries to copy the animation, some characters were more difficult and took me up to 6 tries. Now practicing to ""perfectly"" write every Hiragana was just for my satisfaction and is in no way required to progress through the game. In the end of each lesson, there is a small quiz showing you the Hiragana and you need to choose the coresponding sound in English and then vice versa.
Some lessons also include useful vocabulary of comonly used words. You can see the word written in Romaji (with English letters), then written in Hiragana (only the characters you've already learned, the others were in English syllables) and finally the translation what the word means.
At the end, there are also lessons of some sentences like introducing yourself, how to thank people etc.
- Revising
After passing the small quiz, it's time to start revising/practicing the Hiragana characters you just learned. This is done by going into different places (following the main story quest) which are overrun by Hiragana. When you meet them, you have to choose the right English sound to match it with, if you chose correctly, you'll do damage to the Hiragana, if you choose the incorrect sillable, you do no damage. Later in the game, you'll also see the English syllables and you need to choose the correct Hiragana to match them with. [spoiler]At the very end, words formed of Hiragana will attack you and you have to choose the correct word. The final boss battle also had an unique battle style for the game.[/spoiler]
At later stages, you might not only find the Hiragana you just learned from the lesson, but also find some older Hiragana, that way you can practice newly learned Hiragana and revise the ones from previous lessons.
A minor complaint I had with the battles was, that the different Hiragana characters were put into ""sets"" and before every battle, a set was randomly chosen by the game. On occasions this led to having to fight the same set of Hiragana 4 times in a row where all the Hiragana were positioned the exact same way.
- Extra Learning
The game offers additional learning content in form of side quests. I highly recommend doing them, as it teaches you aditional words and phrases after completing the sidequest. Those quests reward you also with Bonus Points, you can exchange 10 of them for a free instant level up for the whole party (completely optional). If you are purely playing for the educational part, I would suggest using them, as you will be overleveled, meaning you will be outspeeding the Hiragana and defeating them in one hit. ""But won't this make the game too easy?"" - I hear you ask? Well, not really, because if you choose the wrong syllable, no matter how overleveled you are, you will do 0 damage for getting it wrong, the only other point is the Hiragana will be unable to defeat you because of your high defence and life points. For me it was just ""Ok, I got the right sound, enemy should be defeated so I can move on"" or ""Oh, I got the wrong one, let me try again"".
- Conclusion
I am really satisfied as how the game teaches Hiragana, I am totally recomending it, the developers did an outstanding job! I already got me ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War"" and will get me ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Combat"" when  it releases.

===

I won't review ""Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle"" as a turn-based RPG that deeply, as I am not the biggest fan of the genre, but I don't really mind playing them either. You'll have (soon after the beginning) a party of 4 people. The plot is pretty straightforward, a bad guy wants to take over Japan and you need to stop him.
- Know your Enemy
Before going out to fight your enemy, you get some lore about their only weakness, namely you understanding their name (a la Rumpelstiltskin). If you get the name of the enemy correct, they take damage, if not, you can't harm them at all. 
- Get stronger
By defeating the enemy, you get experience and money. By leveling up, your characters are getting different special skills, although, the only skills your party gets are support and buff skills. The enemy on the other hand gets debuff and special attack skills.
- Side quests and gear
By doing the optional side quests, you get some money or items and Bonus Points, by collecting 10 BP, you can trade them in for an instant level up for the whole party. It really depends if you want to have a challenge or to be overpowered, so only use them if you want. The local shops also offer a variety of equipment and items to help you on your quest.

The only minor complaint I had was when viewing your character stats, when viewing one, you couldn't switch to the other char by simply pressing left or right, you had to go back to the stat menu and manually choose the other character (funny enough, in the ""buy"" screen in shop, pressing left or right did go to the other characters). Another minor complaint was the order of the 4 characters, one of them is so slow, the order was always 1, 2, 4, 3 (you do get some speed modifying gear later on though).

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
All in all, I played the game for its educational part, I am really satisfied, the price is right, I will most definitely play the other 2 games of the same developer involving Katakana and soon Kanji.

The game presents itself with the plot of a traditional turn based JRPG, as a, per say, a 2D Final Fantasy, with a main character living in a forgotten town where some day a villain arrives trying to conquer them, and our character is the unsuspected hero that's up for beating badies, until they find out that the enemies are.... japanese symbols inmune to all damage unless you know their meaning!... the usual, right?... and so the game stablishes a mechanic that forces you to learn if you want to advance, and has all quests revolving around this, adding a new set of symbols slowly so you don't get overwhelmed, and some grammar details and sugestions that help you understanding.

The artistic concept is rather simple and not very impressive, but provides with a distinctive apearance for each character you play, areas, npcs and everything else in a good measure. As for the plot story, it isn't very original or creative, but does just enough to work with a character that fights written symbols for a living.

At the end this game delievers what it promises, it will teach you basic japanese, and if you go with the flow and don 't cheat your way through, you'll be obligated to learn the full set of Hiragana characters, the numbers, some basic phrases and nouns if you want to be able to beat it. [b]IT'S VERY BASIC[/b] so if you have already learned this, this game has not much else to offer.

Starting with this game really helped me jump into the learning with Hiragana visualized in my mind instead of our plain old letters.

It is plain old rote learning with a few fun cultural tidbits tossed in to spice it up here and there.

Leveling your party and keeping them geared make things move faster so you can one shot enemies instead of ga gu gaing them to death slowly (by slow I mean two hits but it really does get tiring seeing that same damn letter you know and needing extra hits to vanquish it)

Speaking of seeing the same letters the fights aren’t randomized enough. The enemies seem to come in pre made sets. So sometime you might want to get practice on す but さしそ show up 6 times in a row. So by the time the stage is over you can’t remember SU and you have a hate for SA SHI SO.

But the lessons can be intense and overwhelming. But that's just how the japanese language is. 

Hiragana is the most basic levels of their language. It doesn't prepare you for everything, but it's a great place to start. Then follow it up with Kanji. The Japanese educational system states that in order to be literate in Japanese (or Nihon Go), you need to know at least two-thousand characters. Kanji was formed using Chinese characters to reduce the need for large banners and signs in Japan. During each lesson, you have some practice to do first. I highly recommend not skimping on the practice if you're serious about learning Japanese. And daily review is critical. As the saying goes, ""if you don't use it, you lose it."" 

Just think back to something you used to do well but haven't done in a while (years). You'll find your skills to be rusty at best. Even if you just look at the characters once a day and say the sounds & words out loud, you'll keep it fresh in your mind, at least enough to pick it up when you get involved with Japanese again.

[u]Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle[/u] เป็นเกมที่สร้างสรรค์และมีประโยชน์อย่างมากสำหรับผู้ที่สนใจจะเริ่มต้นเรียนภาษาญี่ปุ่น ตัวเกมใช้โปรแกรม RPG Maker ในการสร้าง แน่นอนเกมจึงออกมาในรูปแบบ Old school JRPG ทำให้เล่นง่ายและเข้าถึงได้ทุกเพศทุกวัย ต่อไปเป็นข้อดี-ข้อเสียในความคิดเห็นส่วนตัวของผม

+เป็นเกมแนว JPRG สไตล์ดั้งเดิม (แนวๆ DQ หรือ FF ภาคเก่าๆ) ทำให้เล่นง่ายมาก
+เนื้อเรื่องสนุกสไตล์ JRPG ผู้กล้ากู้โลกประมาณนั้น
+เกมเน้นไปที่การสอนอ่าน-เขียนตัวหนังสือฮิรากานะ ซึ่งเหมาะสมสำหรับผู้เริ่มต้นเรียนภาษาญี่ปุ่นเป็นอย่างมาก
+มีคำศัพท์ญี่ปุ่นที่มักพบชีวิตประจำวันให้เยอะพอสมควร
+มีการสอนรูปแบบประโยคการใช้คำเชื่อมญี่ปุ่นทั่วๆไป
+ให้เรารู้วัฒนธรรมเล็กๆน้อยของญี่ปุ่น เผื่อใช้ประโยชน์ได้เวลาที่เราไปอยู่ที่ประเทศเขา
+-อย่างที่ว่าเกมเป็นแนว JRPG ดั้งเดิม ทำให้เวลาเข้าดันเจี้ยนจะถูกดึงเข้าฉากต่อสู้บ่อยๆเพื่อเก็บเลเวลตัวละคร คนที่ไม่ชอบอาจจะเบื่อมาก แต่ข้อดีของมันก็คือทำให้เราจำตัวหนังสือหรือศัพท์นั้นๆได้ขึ้นใจ
-Game Play ซ้ำซากไปหน่อย เรียน ลงดัน กลับมาเรียน ลงดัน วนอยู่แค่นี้ แต่ก็พอเข้าใจว่าผู้สร้างไม่อยากให้เราว็อกแว็กจากสิ่งที่เขาอยากสอน
[u]คะแนน 9.5/10[/u]

[b]สุดท้ายสำหรับผม เกมนี้ก็ไม่เหมาะสำหรับผู้ที่ไม่ได้สนใจอยากจะเรียนรู้ภาษาญี่ปุ่น หรือคนที่รู้ภาษาญี่ปุ่นอยู่แล้วเลย เพราะตัวเกมไม่มีอะไรให้คุณเลยนอกจากความรู้เกี่ยวกับภาษาญี่ปุ่นเบื้องต้น แต่ถ้าใครสนใจจะเริ่มเรียนภาษาญี่ปุ่นล่ะก็อย่ารอช้า กดซื้อได้เลย ราคา 169 บาท ได้ขนาดนี้ถือว่าคุ้มสุดๆครับผม

Oynarken gerçekten çok eğlendim. Üstelik daha önce hiç JRPG oynamamıştım, rpg biliyorum fakat Japon rpg'sine yabancıydım. Ama kısa sürede alışıp senaryoda ilerlemek için delirdim. Tabi eğitim odaklı oyun olduğundan normaldeki gibi öyle çat diye ilerleyemiyorsunuz, dersleri alıp ondan sonra gidebiliyorsunuz ancak. Kendime bunun için özel bir defter ayırdım, gösterdiği tüm harfleri, tüm kelimeleri oturup çizdim (bunu yapmak da çok eğlenceli). 20 saat oynadım ama kazanımı gerçekten çok büyük. Böyle bir oyunu kim düşündü, kim yarattıysa tebrik ediyorum, tek kelimeyle harika.

Almayı düşünen varsa söyleyeceklerim:
1- İndirimde çok ucuza düşüyor (2.60 tl gibi komik bir para), o zaman alabilirsiniz.
2- Oynarken muhakkak side quest'leri de yapın. Her biri size az da olsa yeni kelimeler öğretiyor. Ne kadar şey öğrenirsek o kadar kâr.
3- Bir süre sonra kasabadaki silahçının sattığı armor ve silahların size yetmediğini göreceksiniz (ilerledikçe daha güçlü harflerle karşılaşıyorsunuz, sizin ekipmanınızla yenmesi zor oluyor). O yüzden gezerken sandıkları arayın, bulun. İçinden güzel silah ve armor çıkacaktır.
4- 3'le bağlantılı olarak, yine de çok fazla bir çeşitlilik beklemeyin, oyunun ilgi odağı farklı çünkü. Ama çeşitliliğin az olması kötü yapmıyor, yeterli yani.
5- Telaffuzlarını kendi kendinize tekrar edin evde yüksek sesle. 
6- İlk başlarda kelime öğretirken, kelimede henüz öğrenmediğiniz heceleri Hiragana ile değil normal Latin harfleriyle yazıyor. Benim önerim, hece öğrenmeyi tamamladıktan sonra, alın ve o eski kelimeleri siz yazmayı deneyin, tabi öğrendiğiniz yeni hecelerle birlikte.

Ich lerne aktiv die Japanische Sprache und kann daher, meines erachtens nach, relativ gut einschätzen wie gut dieses ""Spiel"" ist.

Wer keinen Plan von der Sprache hat jedoch interessiert wäre diese zu lernen, kann hiermit schonmal nichts falsch machen.
Hier lernen wir die Japanische ""Hiragana"" Silbenschrift und einige Vokabeln welche hilfreich einen einfacheren Start in die Sprache gewähren und das auf Spielerisch einfache weise. Für jemanden der gerade erst anfängt sicherlich verlockend und gut, ein Fazit welches 'ich persönlich' jedoch geschlossen habe ist, das es mit Büchern und einer entschlossenen Einstellung weitaus schneller funktioniert.

Schönes Konzept und gut gemacht! Aber für mich dann doch etwas zu langsam und zu oberflächlich.

In my opinion, the gameplay is just a nice touch accompanying the lessons but it does have positive aspects. In general it's an average JRPG, but when you think you've seen about all the gameplay this game has to offer, it changes intruducing a new mechanic. There are several sidequests, that I suggest to play, that will teach you more expressions and words and if you complete them all you also get a discount code to use on the devs' website!

[b] Como estudiante de japonés desde escasos seis meses, este juego no me parece ni cerca la mejor forma de aprender el silabario básico del japonés (hiragana) [/b], debido a que lo ideal es aprender el silabario en un mes o menos para un curso más serio, pues es lo más básico. Entre las formas principales para aprenderlo puede ser con fichas de los caracteres, escribiendo palabras en español con hiragana hasta memorizarlo, o si se sabe de antemano inglés se puede usar la app de Dr. Moku, que ayuda a aprender el silabario de una forma bastante didáctica. Para maneras rápidas que cuesten menos o nada se pueden escribir varios párrafos.

Sin embargo, antes de empezar a estudiar formalmente japonés, compré este juego, y fue el que me motivó a aprender el idioma, siendo que con la práctica no es tan dificil en realidad, y pude seguir de una forma más intensiva. Ese es el punto fuerte de este juego y en el que se basa: quitar el formato de clase y enseñar sin hacerlo tedioso o más fácil de dejar de lado. Antes de japónés, aprendí inglés por obligación escolar, e intenté aprender francés, alemán y catalán, pero siempre los dejé de lado y no continué por desidia y pereza.

En las clases de idioma que tengo, son tres horas a la semana, y en un mes nuestro sensei ya quería que supieramos este silabario y el katakana, el silabario que se usa para palabras extranjeras, y la verdad no era tan dificil si se usaba un método como los que ya mencioné, y este juego en serio me parece que avanza lento en cuanto al aprendizaje.

Las lecciones consisten en las que son para enseñar las nuevas sílabas, que suelen venir con notas sobre vocabulario y cosas que son como el dakuten, o la pronunciación de los tsu disminuidos, que son lo que en español sería como la pronunciación de una tilde o acento, pronunciación de sílabas con ""ll"" o ""ch"", entre otras cosas. En ocaciones habrán lecciones extras con cosas como vocabulario o esa ""ortografia"" del japonés. Despues de estas lecciones, se pasa a el juego de JRPG clásico, y se pueden repasar todas las lecciones.

Respecto a la jugabilidad, el sistema de juego es como el típico RPG japonés como Final Fantasy o la saga de Chrono, y tiene una historia simple que cumple con su cometido. En esta fusión con el RPG y las lecciones ví que la idea suena muy bien, pero básicamente sólo se van respondiendo preguntas sobre qué significa cada símbolo, y ya. Ese es todo el sistema de combate: responder qué significa el signo del enemigo e irle haciendo daño hasta debilitarlo. Esto no sé si verlo positiva o negativamente, porque es cierto que el practicar es la escencia del estudio de un idioma, pero se me volvió tedioso, y más en partes que simplemente no alcanzaba a avanzar rápidamente al final del nivel, y al no matar a los enemigos a tiempo, va bajando la vida gradualmente hasta agotar los suministros y se complica mucho el juego.

Sin duda es importante que existan más juegos anhelando como mínimo lo que aquí se logra, más  allá de los juegos infantiles para enseñar a sumar y restar, que en verdad sirvan de material didáctico a personas de todas las edades. El juego dista aún de ser una manera de entre las mejores para aprender hiragana, pero sí puede ser de las mejores para motivar a empezar con el estudio de un lenguaje de una cultura tan interesante e importante como la japonesa. Como sea, cada quién aprende una lengua a su manera.",1512802073,1514088012,True,18,0,0.695751965045928955,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sorry to say but trying to make learning a game is viable but definetly not in the way it was tried to be done here, while I can appreciate the effort put in the lessons and educational part of the game, trying to use RPG maker to make it was a mistake, the RPG part takes too much of the game and I dont think I should feel forced to grind with useless battles constantly of characters I already know until I am high level enough for the next part of the game.

The RPG aspect gets in the way far too much to be enjoyable, not to mention the gameplay part is horrendus.

Other than that if you know nothing about Hiragana coming in then this will teach all the basics you need to know. The encounter rate is fairly high, of which it needs to be, and should give you enough encounters per area to memorize each set of characters. Once you reach a certain point of the game some of the characters that are introduced will stop appearing in favor of newer ones. Use the wrong translation and no damage will be dealt. Fighitng every battle will let you breeze through the game so long as you also did the sidequests.

When each of the lessons are presented the stroke orders of each of the characters will be, as well as sounded out, drawn out and then further allowing you to hear, and see, the sound and stroke order as many times as it takes. Some of the lessons will even give you some introductory grammer lessons in how they are used as is the case with や, つ, ゆ, and よ as well as a few others.

As with any learning endeavor, the journey does not end here just because you beat the game.

Hiragana Battle is a helpful tool for learning Hiragana for the first time, in an interesting and engaging way. Unfortunately, it has plenty of shortcomings, but I think it's still a worthwhile pick-up if you're looking for something to spruce up your studying a bit.

The game introduces you to Hiragana characters in sets of 5 and then you go on to ""fight"" them in various locations. In order to deal damage to an enemy Hiragana, you just need to provide the correct sound that Hiragana corresponds to.

Pros:
- Decent RPG with most of the basic elements you would expect (equipment, stats and skills)
- A kinda decent story, which is a welcome surprise given the game's purpose and subject
- A few cool music pieces
- Good in-game lessons and study guides
- Some vocabulary and phrases besides Hiragana are also provided

Cons:
- Bugs : I had a memory leak occuring around every 30 minutes. Extremely annoying, game would crash. Couple that with the game not having an auto-save feature and you can lose several minutes of progress at a time. Save as often as you can. 
- The game tries a bit too much to be an actual RPG which sometimes gets in the way of learning. Fall a bit behind in equipment or levels and you'll have trouble progressing, which can be annoying if you feel you've already learned the current set of Hiragana already. Thankfully it doesn't take too much to grind yourself back up to where you should be.
-  Another huge problem I had with the game is that the Hiragana that you fight were not really random and mixed-up. Each fight you get into is more or less against the same Hiragana in every region, making it very hard to learn all the Hiragana properly. As new Hiragana are introduced, you almost never fight any of the older ones, making it really easy to forget them. This should have been the best part of the game for learning and yet it's not there.
- Some Quality of Life improvements are really missing. Why is there no option to return to base immediately while in a dungeon?

The game does a fairly okay job at introducing the player to each hiragana character, though with some problems.
It introduces the characters in sets, showing each one to the player and providing the sound and how the character would be written on paper. This would be fine, if it were not for the very poor choices in fonts which don't even remain consistent in the game, switching between caligraphy styles and more web-safe fonts.

Other than that, having to 'kill' each character repeatedly over the course of the game is a solid way of giving the player the chance to memorize each character's associated sound. The game also provides minor side lessons on actual words which help show how the characters would sound when pronounced together.

[b]As a game[/b]
This is where everything falls apart. You have to REALLY enjoy retro JRPGs to wade through this incredible mess.
The game is blatantly a very poor RPG maker product, including all the out of the box issues with no added quality of life enhancements.

[b]Together[/b]
The issues [i]Learn Japanes to Survive! Hiragana Battle[/i] presents as a game, seriously hinder the quality as a learning tool. The point of a learning game is to make learning interesting and fun, and this game did not do it. Battles were the main flaw, though wandering through empty mazes  while being battered with random encounters helped bring everything down.

The idea of the battles was fine. Fight hiragana characters by attacking them with the matching sounds. This was a good idea. The issue a culmination of having a long list of sounds to search through everytime you want to hit something, not being able to click directly on the character once you have the selected sound, then having to do this for each member of your party even if there's not enough characters to go around, possibly multiple times during the battle if you're not strong enough to kill the characters in one hit,  and then waiting for the battle to play out.

It would have worked much better if each fight was always 4 characters lined up, one for each party member, selecting the sounds for each, and then having it all go down at once with one-hit kills. Incorrect selections would of course result in party members taking damage, and any surviving characters would need to be attacked again, [i]but only by the party member they were lind up with[/i].

Katakana Battle. I'm glad I played that one first, because I don't think I would have given it a shot if this was my introduction to the series.

There's too many frustrations to enjoy the experience. On the learning side, the ""how to draw"" segments are painfully ambigious for some characters, making it hard to tell when a stroke is actually connected. I wish they would show us the font's rendering of the character during these segments, so that I can tell how to *actually* draw it. Additionally, vocabulary is almost always ""here's the word, next"" rather than any reinforcement learning.

The gameplay itself, though, is painful. Without a lot - a lot! - of grinding, basic encounters will shred your party. This makes for a very frustrating gameplay loop. I wasn't actually able to finish the game; I got to a point where there was a gauntlet of encounters without healing between, and I couldn't pass it without committing to a lot of grinding. I did cover the entire alphabet before tapping out. The encounter rate is very high, and the map design requires a lot of back-and-forthing, making combats a nuisance. Eventually I just started running from most of them, which probably contributed to my under-poweredness. Enemy encounters were frustratingly non-varied; most areas seem to have only two different sets of enemies, rarely going back to earlier characters.

Это необычный обзор. Потому что эта игра имеет свою уникальную особенность. Изучение Хираганы. Учитывая историю языка, то Хирагана  появилпсь в 8 веке, после кандзи. В основном хирагана использует лишь японские слова. Так же в хирагане всего 5 согласных: ā, ī, ē, ō, ū.  Но не будем над этим зацикливаться,и перейдем к самой игре. Игра представляет собою JRPG, где ваши враги- это иерогрифы хираганы. И вы должны для каждого иерогрифа использовать определенную атаеу, а иначе проиграете. Тем самым вас учит понимать тот или иной слог. Например если перед вами "" こ "", то вы должны выбрать ""ko"", чтобы успешно атаковать.На этом и зацикленпроцесс игры, но при этгм имея сюжет, и геймплей похожий на ранние Финалки. Если вы хотите знать азы, то настоятельно рекомендую эту игру. Потому что японский язык тесно связан с Хираганой и многие советуют изучать именно с этого алфавита. Катакана же использует заимствования с иностранных языков и имеет отдельный алфавит. Как и кандзи, которая насчитывает 5 к символов в алфавите и средний японец знает лишь 1-2 к. Кстати кандзи пришла как раз с Китая. Но это уже лишняя лирика, если вы серьезно решили обучаться этому языку.

A história do jogo é simples: um cara invade uma vila e quer domina-la usando seu exército de Hiraganas, então o que você tem que fazer é duelar contra as letras, escrevendo seus significados, e controlar toda a situação.

O interessante do game é que ele te ensina realmente o básico: como é composto o alfabeto japonês, para que serve o hiragana e as diferenças dos alfabetos. 

O jogo trabalha com o sistema de decorar: você entra no mapa, fica andando por ele até aparecer uma letra X, duela com aquela letra e ganha pontos. Fazer isso 100 vezes faz você decorar aquela letra de forma não tão rápida, mas bem divertida e recebendo prêmios no final.

O que acho ruim é que, como gosto muito de idiomas, sempre aprendi a não focar em muitas coisas ao mesmo tempo. Exemplo: se estou aprendendo a ler um símbolo, se torna inútil aprender a escreve-lo, já que meu foco deve ser APENAS para aprender o que é o simbolo. Isso faz sentido pra você? Se não, vou te mais um exemplo: quando você é criança e não sabe escrever, isso te impede de falar? De entender o que é dito? Não. Acontece que, não precisamos saber escrever ou saber gramática para falar um idioma, precisamos apenas aprender o idioma no geral e o resto é uma consequência de outro tipo de estudo. Estou dizendo isso porque no jogo, no meio da explicação, ele te ensina palavras soltas e ensina a escrever, o que na minha visão não é tão útil assim, já que eu não posso perder meu foco em entender o que um simbolo X significa para tentar aprender uma palavra inteira ou até mesmo escreve-lo num papel.

Como nota adicional, los desarrolladores escriben en repetidas ocasiones 「こんにちわ」 (konnichiwa) sin tener en cuenta que esta es una palabra compuesta con la partícula ""wa"" は, y su escritura correcta es 「こんにちは」 (konnichi wa).

There are certain segments of the game that reverses this and makes you fight ""a"" with ""あ,"" but unfortunately, you cannot revisit those sections--they're a one-time event.

The biggest downside to this game is that you cannot use this game to practice all the hiragana it teaches you. While you can revisit areas of the game and fight the same ""blocks"" they assigned, they never toss all the hiragana together outside of boss battles that you cannot revisit--hence why I'm about to link you to outside practice. The downside that you don't see when you don't practice all the hiragana together is that there are several hiragana that can easily be confused that are never presented together, so you might never realize it's a problem unless your practice.

I will always appreciate the devs for making the game and the enthusiasm they have for Japanese, but I would recommend You Can Kana for a straightforward experience of learning hiragana and being able to practice it all in one place:

This was wonderful. I just finished the game a little bit ago, and I've already purchased Katakana War. I was using Duolingo on my phone, but honestly, this game had me learning and speaking Japanese much faster. I can highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to learn the basics to Japanese. We all have to start somewhere!

+ Makes learning Hiragana simple
+ Battle system is easy to understand and gives much nostalgia to anyone who played JRPGs in the 90's
+ Very easy to view previous lessons
+ Side quest that teach you new words
+ A quick look into sentence structure. It's basic, but I believe it'll help me a lot.
+ No grinding required, but if you wish to, grinding is fun because you're learning the whole time
+ The soundtrack is surprisingly good and catchy. Wish I could get a download of it

- No real end game content. I was hoping for a place to battle that would help learn new words.
- Can be kind of too easy at times. But if you find it too easy, you can just run from any battle (except bosses)
- A few cities on the world map you can't visit. It's a small complaint, but it was leading me to believe there were more side quest and end game content. Nope lol.

All together, I'd give this game a 9/10. Great for learning, fun to play, and the story is simple but isn't boring by any means. Ready to see what happens next and learn Katakana on the way!",1499651168,1499651168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First of all for anyone who is starting to learn japanese, Go for the order Hiragana-Katakana-Kanji (Hiragana First).
second, This Game should take you from 15-20 gameplay hours depending on your focus level ( I took like 17.5).
Thirdly, This Game Isn't That Fun as you'd expect but not dull AT ALL!!!, the story was actually awesome, the finale was perfect and the way the game allows you to memorise symbols is clever and intuitive!
Side Quests give the game extra fun and more multi-tasking and finishing all of them will get you a reward ;)
After you finish this game ""immediately"" you should be able to:
1- Remember minimum 40 Hiragana (46 Total)
2-Read Hiragana (slowly but surely!)
3-Write Hiragana(not perfectly but surely!)
4-Understand very little basic Grammar notes
5-Know at least 10 japanese words (if you focus truly you can know like a 70!)

Drawbacks:
1-Game shouldn't cost more than 5$, my problem is that i live in Egypt where 1 dollar = 18.5 pounds so 2 dollars cause a huge difference
2-Combat can get boring especially when you get the same exact scenario twice in a row(3 times once!)
3-Some Maps will have Combat Encounters every 3 sec which sucks if you want to avoid them because you insured that you remember the Hiragana
4-Some Places on the world map aren't meant to be visited and will always be locked which can turn off the player after he finishes the game
5-Glitch where if you go to the ship (Won't Spoil) manually as of to the place you find it first at you will turn to a ghost
6-No AutoSaving System (Not really a problem unless you forget) BUT THEY REMIND YOU SO FORGET THIS ONE
7-You Can't Skip lessons when you review them which sucks when you forget like 1 of the symbols from a set
8-Can't customize players which isn't really a problem to be honest.

-Story is cool
-Characters are funny.
-Good for memorising Hiragana.. (IF you dont lose your cool over this HORRIBLE game system.)

The rest is sh*t (sorry):
-The menu is one of the worst ever
-The controles are HORIBLE..
-The combat system is HORIBLE and frustrating.
-The sidequests are sh**ty AF and at the first 10lvls they are almost INEXISTENT.
-The quest log is... ONLY for Sidequests... SERIOUSLY? SERIOUSLY???? 
-Cant skip the writing example when its not even needed to complete the game.. Wow.
-Map designed like labyrinth and its REALLY frustrating.


The game is NOT learning-Friendly AT ALL
This RPG was made for the skilled HARDCORE RPG players:
-No [Easy,Normal,Hard] mode choices.
-You have to go back to the main town to know what is the MAIN objectives.
-You CANT avoid enemies when there are ""side activities"" that are tied to the main progresion of the game.
-Health in this game is almost inexistant.

And im not saying that Super easy game to learn language is better.. ITS WORST... 
And I think the one who made this game is a bit more on the RIGHT path to make a GOOD learning game.
But honestly.. 99.9% of Learning games i've played are all TRASH.
Seems like those who makes learning games.. either think, I can do the game.. so its a good game.
OR, The game is way too hard for a 1yo child. Gotta be easier..
Seriously I just dont get it... Seems like its IMPOSIBLE to have just the RIGHT learning game.
With money or not. I found one on my phone, and its way better tho.. I think its the best learning game ever made. 
I wont tell the name here cause it would be really sh*tty of me, but yah.. Just that..
Learning game dont know ""Perfect middle"". Its either stupidly hard (Like this one) Or Stupidly easy.
Both are not worth playing IMO. 
Whit that said, Id say this game would be ""OK"" with a dificultu system. But not worth 8$. Not at all. 
The story itself is the best part, and the only reason Im not gonna take a refund on this.

The fighting system plain sucks.

If he already died, your move is wasted. The Guard action seems to be completely useless. You have to grind levels very early, or you will just get fucked over (even if you don't do any mistakes). The enemies you will fight against are not really randomized... it will happen pretty often, that you will fight the same ones over and over and over.... which really sucks because you have to grind.

As a learning tool, I'd say do yourself a favor and skip this game. Instead, get Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War, which is much more refined and a great learning tool. Hiragana Battle had me chugging potions left and right, with me unable to keep my characters alive through simple battles. I think this game should be skill based, where I do well in the game if I am learning the Hiragana characters. Instead, it is grind based, where I do well only if I sit through repetitive battles with Hiragana characters I've already mastered, levelling up my heroes to a point where they can actually endure the enemie's attacks. Zones are long, with poorly randomized enemies. For example, the same three Hiragana characters will show over and over in a zone, and it takes away from learning individual characters, instead optimizing learning a set of unrelated characters.


One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the combat system. If I have four of my heroes attack one Hiragana character, and the third attack kills the Hiragana, the fourth character will send his named attack to a Hiragana that is still alive, which is the wrong name, ineffective and a wasted attack. There is no way to tell how many attacks a Hiragana character needs to take in order to die, so this problem happens over and over again. Again, Katakana War fixed this problem completely, which is why I don't recommend Hiragana Battle. I'd say use something like Duolingo or Ankiweb for learning Hiragana, and use Katakana War to learn Katakana. This game is just a waste of time because of the grinding that doesn't scale with my actual knowledge.",1499021236,1499021416,False,4,0,0.485354423522949219,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I've tried several ways to approach learning hiragana, just for the sake of entertainment and not as a serious endevour.
Learn Japanese To Survive had an actual good approach to this, integrating repeating a hiragana character over and over until it stuck by making it an integrated combat mechanic. The problem is, that they wanted to fit the Final Fantasy-esque combat ontop it so bad, that it makes the combat extremely boring. Combat is basically this: A Hiragana character can only be damaged by choosing the equivalent English sounding word/letter. Damaged, not killed. So this means, if you know the character, you have to click the same sound multiple times to kill it. So you think for ~2 seconds what the sound is, use ~6 seconds to plot it in (multiple times) and wait ~20 seconds for your choices to resolve. Repetition is key to learning a language, but instead you end up using the majority of the time just finding the sound and waiting for it to resolve.

If voice recognition is good enough, a better approach would be a voice-controlled Guitar Hero-like game where you could get past the thinking aspect and just get the letters out on reflex.

It is kind of overwhelming when you get to learn a new language. Especially with such a complex language like Japanese.
I have just started playing/learning, and I am happy so far with this.
This game is more than just that, besides engaging into the story itself, it also serves it purpose without being too overwhelming with one thing at a time. Yes, there are free websites where you can learn Hiragana and such, but personally I need something to keep myself motivated into continuing on learning, and ""Learn Japanese To Survive: Hiragana Battle"" does that with the interactivity it offers, being a game made with RPG Maker. Plus said ""free"" websites usually start spitting complex words on you without even telling how is each letter/character pronounced.
One example, when I tried Livemocha, the first word they gave me was ""Otokonohito"" (man). How exactly is every letter in ""おとこのひと"" pronounced?! Is it Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana?!
Instead, ""Learn Japanese to Survive: Hiragana Battle"" started with the basics, with a simple lesson on vowels; how are they pronounced, how are they written and such.

Here is a list of the things that the game could have done much better:
- Better combat animations: Animations such as in old Final Fantasy games would not have been difficult to implement.
- Allowing you to type instead of selecting from a list
- Making the list from which you select answers in 5 colums with a seperate for the ""n"". Maybe they do this later, but it should have been like that from the start.
- Not have the first word that is thaught be ""sushi"", that is just shallow.


Things it does well:
- Early weapons remind me of Dragon Quest: First shields are pod lids. Heck the first polearm is a post (original and funny)
- Immidiatly teach how kana pronounciation can change by adding one of the two kana modifiers.
- The reward for my first battle (to the death I imagine) was 78 yen, I laughed

I am not a big review writer so bare with me :D

I already knew how to read hiragana prior to this which made progressing a lot easier for me, but I had no clue how to write it.

This game managed to get me to grab a notebook and spend half my gametime writing each character over and over again across 10+ pages... I don't even like writing in English ffs.
After 9 hours of gameplay across 3 days, I can proudly say I can write all 46 characters by memory! 

Anyways,

Pro's:
- Really engraves Hiragana into your mind through repetition (a lot of it)
- If you don't mind grindy games like me, this game can be really fun.
- Can't remember a hiragana character? Level up your characters while doing so >:D
- Soundtrack is catchy

Con's: 
- As far as I can tell, there is no forced repetition of the vocab that you learn. *EDIT: Can confirm the game does test you on vocabs but it's not for a while so better remember them ;)
- Can be tedious if you do not enjoy the grindy aspect of the game.
- Not much to the story. Evil man forces you to learn Japanese :^)


TL;DR/Conclusion:
A good starting point to learning Japanese, but don't expect huge results. 
Very useful for learning how to read and write Hiragana. 
Repetition through lessons and grinding while doing quests. 
Decent soundtrack. 
Only get this game if you are interested in LEARNING. Yes, get them notebooks out.

A co NOT:
- fabuła jest nijaka jak wyblakły duch zmarły w wyniku ostrego ataku apatii, szwędający się bez celu po śmierci w byle jakim prześcieradle - postacie są nudne, historia nie ma sensu, humor na poziomie słabego anime, a twórcy nie mogą się zdecydować, czy chcą, żeby było poważnie, czy lekko;
- pusty świat: klikanie na wyróżniające się przedmioty nic nie daje, NPC mają po dyżurnej linijce dialogu, której nie zmienia postępująca naprzód fabuła, nie ma żadnych znajdziek, kartek czy dodatkowych info w nagrodę dla tych, co to lubią przeszukiwać mapę;
- rozstrzał w trudności questów pobocznych: raz to jest ""nauczę cię nazw napojów, tylko idź i przynieś mi je z gospody położonej pięć kroków dalej', a raz ""nauczę cię pór dnia, jak mi przyniesiesz magiczny klejnot schowany w kilkupiętrowym labiryncie w Ruinach Ghuli, którego znalezienie wymaga pół godziny grindowania"" - dzięki za zdradzenie nagrody, frajerze, w Google se te pory dnia sprawdzę;
- jeżeli waszym ulubionym miejscem w Pokemonach były jaskinie, to mam dla was dobrą wiadomość: ta gra to jedna gigantyczna jaskinia pełna zubatów atakujących co dwa kroki;
- design misji jest sadystyczny - jak nie labirynty, to zadania z cyklu ""pokonaj całą planszę, by dotrzeć do drzwi, odkryj, że są zamknięte, zawróć, by znaleźć trzy przełączniki i wróć do drzwi, a to wszystko z atakującymi cię co dwa kroki przeciwnikami i poczuciem, że gra ma cię za idiotę"";
- walka jest nudna, monotonna i źle przemyślana: wybieranie znaków w nieintuicyjnym menu ataków zajmuje mnóstwo czasu, przeciwnicy nie mają paska zdrowia, kolejność ruchów w turze też nie jest pokazana, wcześniej ustalony atak na pokonanego w trakcie przeciwnika idzie na zmarnowanie;
- mało różnorodne zestawy przeciwników - podczas rozgrywki można złapać się na tym, że zapamiętuje się nie tyle znaki, co układy ataków;
- dlaczego tu wszystko jest takie wooooooolneeeeee?... Wybieranie odpowiedzi, animacje ataków, próby przejścia z punktu A do B, zbędne okienka z dialogami, nie dające się przewijać pokazówki z rysowaniem znaku... Litości!
- muzyka w trakcie walki jest straszliwie wnerwiająca.

Boli mnie wystawienie ""Niepolecane"" tej grze, bo wszelkie próby dostarczenia edukacji zmiękczają moje serce. Sam pomysł jest kapitalny, połączenie RPG i jego powtarzalności z systematyczną nauką daje mnóstwo możliwości, które zostały tutaj kompletnie niewykorzystane. Nudna historia nie daje motywacji do grania, walki są męczące, a jałowy świat aż się prosi o wypełnienie go ciekawostkami kulturowymi. Nauka sprowadza się do czytania informacji, słuchania tych samych lektorów i tradycyjnego pisania ręcznie znaków jak szlaczków w zeszycie, nijak nie są tu wykorzystane multimedia, równie dobrze można otworzyć podręcznik sprzed 10 lat. I pewnie się lepiej na tym wyjdzie, bo więcej czasu spędzamy na wymianie ekwipunku, łażeniu, nudnych cutscenkach i monotonnych walkach, niż samej nauce. Przejście gry to jakieś 18 godzin, i gdyby wpakować ten czas w faktyczne kucie japońskiego, to wyniesie się więcej, niż hiraganę, pięć zdań z rozmówek i trzy podstawowe lekcje gramatyczne.

The Hiragaana lessons were solid, and the battles were a fun way to memorize them. The actual RPG gameplay, however, could have been much better.

I never felt like I was in any serious danger throughout the game. At the very beginning there were times when a party member got down to around half health or so, but they were very easily brought up to full health and I got through every level without ever once despairing that I may have to back out and try again.

After only a minimal amount of grinding to level up and purchase the most updated equipment, I could handle every level without any fear whatsoever. The party handled almost every encounter in one turn, before the Hiragana warriors even had a chance to strike. On the occasions when a battle required two turns and allowed the enemy to hit back, they either missed completely or did 0 damage. Only very rarely did they roll high and do something like 12 damage, which was negligible.

The magic system is a joke. The characters have an M.Attack parameter, which is strange because there are no magic attacks. There's a spell to give all characters a boost to defense, which is useless when the characters almost never get hit. There's a spell to give a boost to attack, which is also useless since every character except Misaki will usually kill an enemy in one hit. There's a revive spell if a party member dies... which will never happen. There are spells for removing conditions on party members, but even in the cases where a chracter is hit with an attack that imposes a condition, the enemy can still usually be taken out without having to deal with that.

The heal spells can be useful at rare occasions, usually at the beginning of the game. You can stock up on potions that do a lot of the same things as the spells, but you'll almost never need them. 

There are two main stages in the game. In the first stage, you're in your home country. In the second stage, you chase the enemies to Japan. After you've bought all the most updated equipment in each stage, money becomes essentially useless.

I accidentally stole a NPC's entire life savings by looking into a potted plant. It was only 2 gold. Made me feel kind of bad, but the game wouldn't let me give it back.

There was very little effort put into the game's story. I know it's an educational game, but it would have been nice if there was some effort to make it feel like the story wasn't just an excuse for learning. When you're directed to a new level, the directions are like, ""In order to continue our lessons, you must go to such-and-such village"" - why not even put some minimal effort into it and say something like, ""We've got a tip that weird stuff is happening in such-and-such village, we need to go chek it out!""

I know that's a small thing, but attention to details like that would have made the game feel more like a game.

The menu system was bulky and awkward. They could have very easily fit more hiragana options on one screen without the need to scroll. The way general options were set up was also very inefficient, often requiring a lot of back tracking and fiddling around to do what you want to do.

Overall, though, I'd recommend this game because it teaches Hiragana well, and the RPG gameplay, while imperfect, was game-like enough that it distracted my mind from the tedium of studying.",1493706754,1493844305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

frankly: the odd thing about hiragana battle is - at least in my opinion -  that the learning part is much more fun than the gaming part. 
yes, fighting the hiragana symbols by giving correct answers is a nice way to learn by repetition, but the rpg-part is at times too difficult and tedious. you never know how much health an enemy has- there are no hp-indicators. will one attack suffise or will you need more? will one strike instakill and the next attack on the same symbol be wasted? you just never know. initiative is unnerving and you often end up with half your team being hit or inconvenienced by effects like poisoning, sleep or paralysis, before you even had the chance to do some damage or counter the effects of the last round. you should constantly save the game because there is permadeath that throws you back to your last manual save and with battles as unpredictable as the ones in this game, the grim reaper always seems to lurk around the corner. one streak of badluck and your entire fellowship gets buggered with a fishfork. while the general controls are relatively intuitive and generally alright, inventory management and equipping are quite cumbersome.

these are things you will have to put up with between lessons. learning the symbols, vocabulary and writing is way more satisfying than going out into a ruinous labyrinth, fighting two battles and then having to head back to your base village to heal  and revive your little party over and over again. but then i am not a very rpg-o-phile person and others might be quite happy to endure all that.

if you are stictly looking for a japanese-learning program, have no experience with old rpgs and no patience, keep away from this game. if you like to play oldschool rpgs like the early final fantasys and on top of that learn some basic japanese, then this will be perfect for you. i do hope they refine the next title and make the game part less disruptive and more adaptable to the players preferences.",1492573409,1492573409,True,2,0,0.548387110233306885,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Goes over the Hirigana and some words, other people have taken issue with the fact that some of the words taught are usually spelled with Katakana but as the game serves to teach you the Hirigana I don't really mind this. Just don't worry too much about remembering the 'spelling' of the words being taught. 

In terms of actual gameplay, it's a very simplistic jRPG style game, you can attack, guard, use items, cast defensive/buff spells and buy new equipment etc. Now to be clear, I hate old school turn based jRPGs, even classics like FF7/8 and Lost Odyssey eventually wore thin for me before I got to see the ending, but mercifully this game requires very little grinding in order to gear and level up your team to the point where they're fairly powerful (mine were about lvl 32 by completion on an ~12 hour playthrough, aided by the bonus levels gained through completing side quests). In fact the joy of it was I liked grinding because it was helping reinforce the Hirigana I was learning. 

I will echo some of the other reviews by saying that you do begin to see patterns of enemy formations rather than having to identify 3/4 random enemies each time, but this didn't diminish the value of the practice too much for me. 

Finally I will say that this is not the first time I have learnt the Hirigana, the first being a few years ago, so a completely fresh learner may have a slightly different experience. I was also supplementing the game with Heisig's Remember the Kana (or was it the other way round) which is vastly quicker but much less fun than playing through this short game! All in all worth the very low cost for a fun way of learning/reinforcing the Hirigana and perfect for a long weekend/quiet evening.

The game does not overload you with too much information and it bitsizes everything down to make it easily memberable.

I am writing this review based around the primary objective of this game which is a learning environment first and a game second. The game components themselves are playable and simple to understand. 

I would also recommend additional practice writing Hiragana characters on your own a little each day. No point in playing 5 hours straight otherwise you wont remember a thing by the next time.

Edit: I have completely learnt Hiragana thanks to this game, a more focused approach and you can probably learn it all in about 5 hours or so. Spelling.",1492380918,1492395679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I found myself up at 3am still scribbling notes in my book cause this game had me hooked. :D
Pros : 
Fun way to learn the characters.
Lots (I mean LOTS) of repetition
Allows you to recognise characters.
The writting animations are your best friend. <3
You actually learn this stuff :]
Music was nice too
I liked the blond; fun guy.
When you had to answer with hiragana to the english enemies. That was a good one
Cons: 
A little unballanced since once you reach a certain character line; the ""older"" ones stop showing up. Once youve reached the Na line (or maybe even before that) I never ever encountered any character from the Ka line.
Thus the groups that show up become predictable and come in a bunch. Ive had the group ""yu"" ""yo"" ""ya"" show up more times than i can count (since i kinda got lost on the map by being a noob) and they even showed up one after the other.
I dreaded going back to the fuji mountain for those colored stones.... jfc..... two steps; battle. I win; two more steps; battle. lvled up two times just to collect five goddamned balls. And ohh lord. I almost didnt find the Blue one.
I have yet to find that magic/legendary sword for that one mission.... i gave up

It took me 21 hours to complete the game, which is long than most people who reviewed this game, because the game suggests you write everything in a notebook but instead I wrote every little detail in the Notes application on my iPhone and iPad using both Japanese keyboards which are included in the Settings application. 

I made two different pages in the Notes application which look a bit like grids because on one page I wrote the hiragana letters in one column, how to pronounce them in the next column, then the same hiragana letters with dakuten marks ("") or handakuten marks (o) in the next column and below those columns I wrote grammar particles such as は, が, を, ヘ, の and ですwhich mean words like the, to, of, a, is and after learning all the hiragana letters this game also shows you how sentences, phrases or question are set up using these particles all of which I wrote down in Notes as well. The other page in my Notes application shows all the Japanese words I learnt throughout this game in hiragana letters one column, then in romaji (Latin/English letters) in the next column and then the English translation in the final column. If you have an iPhone or iPad or other smart device which you can easily access Japanese keyboards on I suggest writing down every little detail in a grid or table on an application like Notes the same as I have done. 

I am looking forward to playing the sequel Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War which I have also bought recently and am going to start now. If you want to learn kanji characters there is currently no game in this series for them but after I learnt all the hiragana letters from this game I decided to buy a Japanese language manga volume (specifically volume 1 of 君の名は/Kimi no na wa/Your Name) and it nearly all has hiragana letters or kanji characters and next to each kanji character it shows you how to write it in hiragana letters too so I can just translate everything I don't know yet online by using hiragana letters and learn kanji characters at the same time (which I also write down in my Notes application) so this game was very useful for helping me read my manga too. If you can find a Japanese manga volume like mine with hiragana letters next to kanji characters I think it would be very useful after learning all the hiragana letters from this game to learn kanji too while waiting for a speculated sequel in the Learn Japanese to Survive for kanji characters.",1491847869,1491847869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love educational games, I feel like I have a ton of experience with them, and I considered Japanese an unlearnable subject for me, something that could only be learned with a really good educational game.

Turns out this is an AMAZING educational game! After just the first set of characters, the simple vowels, I looked back on my notes and realized what I had done. I've written Japanese characters. Me! I did that! And I look at them and I understand their meaning! THIS IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING TO ME :D :D :D

Now I've learned many characters and a few words and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed, but I won't stop being amazed at how much I've changed. I understand basically how Japanese works now, and I can hear the individual syllables in the words whereas before I heard nothing but gibberish! That's a huge accomplishment imo! My way of thinking has been irreversibly changed. And I don't think Japanese is that hard anymore. Well, not hiragana anyway xD There's still katakana and kanji to learn but those are entirely different subjects and games (and only this one and katakana are available right now). I'll probably pick up those sequels at some point because wow this style is effective!

I'm not looking to be fluent or able to understand/hold a conversation with this. I'm just learning it casually, for fun. But even if I forget all the words I learn and how to read the characters, this breakthrough in my mind made it worth it. :D IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF!!!!!!!

When the game [spoiler]gave me すし and told me that I already know the word, I just have to sound it out using the syllables I learned, and I GOT IT IMMEDIATELY as ""sushi"",[/spoiler] my mind was blown. That's when I knew this was working, I've learned something. I'll never forget it. It was a moment of epiphany and enlightenment and overwhelming joy - the joy of discovery, of learning something new by figuring it out on my own. Something I've been sorely missing for a long time. That's the best way to learn, and that's what this game encourages. Sure it tells you to memorize all these characters and words and stuff, of course there needs to be memorization. But it doesn't feel so in-your-face and pressuring. It lets you do things in your own time, repeating as much as you need and just overall being gentle with the process. And it helps that it's an rpg with random battles where you have to attack with the correct meaning of the symbols, so it gives you the necessary repetition for memorizing but in a fun way. 

The music, especially during lessons, is very soothing and relaxing. It helps to keep you stress free while you're trying to learn something as new and strange as Japanese. In fact, I find this game very relaxing as a whole mostly because of the music. I like to practice drawing the hiragana with a brush and ink along with the lesson music just to relax.

I strongly recommend the game, especially if you want to learn Japanese but, like me, considered it too difficult or time consuming. Or if you want to have fun learning a new subject, it's good for that too since it is an educational game. :D",1491432243,1491432243,True,2,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hiragana Battle[/i]. Going into it, I had already memorized about half the hiragana alphabet, which ultimately came back to severely diminish my experience. Without the learning aspect, this game is just a boring cliche RPG-maker game-- so if you have knowledge of the hiragana, you're honestly better off spending 9 hours studying some other way. However, if you have zero knowledge, this is a good place to start. 

[b]I should mention[/b], I had to hack my save file and give myself a ton of money to even bother continuing with the game. The battles were just so slow and grindy for me (and I like RPG games) that I had to give myself the best armor so I wasn't spending a full minute ""fighting"" hiragana that I already knew. Without hacking my save, I'm not sure if I would have bothered finishing it.

I should also point out that I fully realized this game was probably a mistake to buy like 5 minutes after playing 2 hours (which is past the refund limit). I would have refunded the game if I had kept better track of my time.

A couple of my gripes with the game:

• [b]Hiragana can inflict status ailments.[/b] So you enter a battle, immediately know the characters (you identify them to ""kill"" them)-- and then they put 3 of your 4 party members to sleep. Beyond that, the hiragana can all attack 1 party member, killing them in a single turn. Party members that are asleep or dead cannot be used to identify hiragana.

Additionally, [b]a hiragana character typically takes multiple times identifying it to kill it[/b], allowing it to keep attacking your party and inflicting status ailments. 

What does this all mean? Even if you know the material and wish to move on you have to spend more time than necessary trying to overcome the frustrating battle mechanics. The game element should take a back seat to the learning, not the other way around. 

It came to a point where I would see the characters, say them out loud, and then run from the battle.

• [b]Encounter rates are very high[/b] (take a few steps and be put into another battle), which loops back into my first point. 

Additionally, you encounter pre-determined groups. By that I mean, characters aren't randomly thrown together before a battle-- you will encounter the same characters in the same groups over and over again. Meaning, you will recognize the group of characters (""Oh, I just had this one last battle. Ji, Shi, Ko, Ku""), rather than actually identifying the characters themselves. 

• During the ""lesson"" part of the game, words are introduced with characters you haven't even learned yet (which they write in romaji). This feels like a huge missed opportunity, as they could easily show you words made of characters you [i]have[/i] learned. 

For example, imagine you've learned only the vowels. They then show you the word for chair (hiragana: 「いす」) as 「いsu」, rather than waiting until they teach the ""s"" group, and then introduced the full word. It just feels so pointless, and like such a missed opportunity. Learning words made of the characters you have learned is so rewarding, compared to half romaji/half hiragana words. (NOTE: That specific example does not show up in game, but many like it do). 

[b][u]""So why do you recommend the game?!""[/u][/b] you might be asking. As stated, this game [i]will[/i] help you learn the hiragana. The game does open up towards the very end, when it focuses more on words and phrases, as well as explaining sentence structures, which I enjoyed immensely. 

I will be purchasing [i]Katakana War[/i] because I do not know any of the katakana, so I'm sure my experience will be better. (On top of that, I've heard the dev addressed some of the issues with [i]Hiragana Battle[/i]). But again, if you do know a majority of the hiragana already, studying via traditional means will be far more rewarding, as well as less frustrating.

Con el tiempo me he dado cuenta de la magia que tiene el escribir en aquel idiota,el hablarlo (al menos un poco) ...

说一下缺点——

1、平假名和片假名分开做成了两个游戏，实在是没有必要（还是说本来就在强行圈钱）

所以说玩游戏的时候，最好还是和片假名对应起来记忆，免得今后对不上号

2、按F12也没办法截图，什么情况？

3、无法即时存档——

我必须要每上完一课（一课是不含片假名的一行）才能由系统引导我去存档

所以在课程之间，如果我想要退出，就只能直接右上角关闭

但是课程的间隔之间，有很多很多的对白啊，下次重进，还得重听一遍，这个做得不太好

（探索时倒是可以直接存档

4、明明是在同一个战场，为什么我和敌人的画风差那么多？？

5、这战斗真的让人想死，昏昏欲睡




所以总得来说——

1、这款游戏适合英语有一定基础，但日语零基础的人（有日语基础的人就不推荐了）

2、不适合要去参加专业考试的，对你们来说，这个太休闲、词汇量也太低了

3、玩的时候记得自己看词典和片假名对照一下

4、适合每星期上几课、轻轻松松记一些简单的单词

По этому возможность нормально выучить, по крайней мере, хирагану, даст вам эта игра. Сейчас САМЫЙ будет краткий экскурс по игре и я расскажу, как, собственно, проходит обучение.

[b][u]Геймплей[/u][/b]
Как гласит название игры ""Учи японский чтобы выжить"". На самом деле, это правило работает не так, как хотелось бы, ибо ""иероглифы"" бьют больно, хила не хватает, качаться и учить японский - надо. Боевка игры выполнена в лучших традициях jrpg и мне это зашло. В принципе, игра сильно напоминает первые части Final Fantasy. После каждой посещенной локации - урок японского. В побочных заданиях мы учим простенькие слова. Дальше этого дело не идет.

[b][u]Дизайн локаций/героев/окружения[/u][/b]
Характеры героев, особо не раскрываются: есть плохие, а есть хорошие. Локации сделаны средствами, доступными в RPG Maker'е, так что придираться к этому - быть дауном.

[b][u]Сюжет[/u][/b]
Злой маг прибывает в наше селение, в своем путешествии по уничтожению мира. Дерется он ""хираганой"" и простое оружие не помогает, против него. По этому нашим героям нужно выучить хирагану, чтобы противостоять ему. Довольно неплохая завяка для игры-обучалки.

[b][u]Звуковое сопровождение[/u][/b]
Саундтрек не режет звук, пусть он и однообразный. Всю игру мы слышим милые мелодии. Герои не озвучены.

[b][u]Итог[/u][/b]
После 4-ех часов я забросил игру и начал просто учить хирагану. И, таки, выучил. Эта игра дала некий толчок для того, чтобы я выучил хирагану и у нее это получилось, за что ей, конечно же, ставлю ""рекомендую"".",1488903684,1488903684,True,42,4,0.750949859619140625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is mediocre, but the story isn't the main point of the game, so I understand why it's so goofy. It's about learning Japanese, not some epic fantasy adventure.

All in all, if you want an aid to learning Hirgana, this game is great. Pick it up on sale for an even better deal.",1488184564,1601584083,True,3,0,0.564778923988342285,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a campy, light hearted, and simple plot but it's still there for texture. If you're trying to learn Hiragana, this will definately help recogize the characters. As far as learning how to speak Japanese, well, I'm pretty sure that's not really the primary focus, but you might pick up a couple vocabulary words along the way. I've learned a couple words, but mostly this is about Hiragana.

What we have here is a simple twist to a classic style of turn based, RPG combat system where you have to answer the characters name/sound in order to damage them. Characters being introduced to the player/student are pretty much just stronger monsters, meaning you are going to have choose the correct name/sound of the same character more frequently in order to deplete all their HP. This means if you need a refresher on characters that don't show up in later dungeons, you can go back to earlier dungeons and one shot some of the weaker enemies, but only after you rediscover its sound/name. It's a pretty clever dynamic that loans itself quite well to its medium.

There seems to be a good mix enemy encounters, but a lot of the same arrangements of enemies repeat while others not so much. Having a limited vocabulary in Japanese, this is a bit of a concern for me.

The frequency of different characters appearing in the random battles may of may not be in response to how often one might see them in everyday Japanese conversation. For example, the letter 'E' is the most frequently used letter in our language. I'm not sure what the most commonly used Hiragana character is in the Japanese language. Hopefully, whatever it is is appearing the most frequently in the Japanese language is also appearing the most frequently in the random battles of the game. Is this a drawback? Ambiguously.

One thing you might want to do playing through this game is focus more on buying good armor. Not that the monsters are particulary difficult, but I find it helps you learn to not kill the Hiragana Warriors too quickly. Like I said, the combat system very much feels like using flash cards, and being able to use the same cards sooner, rather than later can be a big help for you. Omoshiroi, ne?

Ultimately, I think I'm getting my moneys worth here. It's an inexpensive game that can help you out quite a bit. It's not going to build a massive hype train, but it's definately one of the more fun ways of learning the lettering system of another language. I paid seven bucks for it, got 8 hours out of it, learned a couple things, and I still have more hours of gameplay to put into it. I looked at some of the other reviews, showing some people managed to get 13 hours and even 16 hours out of this for only $7.

I had tried using programs like The Rosetta Stone, but to be frank, it wasn't the type of teaching style that really stuck with me. Being able to learn via playing an RPG is brilliant! 

To get as much as I could out of the game, I went out and purchased a note book and flash cards. I wrote down everything that I learned from the main lessons and the side quests. So far I've only made flash cards out of the Hiragana characters themselves, but I take them everywhere with me and just practice as much as possible. I highly suggest doing this as well, the only real way you're going to get a new language down is memorization via repitition. While the game is really good with that, it never hurts to continue doing you're own thing outside of the game.

Even if, as a game, it's pretty basic, I wasn't in this for the gameplay. Even then it still kinda hurt a little how bland it was. It's a small gripe, but a gripe none-the-less.

Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle is one of those multi-genre games that, with the separate gamemodes by themselves, are very bland and unimaginative. But together, it's a fantastic game that can teach you how to read Hiragana in 10 hours.
The learning part is simple. You learn a letter, learn the writing of it, and the pronunciation. Rinse and repeat for the next letter. By itself, it gets the job done, but there's a guarantee that you will remember some, but most likely not everything. 
The JRPG part is nothing special either. You have to translate the Hiragana warriors to kill them. By itself, it's very bland and generic, and has the feel of a old NES RPG, with it's simple mechanics and no auto-targeting system.
But together, it's a fantastic contraption. The JRPG part REALLY drills the letters into your brain, as you need to remember to keep going with the game. The lessons are well thought out, and it's a really fun game to play.
The few critiques I can give is that reviewing lessons is easy, but there should've been previous Hiragana in later areas so you don't forget any of it, and the story and characters are sorta just there.

However judging this as just another RPG game would be doing it a disservice because that's obviously not what the developers were focused on. It's a tool for teaching hiragana, with a game layer to make it more interesting. 

And it works quite well. 

I do have some words of caution for potential buyers and possibilities for improvements for the developer's next games.

1) The game teaches you mostly to read hiragana characters. There are a few words and sentences thrown in there aswell, but don't expect it to be enough to hold a full conversation or read any manga (except maybe those aimed at children?)

2) The game does teach you how to write the characters, but it has no mechanics to reinforce it. Unless you actively work on writing the letters yourself, you're likely to only recognize the letters when shown, and not to actually be able to write them. A writing mechanic could greatly improve this (though you'd probably need a tablet to use that effectively). 

3) The game could do with some more repetition. The characters you learn are usually only shown in one particular area. Once you're past that area, you may not come across them ever again untill the last dungeon. This makes it very likely you'll forget at least some of them. Introducing words in battle sooner or a new game + mode where every character can be found in battle in every area might help here. 

That said, the game does a much better job in teaching a foreign language than I've ever seen in schools, even if it's only a starting point. Definitely try this if you're interested in either japanese language or educational games.",1485404835,1485404835,True,12,0,0.649753570556640625,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I did Latin and German back in middle school and high school, al those classes really did was let me know that I have something of an aptitude for languages. However, this is the first time I've had to learn a whole new set of characters, German and Latin both use the Roman Alphabet that English uses, so it was a simple matter of learning spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. This integrates both the spoken and written language into one seamless leasson. You learn what the character looks like, how to properly draw it, the sound, or syllable, it represents, and how to properly pronounce it, all in one easy to understand package.

My one caveat is this. When you take notes, pay attention to the dialogue box for the easiest way to draw the chacter, then watch teh animation to learn the proper stroke order. The animation assumes that you're using a caligraphy pen, and often looks very different from how the character is commonly written, diffent even from what is shown in the dialogue boxes.

Overall, I would say that this is an excellent method for teaching any subject, turn it into a game that rewards study, repitition, and persistence. I would recomend this to anyone who has ever had even a passing interest in learning Japanese, and I wish the creators would make more like this.

But I gotta be honest: it's just because it mixes two completely different items to an interesting result. These being a classic JRPG setting, and learning Hiragana. There's probably a more-than-average overlap between those who want both. I mean...I thought those crazy symbols were to hard to ever learn, but it provided an excellent entry for me.

The sad truth is, however, that neither of these elements can carry the end result by themself.
-I'm not much of a JRPG player, but this really is as generic as it gets. This game is made with RPG maker, and it shows. The storyline, the (attempt at) sidequests, the characters, sound and music...they're bland at best and shallow at worst. Fights are literally nothing but naming hiragana characters at infinitum. The levels you pass through are set up to be mazelike to increase your random encounters. Sidequests are (until now) nothing more than ""hey...here are a few Japanese words! You now have some extra experience. :) "".
-at first I liked the teachings of the characters, and assumed this to be hard. However, it quickly turns out that it only uses repetition in order for you to actually learn the stuff. There are no mnemonic hints or visual tricks for memorization (hint: get the ""dr. Moku's Hiragana & Katakana"" app, and use it for about half an hour...it'll make all the battles in this game a chore). Worse: as your vocabulary grows, so does your list of attacks. I stopped playing at a point where I could instantly identify the enemies but couldn't be bothered to scroll down the nearly endless list of options. Dakuten should've been a submenu option, or we should've just be able to use our keyboard to type the sounds, but alas...here as well, things are better on an app (like ""hiragana - learn Japanese"". Aside from quizzing and fast typing, this also quizzes your ability to write hiragana).

I can't deny that this game is more addicting than it should (I easily played two extra hours after determining that I would learn better on the mentioned apps), and has more charm than its technical shortcomings may indicate. As such, a thumbs up. After all, it doesn't matter how hard I can try to rationalize why the game isn't good if it has this huge a ""one more dungeon"" kind of feeling (and unlike most other games, you actually DO get something useful out of it :D ).",1483772223,1483772223,True,5,0,0.568132281303405762,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Instead of fighting monsters, you mostly fight Hiragana characters and to defeat them you have to use the correct reading command. With this game Japanese gets a lot easier but don't consider using this as a total Japanese reference because it teaches u only Hiragana.

Pros:
-Old Final Fantasy graphics (for the lovers of the genre and the most nostalgic players)
-Easy and intuitive gameplay (the only important challenge is to learn a language)
-Original way to learn a language that is not considered easy for Western people
-Funny story and enough entertaining
-You can go back to old lessons whenever you want

Cons:
-Sometimes it gets too repetitive (but that's because u need to master the alphabet
-At the time of the review there is only Hiragana

I recommend this game to all Japan/JRPG/Japanese lovers!

It felt a good breath of fresh air. After being able to dig in, and see, especially post patches. This game just falls, on so many fronts. Despite that, it has some good things.

Pro catagories: 
Good Graphics
Good Music
Good Animations
Good Sound Design
Good Religious Design
Good Diplomacy Interface (Outside of a few issues.)

Con's:
Stupid AI (Even Post Patch)
Horrible UI (Game seeks to hide information almost from you at times.)
No penalties for going tall and wide. (And stupidly easy to do so.)
War solves almost every problem. (So many ways to bleed folks offensively and defensively.)
Ai feels stale and uninteresting. 
Diplomacy with the Ai is never worth it. (What it will agree to in weakness, is suicidally stupid. Or demand, equally so.)
Difficulty again just gives the Ai free units, not stronger design.

I wanted to hope this would be good. I love civ. I've countless hours in 1-5, and loved them. But this design just hurts it, maybe, just maybe they can salvage it in a dlc. But I don't have hope they will. Avoid until its under $25, maybe might be worth it then.

That said, this title is well worth full price, I bought it on a whim during a sale.  It teachers you the Hiragana alphabet while being a very enjoyable RPG.  However, I will say you should treat this title as a supplement instead of an end all be all, just as anything else you would when you are learning something new.

Hiragana Battle does exactly what it promises and then some.  I learned and committed the alphabet to memory through light grinding and a few online resources.  The explanations for how to write the characters, while not too involved, were more than enough for me to follow and understand.  As you play, the game provides you with plenty of vocabulary, and even touches on sentence structure.  I don't claim to be fluent, but I did spot a few inconsistencies with my other learning resources, but for the most part everything agreed with whatever I researched.

The story itself is no Witcher, but a nostalgic callback to simpler JRPGs in the vein of say, Dragon Quest.  Simplistic turn based combat and spells are in your arsenal, though not at all required to complete the game.  Boss battles are not difficult at all, but then again I grinded a bit during each area to make sure I knew what characters were what before moving on.  It's a learning game first after all.

I want to give a special note to the soundtrack, it definitely helped the light slog because the songs are all very good.  I can't think of one that I didn't like.

All in all, if you want to learn Japanese, or at least begin to, this is a great place to start.

Selecting the wrong answer will do no damage, forcing you to learn the hiragana in order to advance (or, if you're lazy, you can keep guessing and hope your party isn't defeated). This is, while cheesy, surprisingly effective in teaching hiragana. If you don't mind a simple, somewhat childish plot and gameplay, then I urge you to give this learning game a try.",1483166853,1483166853,True,1,0,0.502712488174438477,0,False,False,False,False,,,

before i tried it i decided that giving the authors a small amount of cash to support their goal was a good idea.

well it's actually well done and i think that for anyone that wants to learn another language this is a good idea.
i can see that perhaps this format can be used for other languages.
i have played for just a bit over an hour and i can see that this is going to cut into my EVE, Shroud of the Avatar, and Black desert online time.

buy it. Even if you don't like the game the money will be well spent.

Learn Japanese to Survive? Finally something that catched my eye. Iv been looking for different games and tools that teach you Hiragana and Japanese in general. And i found the most promising one of them all. Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle, or LJSHB for short is money well spent it covers Japanese culture and not only the basics of Hiragana but nearly all of it. It is indeed the most formidable learning tool for anyone who is intrested in learning Japanese or even going over there for a holiday. Not only do you get to learn it but yo get to have fun while doing so, Which is a must have for someone like me who needs to be intrested in something in order to learn it, (which this does exactly.). 

Basicly is you are intrested in learning Hiragana and the culture of japan this game and learning tool is money well spent in my eyes. i personally bought it because im intrested in teaching english over in Japan and learn all about the culture that western countrys do not have. 

So if you want a fun way of learning Japanese i highly recommend this product to anyone. Like seriously.

RPG"" , a game that is made by the same engine cause i can see lots of similarities including background songs. The game have a story by itself, game mechanics where you will need to answer the right alphabet to a specific hiragana and hopefully defeat it before your team runs out of health. As the game progresses lots of things will be changed to hiragana.

Probably the best edutainment game designed to teach you Japanese, so far as I'm aware. Unfortunately it only goes so far. One might think they are only learning Hiragana though & I can at least say there is a fair amount of grammer & vocabulary that is taught as well. They have already announced another game for katakana, so I'm hopeful they will be able to move on to some kanji for something more around my level.

The battle game challenge is a bit intense if you don't grind as it intends you to do since each battle is mini review. I didn't die once in this game, but there were many times when it was close. In fact, pretty much every encounter was me being close to death with each turn. And since many things had higher speed with my first encounters with them, they would get some hard hits in regardless of my own skill. I think the balance would work better if there were 3 characters, but each took more around 1/3rd damage instead of a full 1/2+ if one were a bit underleveled.

You're allowed to run at 100% success rate with no penalty. I think I like this, but of course with my preferences these days it wouldn't be a problem if the encounters were visible before doing an encounter and there were ways to avoid the enemies. I'm not sure these devs are skilled or financially independent enough to go through with all that anyways. As it stands with random encounters, having an easy escape tool is good enough for a learning tool, I suppose.

The story is mildly comedic, which I think is a fine approach. I think it was kind of a lost opportunity though much of the story's events being all too brief. They could have fleshed out the characters, setting & added funnier jokes in some of the text & events that feel more like filler. Granted a game like this is designed to be padded, but it feels they didn't pad it out with much other than the battles and all the 'puzzles' that basically give the run around.

It's still a solid study tool sans actual writing. It asks you to practice writing each new character, do what it says to help you remember. It is because of it being a reliable tool for learning that I recommend this for all beginners of Japanese!",1480381469,1480381648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Things I like:

+ Substitutes Romaji (abc) with Hiragana（ひらがな）as you learn so you can still read out what is said in Japanese even if you can't read the language.
+ Engages you to learn to survive!

- Limited learning.
- No Katakana. (For use with InFluent on Steam, for example.)

In battles it would be nice if rather than just show a ""slash"" animation over the Hiragana character and a tiny text of what was said up top in the console text area, to show a quick animation of how to [i]write[/i] the Hiragana character [b]and[/b] the spoken form (currently there is no sounding of the character in battle) coupled with a flash of the Romaji as it is spoken side-by-side with the Hiragana.

This would help teach more at the same time.

1. nice story to start and fun to learn
2. Great value when it is in sales period
3. Simple is the best! Great concept to play and learn!

1.

Instead of just memory the hiragana by attacking the warrior, it is better to show some other technique to memory Hiragana when it is in the learning stage.
2. If the game can keep update and have more content to play with would be exellent!

Хотелось бы что бы таких игр было больше, особенно для изучения японского, так как это для меня сейчас очень актуально.

As a game, this is really bad. The story is some nonsense about a Japanese mage invading the world, or whatever. Who cares. The controls are simple, the graphics bad, the sound bad and so on. If you want a good JRPG, this isn't it.

What this is, however, is a great way to get an introduction in Japanese. That mage I mentioned has a whole army of, uh, letters at his disposal, and the only way to beat them is to match the Japanese letters with the English ones. For instance, if the symbol for ""ka"" pops up, you need to pick ""Answer"", then select what you (think) the letter means. If you pick ""ka"", the enemy takes damage. If you pick anything else, the enemy won't. While this sound simple, keep in mind they usually attack in groups of two or three, and they really like to vary things around. So even if you are on your third ""lesson"" with the latest five symbols, you will still find the first symbols in the random battles you encounter. But this means that for once, grinding is a lot of fun. You are constantly getting symbols thrown you that you haven't seen in a while, so you really need to learn what they mean to proceed. (that's one reason why the game suggests you keep a notebook. Don't use it a a cheat-sheet (you won't learn anything that way), but it can be quite handy as reference.)

Now here's the best part: When I started this, I didn't have a clue about what each symbol was. It's just a lot of nonsense to me. But after ony two hours of playing, I have a pretty decent understanding what 15 of these symbols mean, and many of them can ""transform"" into other symbols by adding a "" at the end. So the more you play, the more you learn. Of course, it's not like you're going to be fluid in Japanese after playing this game. Not by a long shot. But the game WILL teach you enough to give you a good starting point. Once you've mastered the basics by playing this game, you can move on to more advanced stuff. Read Japanese comic books. Play your favorite game with Japenese texts. Visit a Japnese forum.

I've tried to begin learning Japanese for the past 15 years. But I've never really been great with flash cards as a learning style.

Surprisingly, a little under 12 hours spaced over a few months, and I feel pretty confident in the writing system. I'm moving on to beginning textbooks and rosetta stone with confidence. I'm writing all of my study guides in hiragana. Sure I have to look at a hiragana table every once in a while. But it is very rare. 

In terms of gameplay, it's not bad. Going through a huge menu of every sound you have learned up to that point is tedious. The story is ok for what it is. But all of that stuff is incidental. It kept my attention long enough for almost 12 hours of flash card study. That is impressive. 

There are a few bugs. Most notably, slow down during long periods of play. I am using mac osx, not sure if it is just the mac port.

This is a great studying tool to learn the Hiragana alphabet as well as a limited range of vocabulary including the Hiragana you learn. For the price mark of $6,99, it might deter some people. I would love if the price was lower for such a small learning tool, but if you like learning through games, I would definitely consider buying this.

The battles are simple: match the romaji to the correct Hiragana to damage it.

Personal Pros:
First starting the game, the learning was not intimidating at all. It goes through pronunciation and strokes to properly write the Hiragana. From there, it gives you time to reinforce the Hiragana you've learned by progressing through a stage. Having to memorize which hiragana corresponds to which translation effectively helps me. Another thing that was helpful was the ""Ghoul Ruins"" stage, where the battles are flipped. You have to match the right Hiragana to the correct romaji to fight. Learning in that type of reversal is also beneficial. Also, what I appreciate, is that equipment and items in the late game start to change into Hiragana format, so that in order to read them, you must have properly understood what you have been learning so far. Conversations and words in the late game will also include Hiragana, most of which are phrases that you have become acquainted with already to use. Lastly, it's a game. You're going to have a little fun while you're learning stuff. That's the best way to learn stuff, at least for me.

Summary:
- Nice learning progression
- Good reinforcement through battles
- Transition into medium use of hiragana later
- It's a game, you'll have fun while learning

Personal Cons:
The enemies seem to have a sort of format. Example: This random encounter will only include a certain 3 or 4 Hiragana, so it's easy to memorize which Hiragana is used to defeat a certain battle. Also, most stages only contain the newest set of Hiragana learned at the time. I would have really loved if all stages jumbled up the Hiragana you've learned so far to truly test if you remember everything from beginning to end. Or even if there was a hidden stage in the last game to practice matching the Hiragana to the romaji counterpart instead. In addition, the newest hiragana you fight every time might be too difficult to fight (you might get smashed by their latest attacks), so you could find yourself farming levels and practicing only a certain set of Hiragana to catch up, which sucks because you want to move on and equally spend time practicing everything else. A small con that really made me sad: the menu navigation. When you scroll down to the bottom, I REALLY wish it would reset and start again from the top. It would help with selecting answers during fights so much.

Summary: 
- Fixed Hiragana battles and enemy encounters
- New stages only practice the latest Hiragana set learned
- More time must be spent in a certain area to catch up on levels, therefore more time is invested into a certain set of Hiragana, not everything else as a whole
- THE MENU NAVIGATION ;_;

So far, I'm pretty much right before the boss. This has been a great study tool just for the Hiragana. Every time I go into a battle, I make sure to write down what Hiragana I am up against to practice the strokes, and if I plan on escaping the battle (which I tend to do if I'm way far ahead of the stage), I make sure I am aware of which Hiragana is which. Definitely enjoyable, but just make sure that you are aware that this is a learning TOOL, not an actual game to learn a huge portion of Japanese. Also, if you are interested, but the price deters you, just check out some free apps out there to help get you started on Hiragana instead.

[h1]What I like:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Concept, seriously, did ANYONE thought of mashing ""learning a language"" with an ""RPG""? Well done to the guy/girl who came up with something so original
[*]The easy to pickup lessons, they don't shove everything down your gullet at once and it makes learning really easy
[*]Battles, the battles are repetitive and predictable early on. But late-game, it throws EVERYTHING you learnt in your face, so make sure you've been paying attention in class
[*]Notes, I'm sure this is kind of a turnoff for most people, but I personally like having a physical note that I can flip through[b]__〆(￣ー￣ )[/b]. Don't wanna write? No prob, you can easily revise everything you've learnt by going into your inventory
[*]Soundtrack, honestly, this is probably the BEST thing about this game, the opening song is pretty hype (not fitting, but I like it)
[*]The final lesson, everything you've learnt uptill this point is [b]TOTALLY WORTH IT[/b], for a [b]kickass[/b] Boss fight with [b]kickass[/b] music in the background
[/list]

[h1]What I dislike:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Length, this game is short, and I'm not complaining, but I'd prefer if they had a [i]bit[/i] more content (nitpicking)
[*]Level designs, they're as generic as they get, with a few exceptions, but overall, it's pretty bland
[*]Stats, it's not that in depth, kinda boring when all you have to do is:
[olist]
[*]Fight
[*]Get money + Level UP
[*]Buy better items
[*]Repeat

[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]
In the end, this [b]IS[/b] an edutainment game. So based on that, I think this game is pretty good, an amazing blend of both education AND entertainment. I had fun going through lessons, so do I suggest other people try it?
If you [b]REALLY[/b] want to learn Japanese, and don't have the attention span (like myself [b](๑╹ڡ╹๑)[/b]) to read books/online, then yeah, pick this game up.

This edutainment game deserves a decent:

Huge thank you to the developer for encouraging me.  Still they could do better.

The fight sequences (where most of the reinforcement of learning takes place) are frustratingly slow.  There are just too many keystrokes involved for preloading a character's attack, and by the time I finished all of the characters I've forgotten what I had set them to.  So no immediate punishment for bad choices and learning is not very efficient.  Also there's too much wandering around to get to the next battle.  This is an okay introduction, but it is not designed with optimizing learning in mind - which is a shame because it would only take a few tweaks to the gameplay to make it much better.  Bigger enemy armies, and a snappier UI with fewer answers to choose from would help.

Also in the battle phases there could have been reinforcement of the phonetics associated with the symbols, maybe as a symbol died.  So the game is mostly learning the shapes of all the Hiragana characters, but I don't feel like I'm getting hardly any practice with the sounds these characters make.  And because the order of the vowel sounds don't match the familiar ""a, e, i, o, u"" (instead it's ""a, i, u, e, o"") I find myself trying to rearrange the learning process in my notebook to have any hope of remembering the characters.

I am still waiting. I have been trying for a couple hours now to like this game but I cannot. This review is for two purposes: (1) If you sincerely want to learn Japanese, please take the following into consideration before you buy, and (2) If you are a dev of educational games, here are some things NOT to do. I know I'm going to come across as a mansplainer so you're warned...

Why is this an RPG? At first I was excited by the idea that we could learn Japanese (or even just Hiragana) via an RPG system... however, the mechanics of this system do not complement or facilitate learning. At best, they get in the way, and at worst, they really make it hard to want to learn. In order to attack, you have to first select ""Answer,"" then select the correct Hiragana - and by mid-game (as far as I got before throwing in the towel) this is a looooooooong list, then select the correct Hiragana warrior to attack. Pick the wrong answer and you do no damage. This is supposed to reinforce memorization of the Hiragana, right? Wrong. It turns out that this game is made in RPG Maker and no changes were made to the battle system... so there are fixed, pre-determined groups of Hiragana, usually only 2 or 3 possible combinations per world. I quickly memorized the pattern of enemies and was not anymore concentrating on the Hiragana, but the system of button presses that would result in my victory the quickest. Plus, because the Hiragana are never (well, except the alternate dimension part) written into your menu, I was instead memorizing English letters! I doubt the devs intended this but it is a severe oversight.

This type of gameplay mistake persists in almost every area. I suspect it is for a noble cause. The devs are likely very, very passionate about teaching, or at least they like the Japanese language. There isn't much on the market for teaching language that isn't insanely boring or difficult. So, they wanted to make learning into an RPG... but I suspect the devs aren't practiced game designers, so they just downloaded RPG Maker and crammed the Japanese language into the program's way of doing things. This game should have been made in a more flexible system like Unity or Unreal, or coded from the ground up. The mechanics of the game should have been 100% about the mechanics of the Japanese language. Unfortunately we end up with the following:

EXCUSE PLOT INTERFERES WITH LEARNING. I know it's educational so the plot ""doesn't matter."" Either ditch it or figure out how to work it into learning. Having to walk back and forth across a room to find a key feels like grinding. If I liked grinding I would learn the old-fashioned way.

GRIND. Ideally when you learn a new set of Hiragana you would get a chance to RAPIDLY test your skills. Instead you are given a quiz of 5 questions (seriously? this is the worst part of the game imho) that can be brute forced, then sent out to battle. Each battle is excruciatingly long. Hiragana take multiple hits to defeat, they inflict statuses (why? what point is there to standard RPG mechanics?), they do insane damage to you, and random battles happen every 6 steps or so. If grind is the only way to learn, download a Hiragana chart and do it for free.

PRONUNCIATION IS GIVEN BY ROBOTS. I can't say for sure but I think the sound files for pronunciation are only the 50 or so syllables in Japanese glued together. It sounds okay for the individual Hiragana but very forced when learning the vocabulary. Full sentences sound like Google Translate. I may be a beginner in Japanese but I am confident no one speaks like that. For the love of God just talk into a microphone - there aren't that many vocab words in the game.

WHY LEARN VOCABULARY? The vocab sections are not mechanically a part of the game. Again, I'm playing this to learn the language in a more immersive and enjoyable environment than a classroom. If I'm sitting here listening to someone recite (robotically) 10 words that I have to memorize, I'm going to go elsewhere for learning. Especially if I am not required to use those words ANYWHERE, and they serve no purpose mechanically. Oh, and the vocab words I got through don't actually help you create sentences.

LESSONS AND GAMEPLAY NOT INTEGRATED. The whole point of the educational game is that I learn while I play. I felt the learning was separate - in lessons made before each world, asking you to write and take notes on a separate sheet of paper. Why play the game, then, and not just look at a chart or take a class?

ART STYLE DISTRACTING. This one's more personal, but the music/sound/art felt totally wrong. I'm squarely blaming RPG Maker for this one because the devs are working with it pretty much out-of-the-box. But future edutainment devs should note that using an out-of-the-box program results in a stale, uninspiring game.

ALL THAT SAID! If you want to learn Hiragana, you can with this game. But you won't really learn any useful Japanese, you won't get the pronunciation right, you won't learn Katakana or Kanji, AND it will take you considerably longer than if you just spend five minutes a day looking at a chart of Kana and writing them down.

Long review, I know, but I really, really, REEEEEEEALLY wanted to like this. I want edutainment to be a thing not just in schools, but everywhere. I'm also trying to learn Japanese right now. So I jumped at the chance. But ultimately it looks like we're still waiting for the perfect game. I hope the devs continue, however, and they either work on their dev skills or hire someone to take care of that aspect.",1473653371,1473653371,False,231,8,0.774411201477050781,12,True,False,False,False,,,

Learn Japanese to Survive is a RPGMaker-style educational video game developed by Sleepy Duck and currently published by River Crow Studio. This game is educational in nature while employing turn-based RPG mechanics. The Japanese language has three different writing systems: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. This game covers the hiragana characters while the katakana and kanji are covered in the sequels of the Learn Japanese to Survive series.

This game isn’t very long and you can complete this in six hours though I do not recommend you try to finish this game in one sitting to give yourself more time to actually absorb what you learn or practice writing. With a total of 46 hiragana characters, I played this game by learning ten characters per sitting and I found it to be an effective way to memorize the characters. As this game teaches you how to write in Japanese, you should also prepare a pen and paper and practice writing as the game teaches you.

[h1]Art and Music[/h1]
The art isn’t very impressive, though this doesn’t really matter for a game like this. Be aware that the game is only 720p. As for the music, it’s very lively and each areas have unique soundtrack. As for the dubs, no characters are dubbed but the lessons do have pronunciation samples.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The RPGMaker gameplay is simple: with a top-down camera angle, you move the character in four directions. You may encounter enemies and you engage in a fight. This game implements a random encounter system where you don’t see the enemies as you move around and you are just pulled into battle randomly. I found this mechanic to be annoying as I would rather avoid enemies to do side quests but couldn’t.

The gameplay is simple: you are taught a set of hiragana characters, you are quizzed for it, you go out to do the main quest, fight hiragana monsters while on quest, then rinse and repeat. Sometimes you are taught Japanese vocabulary which you should pay attention to because those are in the final battles. The battle is like matching a specific attack move against a specific enemy. To elaborate further, you would attack a hiragana character with its corresponding English equivalent. For example, the enemy か would be damaged if you answer it with ka but would not be damaged if you attack it with a different answer. You battle hiragana warriors with four members of the party.

At some point in the game, you might think “I already mastered this character. I don’t wanna fight anymore,” and I felt the same and was tempted to hit that “Escape” option whenever I get pulled into battle. But, like many RPG mechanics, enemies do get stronger as you progress further. This means that you shouldn’t neglect your levels and equipment as you might end up getting beaten in scripted and inescapable battles.

Side quests in this game is simple: just talk to an NPC or deliver items requested by the NPC. While these are completely optional, accomplishing side quests earns you more short lessons, bonus points, and money. The bonus points you earn can be used to instantly level up all members of the party.

[h1]Plot[/h1]
The world lived in peace until a certain villain called Noburo unleashes his hiragana warriors everywhere! It is up to you to stop his conquest by learning hiragana and fighting hiragana warriors. Fight alongside with your teacher Misaki and your classmates and put a stop to his plans to world domination.

While this does sound like your average shounen plot, it’s a good element of the game to entice players to keep playing ‘till the end. Sadly, there is no function to enable full-study mode where you only get lessons with the plot disabled. You will have to progress in order to unlock new lessons.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Learn Japanese to Survive: Hiragana Battle is a simple educational game for teaching hiragana. The repetitive gameplay helps you memorize the characters with ease. Although, you might learn hiragana faster elsewhere considering how the game would take more of your time playing it than how much you could have spent that same time studying hiragana elsewhere. We recommend this game to those who would like to try learning Japanese, but we don’t recommend this game to those who have committed themselves into learning Japanese considering the slow pace of the gameplay.",1473307719,1625030700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have tried to learn Japanese several times before with different methods, but I've never been able to stick with it. Most recently, I tried the Rosetta Stone software, but it's 'immersive' teaching style left me very frustrated. With Japanese being so different to english, I wasn't able to figure out much of what was being presented, and gave up quickly.

Then I found Hiragana Battle. I flew through the game in a weekend, and gathered up the motivation to give Rosetta Stone another try. This time it went much easier. Having a basic understanding of what the language is built out of, and being able to sound out the written portions made the initial lessons much less overwhelming. Hiragana Battle also threw in a few grammer tips (like how は is often used to denote the subject) which made a world of difference in my understanding.

Pros:
Characters are presented in well organized groups, makes remembering them easier
Well paced, new groups of characters are presented quickly enough to prevent boredom, but far enough apart that the old groups are sure to stick.
Interesting enough gameplay to keep engaged, assuming you like JRPG style party management

Cons:
Lacking enemy group variety.
No long-term practice. If you don't start using your new knowledge of Hiragana for something it will fade quickly.

Tout d'abord, j'ai acheté Hiragana Battle parce que je me suis rendu compte qu'appendre le japonais sans connaître les ""vrais"" signes était impossible (je pensais qu'on pouvait se contenter des caractères romanji, mais ce n'est malheureusement pas le cas). Et apprendre ça dans son coin, c'est possible, mais c'est parfois dur de s'y mettre.

Donc là, on me propose une méthode RPG-esque pour apprendre une partie des caractères japonais : les Hiraganas. C'est en promo, et je me dis : ""pourquoi pas ?"". Après tout, quel gamer fan de RPG n'a pas passé des heures à faire du level up pour débloquer telle ou telle compétence, ou tout simplement pour poutrer tout ce qui bouge avec force et fracas ? Et ben autant passer quelques heures pour faire ce que je fais souvent, les Hiraganas en plus.

J'irai donc droit au but : ça marche ! C'était tout bête, mais fallait y penser.
Pour ceux qui voudraient des précisions sur le fonctionnement de Hiragana Battle, en gros :

1) Notre sensei nous apprend une nouvelle leçon pour massacrer les Hiraganas Warriors de la zone Y. Ces leçons sont organisées de manière logique (par sons), tranquillement. En gros, 5 nouveaux caractères à chaque fois, voire plus s'il y a utilisation de dakuten ou de handakuten. Ce sont juste des petits signes qui sont rajoutés pour modifier les sons. Exemple tout simple : [ku] く se transforme en [gu] ぐ juste en lui ajoutant un dakuten. Le signe en lui-même reste le même, donc ça reste très simple une fois qu'on a compris le principe.

2) On part dans la zone Y pour appliquer la leçon : je vois か qui me regarde d'un air vicieux ? Ben je choisis sa traduction [ka] pour lui apprendre qui est le patron.

3) Retour en ville, leçon suivante, et rebelote. Parfois, des leçons de vocabulaire sur les mots de base sont rajoutées, histoire de changer un peu. Idem via quelques (rares) sidequests.

4) A partir d'un certain moment dans le jeu, le principe d'inverse : vous allez voir [no] se balader, et il faudra retrouver の pour lui rappeler combien la vie peut être difficile. Dommage d'ailleurs que cette étape ne soit pas plus présente, parce que c'est bien plus difficile dans ce sens-là que dans l'autre !

Et donc, ça fonctionne : je ne sais plus exactement à combien d'heures j'en suis, mais en s'appliquant, en un peu plus de 10h, on est capables de lire à peu près tous les Hiraganas sans trop de problème (même s'il y en a certains se ressemblent beaucoup, ce qui prête à confusion). Au niveau du ryhtme, une petite heure par jour + relecture des notes le soir, et c'est bon !

Attention cependant :
- Sans carnet sur lequel noter les Hiraganas au fur et à mesure, c'est même pas la peine.
- Les Hiraganas sont répartis dans une logique zone/son : c'est très pratique au début, mais du coup vers la fin, on ne revoit plus forcément ceux des leçons précédentes, ce qui n'aide pas à les mémoriser. De même, les séries d'Hiraganas sont aléatoires... mais c'est souvent les mêmes qui reviennent, donc on s'entraine sur certains plus que sur d'autres.
- Ne comptez pas apprendre le japonais avec ce jeu. Là, on se retrouve comme quand on était minot en maternelle à apprendre ces trucs bizarres qu'on appelle des lettres, et c'est tout, ou presque !
- Vers la fin du jeu, on se rend compte qu'il n'est pas suffisant pour permettre de continuer à s'améliorer (en automatisation et en vitesse de décodage notamment). Il faut alors basculer sur autre chose.
- D'ailleurs, évitez de frimer une fois le jeu terminé : non, vous ne pourrez pas tout décoder même si vous avez appris par coeur tous les Hiraganas. Prendre un texte au hasard vous calmera de suite, parce que sans les Katakanas, on se retrouve vite bloqué. Heureusement, la suite (avec les Katakanas donc) est également disponible.
- Il manque clairement un vrai post-game pour continuer à véritablement s'entrainer.

Malgré ces bémols, Hiragana Battle est un ""jeu"" qui remplit parfaitement son office : aider à apprendre les Hiraganas. Si c'est ce que vous cherchez - que vous avez la flemme de vous y mettre via des moyens plus conventionnels ^^ - alors vous ne serez pas déçus.",1472434937,1511472493,True,4,1,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game can be extremely frustrating if you have prior knowledge; the more you know the more you will be annoyed. 

Most of the impatience comes from RPGmaker, however, as this is bare-bones as RPGs come. This coupled with the aggravating UI (you have to scroll through an ever-growing list of all the Romaji syllables to make a selection) makes it more of a chore than it should be. I digress...

I haven't completed it yet, and I'm not certain if I will. As it is, this game is a great introduction to learning Hiragana. It is paced out well enough, and the lessons are simple to learn. I cannot fault the game for what it does, because it does it quite well. This game WILL make you remember the Hiragana characters, as promised, but in the most aggravating way imaginable. 

An RPG where you fight enemy characters (literally) by matching them with the corresponding Romaji. Seems simple enough, but the rate of random encounters in this game is obscene. Areas that take 30sec to walk through can take up to 30 minutes because of all the battle sequences. After finishing an encounter, you cannot walk for even 10 seconds until the next one starts, which is infuriating. In a game depending on classic RPGmaker level design (ie. crude mazes), the player HAS to walk around somewhat unimpeded to complete the level. This is impossible in this game.

Since you won't fight more than a few characters in each battle, you will be seeing the same 5 syllables pop up in every zone (for example, the first zone consists of 30+ encounters with only 5 ""S"" characters). You only memorize a small chunk of Hiragana at a time, while completely ignoring those that were previously learned. If I did not already know my Hiragana, this would almost definitely lead me to forget the early lessons. 

The small bits of vocabulary you learn are a nice addition, but is definitely not a focus or even really a selling point. Apparently you fight full words by the end levels, so I'm going to try and stick around until then.

TL;DR: This game will make you memorize Hiragana in the most annoying way possible, but it is effective. Only buy if you know *NOTHING* about Japanese writing. 

P.S. you're better off googling the different alphabets and writing them out yourself, it's free and much simpler to remember.",1472425031,1472433488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Well, this game doesn't fully replace a class, but it works just about as well, if not better.

Hiragana Battle is an indie RPG made to teach you the first part of Japanese: Hiragana, one of three character sets in Japanese. The game itself is your simple turn-based RPG with a leveling system and the plot isn't terribly rich, but it's entertaining enough to spend hours learning Japanese with.

In Hiragana Battle, you will learn all 46 characters of the Hiragana character set (and its dakuten and handakuten variants) and a bunch of words from yes/no to household items and a few simple phrases, along with their Romanized (Romaji) variants to make it easier to understand the pronounciation as an English speaker. The Hiragana character set is surprisingly easy to get a hold of, taking about 14 hours of gameplay to learn, however I still find myself going back through and still having to look at my notes (which I very much recommend you do, especially on paper and pencil), so the memorization definitely takes time. My best suggestion is to do a single or two chapters a day, then grind out for a good couple days until you don't need your notes to defeat all the enemies, and then move on. I made the mistake of going through and just jumping to my notes when I found myself stumped.

The game gave plentiful information to understand how the Hiragana set is written and pronounced, and gave many examples of words and a few phrases, but it didn't feel satisfying enough [strike]because it just wasn't enough i must learn all the japanese and become the most weeb[/strike] because the game gives very minimal examples for conversation pieces, but it's permissible since its purpose is more-or-less get you hooked and researching afterwards.

tl;dr: I give it an 8.5 out of 10; It's a very great way to get into the Japanese Language and learn a bit of it, but it doesn't have enough content to fully replace what a class/your own research would do. I very excitedly await the release of Katakana War, and hopefully a sequel after that for Kanji. It and Hiragana Battle will be worth the $6.99 each. I almost wish I didn't get it on a Summer Sale Price so I could pay full-price for this.

After finishing this game, I have to express my disappointment. I'm disappointed that there's not more of this awesome game and that the Katakana version of this won't come out until February next year.

Want to learn Japanese? Play this game. It's incredibly useful. It's always bothered me that I'm not fluent in another language. This game has paved the way for change. I'm now fluent in HIragana. It really only takes...I don't know, 10 hours? After that you'lll have a pretty good grasp of the language.  At about 20 hours I was extremely confident. Along with this game, I downloaded an app. from the Google store  to study Hiragana on train rides to and from work. It seems to have done the trick.

While this game is amazing, I wish they would've taken it even further. But for what it is, and the price it's at, the game does a great job of teaching you. Here are some improvements that could be made:

- Battles focused on writing. I can read the characters, but even after playing this game I struggle with writing from memory. I kept thinking how cool it would be if this game offered some Zelda/Okami style puzzle system integrated with teaching the player how to write.

- Pronunciation. Maybe have some battles based on pronunciation. This really only exists during the final boss fight.

- More sentences and integration with the phrases the game teaches you.

I love this game. Thanks for the great work!",1470743895,1472516567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am learning some Japanese. I am [i]not[/i] having fun.

The lesson sets are fair educational material, with voice clips and tips on writing the hiragana, which are welcome enhancements. The music is fairly good. As a game, however, Hiragana Battle combines the worst missteps of the JRPG genre into a single frustrating experience. Gameplay is clunky and slow, made up of grindy battles in which every attack can take upwards of half a dozen key strokes. You can also use the mouse, but the game isn't well-geared to that either, and you have to click on the hiragana in the tiny menus instead where they loom large on the battle screen.

Drilling the Hiragana by selecting (or better, typing) matching English syllables is a fine thought for practicing them, but every element of the interface seems designed to take as long as possible to navigate and use. Or more likely, they were the default settings of a sort of JRPG-maker program that the devs didn't bother to find a way to improve, despite the fact that they cripple the experience by inserting pointless user-unfriendliness into everything.

Quests and story progression are not special, except that they also are laden with pointless, time-consuming delays and lazy design. Obstacles appear and disappear without explanation to railroad you through puzzles and the game takes up even more of your time with unskippable dialogue and cutscenes designed to show and tell you everything obvious so that you don't get a chance to explore anything on your own. For example, there is a quest to fix the broken bridge (of course) with three nearby logs. You will know where to find them without needing to explore because if you so much as approach the bridge, for the first, second, or twentieth time, your guide NPC will helpfully and vocally wish that you had some materials to fix it with, and you get to watch the camera slowly pan over to where the logs you need to go get are, and then slowly pan back. Then when you pick them up, you are treated to an identical dialogue pop-up congratulating you on finding each individual log, despite the fact that they are right next to one another.

There is no way to skip or quicken the repetitive animations, cutscenes and dialogue boxes that quickly become extremely tiresome. There is, however, a hotkey to quit to menu without confirmation and without saving, so you can lose all your session's progress with the press, even the accidental press, of a single button.

I would love to have games help me learn, but when my blood pressure is screaming because I am too frustrated by abysmal game design to focus on anything else, I don't learn very well.

For the pacing of the game, each ""chapter"" would introduce about 5 new characters to remember. It would go one by one with pronunciation and how to draw the character. You really need a pencil & paper to copy it down. Once I had my next set of characters, I would save & quit, and spend a few days practicing and memorizing these characters. Once I had them memorized, I returned to the game to continue playing, where the game would use an RPG encounter system to practice what I had remembered, and I would do this without referencing my notes. This pacing worked perfectly for me.

In between, it would also show some common words, as well as some basic Hiragana grammar and special characters to know about. My notebook has 2 pages full of notes. One page for the 70 different characters, and another page for words that were taught.

It gives grinding an extrinsic value that excuses the poor level design.
It's a great tool to start learning Hiragana ( + some vocab). Emphasis is on start.

Although I think it is important to recognize Hiragana in different fonts, I believe the one used in the writing animation is inappropriate. It has little curves that are superfluous and not beginner friendly to draw. The additional connections inbetween strokes that make the characters look more fancy are also misleading and confusing. It should have been more like the font in the dialogue.

There are one-time-only moments where the concept is reversed. It would have been nice if you could access these at any time. Also, it would have been good if there was an advanced dungeon with unrestrained randomness where you can encounter every enemy there is. The troups are very limited - that makes it transparent and exploitable and you won't learn effectively how to tell all kana apart.

Everything beyond the function of learning Japanese is plain and merely serviceable.
If you let that sentence sink in, you would agree that there is no point in describing the ins and outs of the inherent weak design. Just know what you want from this.

Hab eigentlich gar keinen Grund japanisch zu lernen, aber wer weiss wofür man das mal gebrauchen kann :D Soll jetzt nicht so negativ klingen, aber ich schreib mal nur die paar Dinge auf, die man besser machen könnte:

- Lektionen, vor allem das Zeichnen der Buchstaben/Silben etwas besser überspringen können. Sorry, ungeduldig! Vor allem, wenn man es wiederholt.
- Evtl. noch einen extra Vokabel/Zeichen-Test mitliefern, wär schön! Man könnte auch die Phrasen, wie Guten Tag etc. die man in den Sidequests erhält mit reinpacken. Weil die Story hört ja im Prinzip mit den Zahlen auf und die paar Wörter die danach kommen, sind ja in der Reihenfolge immer gleich. Und die Reihenfolge in den Lektionen auch.
- Die Gefahr besteht, dass man das nur optisch ""auswendig"" lernt, weiß nicht wie man das besser ausdrücken kann, weil man ja nur Knöpfe drücken muss, ohne sich Gedanken machen zu müssen, wie man es ausspricht, schreibt etc. Man könnte bei der Attacke die Kämpfer ihre Laute mit aussprechen lassen, oder auch Übungen mit reinbauen, bei denen man die Buchstaben mit der Maus zeichnen muss, statt nur zu klicken. Bietet sich ja vor allem in der ""Paralleldimension"" an. So mal als Idee. Die Soundfiles sind jedenfalls ja eh schon da. Oder wurde das bereits verworfen? Könnte man ja auch einstellen, falls es zu nervig wird.
- Mehr Abwechslung/randomisierte Gegner. Vor allem wenn man schon weiter ist, auch mal ältere Buchstaben mit einstreuen, damit man die auch gleich wiederholt. Gut, man kann natürlich auch die alten Orte besuchen, aber man will als Spieler ja lieber die Story voranbringen als lernen :P Oder einen Modus, der mitwächst vom Schwierigkeitsgrad. Weil nach 15 Stunden, hat man eigentlich alles drauf und es wird langweilig. Vielleicht gibts ja eine weitere Geheimwelt oder Trainingsarena?

Spent about 9 hours in this game and i'm feeling pretty confident with my hiragana and enjoyed the game for what it is. The pacing of the game is excellent. The rate of which new hiragana is introduced was perfect for me And if you want to grind, it's also benifical for you to practice hiragana if you're struggling, but isn't required. 

Story: Well, it's unique. I'm not going to say this is the greatest rpg story in history, but still a better story and makes more sense than FFI. Laughed a few times, got hopefull around the middle, and then the story went flat again. But it was enough to keep me to the end.

Characters: your party stays with the same 4 and gains no new party members. Considering the mechanics, more characters aren't really needed as your main four aren't really special.

Mechanics: sadly, theres a lot to be desired for an rpg. I went through the whole game using only one other move in combat other than the ""attack"" button, and it was the heal for grinding. hopefully in the next game, they can have some kind of magic system that does some kind of speed read or something. But the point of the game is to teach Hiragana and the game accomplishes that in a more entertaining way than writing out the characters repeatedly. 

Quests/sidequests: main quest is stop the evil plan. Sidequest usually offer a better reward for going back to a place to grind for 5-10 minutes and can sometime work on your vocab which the main story doesn't focus on till the very very end.

Overall, I feel good about my hiragana and was entertained enough by the game that I would buy the sequel for Katakana when it comes out. Would recommend if you're looking to learn hiragana and want to have a reward and evidence of your improvement along the way.

[b]I'm not far into the game so this is currently more a first impression than anything. I will update this when I am finished playing the game.[/b]

I've only played about 45 minutes of this but so far, it's great at teaching. It's best to have a notepad/paper and a pen handy to write things down, the game will actually tell you to go do that if you don't have one there already. The game takes things slow and encourages good ways of putthing things into memory. It starts off simple, teaching you the vowels with their pronounciation, equivalent characters in English and character in Hiragana for each one. It lets you learn things and provides options to repeat stuff so you don't have to worry about missing things and if you note things down as it tells you to, you'll start to pick them up fairly quick.

I like how it teaches you how to read, speak and write Hiragana instead of just focusing on just one of those as a lot of other things seem to try and do. It also helps that it acknowledges learning another language is daunting and difficult so I feel I can trust in it more. It defintely helps with holding my attention.

Another thing I'm loving so far is that it's doing all of this within a traditional turn based RPG. So far it's fairly simple stuff for those elements but where it really stands out is that the enemies are Hiragana characters (potentially words and other stuff later on, I'm not far in) so that in addition to attacking, defending, support and item use, you have to actually understand the enemy in a very literal sense to damage them.

That really helps with learning as it gives you just enough pressure to keep your brain working and the things you're learning will start to fit into place as a side effect of playing. Instead of learning a bunch of stats and different elements or whatever enemies are weaker too, it's another language. The game is also just fun so far and both the characters and the story are quite charming. This isn't a game that's concent with boring the player.

It's not perfect as the dialogue text characters, the on screen characters and the how to draw/write animations for characters are all a little different to each other so it can get a little confusing when learning the correct way to write stuff but I guess that gets you used to different writing styles and it didn't get in the way much, I just wanted to make sure I was writing things down perfectly. That aside, I'm pleased with it so far and I would recommend looking into this if you are interested in learning Japanese.",1467778468,1467778493,True,10,3,0.606836199760437012,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Altough you don't learn much vocabulary through the game, it still teaches you the basics to start learning japanese. 
This is how you should teach people languages that use a different writing system than our standard one. I would love to see the katakana sequel and maybe another intermediate version that focuses a little bit more on vocabulary. It would also be great to see an arabic version, since you can apply the same tutoring system that is used in this game.

It is fun to play and you have the educational factor in there, which makes this game very compelling. I do believe that people find it cumbersome to remember all kana and especially the stroke order, but this game teaches you how to do it: left to right, top to bottom, just like the japanese kids learn it in elementary school. Hiragana are the first type of characters the japanese children learn, and you basically approach the language as they do.
If you ever plan to visit Japan, as I have done it multiple times in my life, this game at least gives you some basic vocabulary. You might not be getting that far with it, but this game is pretty much evoking curiosity in people, which is a splendid effect, as they might be getting more interested in japanese language and have a decent knowledge of Hiragana once they finish this game (I believe, I am not through it yet, but if the game keeps the lessons up in this manner, this will for sure be the case).
I bought this game during the steam sale, but (given that I pretty much like both characteristic features of the game) I would also have bought it at full price.

I wish there was an equivalent game for Katakana and Kanji, I would absolutely buy them within the fraction of a second.

Judging from the perspective that this is more or less an ""educational"" game, I would say I haven't seen a better one in a while.

PROS:
- Can actually be used for learning;
- It follows oldschool JRPG mechanics;
- It has some twists in the learning process (like sometimes making latin letters appear as enemies intead of hiragana).

CONS:
- The repetitive music can get really annoying after some time playing;
- You can't switch easily between characters in Equip menu;
- Shopkeepers' menus have some delay opening;
- There is little variation on the hiragana warriors groups' showed, it has about 4 on each zone I think (random permutations would be ideal IMO).

For a rpg turn base game, this one can help you learn it an easier way than stay at the school figuring out how write them down (Screw the school for taking my 25$ just to teach me the lessons of consonants). I mean... who needs school anyways when you can enjoy shouting and pronounciating letters to fight (ingame of course).

The game provides a overview of Hiragana syllables, the fundamental writing system of Japanese grammar, with a number of vocabulary terms. Intermediate learners can brush up on old lessons while wishfully hoping on Katakana and Kanji DLC inclusions.

In the story, you play as a group of teenagers battling to retake their village from omnious ""Hiragana warriors."" The premise of a village being overthrown by Japanese syllables graciously teeters the line between cheesy educational writing and the script to a B+ anime. Writing aside, Japanese to Survive pairs its lessons with turn-based RPG battle sequences that ensure you are always reviewing material.

Overall, I highly suggest Japanese to Survive to any first-timers or anyone initially intimidated by a highly symbolic, Asian language. Each lesson is succinct in educating the player about the pronunciations, translations and writing strokes of each Hiragana character.

There is a lot of grinding in the game, it feels very RPG maker generic in terms of story and graphics, and the game tended to crash on me every hour or so, requiring constant saving or lost effort.

The battle mechanics are okay and help you memorize Japanese characters through rote practice in the RPG battle system, however it's noticably clunky, such as when you try to go down to get back tot he top of your menu, it is disabled and if you overattack an enemy, your next attacker will miss if he still attacked the same target.  Old school stuff that's frustrating.  Still, for an entry level Japanese game it gives you the entire alphabet, plenty of room to practice, and a few phrases and words to go with it.  The best part of the game is easily the last run, where you start using phrases instead of simple sounds to fight enemies.

I would recommend this game to fans of RPGs looking for entry level Japanese knowledge.  Could also be a good gateway for kids.  However, it is noticably clunky and crash prone.

Yes, it does provide some necessary things to learn Hiragana, such as how to write, how to read etc.But I think its way to review or remember, is a bit stupid, and quite slow. Killing monsters to make a choice seems interesting, but in fact it can only help you with ""recognition"", yet you won't learn further usage or practice its pronunciation. Not to mention the less of Katakana -- same or even more common, and should be learned together with Hiragana.I also believe that in this way the learners may not form constant memories and can forget it easily.

Frankly speaking, I felt really excited when I saw this during the period of learning Japanese as a very beginner, and using RPG Maker to make a learning ""game"" is quite creative.However,compared with my free online video lessons from Netease in China, this is not so cool as I expected.

- Helpful when traditional learning methods aren't your thing
- Teaches words and phrases to support reading words in Hiragana
- Audio pronunciation helps tune your ears and your tongue
- Comments on some common font differences in appearance

CONS:
- Sans serif font on lessons would be appreciated
- Attack menu is rather long. Submenu by consonant/vowel would reduce scrolling.

Le faire de manière simple et ludique, en connaissant non seulement la prononciation, mais aussi la manière d'écrire. Un petit test avant d'entrer en jeu pour péréniser ses connaissances et sa mémoire (et occire) des hiraganas est un coup de maitre.

Un jeu parfait pour accompagner ceux qui veulent apprendre le japonais en autodidacte. N'oubliez pas de prendre un carnet pour tout noter et pratiquez (jouez) régulièrement. N'hésitez pas à faire les quêtes secondaires pour en apprendre davantage en matière de vocabulaire et de culture.

回想起刚刚开始学习日语的时候，不要说写假名，想要记住假名怎么读都是个问题。我当时是个问题学生，上课玩手机不听课，虽然想着去日本留学，但是学日语怎么也努力不起来。当时补课班老师一周一下子给我留20个假名（其实不难），我就是背不下来。后来老师说，不行，你这样下去学不了，我就有点害怕了，才开始努力学日语。一周20个假名，加上前一周留下的一共40个，我决定我拼了命也要背下来。手机一收，上语文课开始背假名。上课咱溜号可以，但是总也不能影响别人吧，所以我只能记住罗马音+假名，但是一听读音就反应不过来了。总之也是经历了很多吧，到现在也算是基本成型了，和外教老师直接用日语交流也都没障碍了。一共用了整两年。
一下子想起很多有点语无伦次……近年学日语的不知道为啥貌似是在增加，也许是ACG的缘故吧。我看过同补课班一个同学，纯粹是为了ACG一点爱好学日语，初级书才学9课就已经不行了，上课总是哭。老师开导也不好使。现在时常想起来，感觉分外心痛。学语言绝对不是简单的事情，学一门语言之前不能凭着一腔热血就冲上去，要好好想想，自己究竟为什么学这门语言。游戏里这些人是为了打倒邪恶势力（可以，这很ACG）学，现实中很多人是为了留学/当翻译去学，或者说是为了ACG。什么理由都可以，但是一定要有一个理由去学日语，不然，最好还是不要学，就像我学了两年半法语现在半句法语都吐不出来（破学校英语特长班教法语，不是很懂）。

Alors pourquoi j'ai acheté ce jeu, me demanderez-vous ? Parce que je suis passionné de langues étrangères et que je ne manque jamais une occasion d'en apprendre et de me perfectionner. Là, en l'occurence, j'ai une occasion d'apprendre le Japonais de manière amusante, c'est-à-dire à l'aide d'un RPG, genre avec lequel j'ai grandi. Même si, niveau culture, ma passion est plutôt située en Scandinavie. Mais qu'on se le dise avant que j'oublie : jamais un RPG n'a été aussi instructif.

Alors déjà, ce jeu a bien évidemment été fait sous RPG Maker MV. Ne vous arrêtez pas sur ce détail, il est évident dès la première heure de jeu qu'un énorme travail a été fourni dedans ! Le scénario de ce jeu tient sur quatre lignes. Là encore, ne vous arrêtez pas sur ce détail ! Etant donné que l'objectif de ce jeu est d'apprendre une langue et pas de suivre une histoire, c'est très bien comme ça. Attention, il y a bel et bien un scénario, et il est suffisamment ficelé pour vous pousser à apprendre le Japonais. Parce que la qualité de ce jeu réside dans son gameplay. Globalement, comment ça fonctionne ?

Dans un écran de combat, vous ne combattez pas des monstres. Vous combattez des hiragana. Si vos capacités défensives sont similaires à un JRPG classique, il n'en est rien pour vos capacités offensives. Vous vous battez avec des romaji (la traduction des syllabes avec les 26 lettres de notre alphabet), et le seul moyen d'infliger des dégâts à un hiragana est de l'attaquer avec le romaji correspondant. Il n'y a aucun autre moyen d'infliger des dégâts. En d'autre termes : un combat = un exercice d'entraînement. Jamais le grind n'aura été aussi instructif.

Tout ça c'est bien joli, mais vous allez forcément me faire une réflexion : combattre des hiragana en prononçant des romaji fait certes apprendre comment on prononce les hiragana, mais il serait opportun de combattre des lettres de la notation ""à nous"" avec des hiragana - c'est-à-dire faire l'exercice dans l'autre sens. Justement, le jeu a pensé à vous et vous le propose à partir d'un certain stade du scénario. Bon, en fait, vous n'avez pas le choix. Et, cerise sur le gâteau : le moment où vous devez faire l'exercice dans l'autre sens colle parfaitement au scénario. Je n'en dis pas plus.

Comment fonctionnent les leçons ? Concrètement, et le jeu met bien l'accent dessus, ce jeu a beau être addictif et amusant, il ne vous instruit seulement si vous jouez le jeu. Préparez un cahier et un stylo ! Les leçons sont accompagnées d'une musique douce aux sonorités orientales qui est la bienvenue. Le jeu vous apprend non seulement quel romaji va avec quel hiragana, mais également à les prononcer correctement et à les écrire (les hiragana). En effet, la majorité des hiragana sont composées de plus d'un coup de crayon, et les coups de crayon ne se font pas dans n'importe quel ordre. Le jeu vous le montre de manière animée.

Vous commencez facilement, en apprenant les voyelles a, i, u, e, o (et pas a, e, i, o, u, mais ne vous en faites pas, vous vous y ferez rapidement). Vous apprendrez ensuite la série des ka, vous apprendrez au fil du jeu ce qu'est un dakuten et un handakuten et comment ils changent un hiragana. Chaque leçon est accompagnée d'un quiz pour vérifier que vous avez compris la dite leçon. Niveau combats, et c'est important de le signaler, lorsque vous arrivez dans une nouvelle zone, vous combattrez, parmi les ""monstres"", les nouveaux hiragana fraîchement appris ET dans la foulée, des anciens. Niveau RPG, forcément vos personnages ne gagneront pas grand chose. C'est vous, le joueur, qui réviserez vos acquis et consolidez vos connaissances.

Le jeu contient également des quêtes annexes qui vous en dira plus sur la culture Japonaise. Même si cette culture, comme je l'ai évoqué, ne m'intéresse pas tellement, un peu d'instruction sur le reste du monde ne fait jamais de mal. Vous apprendrez aussi du vocabulaire. Si vous jouez le jeu jusqu'au bout, vous pourrez écrire les mots fraîchement acquis sur votre cahier. Lorsque vous arriverez à Tokyo, vous commencerez à lire vos premiers dialogues en Japonais (même si c'est juste ""ohayou gozaimasu"", faut bien commencer quelque part). Par exemple, un garçon vous demandera d'acheter un manga dans la boutique. Sauf que dans la boutique, parmi ce que vous pourrez acheter, vous trouverez un tas d'articles dont l'intitulé est rédigé... En hiragana ! Cela ne se produit pas au début du jeu, aussi ne négligez pas le grind, cela n'a jamais été aussi instructif.

Concrètement, parmi les défauts, il n'y en a qu'un seul : un bug mineur, mais rien de bien méchant. Pour ceux qui sont curieux : dans le village en ruines, quand j'ouvre une leçon et que je reviens sur la map, l'effet ""safran"" disparaît. Rien qui n'empêche de jouer.

Ce jeu, en plus d'être une très bonne méthode de langue, démontre que quoi qu'on en dise, hé bien oui ! Oui, il est possible de s'instruire grâce à un jeu vidéo ! Et surtout, ce jeu démontre que même dans un genre qui ne se prête pas vraiment à l'éducation, il est possible de faire un jeu instructif. Et surtout : un jeu instructif et amusant à la fois.

A qui s'adresse ce jeu ? Aux ""weeabos"" qui en ont marre qu'on les appelle ""weeabos"" et veulent passer aux choses sérieuses. A ceux qui veulent apprendre le Japonais, tout simplement. Ou, alors, à ceux comme moi qui sont passionnés de langues étrangères et de RPGs. Surtout qu'à ce prix-là, cela serait vraiment dommage de passer à côté.

This game is the first RPG game that I mostly willing to buy, a game for learning Japanese. When I was searching some random games on Steam and saw this special game. It is hard for me to find a way to start and here it is, a game for the beginner to learn Japanese characters and vocabs. However, I can't fully recommend this game for everyone to play because it is not easy to learn-and-remember in this game, even I take lots of notes and keep practicing on writing the characters. It is a method for me (maybe including anyone) to 'Learn' Hiragana but not 'Remember' Hiragana. Maybe it is just me having some learning problems, but seriously, the game's battle system is quite boring that you focus on defeating the enemies and get money to buy stuffs, then go to the next area and do the same thing. The aim still is still finishing the game and have a happy ending after a while I may forget all I have learnt and wasted several hours. I don't mean that playing this game is wasting time but it is not a choice to keep learning Japanese. Like I said, it is a good start for learning Japanese language but if you have already had a bit or more knowledge of this language, this game may not perform effectively. 
Let me sum up this long freakin' review:
Pro:
- a choice for someone who would like to learn Japanese but don't know where to start
- suitable for someone who like playing RPG games
- educative
- feel fun to learn Japanese name of the daily stuffs
Con:
- quite boring battle system
- not easy to focus on learn-and-remember the Japanese characters
- some of the stuffs in game are useless or unable to use (spoiler alert!)

  2. For the writing segments to use only one image of the character, or to have both images side by side and to have the drawn image stay on the screen until a button press.

Before I get into detail, I want to view this game from two different angles and review them seperately.

Learning:
This just blew me away! Within 10 hours of gaming split across two days I was able to master all the hiragana and learn some basic vocabulary. I spoke some japanese phrases beforehand but never bothered learning how to write so this was totally new to me.
I found the lessons to be very well paced and never felt over- nor underwhelmed.

Gaming:
Likely made with some version of the RPG Maker, so adjust your expectations accordingly.
I always liked the RPG Maker games so this was totally fine to me. 
The graphics are nicely done and quite fitting. Sound and music are your typical 8-bit retro RPG sounds, so don't expect an amazing OST.
The story, while absolutely sufficient for this kind of game, is the only weak point. A very very basic RPG story that tries to take two interesting turns, but those are easily predictable. For this kind of game I don't see this as a bad thing though because you can easily take a break and absorb what you've learned without wondering all day how the story will continue. If the story was too good you might end up rushing to the finish in one session (which is totally possible) and end up with way too much to learn.

If you're looking for a traditional JRPG, there are far better alternatives out there in terms of story, gameplay and animation quality.

Because this game delivers what it advertises. It's teaching you a pretty complex language in a fun way, by going step by step and repeating the important parts often enough to keep them in your head. You're not only taught the writing system Hiragana along with the pronunciation of the characters but also basic conversational skills, important words and a bit of japanese culture. And the rudimentary RPG style is an additional motivation to keep going. ""Just five more battles until i can afford that new sword"" means that you voluntarily repeat a lesson 5 times more. And no matter what ""wholesome"" or ""natural"" approaches to language learning might say, practice is what makes you perfect.

Keep in mind though that this will only teach you one of the three writing systems. If you really want to learn japanese, this can only be complimentary to real language lessons (online or in class).",1461838331,1461838525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So you dont literally forget after 20 mins off not seing it. Other than that i will say its good to take breaks and refresh your mind like the game says to do iff your strugling as it does help.

As for Story its quite fun actually the game will keep you entertained, You start off in this litle peacefull village and end up in a tavern talking with some friends, when your finished you go outside and a mysterious man appears and thats where the journey will begin. You travel around a map to new places and from what i can tell you end up in a distant land called ""japan"". For me its not like going to school and just having a teacher tell you do this and do that, and the side quests aswell are cool because they tell you a litle bit about culture in japan. They Can also teach you new phrases aswell.

But I'd like to give some spoiler-free constructive criticism for the game.

[list]
    [*]Lack of variation in waves: I'm to understand that when making a game in RPG maker, one would have to create set ""troops"" of enemies(Making this a difficult point to improve upon), but I find myself sometimes remembering Hiragana characters solely upon their placement within their troops, which isn't a practical way to remember Hiragana.
    [*]Takes itself a bit too seriously as an RPG: Having to keep track of a storyline and stats is commonplace in a typical RPG, but here is just feels strange. Sorry if this is a bit of a nitpick!
    [*]More boss fights would be very welcome: I found the most fun (and rewarding) parts of the game were the boss fights with Noburo, where a stream of characters would spawn (even better with the final boss's final form- I may go back and play just that a few more times), but I felt like these weren't really explored enough. A boss fight per ""world"" would be a welcome change in my eyes.
    [*]More ""other dimension"" areas: These were among the most challenging segments of the game in my eyes, and I would have loved to see an area where you have to translate english words to their Japanese equivalent.

How do you manage to pull that off in an educational game!? 

Yeah, the battles and the questing are kind of shallow and wouldn't hold your interest if this was any other game.
I would have liked them to vary the enemies better, as its way to easy to know what hiragana to use if you only use the latest we learned every quest. It only rarely switches things around, if more quests were like the final dungeon, it would be more engaging, I feel. 

In the end though, I finished the game and I am FULLY confident in my Hiragana skills.

technically the game had only covered 10 percent of what it had to cover, so why not make it unwinnable at that point?

Little background info: I have been learning japenese on the down-low with my home boy *cough*[spoiler]ROSETTA STONE[/spoiler]*cough* but the way they teach hiragana is a bit wonky. I was at the end of lvl 2 and I could barely remember more than 10 or so hiragana. I just couldn't get them to stick. Then I saw this on sale. I figured,""Eh, why not?"" and purchased it right away. This was by far the best descion I have made this year

I leveled a few levels ahead of what I was supposed to be and completed all the side quests before advancing the story, and would you know it those are great ways to memorize the hiragana.

That's this entire games premise if you haven't guessed yet, and boy does it do it well.

Everything you learn in each lesson is easily accessed for reminders.  

On the game side of things, I think it was a really nice touch.  We can face facts. If you like JRPG’s, you likely buy imports since it’s not a very popular genre outside of Japan (Hence the ""J"" part). Some of them don’t exactly offer English as an option for Subtitles.

Some specific things I disliked:
- Game felt short. 
- Hiragana enemy groups are not random but preset, so after a while you just know the group of monsters you face, rather than knowing the characters
- Because of the way the menu is set up, sometimes you can guess a character by the place it has in the menu rather than actually knowing it. I tried to circumvent this for myself by not opening the menu until I knew what I wanted to answer.
- I would have really liked if there was a post-endgame dungeon where all the characters are present and you fight them randomly, rather than preset groups. With the game right now I don't really come away feeling I mastered all the characters, and feel like I still need more and better practice.

My suggestions would be: 

1) Once you finish an area or specific quests, it could be great to have quick shortcut portals to move to other cities faster. 

2) Music gets repetitive when in fighting mode with Hiragana Warriors at the beginning. Keep in mind we want to repeat areas as many times as possible until we fully memorize the characters. So it would be great if music were random and with a wider selection. Not just same everytime. I truly loved the music at the ending and overall!! Cutie Anime style :).

3) If you are a woman, japanese pronunciation should be studied from a Japanese female voice because male japanese voices are really different. If the player is a boy he should learn male pronunciation. It could be good to be given this option too.

4) More vocabulary quizes :).

Hab das Spiel soeben beendet. Mit allen Sidequests hat es ca. 17 Stunden gedauert.

Die Kombination aus Spielen und Lernen ist super! Man wiederholt Hiragana indem man Hiraganamonster in zufälligen Kämpfen im Final Fantasy Stil besiegt und lernt Hiragana zu schreiben, indem man sich die jeweiligen Schreibanimationen dazu ansieht. Einfache Vorkabeln werden einem im Spiel auch beigebracht.

Was die Story angeht, ist Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle nichts besonderes, unterhält aber trotzdem.

Für jeden, der Japanisch lernen möchte, sich aber nie dazu überwinden konnte anzufangen, kann dieses Game ein guter Einstieg sein. Besonders für Leute, die zu faul sind ein Buch für solche Zwecke in die Hand zu nehmen - so wie ich :D


######################################

I just finished the game. It took about 17 hours with all sidequests completed.
The combination of playing and learning is great! You revise hiragana by fighting ""Hiragana""Monsters in random battles and learn to write hiragana by watching the writing animation in the game. 
There are also Vocabulary Lessons. 

The Story about an evil Mage sending hiragana warriors into the world, to conquer it, is nothing special, but quite entertaining. 

So, if you want to start to learn the japanese lanquage, this game can be of great help. Especially for lazy people who don´t like to read books ... like me :D",1457910742,1457910785,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Einen Käufer habt ihr auf jeden Fall.

Nun aber zum eigentlichen Bericht:

Ich habe mir dieses Spiel gekauft, da ich schon immer an Japan interessiert war und schon mal die Schriftzeichen lernen wollte. Leider ist es halt so, dass man sie schnell wieder vergisst, wenn man sie nicht mehr aktiv lernt oder dass man nach kurzer Zeit keine Lust mehr hat sie stupide auswendig zu lernen. 

Deswegen dachte ich, dass dieses Spiel eine interessante Alternative zur Karteikarte sei und das ist es auch.

+ Man fängt mit einem Set an Zeichen an und lernt im Laufe der Zeit immer wieder neue Sets.
+ Die Story wird zwar keinen Oscar gewinnen, ist aber unterhaltsam genug um weiter zu spielen.
+ Die Grafik ist passend. Insbesondere Fans alter JRPGs ala Final Fantasy werden sich freuen. 
+ Der Preis ist mehr als fair

- Im Allgemeinen ist das Spiel sehr repetitiv. Man lernt ein neues Set an Zeichen und geht dann in ein Gebiet, in dem man vorrangig von diesen Zeichen attackiert wird, welche man besiegt indem man ihnen ihre Übersetzung an den Kopf wirft. Wenn das geschafft ist, lernt man mehr Zeichen, geht in ein neues Gebiet, übersetzt die gelernten Zeichen usw usw.
- Leider kein Wiederspielwert
- Sprache leider nur auf Englisch

Ich bin mir natürlich bewusst, dass man nur durch Repetition lernt, aber ein wenig mehr Abwechslung wäre lustig. Vielleicht mal Gegner einbringen, die man nicht durch Übersetzungen besiegt, sondern in alter FF-Manier. Das ist jedoch Kritik auf sehr hohem Niveau. 
Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt ist, dass jedes Gebiet sein eigenes Set an Zeichen hat, die vorrangig attackieren, was dazu führt, dass, wenn ich mal ein altes Set wiederholen möchte, ich in Gebiete gehen muss, die keine Erfahrungspunkte mehr bringen oder storytechnisch vollkommen irrelevant geworden sind. Da wäre es schöner, dass geschaffte Gebiete einfach alle Zeichen mit der selben Wahrscheinlchkeit beherbergen.

Summa Summarum: Ein Spiel, welches mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht hat und welches ich noch oft starten werde um zu üben.

Tl;dR:
Kauft es! Ihr werdet dadurch NICHT japanisch sprechen können, aber ihr werdet Hiragana lesen und schreiben können. Aber Vorsicht, das Spiel ist komplett auf Englisch.

Liebe Entwickler, bitte übersetzt euren nächsten Titel! Zur Not meldet euch bei mir, dann mach ich das :D

It's a little adventure, and has gear upgrades...  What can I say?  It's an RPG.

Japan produces some pretty cool stuff. Some of the best games of the last few decades have been either first released in Japan or exclusively released in Japan. A lot of the times, nice folks who know the Japanese language will translate Japanese games so that we can enjoy them to their fullest. However, that may take a while, if it ever happens at all. Besides, self-reliance is an underrated thing. Now, if you’re a chowderhead like me, then you only know one language, and that’s ‘murcan. But what if you want to broaden your horizons? You could take a Japanese course at school. But only if your school offers it, and if it’s a college course, you may be spending quite a bit of money on the course and books. You could buy Rosetta Stone, but that could cost you up to $200. I don’t know about you, but I’m not a great learner in the normal classroom setting. I’ve tried games before like My Japanese Coach, but I was bored and frustrated soon after starting. I’ve always wanted to learn Japanese, but have never found a way that works for me.

And now this is starting to sound like an infomercial, and as much as I love me some infomercials, I purchased Learn Japanese to Survive: Hiragana Battle from the Steam store on a whim the day it launched. I didn’t even know this was a thing until the day I bought it, but I saw the $7 price tag and good early reviews and figured I’d give Japanese one last shot. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made.

Hiragana Battle is an educational game. It teaches the player Hiragana, one of the 3 forms of the Japanese language, in the wrapper of a traditional JRPG. Misaki, your Japanese instructor, gives you lessons. You’ll then set out to the world map and fight Hiragana characters by selecting the matching sound they represent.

The story, which isn’t of much importance, goes like this: Noboru, a strange, unkempt man, is summoning Hiragana characters into the real world in hopes of taking over the land. It’s up to you and your friends to fight off the Hiragana Warriors and seal the gates before Noboru gains too much leverage and conquers Japan and all around it. But of course, you don’t know any Japanese at all, so you have hit the books before you’re able to save the world.

Hiragana Battle is made using the RPG Maker engine, an engine I quite like. And the game looks very good, for that sort of style. It does have an aura of being generic, mainly because this is how most of the games made with the RPG Maker engine look, but it’s well-done nonetheless. I never looked at anything in the game and said, “Oh, that’s just ugly.” It’s a good looking game, even if it isn’t the most impressive looking game.

The lessons are nice. Calming music plays in the background as you’re told about each Hiragana character. Unfortunately, you are going to have to break out a notebook and do some old school learning, as Misaki will ask you to practice writing each character. Even though this is by far the least fun part of the game, it's actually very beneficial as you'll more than likely need to recall back to earlier sets of characters later in the game. And although you have the option to revisit an earlier lesson with Misaki, it's a lot easier to be able to flip through a notebook. Throughout my 15-hour playthrough I took several pages of notes which gave me a much needed crutch. 

You see, Hiragana Battle doesn't do a great job of mixing up all of the characters throughout the game. You'll go hours and hours without seeing some of the earlier characters and if you don't have a great memory, like myself, then you're going to have to look back in your notebook to see which character is which. There are many characters that look nearly identical with the only difference being the stroke of a final line. 

Which brings me to my next qualm with the game: the confusing font. Most of the time, we see Japanese characters typed out. Whether that be on a website or in a game, you usually see the same font. Hiragana Battle includes this font in the game in their menus, but when Misaki teaches you how to write the characters, and when the characters show up in battle, they’re a more stylized version. Often times, they look different than what we read as normal Japanese font, and this can also make things very confusing for beginners. However, it does teach you to recognize the characters in different fonts, so it can be a good thing.

I was able to triumph over all of that and push forward, and soon after, I started recognizing Hiragana characters on Twitter from all the Japanese wrestling posts I see and from the man himself, Mother/Earthbound creator Shigesato Itoi. And I kept going forward. And then I started recognizing Japanese words, and that excitement continued to push me through to the end of the game. One of the more interesting things that Hiragana Battle does is, towards the end of the game, it’ll start listing items, weapons, and armor in Japanese only, so you’ll have to be able to read the word in Japanese to understand what you’re buying. There was a side-quest where some dude in Japan really wanted a Manga issue, and I had to go down to the convenience store, look at their items that were only listed in Japanese, and then read and buy the correct item to give him. The feeling I got when I read “manga” in Japanese was euphoric. It was a sign the game was truly working.

Along with the main quest, you’ll have side-quests. Most of these are fetch quests, but all of them teach you new vocabulary. You can also acquire special points from these side quests to help boost the levels of your party members.

Every RPG element about this game is pretty standard and basic. You’re not going to see any new functions. You fight enemies to earn money, you spend that money on better weapons and armor, you level up to get stronger, and you save after every battle. If all of your party members die in Hiragana Battle, it’ll reload to your last save, so make sure that you’re saving every few minutes.

Hiragana Battle isn’t a perfect game by any means. It has issues both on the RPG side and on the teaching side. I would have like to have seen some form of mnemonic teaching in the game, aka helping the player remember by relating the character to something else, like a kangaroo for ru or a pig tail for su. But then again, maybe it’s best to leave that up to the player.

Even with its flaws, Hiragana Battle is well worth the $7 asking price. $7 will teach you all the characters in the Hiragana set, plus grammar and punctuation, vocabulary, and even some common phrases. And it’ll do it in a way that keeps you engaged. It’s about time someone used the grind of RPG’s for an educational purpose. I’m sure it’s been done before, but learning the Japanese language through a traditional JRPG is just about the best combination you can come up with. 

The developers, Sleepy Duck Educational Games, have plans for a sequel that will teach the next phase of the Japanese language, which they plan to call Katakana War. It’s good to know that you can invest in Hiragana Battle and be able to continue forth at some point in the same style. I will definitely be buying Katakana War, and if you’re interested in learning Japanese, I highly recommend you pick up Hiragana Battle.",1457115595,1457115595,True,38,5,0.748785853385925293,1,True,False,False,False,,,

这是一款教你学日语平假名和简单词汇的rpg游戏。
总之一个词，好评！
打通关来补充。
---------------------------------------------------------------
今天刚刚打通，一共大约10个小时的游戏流程，可以让你基本掌握平假名的读写，并且教给你一些日语中的基础用语和词汇，30元钱，还算是个良心价钱，对学习日语有兴趣的零基础的朋友们一定要买！
由于没有汉化，所以适宜人群为有一定英语基础者，至少通过大学英语四级吧。

怎么说呢，对我来说，非常好，但是……毕竟这是个rpg游戏，所以不会像其他教程那样直接，自由度肯定也不如直接看教程，如果直接看教程大概在一半甚至更少的时间可以学完这么多内容。然而，就是因为没有看教程的热情，也没有那个毅力，所以才选择玩游戏。玩游戏能玩到12点过后还不睡，看教程行吗？无论是纯粹玩游戏还是学习，其实我都是没什么毅力的，很多游戏都懒得玩通，但这个游戏我就通了，游戏内容吸引我继续学习，日语学习吸引我继续游戏，好似有一种魔力。而且通过不断的打平假名怪，也相当于是一种不断的练习，毕竟学习就是需要重复，这样才能掌握的更牢，但打怪肯定比做练习要有意思多了对吧。总之把学习与游戏相结合这个想法很有创意，也很成功，可以说这是最有教育意义的rpg游戏，也可以说这是日语教程中最好玩的。

从游戏角度来讲，没有过于出彩的地方，是一款中规中矩的rpg，但的确做的一板一眼，融入了许多rpg的要素，所以算是一款合格的rpg游戏。而且这个游戏过程中还能不断给你惊喜，比如一开始我以为就把平假名50音教完就完了，但是中间突然就冒出了词汇课，令人意外。战斗方式也在后期会发生变化，算是不同的练习方式。（看字选音变为看音选字等等）总而言之，这一切让我感到非常满足。

当然，并非没有缺点。比如教学课程没法中途退出，必须看完，有些麻烦；支线任务教的日语没有收集在一起，复习比较麻烦；战斗随机性不够高，意思是指战斗的时候怪并不是纯随机的，而是分了几组固定的然后随机出一组怪，这对于练习来讲的确不完美。所以，如果想要系统地学习日语还是需要正规教程，这个游戏只能算是兴趣向入门教程吧。",1456502325,1456648557,True,8,2,0.593147099018096924,3,True,False,False,False,,,

I really want to like this game more..
It's a great idea, and they kind of pull it off. 

Pros:
Educational.
Not horrible graphics and audio.
Learn hiragana while grinding away in various levels.

Cons:
Battle menu menu menu. Did they really have to put *every* single option for the battle menu? 
RNG hiragana attack in the wild a little too frequent for my liking [and poison dmg is too high as well].
I feel like as they were trying to make an educational game, they should have made the hiragana monsters more varied throughout levels. 
And if the title didn't tell you enough, this is *just* hiragana [no katakana and a bare minimum vocab list].

In all, it's probably fantastic for absolute beginners, but if you know some basics this game probably wont teach you much. It's cheap enough, so it balances out, I guess.",1456472409,1456472409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So far, I've been able to learn sounds and recognize how those sounds look if written on paper. While that doesn't seem helpful, it is a huge asset. Things get a bit trickier when ""Dakuten"" are introduced, making sounds you can easily remember into completely different sounds.

The game is slow paced so that you can take your time. There is no rush. Pencil/Pen and Paper is a MUST. This way you can take your lessons with you on the go, and as a helpful guide in case you forget. You can also access every lesson from your inventory after you complete the lesson and quiz. Fighting the words helps with the visual but they don't make the sounds in order to help you memorize how to pronounce the sound even when you choose the correct sound translation.

- On ""combat"" les hiraganas par groupes de consonnes ( ma, mi, me, mu, mo par ex ) après la leçon correspondante. Trop peu d'instances proposent de varier les consonnes, et on finit par confondre ha et na.

- Des instances demandent de désigner un hiragana à partir d'un son, plutôt que l'inverse. Super idée : c'est le plus utile pour réellement se tester. Mais là aussi, il n'y en a pas suffisament. Et il faudra penser à garder la sauvegarde pour les refaire.

- C'est du tour par tour. On a trop de temps pour réfléchir. Il aurait fallu un timer ( réglable ? ).

- Difficulté mal dosée. Par pour les caractères, non : pour les ennemis. Toute l'équipe peut mourir sans avoir fait de fautes, vu que les derniers hiraganas peuvent vous one shot.

- Cette difficulté oblige à farmer. RPG oblige, les 1ers ennemis donnent moins d'xp, il serait plus intéressant de les revoir plutôt que de tuer en boucle ceux de la dernière leçon.

Putting it in this simple JRPG format did the trick. I ended up having a lot of fun and took down about 20 pages of notes in the process, and that's not counting side quest vocabulary I didn't bother writing down but probably should have.

On the plus side:
[list]
[*]It's simple and accessible, especially if you're familiar with traditional 2D JRPGs
[*]Moves at an easy pace, only throwing a few new characters at you per area
[*]Has some humor and plot to it without being dumb or overly cheesy
[*]Actually helps you learn Hiragana
[*]Clear explanations of many subtle aspects of the language, like dakuten or particles.
[/list]

On the negative side:
[list]
[*]Despite the presence of several buff skills, they don't see much use, so the combat's missing on depth most of the time
[*]Gear is likewise mostly linear upgrades with a few unique pieces here and there
[*]There's no way to limit encounters. You'll sometimes trigger 3 fights in 10 steps and wish you had Repel or something similar to halt them for a while as you search for an item or NPC. An Escape Rope mechanic to quickly return to town would be great for the very few times you need to backtrack into a dungeon as well. (The game teleports you out nearly every other time.)
[/list]

On the hit/miss side:
[list]
[*]Voice acting is usually great, but sometimes it's unclear or too abrupt to understand.
[*]Demonstrates stroke order and gives tips for how to properly write all characters, which is awesome. But in-game font, character image used for enemies, and handwriting tutorials often differ from eachother and occasionally cause confusion. (I'm looking at you, り!)
[/list]

My best moment in the game: When it started throwing words at me instead of just isolated characters and I realized I could read most of them. You start running into people who speak Japanese and items with Japanese names and you get to figure out what's being said or what the item is called not because some tutorial or textbook told you to, but because you want to know what is being communicated and you know you have the tools to figure it out. (Because you were taking notes, right? Right?)

Das Spiel selbst basiert auf HTML5 und Javascript und ist daher leider ein bisschen laggy (liegt aber teils an meinem Laptop der schon etwas älter ist). Die Art und Weise des Lernens selbst ist ganz Nett gemacht.. einziges Manko - Das Kampfsystem. Anfangs mag es Nett wirken das man das richtige Symbol / den Englischen Buchstaben wählen muss.. jedoch nervt es ungemein wenn man zig mal das gleiche Symbol wählen muss und wenn dann noch mehrere ""Hiragana Warriors"" aufm Feld sind kann das ganze ziemlich nervig werden. Ich kann also den 2 Negativen Bewertungen hier in diesem Bezug Recht geben.. es IST nervig von der Menüstruktur her gesehen da es umständlich ist wenn man 4 Gegner hat, und dann beispielweise 2 eigene Charaktere.. denn das muss man 2x4 bis 4x4 mal Angreifen.. und bei jedem dieser Angriffe muss man erst wählen welchen ""Angriff"" (die englische entsprechung des gegners) man nutzen möchte,und dann welchen ""Hiragana Warrior"" man angreifen möchte.. was ziemlich nervig wird auf Dauer. Da mir aber der Style des Games (Grafik etc.) gefällt, und ich eh Japanisch lernen möchte behalte ich das Spiel und werde es nicht umtauschen. Schlecht ist das Spiel nicht.. nur ist die Menü Struktur etwas Doof gelöst - da sollte man eventuell nochmals etwas anpassen als Entwickler. 
Ich habe das Spiel soweit gespielt das ich meinen ersten Kampf hinter mir hatte, dort gab es 1 Gegner und man hatte 2 Spielfiguren zu steuern.

Its of course very repetitive, you simply choose the right hiragana for the appropriate romaji. Or the other way round in so called ""other dimensions"". I guess. Can´t remember really. My brains mud now.

It wasnt too much fun in the end but very satisfying for me to get through this, after all I now can read at least some hiragana. Forget the vocabulary. Its just good for learning to read the hiragana in my opinion. Dont expect to learn a lot or be able to speak a lot. It really is mostly about the Hiragana writing system.

My Hiragana is not perfect by playing through this a single time but far better than before. And I guess thats all one can ask for after just ten hours. That furthermore makes maybe 4-5 hours of intensive studying for me, since I knew a lot of the hiragana before and could concentrate on fighting through the game instead of writing down all the letters. In fact I did not write down a single hiragana. Cant tell how far in what time one comes when being an absolute beginner. 

I´d suggest to use a memrise course along this journey if you play through it in chunks, what I absolutely recommend for  a beginner since else your brain might burn out. Keep calm if you feel overwhelmed, its really not that hard and will get easier and easier with the time you are ready to invest.

Glad this game exists, cant wait for what they anounce in the end, wont spoil it though :P


I recommend it to everybody who wants to learn in the first place, since it is very likely that the game depth and mechanics wont be whats satisfying in the end for many people. Its still just a pure grind.



p.s. I thank all the people making these kinda games possible, those kickstarter supporters as well as the developers as well as the buyers. Being on the lookout for games like this for like 3 years now.

----------------------------------------


I have had a positive experience with this game.  I currently have worked and lived in Japan for about a year now, and have had trouble learning the language. This being said, I have been exposed to the everyday Japanese language, and I can say this is a good starting place for people who like to play games and want to learn Japanese. Below is a list of pros and cons I have found within the game so far. 

-------------------------------------

✱Pros:✱

---------------------------------------

❤ 1.)  The order the lesson is presented to you. 

Details: I really like the order they present the material(s) to you, and I think it is one of the best styles I have seen for a beginner learner.

❤  2.) Defeating the ""hiragana."" 

Details: Although, this might be a minus for some, I like it. You have to constantly kill the same hiragana, but there is enough of a mix, that it does not get boring to me. Repetition is key to learning a new language.

❤ 3.) The side quests 

 Details: The side quests are optional but give you the option to expand your vocabulary. I really like how they just don't focus on the hiragana alone. This and visuals are sometimes shown through out the side quests, which help! I have also learned a little culture from it, like types of food and drinks in Japan.

❤ 4.) The ""lessons"" 

Details: The lessons have a listening and writing part, which I really enjoyed. If you actually read what Misaki says, it gives you a lot of good tips! I highly recommend not skipping through it. The quizzes are nice. They don't grade you, just check your comprehension and do not let you go to the next question until you select the correct choice. (Although the monsters are not as forgiving. haha)

❤  5.) The humor 

Details: As you start in the game, the humor is quite funny. *At least to me*. (SPOILER: Leon's story about the pumpkins. The snowman in the town and the dog in snowleaf village, etc.)

❤ 6.)  ""Bonus point crystal"" 

Details: As you do side quests, you get bonus points which you can turn into the ""bonus crystal"" next to Misaki that you can exchange for levels. 

❤ 7.) Option to review with Misaki 

Detail: I like the option to review when you want to!

---------------------------------------------------

✱Cons:✱

---------------------------------------------------

✘ 1.) The story 

Details: The story is a bit ridiculous and it is sometimes hard to take the game seriously, but if you remember you are here to learn the language versus playing a game, a lot of this cons can be overlooked.

✘ 2.) The interface 

Details: There is some features I think that can be added to help the game be a little more smoother for the learner. One  is as you progress and learn more hiragana, the list obviously gets bigger. However, as it gets bigger no arrow/scroll is shown, so as a beginner you are searching through the big list of hiragana and not realizing there are more choices. I got stuck for a good 5 minutes the first time this issue arose. I could not find the choice, so I thought I had remembered incorrectly. Load and behold, I scrolled down on my mouse because I became frustrated and the list scrolled down and there were more choices! This seems so obvious now, but it might be a similar problem to someone else. In addition, I think the hiragana should have an hp box. It is a bit annoying not knowing how many more hits I have to do before I should pick the next pair. (For example: I might pick answer ""ko"" for the hiragana ""こ"" for ALL my players, and than the hiragana dies...and the player still attacks with the answer ""ko"" to the next mob...even though it is ""か"". I found this to be VERY annoying.) However, one you are in the area a bit, you start realizing how many hits the hiragana needs before it dies.

✘ 3.) Too easy to ""escape"" 

Details: For me, I like a little strategy in a game. So this might not be a con for some. Whenever you click the option to ""escape"" you always do. There is no real struggle. So I could go through a dungeon without practicing any hiragana. (You need to for money and exp though.)

----------------------------------------------

✱Other suggestions to the game that I feel are not critical but would help the game.✱

---------------------------------------------

1.) ❥ Customization

Details: It is a bit boring to not see the characters change at all as you give them new equipment or items. I wish I could name the main character too.

2.) ❥ More variety earlier

Details: As I have progressed through the game, I did see change; however it is a bit of a too slow of a pace in my opinion. 

3.) ❥ Features to include:

Details: Things that I think that should be added but not necessary. I wish as they attacked there was sound effects. For example when you answer ""e"", it would be nice if the character pronounced the hiragana. This gives repetition and makes it easier for the listener to remember how it is pronounced. There should be a feature where you can turn it off too, for the people who think it would be too annoying. Secondly, when you are getting exp, it will show a bar and +number of exp earned, but there is no numbers on the bar. It is not too annoying, and it might be cleaner for some gamers, but I like seeing the numbers. Maybe you can include a feature to add or remove numbers to both exp bars and hp/mp bars. Thirdly, when going to the inn to rest, it does not show you how much money you have. Although it is very cheap (only 10¥ and you should have it), it still seems weird not to see it. I would feel differently if it was free.  Lastly, I think when you save the game it should say where you are located. The only way I can tell the difference between the files is by the hours I have played.

4.) ❥ More side quests + order they appear

Details: When the side quests are first introduced they all appear at once! I am an eager learner, so I tackled them all at once, hoping more would come as the game progressed. So far...NOPE. I think the pacing of the appearance of them should be fixed. The learned might either get overwhelmed or bored due to no new variety. 

5.) ❥ Stealing the little boy's  life savings from the vase

Details:  I just think it is a sad feature, that maybe we should have the option to give it back.

6.) ❥ Starting a new game (Option to skip dialogue or repeat it)

Details: Although you can mash the ""esc"" key; It would be nice to skip, as a return player.

7.) ❥  Double checking (Are you sure you want to quit?)

Details: The game doesn't ask if you want to save or if you are sure you would like to quit, when clicking the ""x"". Same with selling things, it just sells it.

8.) ❥ BOSS fights

Details: I think it should be a BIGGER hiragana that changes as you hit it. This would be a bit of a variety OR you should introduce kanji!!  It can review the vocabulary we already learned....like ""犬"" (いぬ) [dog].  How to attack: the boss comes in and it shows the kanji + hiragana + english. After the monster gets to 75% the hiragana disappears, Than the english at 50%. I think it would be fun and challenging!

9.) ❥ In game notepad

Details: Just a suggestion, but not needed.

10.) ❥ Equipment tutorial.

Details: It is a bit confusing. I self-taught myself but it is a bit frustrating not having a bit of a guide.

You will need a pen and paper so you can learn to write all the characters and keep notes if you wish, but other than that all you need is a curious mind and the suspension of disbelief.

Какое же это великолепное совпадение! Эта игра появилась буквально тогда, когда я начал изучать японский! Даже недели не прошло.

А теперь к сути. Эта игра - отличный гайд для изучения японского языка и даже более. Как человек, который уже изучил озы опираясь на уроки учителей японского, я могу сказать, что эта игра ничуть не хуже полноценных репетиторов, я бы даже добавил - дешевле в разы. Найти хорошего учителя по японскому языку довольно сложно, да и цены у многих очень кусаются. Поэтому, эта игра - ваш выход из затруднительной суеты и вход в японскую культуру.

Помимо очень простых и понятных уроков правописания Хираганы, вы будите улучшать своё владение английским (посредством вбивания непонятных слов в Google) и корректировать русский (ну, мало ли :D). Так же, игра стилизована под типичные JRPG, поэтому это ещё один способ приобщить учащихся-игроков-вас к культуре Японии.

Добавить ещё что-то можно... например, можно сказать про прекрасную музыку, про запоминающихся персонажей, про сюжет (который отдаёт типичной атмосферой японской несуразности) и так далее. Но смысл то в изучении японского языка, поэтому всё выше отходит на второй план.

Unfortunately, the clunky user interface and tedious battle system made this game unplayable for me.  The menu system is uninuitive, and requires an unnecessary amount of input to navigate around.  

Each battle involves correctly identifying Japanese characters for the enemy you choose to attack.   This requires the player to click Attack, then navigate a menu of Hiragana characters, select the character, then select the enemy.  Easy enough...except that these steps are required for every attack, and for each of the attacking characters in your party.  By the second or third battle, you know the correct characters instantly, but have to navigate the same tedious menus for each character in your party repeatedly.

本来 我只是想到steam上看看有什么教育类软件，结果排名第一的就是这货^_^（现在才发现，当时是我默认了按 “新发布”查看教育类软件……好吧，我也许有义务来为这个游戏写第一篇中文评测）
额，不管了。反正吾辈已经买买买啦~

目前看来，这个游戏大概就是让我们能够在英文模式下愉快的与日本平假名大战三百回合~~想想有点小激动呢
（现在，也就是2016年2月17日，这款游戏仅支持英语。也就是说，你必须有一定的英语基础，才能欢乐的大战平假名！）
不过看相关的讨论帖，后续可能还有其他语言会加入。如果能支持中文的话，这款游戏应该是非常适合新手学习日语基础知识的。

1.让我以看待RPG游戏的眼光来评价这款游戏吧。
（大事不好，这类游戏我好像只玩过一点仙剑……所以我说错了什么，请大家轻拍Ｔ－Ｔ）

Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle对电脑的配置要求不高，刚刚试了一下，就连我的平板都能运行这款游戏＾－＾
（所以想买这款游戏学习日语基础知识的小朋友们，基本上无需担心自己的电脑能不能玩这游戏）
游戏的画风，就像N年前JAVA上那些手游一样，看起来并不细腻＆唯美。但还是比较简洁＆小清新的。
游戏操作没什么难度，按照提示操作就行。

2.从日语学习工具方面来评价 Learn Japanese To Survive - Hiragana Battle
      好吧，其实这就是只游戏~ 它所能提供的知识是有限的。
      （截至目前版本，它里面只能教你平假名和一些日常生活中常用的词句。不过这款游戏以后可能会有更新或DLC，还是很值得期待的。）
      以日本语能力测试(JLPT The Japanese-Language Proficiency Test)作为标准，我个人认为只要你能够顺利通过最基本的N5考试，这款游戏对你的日语学习没有太大的帮助。
      而且，用这款游戏来学习日语的效率并不高。可能正如一位给了差评的兄台所说，玩40分钟的游戏就跟看5分钟教学视频差不多。
      战斗多了总感觉好无聊（这纯属个人感受)
      
以上都是这游戏的缺点……那么这款游戏适合什么人捏？
      (自问自答:）适合给那些对日本文化有兴趣的，想学日语却又无法忍受日语传统教学的日语初学者。
       毕竟，玩一个小时Hiragana Battle比看一个小时日语教材有趣多了~

  
   

另：不要以为这游戏标着Japanese，就以为里面有神马interesting的东西～
那些就想围观　某猫某球　之类的少年们，可以放过这个专为学习基础语言文化知识而设计的游戏了……它里面没你们想要看的东西……
这款游戏还是灰常严束的。
（我知道我这样的测评不是很严肃Ｔ＿Ｔ，毕竟吾辈瞎说了大实话。手动滑稽～）

For example, once I figure out what a character represents in battle, it's just tedious and doesn't help learning to repeatedly hit him. They should consistently morph or do something slightly cleverer.

Aside from that, wasting your time with clunky JRPG mechanics from the 80s while you're trying to learn is annoying. 

The concept is cute, but just focus on making it exclusively a learning game next time. Nobody who's up for learning a writing system needs to be entertained by junky JRPG mechanics like a child.


Longer edit:

I can't go too in-depth as I've only put about 40 minutes into the game before I dropped it.

The battle system is very simplistic - you slap the Hiragana character icons repeatedly with their corresponding english sound and use typical video games skills that have nothing to do with language learning like heal skills.

It's simply a missed opportunity. The battle system hasn't got any depth, there's no reason the Hiragana characters shouldn't just die in one hit to their corresponding sound and/or replace themselves with others, and all the video-gamey stuff is very detracting from the actual learning.
Beyond slapping characters around there doesn't seem to be anything more, for example an integrated drawing tool to recognize that you can draw the characters.


What I learned in 40 minutes of playing this I could have learned in a youtube video of 5 minutes. And it shouldn't necessarily be that way. Yes, I get that it's a game, but it's a learning tool first. Nobody's gonna get into this game thinking ""hmmm I crave a real good JRPG right now"", it's purely for the learning in an enjoyable way - it is neither a good learning tool nor enjoyable.


Seems like this review is garnering a lot of traction. I say judge for yourselves, and refund it like I did if you don't like it. But let me tell you as someone who speaks multiple languages fluently - this is a very poor learning tool, even for something as basic as this.

Its a great tool to use to learn basic Japanese and its a lot of fun while you do it. Buy it. It will be one of the best $6.99 purchases you have made in a while!

This game focuses on teaching the player Hiragana, one of the more basic japanese writing systems, while still maintaining the old pixel RPG adventure games. It has a good story line for what it is and some pretty charming art and music.

I haven't played it a ton so far, but from what I got out of that short time is actually pretty good! This game has you learn japanese you've learned from previous lessons to take down all of the enemies in the game. So,

The more you pay attention, practice saying the Hiragana and taking notes, the better you will do.

That brings me to the note taking. If you are a beginner in Japanese, notes are ESSENTIAL. The game even tells you to go get a pen/pencil and a piece of paper. Though while you are practicing the Hiragana strokes as it has you do, they do seem a bit tedious in the beginning. It isnt enough to make the game feel terrible and not worth it but you do have to put in a good amount of effort to learn and play the game.

So to sum it up, the game is good. If you want a rating i'd give it a 7/10. It has great music, good art, you can go somewhat at your own pace and the story is pretty good from what it is. For $6.99 its worth it. Definitely. If and when it is on sale then pick it up if you dont have it.

In all seriousness this is pretty good so far

Edit: Ill write a legit review here bc people kinda wanna know if it's good. Weebs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

It's your average RPG with Yen as you currency. You earn Yen by defeating the Hiragana characters that pop up when you run around kinda like Pokémon. If the enemy looking like the character あ pops up you must choose ""A"" from the attack menu as this character is the equivilent of A in the English Language. If it's wrong you do 0 damage and if it is correct then you do the damage that your character(s) can achieve.

It has a surprisingly good storyline to it, and it has a good amout of repition in it to help you learn the characters. It has good graphics and the way it teaches you to learn these characters is pretty effective. I WOULD recommend writing them down on a note pad as you will certainly need some kind of reference to help you along with the new characters in the beginning. Mine looks like this puu.sh/nblSN/4b6e41845b.jpg . 

I recommend it, it's only £5 and I bought it because I said to my friend before I was interested in it but I didn't really have an incentive to learn, but this is great because I actually want to play it since it's a game. 

TL;DR It keeps you entertained, it's a good story and It has good ways of teaching. Would recommend. Buy it cheapskates ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).",1455678537,1455726016,True,51,35,0.422151416540145874,4,True,False,False,False,,,
