You are the owner of a call centre, just starting up, and so you have to expand (buy) extra office space so as to hire call centre staff (i.e. phone operators, as per the game's title).
Extra items can be purchased to increase staff morale - such as toilets and food facilities (not necessarily placed in the same area).
Also, you can change salary levels or send staff on paid holiday leave so as to increase their happiness.

A variety of personnel are needed to run the call centre; if you don't cover all of the requirements (as needed by your business clients), then you lose money.
Sometimes staff resign, which can be quite annoying - as you need to hire replacement staff (which have an initial set-up cost, on top of their wages).
And sometimes staff go home sick (sick of working in the call centre, no doubt).

Therefore money can get a bit tight at times, as you try to juggle all of the competing demands without going bankrupt (I haven't been declared bankrupt so far, thankfully; neither in game nor in real life - not yet, anyhow).

The graphics are very basic - nothing special there.
However, the gameplay is quite good.
And there are many instances of a bit of humour in the game (some of the reasons staff give for resigning, or taking a day off sick, can be somewhat amusing).

The game is $3, which is quite reasonable (although, compared to some of the amazing games you can buy online for aout $3 to $5, it possibly should be cheaper).

Although Smooth Operators is not a high-end production, it can be quite fun (if you like management games).

Smooth Operators Call Centre Chaos is a game developed and published by Heydeck Games

The basic premise of the game is that you run a call centre and all the chaos that ensues from running said call centre (no pun intended)

The game is okay for the cheap price it offers. You hire people for different departments, make money, try not to get fines, research new things and bring in new contracts. Nothing more, nothing less...

Smooth Operators is a decent game. I just wish it had a bit more depth and have a little bit more items and stuff to do, though still is a good game

For it's cheap price, it's a definite steal!

I was the guy who probly called you about Directv, Bank of America, or even sprint. Actually you called me because I was inbound not outbound. So what is actually cool about this game is you can name your Call Center whatever you want design it how you like and ultimatly run a call center. You will start by naming the call center setting up your 1st 3 rooms being inbound outbound and back office. In the call center world this doesnt always happen at the same site. It is ultimatly based on your contract. I have only ever had to do Inbound in most of why I did unless it was to call someone back. Now something that you will notice that is very real is that you will have a high turnover in this game, Why you may ask? Thats the Nature of the Beast in a call center either your worked to hard or not enough and youll defently experince this. Now as far as Gameplay is concerned it can be a bit slow at times and stacked against you do to the point you cant hire who you want when you want. you have to work to unlock all of this. In the call center world you would work from the ground up with HR Supervisors Opperations managers trainers QA teams and Tech. This is where the game loses it for me when you start out you have the option for IB OB and BO and thats it no HR no Supervisors to push no Opps managers no Trainers and for some reason this game doesnt have Quailty associates which is the key to a call center without Quality control that guy that is speaking with you on the phone could call you a dumb ignorant stupid head and there is nothing you could do about it except leave the company if that is your choice. So in Closing the game is good its not excellent or great it is good it delivers on some funny bits but it falls short on authenticty when it comes to the point of where you have to unlock everything. the game should be like here is your money build and thats it. so 3 stars out of 5 because it is fun youll have a good time playing it and there is a challenge the its not 5 stars because again lack of authenticty and the fact they make you unlock stuff that you need early on in the game. Do I recommend this game ? Yes especially if you work , have ever worked or are planning on working in a call center it will give you a bit of a taste or give you a parody of what it is like.

A great combination between Corperation Inc. And sim tower, This game combines great aspects from both.  How ever, there are quite a few reasons this game isn't a thumbs up.

1.Unlocking is slow.
What I mean is, by the time I was given the ability to purchase handymen/HR people/Project managers, it was either after the time I realized I needed them(in the case of HR/Project Mnagers) or when the cause that i needed them escalated way out of hand.

2.No hot keys
If I wanted to change the shift time of a group of employees, I had to select each worker, open the menu, slide the thing, save it and close it for each worker.  While this isnt as big of a problem concerning one or two blocks, this becomes a tiresome chore when dealing with entire clients.  I would also put hotkeys/mass selection. in for hiring/firing, educating, and upgrading

3. No control of unlocks
The project manager researches what ever he wants, taking a couple of in game days.  I would suggest having a more a concrete progress bar instead of ""about 3 days.""  I would also suggest allowing me to select which things im reserching.  I dont need to unlock a 15th floor when my elevators can only carry three people.

Simple fun game. I mean simple in the way that the concept is straight forward, there seems to be a lot of depth to the mechanics of it.

In the example hiring a Call Center Rep involves opening the store menu, opening the operations staff menu, selecting the type of rep, and dropping the rep on their workspace. Not terrible, but pretty taxing when you just added 12 desks and need to fill them all. The tutorial feels a little invasive and it seems to play every time. 

Breaking it down to Pros and Cons.

Pros:
Easy initial learning curve.
Decent depth in mechanics beyond initial learning curve.
Cute art stlyle
Unique Game
Low Price

Cons:
Dated feel.
Tutorial nevers.
No true ""Sandbox"" mode.

This is a Simulation game.


[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

No options or whatever. (only ingame)
Only able to choose if you want to play. Normal or Hard mode.


[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You start with a small company and it needs to grow like a true business building. You are able to give your company a name that you desire. You have to complete jobs to earn some money. Completing some Challenge (achievements) will give you some extra bonus Cash. Slowly but truly you will expend and become a true hit. But more things will be unlocked and causes for trouble.

Destroying a room will only give a little bit of money back.
Upgradeable Rooms
Tutorial ingame.
There are not alot of music variety.
There is an option to change the volume of the Sound/Music with a slidebar
Able to speed up time.
There are many Save slots.

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

Birds are able to enter the office floors?
Each day you get a \""tip of the day\"" and able to save your game.
Reminds me of \""Sim Tower\""

Turns out it's not really a ""simulation"" nor a ""strategy"" game (as implied by the Steam tags) but a ""click-and-wait"" game. Luckily I got it at a decent discount. 

The premise is promising and could make for a very interesting game. Thus it's a real shame it's almost not a game at all. Your business runs on its own and you just have to keep adding new rooms and people when you have the money -- and usually you don't have the money, so most of your time is spent waiting for money to accumulate. There's also not much to stop the money from accumulating, except for the random message dialogs that randomly pop up and require you to click ""OK"". The game is literally unable to advance a single in-game day without you being present clicking something. Forget about SimCity and the like where you could leave the game to run for an hour and come back. This game runs a minute or two and after that it need you to click a button.

Building a new room into your call center costs $3000 or more. At least in the beginning (for the first couple of hours) you won't make more than a few hundred dollars a day, so you wait. And wait. And wait. Occasionally someone quits and you need to replace him or her, and that of course takes away from the small pile of money you had accumulated.

Upgrading rooms costs $5000 or more, so your money seems much more well spent just adding rooms than upgrading them. Or at least I think so. The game lacks proper statistics so it's difficult to get an overview of your situation. Sure, you can read the thoughts of all of your employees and you can see a list of your clients (up to a whopping number of two (2) within my first 5.5 hours, or two in-game months), and you can click on all of your rooms and get to know some stats about them. But there's no list of rooms, or heat maps of any kind. There is a list of employees, but it appears that you cannot sort it, and the filter system (for choosing which types of employees you want to see) is really clumsy, requiring multiple clicks on a different screen from the actual list! So while you can get the details of a detail, there's no real big picture available.

Talking about your employees, you can hire different kind of people: inbound (IB) agents to receive calls, outbound (OB) agents to make calls, managers, janitors, etc. The different professions are very stereotypical. They might've been true in the 1960s or funny in the 1990s, but seriously, it's 2016 now. When a manager's work description is ""putting fear in the agents"" and you see him running around and shouting at people, I don't even. Similarly, a ""Coach"" turned out to be a cheerleader girl waving pom-poms. Seriously?? 

You can also educate your employees (just a click of a button and ta-dah, they are instantly smarter!). The education levels are very sketchy too, like a manager learning a class ""Management By Fear"" or another person learning ""Lying 101"".

Yet another profession is the Project Manager. They unlock new things for you to do. However, you cannot decide what, so most of the time they unlock the possibility of building an even taller building (10 floors, 15 floors, ..., 50 floors, ...) when your building is still less than 5 floors tall and you'd much rather have, say, some better education levels or some new room types. (Not that it'd matter, you wouldn't have the money to buy those things anyway, until after waiting for quite some time.)

All in all this game seems to waste its potential really badly. It's not a game that you play intensively, but a game that you put into the background or on your second screen while facebooking or something, and just check out occasionally to click ""OK"" on that dialog. I believe I'll still give this game a chance for a couple of more hours to see if the money would start pouring in a little faster and if that would make it funnier, but I have my doubts.",1452206510,1452206510,False,59,3,0.724947750568389893,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

Generally, it's facing a lot of problems, which make it shallow and unrewarding:

[list]
[*]Stupid AI (being the way you handle your clients/contracts)
[*]Unintuitive UI (ancient UI, making the most simple tasks a pita)
[*]""Broken"" content (almost 50% of the mechanics/employees/abilities are utterly useless)
[*]Unbalanced gameplay (balance is achieved through trial & error solely, logic is almost extinct)
[*][b]Unintuitive UI[/b] (to stress this a bit more, anything you want to do other than watch the screen, is extremely time consuming in the most unproductive way)
[/list]

[h1]The Good[/h1]

Although I wouldn't think of many ""good"" things to say about the game, being a sim fan I did have my few hours of fan, mostly because of: 

[list]
[*]The nice concept (I'm an entrepreneur, so it's always interesting to run a virtual business)
[*]The cute/silly pixel graphics/animations 
[*]Building 40-story headquarters
[*]How easy it was to get a 100%
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you're not a hardcore sim fan, there's not much to like in this game. 

If you are, maybe add it on your wishlist and grab it when it sells for like 20 cents. 

I'm posting the review as positive regardless of the ""bad"" feedback, simply because it's a well-hearted, and quick, ""fun"" game, that's priced as it should be. 

I'm also guessing we won't be seeing any future updates, and all the broken/useless mechanics will stay the same, making Smooth Operators a silly/mindless sim game.",1431926314,1431926314,True,0,0,0.454661726951599121,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+ Fun and simplistic - quick and easy learning curve 
+ Soundtrack you can tap your foot and whistle to
+ Unlocking achievements grants a cash bonus (which usually hits right when you need it) 
+ Offices can be built up to 40 floors high
+ IT staff fixes PCs the way I'd like to ""fix"" mine
+ Most dedicated receptionists ever

- Menus would benefit from sortable columns when evaluating employees, along with viewable past reports; would be nice to schedule/educate employees by building
- Can't zoom out wide enough to see entire building

Overall, this is probably the best deal among the sim/tycoon genre on steam.

Smooth Operator has Charm, it's unique, insofar as I've never played a call center simulator before. Is that enough? Maybe for a few hours.

After a few hours it becomes apparent that the challenge is keeping people happy. And keeping people happy is largely based on your transport, elevators and the like. So while you are using elevators people get pissed from slow elevators, when you upgrade to tubes nobody gets mad and the game becomes too easy. 

So since the primary challenge of the game is managing people and their routes, it's sad that there are no controls to help route people, they pick their own paths and their pathfinding is atrotious. They will line up outside an outdated elevator even when there are shorter and quicker paths. I'm not actually sure how they pick their paths, but sometimes it's just awful. 

Their tasking is also terrible. An IT worker will fix broken computers, but sometimes he walks all the way across the building to fix his next one while there is a broken one right next to him. So it ends up with a lot of wasted time. I wish there were ways to give them an area that they work rather than let them run all over.

When it was cheap in a sale, I grabbed it.

As a business sim, it's rather lacking. The economy is very predictable and very easily exploited to make money a waiting game rather than a commodity. If you make sure you have a few thousand to pay your employees at the start of each day, you never need worry again. Set up a situation where you're earning more than you're spending and leave it running for a few ingame days to let the income pool.

Or at least you could do that, if the game didn't pause every few minutes to tell you that one of your hundreds of employees isn't feeling well. Thanks, but that's what the HR Report's for. Between pauses for sickness, deal changes and end of day reports, the flow of the game jitters too much to easily farm money. Granted most if not all of these pauses auto-continue on their own, but for those 30 seconds or however long, your entire business is paused. When 5 people go sick in one day, that's a lot of wasted time.

Then there's the worst aspect of the game; theft.
There's a chance that one or more of your employees - especially in the late game - can start stealing from you. One or more times an ingame day, you'll get a pop up saying that x amount of money has been stolen and that you should find the thief. This x can be as low as $100, but I've seen it as high as $5000. Of course by that point I earned five times that a day, but the pop ups were annoying.
The way you find the thief is to read the thoughts of your employees (that's a mechanic, Rollercoaster Tycoon-style) to find the one who thinks ""they won't notice it missing"". This can be any one of your hundreds and there's no way to sort by thought (unlike RT). You have to go one by one or wait until their theft obviously impacts their lifetime earnings.
I eventually worked out quicker ways, but it's a drag. You catch one and there are two new ones the next day.

Menu-heavy games usually allow the keyboard to move and select. In this one, however, you have to click everything. Sick employee, click the OK. New day, click the OK. Another bloody thief, click the OK. It's bloated, unwieldy and quickly becomes a drag. I only have so many hours in it because I had it on in the background when I was doing other things. And even that's just so I could satisfy my 100% achievement compulsion.
Now that I have, I immediately uninstalled it and will probably never go back to it.

Kinda funny in places (company names and some descriptions can be a good laugh the first time), but the mechanics need fine-tuning, the economy balancing and the menus un-terribling. Nilesy made it look kinda fun, though.",1427065326,1427065453,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically you are running a call center and you continously expand and upgrade it. You get a new workload everyday and try to deal with it. You pay your workers and increase your capital which you use to improve your building and the life standards of your workers. Are you going to be the evil boss who pools money only to himself? Or are you going to be an angel and give your workers vacations and raises? Or are you going to use that money to solve the elevator problems which anger everybody a lot. Are you going to add a new toilet and a canteen to your new floor? Or are you going to use that floor for even more workers? It's up to you.

Dialogues and character designs are funny. The mechanics and formula are well implemented. You have to think, calculate, invest. But for some reason I got bored quick.

+ Realistic sound effects that make you feel like you're back in the call center

		[td][h1]Aesthetics[/h1][/td]
		[td]The graphics consist of pixelated sprites on pixelated backgrounds. The art is aesthetically pleasing and contains a good bit of detail. Trash will build up throughout the day, cracks will appear as the buildings deteriorate, and the objects in rooms change when rooms are upgraded. The graphics are also clear and easy to understand with each room and employee color-coded and easy to distinguish.[/td]
	[/tr]
	[tr]
		[td][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/td]
		[td]The gameplay consists of building new rooms and facilities for your employees, managing the hiring and firing of your employees, assigning job tasks, researching new upgrades, and acquiring new contracts for your company. The room building is done on a grid system and the game encourages you to build up (as in Sim Tower, for easy comparison). One aspect of the game that was rather grating for me is that there is no way to mass select your employees. Moving an employee to a different desk is a chore. For someone like me that likes things to be organized, shifting my workforce around to ensure that like employees were in the appropriate room involves selecting the first employee, issuing a move command, selecting a separate empty desk, selecting the second employee, issuing another move command, moving them to the correct vacant desk, and then doing the same to get the first employee to the appropriate desk. Also, at the end of each day, you are presented a summary report of the day's activity that will kick you out of any menu you have open at midnight each day.[/td]
	[/tr]
	[tr]
		[td][h1]Sound[/h1][/td]
		[td]The sound design is very minimal in the game. You have a few looped chiptune-esque songs in the background that is mostly covered by the sounds of phones ringing, elevators going up and down floors, and your IT staff ""repairing"" computers.[/td]
	[/tr]
	[tr]
		[td][h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1][/td]
		[td]This game is competently made and performs its functions without hiccup, however, the game is just not fun, in my opinion. The tech tree is incredibly shallow and the game offers no greater strategic depth other than finding out an optimal room structure and then hiring enough workers to cover the amount of work your have to do for your contracts. I found myself playing the game with the speed slider turned all the way up and the game still felt like a slog. The problem is that the progression in the game is too slow. Perhaps this is to compensate for the lack of depth, but I spent more time waiting for money to roll in so I could build a new room (which I couldn't actually afford employees for then) than I did actually doing any meaningful tasks in the game. Business simulations like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, etc. have better pacing so that you're never sitting around for days in game waiting for enough funds to come in. Maybe this is a symptom of the game being ported/targeted for mobile platforms. Either way, the game just doesn't have enough meat, enough of that ""wow"" factor to recommend.[/td]

Esta tardanza que muestra la empresa en salir en el resto de plataformas est√° siendo aprovechada por numerosos estudios independientes que quieren vender la idea a las virginales mentes de los jugadores de Steam.

El ejemplo m√°s famoso de esto fue Game Dev Tycoon, un plagio descarado de Game Dev Story que aun as√≠ era un producto bastante pasable y que disfrut√© en su justa medida. Entendieron los conceptos, aplicaron las t√©cnicas de √©xito de Kairosoft en una plataforma que no los conoc√≠a y ‚Äútriunfaron‚Äù, todo correcto.

El problema es que no todo va a ser siempre tan bonito, y este juego es la prueba. La tem√°tica, mec√°nica y est√©tica esta calcada de los juegos de Kairosoft, pero sin ninguna gracia. Eres un director de una empresa de telemarketing y si, tu trabajo es igual de aburrido que suena. Pero es que el juego no hace nada por hacer m√°s llevadero tu trabajo, convirti√©ndose en un suplicio en cuanto comprendes las mec√°nicas b√°sicas (una hora a lo sumo).

Y es en la escasez de opciones donde el juego se descuelga y comienza a decaer. La profundidad es penosa y la dificultad una risa; algo imperdonable en un juego de este tipo.

I thought it'd be something I maybe fired up for ten minutes and then dropped; something I could mention off-hand to the guys at work who think it's hilarious that I have played more than 50 hours of Euro Truck Simulator. However, it was surprisingly engaging - my first 40 minute session felt like a third of that and I only stopped as I was interrupted, and to my surprise I've since returned to the game.

It's a fairly straightforward management game, but so far seems well-balanced, introducing mechanics over time and neither too challenging to feel like good results are attainable, nor so easy that you feel like you're just coasting.

The basic mechanic is building up your building to build up your business (a la Unholy Heights), combined with a very rough sort of worker management - you can hire and fire staff, assign rooms full of them to accounts, educate them and essentially add modifiers to their mood/productivity etc. by hiring other staff. There are a variety of roles covered, so balancing the ratios is the part of the game you'll have to think about the most.

Full disclosure, you will spend a fair bit of time just waiting - I presume that will be reduced as the game progresses and you start earning more money, but I've reached a slightly uneventful plateau where I just have to wait a couple of days to add a new building, and that's a little tiresome even on the highest speed.

I like the art style - it's nothing novel, but it's well executed, and you should be able to see at a glance whether the visuals are for you.

The music is a little cheesy, but I guess that's to be expected from a game about a call centre.

Overall, I'd recommend this as a cheap purchase (I got it in a bundle), but this price seems pretty fair anyway. Don't buy it expecting an immersive cinematic experience, but for the money, it's pretty good.",1422718709,1422741456,True,7,0,0.605596482753753662,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TL;DR
You like micromanaging a company of call center that could collapse at any time due to your own incompetence? Enjoy it you fucks. Otherwised save your money for weaboo shits.

LOOOOOOOOOOOONG Version.
First things first before we begin another session of 'fuck me i'm bored so lets write a review please go to the following website and play the following fucking game for at least 2 hours. Dont worry its addicting and you will somehow spend more than the requested time with the stupid game. Dont worry, the review can wait.

http://armorgames.com/play/7348/corporation-inc

Done? No? Go back you fucking idiot.
.
.
.
.
.
Done for real? Good, lets get on with the fucking show.

1.What the fuck is [Insert game title here]
Essentially its just a more improved version of that game i just forcefully shoved down your throat where the objective is to manage a call center [or a muffin button pushing company in that link i gave you.] and prevent the collapse by a number of highly subjective factors also note i use the word improved very loosely. On with the show please! *clap clap*

2.Graphics
compare to the that link call center chaos has an extremely terrible looking graphics, actually its on par but its my opinion and i hate it but sure doesnt help that game is fun. Its 2D pixelated shiet representing the everyday mundane object of an office enviroment but its a fucking lie because my old office dont have water cooler nor cute furry cats! It looks, feels and taste retro style but fuck it i hate it.

3.Sounds
People with sound sensitivity beware, its annoying. Seriously, it buzzes all day long and most of the sounds kept on repeating due to how often your staff push their big fat finger onto the keyboard and invoking the *taptaptaptaptaptap* noise so prevalent in this game but fuck it you need money. It sounds appropriate enough like a real office which is to say its fucking annoying. 10/10 SOTY. [SOUND OF THE FUCKING YEAR]

4.Gameplay
And here is where the game crash the most. Its good fun, addicting managing your little company to eventual stardom where you can build fucking [spoiler] TELEPORTER [/spoiler] because the fucking lifts are not fast enough. You can micro manage the daily scedule of your minions and even build floors upon floors of bland offices and nasty smelling bathroom that only accomodate 4 people at a time unless people goes back HOME to piss which is ridiculous because i would have gotten fired for it. Speaking of which the micro section is the game's downfall for me, sure its fun setting schedule and giving them holidays but if only there was a damn option to disable em because i want my employee to just fucking be a MINION not human beings with feely feely feelings and needs and desires. Fuck that. Also for some strange reason essential items are locked behind the research section! The hell.

CONCLUSION
FOR those who enjoyed that damn link........... oh who am i kidding?! its Armorgames.com you fucking fucks and yeah if you enjoy it then feel free to pick this gem of management chaos up. Cheers matey.

There is enough room for improvement left in this game that I would consider getting a sequel or expansion if one were released.  It'd be nice to have some metrics screens to help identify poorly performing employees, to be able to adjust schedules of several employees at once, to be able to see the previous day's performance again after you've closed the screen that comes up at midnight, and some way to more easily tell what hours you are over/under-staffed (especially with L2s!).

There seem to be odd algorithm issues that could be improved, such as when you have multiple flowtubes and employees sometimes take unnecessarily long routes or when your elevators are upgraded and people get stuck on them quite awhile because of how the floor stops get queued.  Still, if you're a fan of casual tycoon/sim games, none of these are serious enough to ruin the game.

I'll leave these notes just in case the developers want to patch this or perhaps make a sequel.

1. Lack of micro controls. I constantly found myself in a situation where I wanted to change ALL my Outbound agents or all my Back Office agents to a different client, and then had to go around changing that setting for *each and every office*, which as you can imagine got very boring very fast. This game would seriously benefit from the ability to set control groups of office blocks so you can change settings for whole groups of office blocks en masse.

2. The menu sidebar. As a result of the constant client-switching mentioned above, another thing that often annoyed me was the inaccessibility of the performance report (the one that tells you how many jobs have been done and how many are left for each client). One would think that such an important menu would be included on the sidebar (which includes the HR menu, one that I hardly ever have to look at), but it wasn't: instead I'd have to go into the pause menu to find it. Not a huge problem admittedly, but it would nonetheless be very convenient to have the option of choosing which menus you want in your sidebar for quick and easy reference.

3. Game balance. This point should be taken with a grain of salt since I'll admit I didn't play the game more than a couple of times, but it really seemed to me as though the only way to make a profit was to focus solely on the Outbound and Back Office work and just take the hit on the Inbound penalty. With the small profits you make at the beginning you simply don't have enough money to spend on the huge amount of Inbound agents that you need to fulfil a contract, especially factoring in other costs like the employee benefit blocks (the restroom, restaurant etc.), service blocks and agents, and of course the elevator. You can play it safe and save up but that takes a lot of time not doing anything which simply isn't fun, not to mention if you don't hire Account Managers the number of jobs you get will start to go *down*, which means less money - on the other hand, every day you have an Account Manager hired is another day closer to having another client contract forced on you, so you get stuck in the double-bind of not getting enough money but also not being able to fulfil your contracts, thus incurring penalties which makes it even harder to make a profit. Either the game should give you fewer Inbound jobs or make a few costs cheaper to subsidise the building and staffing of Inbound offices.

4. Priority System for Coaches. I noticed that moods were getting low in my offices so I invested in some Coaches. However, the Coaches didn't seem to have much of an effect because they randomly targeted people - a lot of the time they would go and cheer up someone whose mood was already high, which is simply a waste of time, effort and money. As a result, those with low moods ended up quitting (rather unreasonably I thought, especially after I'd bought all the employee benefit blocks for them), forcing me to hire new staff. On a particularly bad day the new hires not only wiped out my profits but also bit into my savings, making it even more difficult for me to expand. Surely Coaches should prioritise workers with low moods to stop this from happening?",1408578092,1408578092,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- The settings menu only has two sliders for sound. The resolution is wrong and cannot be adjusted. Controls are also non-configurable.
- In a tycoon game, I expect to be given sufficient information to handle my business. If, in order to do anything meaningful and keep track of even the most basic aspects, I have to keep a pen and notebook at hand and write everything down, from employee vacations to schedules, the game is doing something seriously wrong. You are provided with almost no useful information that can be easily accessed. Looking up what you CAN look up means clicking on each individual employee. This can become seriously annoying after you get more than a few workers.
- Want to change the schedule of 30 employees at once? Find the employee, click on him, click Schedule, click Change Schedule, drag the slider to approximately the right place (why a slider!?), click Confirm, close employee menu. Now repeat 29 times.
- Want to make your employees to come to work at 2 PM? No can do, your closest options are 1:57 PM or 2:02 PM. How does this make any sense at all?
- Somehow, the janitors in this game are the laziest human beings on earth. Why the hell does it take two and a half hours to clean a single desk? I should not have to hire an entire army of janitors if I only have a few rooms. This is, by far, not the only thing in this game that makes no sense.

This is the final result.

The unlocking system in this game is unproductive. The first people unlocked are entirely based on how many days have passed. You won't get the janitor until after the second day, which leaves the office dirty the entire second day and makes employees unhappy. You won't unlock the Coaches (Employees that make others happy) until happyness because a problem. When you finally unlock the employee that unlocks other items you'll find that even 5 offices full of them have a rediculously slow research speed.

This game has a very vague information system. An employee will quit, why? ""My dog is lonely at home"" or ""My sports team wins when I watch them at home."" Very rarely will you find an excuse related to something they might have actually hated, like elevator queue times or Managers dragging down their morale. There is no research time table for unlocking items, you will never know when the next item will be unlocked or if you need more researchers.

Starting out in this game is very difficult. You are given a client without any option of choice and the number of calls they want done is realistically not possible. Even with 20k it is very hard to get the number of officies  and employees to take all the calls. If you spend all your money trying to make this happen you will not have enough money to buy the offices or Janitors and IT techs when you really need them. On top of this, you will not get an elevator upgrade for a very long time, this causes an unhappiness black hole and you will see employees quit left and right, causing more financial ruin. Janitors are the most laughable programming when they come to their job too. They will stop cleaning a desk to use the restroom, they then return to their home desk before returning to the desk they were cleaning.

- Only one elevator per elevator shaft, which is super lame. I read in a guide that you had to put down one elevator per building segment, which is unrealistic and utterly lame.

- It makes sense that computers break down, but they seem to do so way too much. This is unbalanced and frustrating.

- Workers quit way too often. Is call center turnover this bad in real life? Jesus.

- Seems like way too much grinding.

- You can't cancel contracts. Why is this bad? When you don't do enough of the tasks per day, you get penalized $100 per Inbound, Outbound, or Backoffice category.

You are a CEO of a Call Center and you are supposed to make it grow to a huge business and you think ""alright this might be easy"" and then you see the money you have to spend and you kinda lose all your money in just 1/2 days and you just want to restart the game.

So basicaly this game is to take you to the limit. This is not supposed to be easy, not even near it. You have to play it a lot and restart so many times to get the right strategy about how to make a good profit and grow your business.

I woud say that this is a really addictive game, because you keep on trying to make it right many times and you get addicted to the difficulty of that. I recommend you to buy it 'cause it's no expensive at all and if you like economic strategy game and you like it hard and challenging, I really really recommend this game.

If you buy ""Smooth Operators"" I hope you like it :3",1402702590,1402702590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It takes a few restarts to understand whats the optimal way to get the call center running in a profitable manner. Worth the price would be even better with certain more refinements to the mechanics of the game.

Ps:- Here is a simple way to catch thieves in your call center , as soon as you get a pop up from HR saying there is some money missing, slow down the game to pause mode by moving the speed counter to left fully . Now the game is paused so close the prompt and start looking at the thoughts of all employees present there, you will find the thief soon.
His thought should be something like this , this way you dont have to look at every record present.

Unfortuantely, the game isn't very enjoyable though. Too many buildings and staff are locked at the beginning of the game, and you kinda need them beforehand. Also it took me 9 in-game days just to be able to get HR staff, 9! You cant change schedules of your employees or anything until day 9, then you have to have the money to build the building, then hire the staff, etc. 

The game is a grind in a bad way, but perhaps that's intentional, perhaps it is meant to be a statement on how call centers are, and I guess mission accomplished if that was the goal. Still, I would have wanted something with more humor, satire, and freedom in the gameplay. Also the sound effects get REALLY annoying since they can stagger, I guess again it is probably intentional, but it makes for a better statement of the call center world than it does an enjoyable simulation game.",1402590342,1402590342,False,9,0,0.469589263200759888,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a call center simulator which has so many balls to juggle, that you'll no doubt need to restart a few times before you finally get the balance right. People answering the calls, computers exploding, walls cracking, contracts to fulfil... and while it's all a bit overwhelming and ridiculous at times, there's something about it that really makes me want to crack on and keep trying. Overcoming Smooth Operators is quite the achievement, and it's sort of refreshing to play a management game that wants to destroy you constantly, rather than hand you a victory on a platter.
