Loading a saved game is rather iffy.
Making a custom scenario is rather iffy.
You cannot make a command post target in a custom game.

Yes that it. Rejoice fans of tank battles of OGRE. And fans of hexagonal war-games. Well as for war-game OGRE is bit simple - no need to build or support troops, it's all about plain good ol' tactical war and strategy. 
There no strong emphasis on story or world lore - you just fight with enemies, There two factions but they difference only in color and icons, and sometimes in roles in battle scenarios. 
Positive things 
-Graphics and sounds are decent - anything you can have from virtual adaptation of table top game. Sounds are simple - explosions and shots, no line of dialouge of course, we on war not in some  rpg chat. Soundtrack is good - a war tunes and vibes that quite pleasant to ear. Also if you have friends - there a good emphasis on competive play on Hotseat or in network. Nice way to challenge friends.

Things is ""So-so"" not so bad but not so good.
-AI act...weird. I mean sometimes it act like true tactical genius, but sometimes it act awfully and absurdly. It can endlessly retreat forcing you to chase enemy all across map and spend hours to pin down remaining hoverboat. So AI is varie from Tactical Genius to Artifical Idiot. 


Things that really bad
-Bugs. They not abudant but they have place to be - unskippable turns, ""frozen"" units, and minor glitches in multiplayer. It can happen. Expect some nasties that can ruin your good war outcome
-Awful support of developer. I mean - there still some bugs that developers promise to fix but promises stay promises. 
There still problem in some OS with empty system-chat boxes (instead of words there ""Lorem ipsun"") and no one tried to fix it. It actually fixed if you change your system language to English but of course...it should be fixed by programmers


So in total - OGRE have good taste but bitter aftertaste. If you search for some good tactical-company joy with friends or wish to start your way in tabletops or hexagonal war games - OGRE is good choice. Also if you are old-timer - OGRE is definetley your choice. But bitter part - is lack of any support from developer. And that just nullify any good vibes when you found some bugs and report em.

The visual effects are also atrocious, and when the units move their badly made icons just slide around on the board accompanied by generic vehicle sounds, which gives the heavy tanks the appearance of shopping trolleys and makes GEVs, my favorite unit of the boardgame, look and sound like angry roombas.

The game also has an inbuilt map editor, which is good, and you can upload your maps to the workshop, which is great, however you can't play custom maps in multiplayer, which is awful.

I didn't get a lot of playtime in before the recent ""AI Update"" but I'll say that after that update, the AI is practically useless - it'll have the Ogre just drive around on the periphery of the action (or just stay stationary), occasionally shooting its missiles at you, but for the most part you can complete your mission objective completely unimpeded on the first try of a scenario.  Somehow the 80s version of the game had a (much) better computer opponent while running on home computers with 1/1000th the power of a modern PC.

I imagine if you were playing against another human using this as your go-between you'd have a lot more fun, but whoever wins might come down to the player than can wrestle the interface better rather than the one with the superior tactics.

Few other wargames can claim that distinction. over 250 thousand copies have been sold. So there is definitely a VERY loyal and enthusiastic fan base for this game. Does Auroch Digital recreate this famous board game faithfully?

tl;dr
YES!

A bit more in-depth:
The first iteration of OGRE as a computer game was made by ORIGIN Systems in 1986 for a variety of PCs of the time. It had severe limitations according to original reviewers. (Alas, I never got to try it. PCs of the time were obnoxiously expensive.) The OGRE faithful had to wait 30 years for another PC version of the game. Auroch Digital has made the new version and it is VERY faithful to the board game. I've been told that Auroch's CEO is a big OGRE fan himself, so it's not really a surprise that they ""get"" what OGRE is about.

The Game
OGRE is a turn-based tactical game of armored combat in the near future. Each armored unit is represented separately on the hex-based board. (Infantry squads are represented by an icon and can represent 1, 2 or 3 squads of infantry together in the hex.) There is no specific ""pecking order"" for the units in OGRE. A heavy tank is powerful, well defended and can ignore many terrain types that would slow down other units. But it's range is low enough that it must come within the return fire range of practically all other units. Missile tanks have decent firepower and very good range. But have a low defense strength and are slow (especially in built-up terrain.) Hovercraft (GEVs, as they are called) are fast, fast, fast. But their combat and defense strength is low, making them vulnerable to other units if they get caught within range. Howitzers are incredibly powerful with a long, long range. But they are immobile (or in the case of mobile howitzers, agonizingly slow.) There are more units available, but you get the idea. There is no one ""right"" unit for all occasions. The units are carefully balanced against each other so that no single one dominates. This is the mark of good game design in general. Of course, what the game is really about are the huge cybernetic tanks know as ""Ogres"". Ogres come in a variety of models ranging from the intimidating MK Is and IIs to the truly frightening MK Vs. Each ogre has a variety of weapon systems and are so huge (the MK V is 50 meters in length to give you some idea) that you cannot destroy them with a single volley. Instead you must destroy individual weapon mounts and drive systems until the Ogre finally grounds to a halt.

Game Functions
Turn based as follows:
Side ""A"" moves, side ""A"" fires, side ""A"" moves GEVs a 2nd time. Side ""B"" repeats these steps. There are more detailed steps within this order, but this the basic flow of the game.
Combat:
Units may combine fire against a target that is in range of all of them. Ogres can combine various weapon systems together to fire at targets in range. Each unit (or Ogre weapon) has an attack strength (usually ranging from 1 to 6) and a defense strength (usually ranging from 1 to 5.) Attacks are made by comparing the attack strength to the target's defense strength and then rolling a die. The result can be ""NE"" (no effect), ""D"" (target is disabled. Ogres are immune to this) or ""X"" (target is eliminated. An Ogre loses the targeted weapon or some of it's ""treads"", which represents it's propulsion system.)

Now there's more to it than just that. Units can be ""disabled"" by a near-miss, forcing them to miss the next turn (Ogres are immune to this result) and there ARE terrain effects on units during movement. But I don't want to overload this review with a complete rundown of the rules so...

The PC version
Auroch's UI for the game is pretty intuitive. Just go through the brief tutorial and you're ready for either online play against others or to try out the ""Nightfall"" campaign. I don't want to spoil the narrative behind the single-player campaign overmuch (it's really good and will catch new players by surprise.) The turn-based system of the board game is faithfully recreated here. OGRE board game players will be right at home in just a few minutes. New players should definitely go through the tutorial to get the all the available options (especially short-cut keys) down pat.

The Pros:
-Faithfully (I use that word a lot, don't I?) recreates the OGRE board game in all details.
-Simple UI lets you get into the game quickly.
-Both single player campaign and online gaming.
-Map generation tools and the ability to publish your maps for other players to try! (A big plus in my book.)

The Cons:
-Needs more single player content. Nightfall simply whetted my appetite. (However, player added content via the map generation tools off-sets this quite a bit.)
-AI in SP mode is still a bit underwhelming. It has definitely improved since the games original release, but I've found it a bit too easy to out-think the AI controlled units.

Score: I give this game a 9 out of 10.

The game wouldn´t load any maps at all. Several people complaining about the same issue on the discussion boards. A user (not the devs) found out that NOT having your OS language set to English(US) was the problem.

After that temporary fix (it hasn´t been fixed by the devs as I write this) I decided to play the tutorials to learn and then some basic skirmish scenarios. The first scenario, when playing the side with the troops against the Ogre, will break the game when you surround the Ogre and leave it no place to go (even though it can ram through your troops, which it does not). The game automatically gives the AI consecutive turns and you´re not allowed to play until the AI wins.

Gave the second basic scenario a chance, played the Ogre MKV vs the army with the MKIII. On turn 6, after dealing heavy damage to the smaller Ogre (and watching the rest of the AI troops do stupid moves) the game softlocked on an enemy turn, stuck ""thinking"".

These are not balance issues, or optimization problems. This is basically a broken game. If you want to buy this for the AI because you have noone to play with on the table, that´s exactly what this game is NOT good for.

I saw Tom Vasel's video about Ogre and it seemed like a great entry level game and after spending some hours I can safely say Ogre delivers everything I wanted.

Essentially this is an asymmetric battle pitting a small army against one ultra-powerful tank, though the combat rules are such that you can ignore the tank completely and just run two armies against each other. The combat rules are such that either way is fun and the game is very easy to understand while still requiring a good strategy. This is a great middle-ground between a board game type battle game and a more complicated PC style turn-based strategy and I think fans of both will enjoy Ogre. While the rules are simple, there is a fair bit of number crunching going on and I think the fact that this digital edition takes care of it for you that makes this more appealing than getting the real board game and while I was looking into it I think this version is the clear winner. 

The UI and presentation work fairly well, with some occasional quirks. The oddest thing about the game is they tell you you can use the Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out in the tutorial, but you actually have to go into the options to do that. Every now and then a stat window might get covered by an interface but you can just pan the camera a bit and it's generally fine. The game has a surprising amount of atmosphere in a similar fashion to how the Twilight Struggle PC game used sound and visuals to really convey a mood. There's a great feeling of 70's comic book sci-fi throughout, especially on the scorched red map and the units all look great.

As far as content goes, there's a ton of stuff here. As far as I can tell the game includes all of the scenarios from the board game and also a neat little campaign with a bit of a story. Normally flavor text mission descriptions don't do much for me, but the weird far-off sci-fi atmosphere combined with the mysterious nature of what's going on actually feels kind of cool and the campaign missions each feel fairly unique so far. Combine that with a scenario editor and Steam Workshop support and you've potentially got infinite content.

While the game does have a great in-game tutorial, it helped a lot to read the board game rulebook, which the game links you to and that has an even thinner 7 or so page quickstart guide that got me up and running. Reading it beforehand really helped me get the context of what I'm trying to do and how the combat works behind the scenes

While I'm not sure I'll rush out to buy the board game edition, Ogre's PC adaptation is a big success, giving you the fun of moving a bunch of dudes and tanks around a map and making them fight without getting bogged down in the subsystems and resource management of a bigger PC strategy game like Civilization. This seems like the kind of design that works much better as a PC game than a board game and I'm glad this edition was done so well.",1613168718,1613168826,True,1,0,0.509345769882202148,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really, REALLY, wanted to love this game.  I would have settled for liking the game, but I do not, and I am going to tell you why.

I have been playing Ogre, literally, since the 70s when it first came out on table top.  I bought it as a little package for like $5 and never looked back.  I bought the expansions, hooked my friends on it and played the miniatures variant.  (The minis are really quite nice....  more on that later.)  The games were fast, fun and captured the intended themes of remorseless AI death machines in a tactical nuclear war environment.  The PC port doesn't capture this vibe.

In a word, Ogre is, STALE:
*First and worst, are the graphics.  Steve Jackson and Auroch could have made the vehicles, esp the Ogre, beautiful, like the many minis the table top game showcases.  Indeed, the icons the game uses are LESS attractive and LESS informative than the old, cheap die cut counters (hand cut by 10 year old me in the 70s) from the original title's press.  
*The map graphics are as sterile as the units.
*The AI is not good. 
*The UI is cumbersome and not intuitive.  It does not reflect contemporary hex game stacking techniques.
*The scenarios were unimaginative and simple cut paste from the old rule books.  What little that was new was depressingly unoriginal.

I have not had the chance to play multiplayer, mostly because nobody else plays when I am on.  But, I doubt it would change my feelings on this title.

As I said before, they could have done so much better just by making the units 3D and artsy as the minis from the table top version.  They also could have had better animations and interactions.  At no time does a player feel like they are in a nuclear war zone against a cunning AI powered behemoth.  Rather, the experience is like playing an 1980's hex PC game, and not a particularly good one.

I really feel bad about this, because as an avid fan of the franchise and SJ games (I love Illuminati and Munchkin) I am really disappointed how the creators and developers went cheap on this title as it sours my fond memories and will make me take extra scrutiny before buying from either SJ or Auroch again.

Like several other reviewers, I was an owner of the pocket box version of this game. It introduced me to tabletop wargaming, and I was a huge fan. I used to draw my own Ogre maps on hex paper, and enjoyed creating custom scenarios almost as much as playing the game itself.

When I found this on Steam I was psyched to play digitally, and was most excited to be able to create new scenarios and share them with the community. The Designer is incomplete/broken on several layers, though. My main gripes are:

1: Created scenarios can’t be played with another person online, only via LAN. WTF, Steve Jackson Games? This defeats the entire concept of uploading scenarios online.

2: When building a Scenario, the only ‘Victory Condition’ is destroying 100% of your opponent’s forces. You can’t even buy a Command Post. There is no option to set ‘capture hex(s) X as an objective’, no way to assign ANY objectives whatsoever beyond a basic slog to eliminate every unit on the other side. The pre-made scenarios that come with the game have many, varied ways to win. The scenario builder has none. It really breaks what should be a major selling point for the game.

Also, I have yet to be able to start playing a custom scenario, save it mid-game, and reload it later. The game crashes EVERY time I try to. It also tends to hang when running a turn replay. I just tried playing a LAN custom game, and after spending all the time setting up, the first time a replay was attempted the game froze. Too buggy.

I’m a longtime fan of the entire SJG franchise, and I really wish the developers had stuck to this - the potential is there. But from what I’ve been able to read it appears to be abandonware at this point. Bummer.

But at the core, massive time wasted just watching units move.  With 20 or so units in a game the bulk of your turn will be spent watching the movement animation.  Sadly lazy by the devs.  Turn based games have had many, many ways to accelerate movement.  Also none of the options to turn off animations work.  Combat, movement, none of them.  Overrun combat happens one hex after another with no idea of where it's happening on the map.

For all of you who know and play OGRE the board game or the miniatures game, stop reading and buy it. You will not regret it. Because you can play OGRE even more often. With all the maps and scenarios and the skirmish AI waiting for you, why are you hesitating? And there is online play as well. Yes, they had to make some very minor changes to the rules, and sometimes the game get's a rule wrong, but nothing that has more impact than a bad die roll. And the developers are listening and constantly improving the game.

For those of you who have never had heard of OGRE, please be aware that you are not looking at a turn-based strategy computer game. You are looking at a digital implementation of a turn-based strategy board game. Its main purpose is not to impress you with fancy 3D renderings of the battlefield, but to truly recreate the look and feel of the board game (with some nice effects thrown in here and there). The original board game has been published in 1977 (that is more than 40 years ago!) and is still in print. It has evolved and expanded since then, but the core gameplay mechanics stayed the same. They are simple (for a war game) but somehow they manage to create very memorable battles. And for me personally, the most memorable battles are not those where equal forces have clashed, but those highly asymmetric battles where some infantry and tanks try to stop an OGRE, a war machine that dwarfs everything else on the battlefield by an order of magnitude. Think about the battle in Star Wars, where those tiny pesky ships attacked and destroyed the Death Star, and you get the idea.

One thing I very much appreciate is that there are a few mechanics in place to speed games up.  In the board game, if you target an Ogre's treads, you have to fire individually with each unit doing so.  In this PC game, you select your target first (like, the treads) then select every unit in range, and the game rolls for them all in sequence, faster than selecting each one individually.  You can also stack multiple units on the same hex and move them as a group, which speeds up the process of closing with the opponent.  

The single player campaign does a great job at teaching the player how to manage different units while still being challenging.  Not to the point of frustration, mind.  Anyone with an understanding of tactics should be able to clear them fairly quickly.  It's a good introduction to playing the scenarios.

My one complaint is that, at times, the AI doesn't know how to use the Ogres.  You can distract them by dangling fast units near them, and at times they seem to stop moving forward, possibly because they feel it's not worth the risk, but of course when they do that, they're a sitting duck.  Now the game is fairly new at this point and the devs seem open to suggestions by the community, and I know I'm not the only one to voice these concerns, so it's possible that it'll eventually get addressed.  From a strategic standpoint, it's probably easier to program armor units and infantry than it is to program an Ogre.  While (in the board game) Ogres are easier to learn, they ultimately have fewer resources than our Paneuropean soldiers, and I'm not sure an AI can manage that when compared to a human mind.  As opposed to, ""I'm a heavy tank, I drive forward and I shoot,"" you know?

As big of a paragraph as that is, it's a relatively minor complaint.  If you're looking for a PC version of Ogre 6th Edition, this is it.  If you don't like the AI, you can make yourself available for Vs. play and someone will accept and play against you.",1515713325,1515713325,True,3,0,0.554308116436004639,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It may be of some value to those like myself with no Ogre experience, despite it having an almost legendary rep in the gaming industry. My list of Steam games (unfortunately there are many others from Matrix and HPS) gives an idea where my head is at.

Despite some critcism, the graphics, UI and RNG are all just fine, and the first two items will likely be improved as well. But will this simplistic and anachronistic-looking game hold the interest of the average strategy/wargame player? Well, hardcore ""clickfest"" gamers might get bored. But I found the very first tiny AI skirmish - Ogre vs Ogre - holding my attention until I finally won via lucky dice rolls. While not the sharpest tool in the shed, the *current* AI will beat me to a pulp for a long time to come, even if the RNG favors me a bit.

Replayability and challenge are guaranteed by Workshop, with some veteran board game players undoubtedly crafting some very crafty scenarios. No Workshop, no buy. Simple as that.

But let's compare the decision-making involved playing a medium-size skirmish to other wargames. I will use Field of Glory 2 as an example, as it is a lovely piece of work that (imo) every strategy gamer should own, whether they know the history behind the battles or not. Anyway, the careful decisionmaking required to win at Ogre is significantly higher than FoG2; and FoG2 has variety in spades. Games like Panzer Corps, which can be really fun, are laughable compared with Ogre when requiring a meaningful effort to win. From a *tactical* perspective, moving chits around in War in the East (hard to learn, hard to master) comes pretty close to Ogre in terms of where to move and the method used to attack.

Ogre is one challenging (tactical) game. And for better or worse, with the RNG in place, you are never guaranteed to win anything. In my fumbling around, I've found I need to pay much more attention to ramming and aggressive play. For me, multiplayer may never well be a consideration, unless I match up with the Noob of noobs.

What you get for your $25 is a chance to make fun and meaningful decision almost every turn. Plus, I can create my own ""idiot"" map to give myself a chance at winning. Have fun!",1515486376,1515486376,True,22,2,0.677736937999725342,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As others have stated, the game is improving with updates (thanks Auroch Digital for keeping at it!), and while the AI is still in its early days, it is fine for practice and fun for newer players learning the game. 

I don't mind the basic UI, appreciate it for a hex-based game. 

My short wish list items include 1) the transparent info overlay on the bottom center keeps getting in the way of my clicks so I have to remember to shift the view around 2) would like a few more keyboard shortcuts (like escaping out of various selections, dialogs, etc.) 3) be able to set up PBEM -style (async play) without other player online  (? that could just be operator error), 4) Undo of accidental click/moves, and 5) greater than 1.9x speed up. 

None of these things are deal breakers, just things that would make play even better to me.

I'm starting to check out the community contributed scenarios, and just created by first (private) scenario to try that out. Will dig in to that more as it evolves (hopefully with more control over scenario parameters, victory conditions, etc.). This is promising to keep things fresh.

Overall, thumbs up and look forward to the game (and community) sticking around for a while.

The cost is a bit steep and the AI sometimes is a a bit flaky (see my guide on one of the major flaws). The UI is not the greatest, but it works well enough. The graphics are pedestrian.  There is a multiplayer option that I haven't investigated, and also custom scenarios via an active community Steam workshop.

However, if you really liked the board game (or at least like similar board games), then this is a great option. It really is an automated board game Ogre rather than some sort of RTS adaption. There is a hex grid with alternating turns, and even dice rolling. If you expect a different experience, you will be disappointed.

Contains scenarios and units from the original Ogre/GEV games (now on the 6th edition of the rules), does not include Shockwave. Experienced players will find the AI somewhat easy to beat.

Cons.
As of time of writing; 
The AI is juvenile. I've seen better play from a potato both in campaign, custom scenario and offical scenarios. Some missions I've seen them sit out of range of my howitzers despite the mission objective requiring them to move forward. Or in others not use weaponry after they move towards an exit point despite there being literally no reason not to, other than a very low chance of success. 
The Ogres are limited to Mk1-6, so no Fencers of similar.

As someone who has been playing the Ogre/GEV games since first edition in 1977, and crowdfunded the Ogre Designer's Edition set and Ogre Miniatures set 1,  buying this game was a no-brainer, and I am glad that I did.  It allows me to enjoy playing Ogre whenever and wherever I like, even when I can't find a person to play with.  I've always loved the game and I feel the same about this pc game.

Having said that I will say that although this game captures nearly everything that made the original Ogre game tons of fun to play, it still leaves a few things to be desired from a modern gamer perspective.  I am happy with the graphics but I think they could at least have been done more in the spirit of Ogre Miniatures rather than trying to precicely replicate the original board game but using miniatures.  Mainly I mean I think terrain, trees, cities, etc. would all look a whole lot better if done as 3d models rather than flat 2D images.  Also, to be honest the game sounds seem sort of like an afterthought to me... honestly they are not really varied and sound to me more like heavy construction equipment of today rather than futuristic nuclear powered vehicles with high tech weaponry.  Perhaps you could allow us to add our own sound effects please?  Also unit selection and movement controls just seem a bit more awkward and clunky to use than they need to be.  These things do not keep me from enjoying the game but honestly I was hoping for a little more polish from this title.

I'll probably always keep playing Ogre, but to Steve Jackson and the devs at Auroch I suggest considering some of the things I mentioned above in future updates and games.  Also I sincerely hope we can expect to see the other units and advanced rules included in the Ogre Designer's Edition 6th Edition...

Gameplay consists of a movement phase and an attack phase, where targets and attackers are chosen to alter the combat odds.

These are available in single player on the default branch, and also in multiplayer on the new beta, which you can access using the instructions [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/517780/discussions/0/3183345000083940050/]here[/url].

We've also made wholesale changes to the UI system in various updates since launch. If you'd like to check out a comprehensive list of all the new features, additions and fixes since launch, check out this thread [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/517780/discussions/1/2765630416826204812/]here[/url].

Let us know if you like the improvements, if you have any further feedback, or there's anything else we can do for you :)

Thanks a lot for taking the time to write a review, all feedback is massively appreciated, and we do apologies for the issues at launch.

Thanks,

Jake at Auroch Digital"

This online version as of October 15th is riddled with bugs. This is a beta! This should not have been released as is! When you save your game and load the Ogre side moves one to three times and often you lose all of your move and fire for the turn you saved one. It is often necesarry to save to get out of an overrun attack that you won but causes the game to stall. DO NOT BUY until the bugs are fixed.

All of the bugs mentioned in your feedback have since been fixed in updates and patches.

I love Ogre the core game. The elegant turn based mechanics make every decision meaningful and full of anticipation. The asynchronous play (dozens of conventional troops vs. a single massive super-tank) is refreshing and doubles up your distinct game experiences. I can extol the virtues of the core game (with its 40-years of refinement and pedigree) for thousands of words.

The digital version we got is a heavy tank stuck in a swamp. You can read my [url=https://oldgrizzledgamers.com/reviews/ogre-pc-review/]detailed review[/url] if you like, but it comes down to bugs (which the developers are squashing quickly) and an interface that leaches enjoyment from the game, click by click. By the end of the 10-mission campaign I was far past having fun despite really liking the clever scenarios and varied objectives they presented. 

The multiplayer might have saved it, despite the interface, the core game being just that good. But I only got to play a single match in many attempts at matchmaking. 10-minutes is my limit for staring at a clock and I hit that limit many times on various days. The one match I did have was a thrilling nail-biter. I was lucky to play against someone else familiar with the game. I wouldn't want to play as the solitary Ogre and watch a rookie try to move and fire with 40-units and this interface.

I emotionally want to just give a thumbs up. Great core game, potentially fun multiplayer, active developers rapidly fixing and patching. But thumbs up means you should spend CDN$28 and buy the game right now and I don't feel that's the case. This is a classic for good reason and should be experienced with a basic level of polish. Unless you have a physical friend to play hot-seat with, hold off, let the developers finish and check again in a few weeks.

A genre I haven’t written a lot about, is tabletop gaming. Board games are a subgenre and an even more specific one, would be that of a wargame. Ogre fits this definition like a glove and even if I wasn’t acquainted with Steve Jackson’s 1977 tabletop classic, I’m a fast learner and enjoyed both playing the game and finding as much information as I could about this particular title. I’m no stranger to digital versions of wargames, yet few can claim a legacy of four decades and still fly under the radar. Pun intended. There are no flying units in Ogre, but armored warfare is excellently simulated. The game couldn’t really fail since it’s been developed by veterans of the tabletop-to-video-games genre, Auroch Digital. They’ve been on Steam for several years already and you might be familiar with their Games Workshop-licensed, Chainsaw Warrior series. Ogre is Auroch’s 4th Steam project. 

[h1]Story [/h1]
The Ogre Rulebook has went through six iterations and upgrades over the years, with its most recent dating back to a successful Kickstarter funding from 2012. There are some minor changes from the board game, in this digital version but as far as I’ve read in those 24 pages of the rulebook, the gameplay itself has been streamlined just enough to speed things up. The game does offer all the links and reading materials you may desire, if you wish to accommodate to the limits and specific details relating to Ogre. What exactly are these ogres and what do they have to do with 21st century armored warfare? 

Well, consider the Ogres as the ultimate mix between a Transformer and Skynet’s hive mind. The last line of defense or offense, given the circumstances. Massive, mobile gun platforms which dwarf even the heaviest human-operated tanks. While the story itself doesn’t explain how the world became deadlocked in a constant war between two factions, their motivations are meaningless when compared to the threat posed by rogue Ogres. Unshackled Artificial Intelligence may not be a groundbreaking topic nowadays, but the original board game from 1977 precedes the Terminator series for certain. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was only scratching the surface and its iconic HAL 9000 could never be considered a killing machine in the vein of a T-800 android. 

Steve Jackson’s Ogres would simply crush Skynet’s self-replicating factories under their huge tracks. It’s unclear which game faction (North American Combine or Paneuropean Federation) designed the first Ogres, yet both sides use them against each other, until the imminent disaster which forces these superpowers to leave their world domination plans behind and focus on the cybernetic demons they unleashed and could no longer command. Ogre’s first singleplayer campaign is aptly named “Nightfall”. Similar to the Long Night which looms over Westeros, the Combine and the Federation will have to stand side by side or succumb to a foe that knows no pain, fear or logic other than its hardwired violence and newly acquired notions of self-determination. An ironic scenario with an outcome that has yet to take shape.

The board game was indeed a product of its time. Cold War was in full effect and folks were right to fear that it could “warm up” at any moment, if some machinery would malfunction. From the silos hosting nuclear missiles, to the primitive computers which despite being prone to errors, were used to calculate missile trajectories and provided an “early warning system”. World War III almost started on the 26th of September 1983, if it wasn’t for the composure of a Soviet Air Defense officer that didn’t mistook a false positive warning for an actual US nuclear attack launched against the USSR. Would an AI have taken any risks and not retaliate at once? Would it even take sides if it becomes self-aware all of a sudden?

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
I never saw any in-game signs for it, but moddb.com lists Ogre as being powered by the Unity Engine. Indeed, it was a smooth rendering which scaled perfectly to 4K resolution and never featured a single case of frame rate drop, so I’m inclined to believe them. The Unreal Engine would never be so generous with me. The unit animations are of decent quality but there’s definitely room for improvement. I’ve seen clips with the physical board game and Auroch Digital really did their best in creating  3D models and adapting them for a wargame that used paper and plastic for its units and structures.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Sadly, the sounds were disappointing. Not that I was expecting voice acting, but the OST itself seemed more like an endless loop of two or three short songs. While the sound effects for shooting or the screams of destroyed units were off-putting. This is an area in which the dev team needs to focus more in the future. Solid gameplay and pleasant visuals will never carry a title that it’s either as silent as the grave or using a small and annoying selection of audio assets.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Yes, the gameplay remains Ogre’s strongest point. A turn based tactical approach that showcases maps in hexagonal patterns and makes good use of the board game’s proprietary dice, instead of relying on a far too common “rock-paper-scissors” combat strategy. Ogres defy that classification based on strengths and weakensses since some campaign missions focus on entire armies trying to stop a single one of these mechanized monsters from leaving the map. In truth, even when battling between themselves, Ogres are very tough nuts to crack and some strategies revolve around disabling them by destroying their many tank treads instead of attacking their equally numerous gun ports and turrets.

There are several other fighting vehicles in the game and they range from lightly armored G.E.Vs (Ground Effect Vechicles) to tank types such as howitzers or heavier units with multiple turrets of their own. None of the human operated units can single-handedly take down or even disable an Ogre. Firepower differences aside, simulated weight and height are also causes for concern. Ramming instances between tanks, aren’t an issue in reality but in the Ogre’s game world, they can prove either a last-ditch effort for the humans, or no effort at all for the Artificial Intelligence operating the Ogres. It’s worth losing a few treads  just to smash some “tin cans” standing between you and your mission objective. 

The battles follow a conventional formula of troop deployment before the actual combat begins. Players must maneuver the units during the Movement Phase and logically, have them ready to attack the enemy during the subsequent Fire Phase. Automatic dice rolls decide the sheer effectiveness of each artillery shell or missile while also having an impact on the damage chance in the case of the designated targets. Sometimes, no damage is being registered despite beyond shot at from multiple sides. Luck does play a larger role than it might appear at first glance. You’ll notice that far more in skirmishes or multiplayer matches against equally capable human players.

Presentation is sparse, but functional.  Animations, sound, graphics, and the UI are.. serviceable.  However, where this game really shines is that this is a boardgame you play on a computer, not a computer game; they haven't sexed it up, turned into an RTS or a graphics show: those boardgame mechanics that seem very simple at first but underneath show that Steve Jackson and co have a mastery of understanding probability and game mechanics still shine bright.

This one's about the gameplay, and people wouldn't have been playing the same boardgame for [b]fourty years[/b] over a dozen editions if it wasn't good.  It's more than nostaliga; Battles have real tension:  You'll hold your breath during those key dice rolls, strategy matters, and the cat-and-mouse play whilst defending against an OGRE is as much a mental chess match/poker game as it ever was.  

Whilst this probably should have been an early-access release, it's still feature-complete enough to justify the price;  and the devs have plans and are releasing frequent patches / updates.  The learning curve is a short but steep if you've never played the boardgame, but tutorials and offline skirmish modes take care of that.

Heartily recommended for boardgame and strategy fans.

The futuristic detailed boardgame style graphics and cold industrial mechanical audio in a good way dont really convey any information. Its all done in a wealth of menu and stat boxes fed info which would bore anyone who likes to have all the nitty gritty represented in a graphical manner. It would have been nice to see something akin to the old Panzer General video boxes but with damage results being shown like when a OGRE tread is destroyed so one does not have to keep glancing over to the onscreen text boxes to see the outcome of a unit attack. Though i personally love the huge amount of battlefield information on display and the nifty graphics when an OGRE has taken damage as it is visually worn away as the battle progresses.
 
Still OGRE is a very enjoyable tense tactical wargame alive with pulse pounding terror capturing the doomsday ambience of the tabletop game perfectly. Being able to ram into enemy troops seeing them crushed utterly by the giant tank treads of an OGRE is an amazing sensation. Seeing an OGRE taking hit after hit from a mass of army units and be hardly phased like Godzilla stomping through Japan during a nuclear war as if taking a walk in the park on a sunny day is truly jaw dropping awe inspiring.  I love the hex drenched maps reminding me of games like Fasa's Battletech. Units seem balanced and realistic where even infantry have a chance to deal some damage and against an OGRE every bit counts. 

There is the option to make your own custom scenarios aswell for even greater personal immersion into the OGRE universe.

Music is very atmospheric full of bombastic science fiction menace capturing a 1970's and 80s mood like a alternative soundtrack to Ralph Bakshi's WIZARDS etc.

Storyline is interesting and captures the lore of OGRE perfectly making me feel like i stepped into a Keith Laumer BOLO novel.

Patch updates have been coming in fast and heavy on a daily basis fixing issues and improving gameplay. Fortunately i have not had any problems and been playing since day one.

Short TL:DR - A faithful translation of the original boardgame with lots of potential, but still rough around some edges. Overall, good enough to get your ""fix"" for classic Ogre, but G.E.V. is still a ways off and some minor bugs still need to be addressed.  I currently rate it a 4 out of 5 (previously rated at 3.5).


I'm going to try to itemize the good and bad as much as possible so you get an accurate view of what the game (v1.2.2.0) looks like.  I was part of the beta test and there are a lot of things that have been improved since the beta, but there's still more work to do. 

The good:

** UPDATE ** Bugfixes - Many bug fixes have been applied over the last week and the game is much more stable than it was at release time. The majority of the core issues/rules errors have been fixed and most of what's left to address are UI improvements or smaller edge-case rules.  Gameplay has cleaned up considerably; with many UI tweaks that have been very helpful.  You can review the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/517780/discussions/0/1489987634000650466/]changelog[/url] for details.
 
Classic Ogre - The rules for classic Ogre games (referred to in-game as the ""basic"" rules) are solid.  If all you ever play is stuff on the orange map (the Original boradgame), you will have a very satisfying experience.  The game plays as expected. 

The graphics - The modeling of the units is excellent.  They represent a great translation of the Miniatures and look awesome. The maps + units are a very good interpretation of what  it feels like to play the tabletop game with miniatures.  There isn't a ton of extra eye-candy, there's just enough to get the point across in a reasonably fun way.

The scenarios - Currently the ""Classic"" Ogre scenarios and the Nightfall campaign.  Both are well done.  The classic boardgame scenarios feel just like you are playing with the 6th Edition set, and the campaign scenarios have some really neat ideas that are implemented very well.  The behavior in the ""With friends like these..."" scenario I found particularly interesting and unique and a great example of the potential of future scenarios.  I've been playing the boardgame for almost 40 years, and nothing surprises me; that scenario surprised me (in a good way).  **UPDATE** The campaign scenarios continue to impress.  I'm up to #9 out of 10 and every scenario has had some unique element that has been a joy to play.  They all make you think and the wrinkles that have been thrown in keep you engaged.

The Scenario Editor - Being able to make your own custom scenarios is a great idea (and honestly necessary for long-term survival).  Making your own scenario is fairly straightforward and the interface is pretty easy to work with.

The Ui - Contains all the information you need to be able to play effectively.  Unit selection and movement works reasonably well overall, and has been greatly improved over the beta so it's obvious they take feedback and are capable of incorporating suggestions.

Multiplayer - setting up custom games between friends works well

The Bad:

Advanced Ogre - A lot is still missing.  If you are expecting G.E.V. or Shockwave, this is not there yet.  Visually, it ""looks like"" G.E.V., but it really has only a handful of ""advanced rules"" that make it G.E.V.  You can stack units, and you have terrain effects and overrun, but that's about it.  Terrain damage is either nonexistent or not working right.  None of the Official G.E.V. scenarios exist yet (Raid, Breakthrough, etc).  The only place you see the advanced stuff is in the campaign, and while the campaign concepts are really cool, the gameplay implementation for advanced rules still need a lot of work.  

The UI - While it does give you all the info you need to play, you have to be an advanced player to understand some of it.  There needs to be more tutorials on the UI and what everything means so new players know what's going on. How the UI works is still clunky in some places and involve more clicking around than necessary and flyouts/tooltips end up in weird places causing you to scroll around to see them.  Definitely needs some refinements.  ** UPDATE ** They have added a lot to make the interface more intuitive, and have started creating some tutorial videos that should be helpful to new players.  A lot of the major quirky UI issues have been resolved, but more refinement is still needed.  One of the biggest is movement of stacked units; that's on the short list of things to address, but it still hasn't made it to the game yet.  

The AI - If you are an experienced player, you will likely find a lot of the AI implementation very weak.  Especially in the Classic Ogre scenarios, the AI plays very one-dimensionally.  It seems marginally better in the campaign, but is still not nearly as challenging as it could be.  ** UPDATE ** The AI is still a weak link for advanced players.  I've seen a number of glaring examples of really bone-headed choices that even a novice player would not have made.  Still needs a lot of work to be as brutal as it should be, but without a way to dial the AI strength up or down, I'm not sure what would be preferable.


The Ugly:

** UPDATE ** Bugs - Most major bugs have been squashed, but there are still a lot of edge-case issues with smaller things that need to be addressed.  Overall, the state of the bugs has moved out of the Ugly category.

Multiplayer - While it works (sometimes), it has a lot of issues connecting players. Also, you have no control over what you get dumped into; it makes a random selection.  It really needs a way to filter the type of game you are looking for and give the ability to choose sides.  It's also really poor at in-game communication if the person you are playing is not already  one of your friends.",1507485626,1507928886,True,43,1,0.809007227420806885,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
- I like the unit models a lot, the little animations are cool.
- The maps are great, so faithful to the original paper maps, with cool little relief effects for things like craters and rubble barriers.
- The campaign has a good premise to the story arc, and 4 missions in it's pretty fun.

The Okay:
- I like the combat animations and sound effects, but I think it could look more realistic when zoomed in (i.e gunfire comes out of barrel, aims in direction of target)
- The combat log window is fine, but needs more options (transparency, etc).  Floating damage/combat results would be even better - it's hard to keep track of tread damage
- The sticky panels for a selected hex and the units in it are nice, but I wonder why there are no UI layout options.  Static panels that can bemoved around for Ogre or unit status, hex information (terrain, defensive/movement effects), etc, ought to be available

The Needs Work
- The stacking UI and visual representation is clunky.  It seems there might be a another way to show the unit mix in the hex more visually than having to hover over the hex.
- Stacking and combat with stacked units works great, but the flyout menu UI always seems to be in the wrong place - part of the overall UI layout issue

It’s also GEV. You get advanced terrain and overrun rules, if you want them. Ogres are murder machines with ram rules; they’re still murder machines with overrun rules. You never, ever want to overrun infantry entrenched in town hexes (double INF firepower and defense) unless it’s an Ogre doing the overrunning (double Ogre attack strength). GEVs in swamps are a Bad Idea.

Only the good parts of SHOCKWAVE, which means no friggin’ laser towers or cruise missiles. Which is is good. You get strongpoints.

You get all of the rest of the units you'd expect and none of the stupid ones; e.g. Vulcan.

Presentation is barebones as hell; functional enough, but I’m looking forward to being able to mod in painted units.
You get to make your own scenarios and maps. The official scenarios are included.

Not too sure about defender AI; I played through a MkIII scenario yesterday and just facerolled the defense.  Then again, the poor defenders did get some crap tread attack rolls. (Note: tread attack rolls WILL take years off your life as the defender).  I haven't played against an Ogre (which actually had a decent AI back in the Origin Ogre days) or a non-Ogre mixed unit fight.  Multiplayer is, of course, available.  Which means you don't get to throw dice at your opponent when your sixteenth tread attack a row misses.

So, if you want OGRE/GEV on the PC, well, you’ve got it!  Every old Pocket Box grognard needs to pick this up now.  You millennial social media kids: well, honestly, I don't know.  There's grogs in every generation, though, so you kids might want to pick it up anyway to learn the ancient street knowledge of CRTs (Combat Result Tables) and IGO-UGO.",1507326299,1507326299,True,18,0,0.649731755256652832,2,True,False,False,False,,,

There are no GEV scenarios included (update 12/04 - there are some now) but there is an editor and there will probably be some popping up on Steam Workshop soon.  All of the scenarios from the original OGRE game are in.  There is also a campaign mode ""Nightfall"" which I haven't yet tried.  There is a tutorial, it seemed solid but as I am not new to the game I can't say for sure.  It did teach the interface well enough!

Ogre needs some UI polish and AI improvements (especially when playing the defense).  For example, it shouldn't set up in a way that lets me launch 6 missiles at its GEVs on turn 1.  The AI did play its endgame perfectly (1 missile tank vs my 2 move weaponless OGRE, stayed out of ramming range while shooting every turn, I even tried pinning it against the map edge but it avoided that).  The interface is a bit click-heavy, if more keyboard shortcuts are added that would be fine.  Additionally, popups can obscure other information.

So far the dev seems responsive so I expect the interface and bugs to improve, but it's only been a day.  I would recommend the game to OGRE fans but not necessarily everybody at this point.

Update: Some GEV scenarios are added, the AI remains pretty laughable particularly when it comes to moving GEVs or being aggressive under a timer such as Breakthrough (and I am not an expert! - I am playing these scenarios for the first time here).
