There are many things I would want to say about this game but I will keep it short for the purposes of this Review. 

Developer Robert Potter was kind enough to offer me an Early Access Key to this game and I jumped right in with excitement. 

Brief points of interest:
Pros:
Visuals
Gun Sounds and Overall Music
Game Mechanics
Level Design

Cons:
Lacking Content at this stage
Play Space Issues (Fixed with Recent Update)


As soon as you are dropped into the game, you notice how pleasing it is to look at and the menu music which creates this vibe for you and gets you ready for action, that’s a good thing. Following that, you are able to choose between a couple of different single player games such as a simple wave shooter, defense based game type and some more. The game does a great job of introducing you to the mechanics but during my original play through, I had to shift my play space in order to be able to reach the required object to further continue the tutorial (This has been fixed with the recent update).
One thing I absolutely love is the gameplay mechanics where this truly makes you feel like you are holding a paintball gun due to the way you put on the Mask and load up (Open the Hopper, pick up the tubes and actually load them in.) I would love to see a belt system as others have mentioned such as in H3VR so that it makes organizing your stuff easier.

Being in early access, I can agree with some other reviewers that it is lacking content, but to me, where it is lacking in content it puts up with immersion and gameplay because for the price it is at now, it is a great game to pick up, and play some arcade style paintball that is visually pleasing to look at.

If you have ever played paintball, or you might have not, I urge you to give this game a chance because the developer looks promising and is delivering updates to improve the overall experience. Now that the play space issue has been fixed, I can only hope for more great things to come. 
I recommend a buy if you are interested at all in arcade style shooters especially in the Paintball Genre to kill some time and have fun.

I hadn't heard of the game before the developer took to the Vive subreddit to give away a few keys, and even though I didn't win one, I bought the game in the end anyway considering how reasonably-priced VR games are so few and far between currently.

I've tried a few game modes so far. I've heard good things about the story mode, but I haven't been able to check it out just yet. I can say that the wave-based shooter, while simple, was pretty fun and frenetic to play. Target practice is cool as well.

As others have said, some of the mechanics are a bit reminiscent of h3vr - you load your paintball guns and prepare yourself before starting certain levels and modes. Obviously this could be good or bad depending on how into that sort of thing you are, and I wouldn't be surprised if the dev added a way to skip that preparation stage at some point - that said, I quite enjoy loading my paintball guns and filling my inventory with paint grenades before a run.

Considering what I've paid for similar VR experiences, I'm going to be quick to recommend this  based on what the future may hold for it alongside the very reasonable price. I look forward to seeing where it goes.

Edit: What I said before still applies, but I'm going to have to, at least temporarily, reverse my recommendation. It's been months since there were any updates, and the premise of a lot of what I said was based on the fact that future changes were promised and I gave the dev the benefit of the doubt to continue development and fix issues.

It still *is* fun, but it's simply not finished - and considering the lull in updates, I'm not sure if it will ever be finished. If you can get it for a buck or something, I can't say it's not fun for at least a little while, but I wouldn't make a decision on the possibility of future development.",1470866943,1488669376,False,0,0,0.505905866622924805,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Cons: 
Not alot of content 
Takes 5 minutes to load your guns before each game type, which must be repeated if you die. 
 
 
The game could really use a limit to how many paintballs the hopper can carry, and let the refill tubes refill it MUCH faster.  
Also a belt inventory would be nice for refill tubes. Right now having to use 10 refill tubes to load my marker before a match and my teleport marker is a massive pain. especially in early access, i've had bugs that delete my marker and then i am forced to reload all over again.",1470833559,1470833602,False,7,2,0.558283209800720215,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Text is being fixed, tutorial space is fixed, user errors are being compensated.

**Original Text**

Pros: This game is worth its main price just for the singleplayer story mode/intro. It's clever and establishes that the developer is putting in effort for this project. It has a few gamemodes to mess around in, which is more than I can say for quite a few VR games out right now. Although I only have half an hour of playtime, I can see myself spending multiple hours down the line, especially if multiplayer catches on.

Cons: The game should have a boundary indicator to say how much space you need to play it. I have 2.1x2.1 meters, and I was BARELY BARELY BARELY able to reach some items in the tutorial mode (and some items I couldn't pick up at all!). Everything should be reachable within a 2x2 meter playspace. The graphics look nice from what I can tell, but there are too many jaggies and they are very very obvious on the wave-based gamemode. 

Notes: The text in story-mode needs to be centered and shrunken more. It's a bit too high up to the point that trying to read it is difficult unless you push your Vive RIGHT against your face, it will be blurry and annoying to read (it's not illegible, but it could be better).
<<SPOILER>> [spoiler]in story mode, when I got to shooting the robot, I went against the game, and decided not to shoot it. I wasted all the ammo on myself as an avant-garde choice, but ended up being stuck in the room after wasting all the ammo. I need to have a method to gain more ammo if I stupidly waste it on myself.[/spoiler]

Conclusion: Buy it. Try it. I'm tired of seeing so many samey-shooting-galleries, but this one does it alright.",1470798554,1471138866,True,3,0,0.51006782054901123,3,True,False,True,False,,,
