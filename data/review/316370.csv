Я би назвав навіть поганою ту РПГ, де речей небагато і немає проблеми вибору, бо це може вказувати на бідність контенту. Але в цій грі все зовсім навпаки. Такої кількості сміття я ще ніде не зустрічав. Наприклад, з мертвої почвари можна взяти м’ясо та кістки. Але це унікальні види м’яса та кісток, які бозна для чого! І вони займають місце. Гаразд, облишимо монстрів, знайшли руду? А її теж купа видів і користі від неї 0, поки не зробити злиток, а злиток можна зробити лише за рецептом, який теж займає місце (як і кожну іншу річ, яка навіть може бути не готовою зброєю, а напівфабрикатом для подальшого крафту). Знайшли «подрібнений» сапфір чи топаз, чи перлини, чи якийсь дорогоцінний камінь? Від нього теж жодної користі, а їхні купки навіть поєднувати не можна. Вершиною менеджменту інвентарю у цій грі є баг (чи це навмисно?), коли однакові на вигляд, з однаковою назвою, предмети не поєднуються у купки, хоча гра каже, що такі речі мають поєднуватися. У результаті за 4 години гри від забитого інвентарю всіляким сміттям жодної найменшої вигоди це не дало.

Хоча проблема з надмірною кількістю у розробника простежується усюди. Мапа засіяна позначками, а позначки квестів, після їхнього виконання, не зникають. Добре, що хоч фільтри мапи є. Монстрів і ворогів різних на вигляд теж сила-силенна, а ось анімації дерев’яні і їх мало. Ледь не забув, у грі ще повно різних… ключів. Я знайшов іржавий, срібний, золотий, кришталевий, кістяний, смарагдовий і ще десь 7 ключів, назви яких я вже забув, проте не знайшов жодної скрині чи дверей для них. Ще є руни, які також виконують функцію ключів і їх різновидів десятки. А закляття? Вивчене закляття займає місце у сумці з предметами! Якщо його «викинути», то й знання закляття зникне.

Всього в цій грі багацько, та локалізації і оптимізації нема. Гра майже нічого не пояснює і без української локалізації тут й англомовна людина не розбереться. Щодо оптимізації, то тут можна і в текстурах застрягнути, і баг з інвентарем отримати, і продуктивність впасти.

З позитивного боку можу зазначити, що деталізація світу присутня (ще б пак, всього тьма-тьмуща) і якщо вимкнути музику та озвучення (які теж забаговані) і залишити озвучені діалоги, то можна у спокої прогулятися місцевим відкритим світом. Але надовго цього не вистачить.

Висновок: могло все бути набагато краще, стільки потенціалу й ідей розробник перетворив у сміття.",1604674319,1604674498,False,1,0,0.483108341693878174,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Brought this game back during 2017 on a big discount. And started to try this game now in 2018.
This game has buggy skill and quest.

Skill - ( When stun monster with a skill and killed, it will just freeze there for about 10secs before the body drop dead on the floor to pick up loots. )

Quest - ( The map will show numerous ""!"" meaning there are quest to take, but quite a lot of them can't be taken and even when quest are done completed, it still will have ""!"" mark shown on map. )

And you can't possible make food/potion(HP regen) yourself because the materials are rare or the shops just randomly sells stuff.
Example you could loot meat drop from monster but you would need coal or spiced powder which i still don't see shop selling it. So you had to purchase food from shop insead. Making the drops lost its purpose to be honest.

[b] Introduction [/b]
Wave of Darkness is an isometric action RPG title set in a common phantasy world with elves, undead and magic.

[b] Gameplay & Story: 2/10 [/b]
Absolutely unique story: Waves of monsters suddenly envade the land and people are in desperate search of a hero. You never had such story before yet, right? The gameplay lasted about an hour until I decided to uninstall. You run around almost aimlessly since the quests only provide you local tasks and no big picture. Once you are done with the quest it just disappears from the log and you dont even know who to talk to to finish the quest. The ingame systems are clunky and require a lot of time and patience just to get used to.

[b] Combat & Challenge : 2/10 [/b]
The combat I had for the first hour of the game consisted of holding the right mouse button down when you want to hit an enemy. Thats it. I would like to write more but there simply isnt.

[b] Graphic & Interface : 3/10 [/b]
The graphic is insanely bad for a 2015 title. Some games from 90s look better and more detailed than Wave of Darkness. The interface is clunky, loaded with tons of icons and the inventory management is one of the worst in an RPG game. Howering over a mouse makes your screen get covered in information about that item, however you dont find the needed or important information quick enough.

[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]
The progress I made in the first hour so far was to run around finishing the few quests I receive talking to random NPCs standing around and killing some monsters. I was tasked with warning the king and what not but did not really feel inclined to do so. The bad optimization and crashes did not really speed up my progress.

[b] Audio & Immersion : 5/10 [/b]
The audio was so far the only positive thing about the game. The smoothing music in the background made me last longer with this game while the battle sounds were not too disturbing or clunky as the rest of the game.

[b] Side-Notes [/b]
[list]
[*]This game is single player only.
[*]This game is reported to last for around 20-30 hours story and quest gameplay time.
[*]This game contains steam achievements.
[*]This game offers bad optimization, possible crashes and performance issues.
[/list]

[b] Summary [/b]
There are not many games that I could not stick through, especially being RPGs or action games. Sadly, Wave of Darkness is one of them, so after playing a bit more than an hour it felt like an absolute waste of time to even try continueing in this game. I cant recommend Wave of Darkness to anyone, even hardcore RPG and oldschool action game fans should avoice it.

・クエストのターゲットマーカーが無い為どこに行けばいいか分からない。英語が解らないと何をしたらいいのかも分からない。

・半オープンワールドゆえに序盤から何処へでも行けてしまうが、敵のレベルが固定である為に「一体倒しては死にリスポーン」を繰り返しという状況に陥りやすい。聞くとダークソウルの様にハードコアな感じを想像する人もいるかも知れないが、あちらはアクションに重きを置きその駆け引きが楽しいと思えるのだが、こちらは敵をクリックするだけの戦闘なので単調で作業的でつまらない。大体が味方を召還する巻物を使って戦わせているところを敵の後ろからチクチクする形に落ち着く。

・一体から貰える経験値が少なく、レベルを上げるには相当数の敵を倒さなくてはいけない。レベルが上がるとスキルポイントとステータスポイントが得られそれを割り振ることで自分を強化できるのだが、スキルポイントはまだいいがステータスポイントが１しか貰えないので成長が感じられない。ストアページに「70時間のゲームプレイ」と書いてあるが大方こういった理由なのだと思う。自分はここまで６時間ほどプレイしたが100近くある実績がまだ一つも解除されていない。

・様々なアイテムを拾うがほとんどが役に立たない。バックパックが必要か不要かも分からない素材でパンパンになってしまう。

I backed it up to the highest Digital Tier. I didn't have much money and felt skipping a meal or two would be worth it.

I waited patiently for it's release and then some to give the devs a chance to work out some bugs. I'm not big on early access and am happy to wait for something decent. I jumped in recently and after giving it a decent amount of in-game time(10+ hours) I can say I am thoroughly disappointed.

I was expecting something more from the previews and the amazing kickstarter video presented by what I thought was a solid and cool team of devs. They even had a cat people... A CAT!!!

Sadly it seems like just a cheap overlay of the Legends of Dawn game. I have both the original and remaster but neither delivered and sadly neither does this game. I am unsure what new tech innovations they dev team has added but I can find none. The interface is almost exactly the same and boy does that have a big let down... there are about 13 floating icons... talk about destroying any immersion. There is an icon for Inventory, Character sheet, map, options, which is fair but then there are about a half dozen more each with a HUGE explanation of what they do... Yes I get it.. it's the inventory... I store items there... no please don't have another huge paragraph for each one.

So onto the other fun stuff.... The loading times.

Loading times are abysmal!!! I had time to go make myself a sandwich and wax the car. I have a very decent PC build and can run anything new with high specs... the optimization of this game is horrid. But hey if the wait was worth it then I wouldn't mind... oh wait... it wasn't... le sigh

The tutorial island is a great idea but does not deliver in giving a meaningful tutorial, it instead just lets you wander giving you a few tips. You may as well just have throw the player into the deep end... but it seems to want to baby you at first but then in the way a parent would leave a child in the crib and go off to have a smoke... yeah.

I was expecting an amazing story drive based game. Instead this is a single player MMO.
I was so frustrated by all I've mentioned and more than I couldn't care less about the story which sounds like it could have been an amazing one set in the backdrop of a war being waged.

I hope the devs see this feedback as constructive and that their next project is far more refined. If they ever need more beta testers or QA please let me know. I would have been willing to throw more of my hard earned money at the KS if it meant a better product.

Please avoid this game until a substantial update happens, if ever. I have a free copy that I won't give away because I honestly don't want to waste my friend's time.

Devs please feel free to contact me and I'd be happy to alpha test, QA and many other things for free including project management then if the game sucks you can just blame me ;)",1496042199,1496042199,False,36,5,0.758216798305511475,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I rather enjoyed my time with the game, but ultimately stopped playing because of the glitches.  There's a good game trapped in here.  If it was finished properly it could even be a great game.  As is, it's interesting with hints of greatness mixed in a bag of random pain.  

Unlike what others have said, this honestly has very little in common with Diablo, Gothic, or other RPGs.  It's definitely a retro, no-hand-holding RPG, but it quite simply doesn't have the depth the other big names do.

Yes, there are significant issues.  The game plays like an unfinished beta: 
- certain mobs glitch
- the tutorial is unclear
- the camera is godawful and needs constant handholding
- locks are totally unused (after the tutorial), but you still find keys and runes everywhere
- the combat system is rudimentary (no skills, just stats and spells)
- performance is pretty bad
- achievements are a mess
- itemization is bland
- terrain can sometimes hang you up and you have not option but to reload
- the UI could really use some work.
- my character would get stuck running and only a full restart would fix it (this ultimately caused me to quit playing because it was way too annoying and frequent)

If you can ignore all that, the base game is completely playable and relatively fun.  
+ The world is very large and there's lots to explore, with secret stashes hidden about liberally.  
+ The spell system is unique.
+ Monster visual design is excellent.
+ The quests and world are interesting, if a bit barebones.  
+ The voice acting is surprisingly good for such a low-budget game.
+ Music is quite good.

Unfortunately, it seems the dev team is no longer working on the project, and they have a shady past of 'updating' their games, so it seems this game will remain in the current unfinished state.  As such, I can only recommend this if you're able to look past the large number of negatives and see the good parts forged by an indie developer with some unique vision.  There's fun to be had, but, honestly, you're probably better off with other big name games.  5/10 ... without the bugs, would be 7/10.",1491836308,1491836308,True,8,0,0.613605320453643799,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There is lots of loot, enemies, and exploration.  You can craft your own spells with the runes you find. There is also a simple harvest and crafting system where you have to find recipes and ingredients.

At first, the controls were a little tricky, but after I remapped the keys and sped up the mouse, it became much more manageable. The game gives virtually no guidance after the short tutorial, leaving exploration and discovery entirely to you. This can be very fun, but at the same time can often leave the players with a feeling of confusion about what they're even doing in this world.

I love the openness of the game. You can go virtually anywhere so long as you find a way there and are able to survive. After discovering spells, I was leaving town when I saw a broken bridge and some interesting enemies across the river. You will begin to drown in deep water, so I found the narrowest part of the river I could and ran through the river. I emerged on the other side almost dead from drowning when I was attacked by a skeleton. I quickly blasted it with a fire spell, and it went down. I allowed myself to rest before slowly heading forth. The creatures here were 15+ levels above me, so I had to be sure to destroy them with spells before they reached me. Eventually, I came to some sort of shrine where I found a powerful ring which I sold for 1000 gold (at this point, selling an item for 1 gold was a big deal). 

Not every location is loaded with treasure, which is nice. I found a frozen grove with wolves and some sort of ice creature. I searched the entire area, and I don’t believe I found any loot. So while most of the time loot seems a little too easy to come by, this is not always the case.

Combat is fairly simplistic. Target the creature and get close enough to swing your weapon. Spells are very powerful; I found myself fighting monsters 20+ levels above me using spells; creatures just a couple levels above me were giving me trouble with melee. It is fun to craft your own spells, though you may quickly find your packs getting overloaded with runes! These spells gain levels with use, and the only limit to how many you can create is the number of runes you possess and how much backpack space is remaining (each spell takes a backpack slot).

While loot is plentiful, after 9 hours of playing, I have only found one or two items that are better than what I started with. This is not necessarily bad; I like the idea that more powerful items are rare. After all, how many fantasy books have you read where the protagonist changes his weapon every other battle?

The crafting system is somewhat frustrating. There appear to be hundreds of recipes, but so far I have only found the ingredients to make a few of them, and most of the time the item is useless to me. I had to start selling a lot of the recipes and crafting components as my packs are getting full, even with over 400 slots! However, I was able to craft a weapon that is better than what I was using.

Speaking of packs, you can eventually get a lot of backpack space. There are 15 pack “types”, each of which can be upgraded to 70 slots (for a total of 1050 slots).

There are some odd visual bugs. Sometimes, after killing an enemy with a spell, the enemy remains standing in place as though I were casting a taxidermy spell. Even when the bodies fall, if they were in the middle of an action when the spell hit, they would fall a few moments later. Skeletons all seem to be female since they let out a feminine scream when they die. It would be nice to be able to jump or climb since I have gotten stuck on ledges and had to reload. However, I have yet to find anything that would break the game or ruin my enjoyment of it.

Overall I would say the game is fun if redundant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes hack ‘n slash action with strong character development.

The container system is pritty crap pritty mutch anything can be a container...and some containers are not containers...like theres some kind of weapon racks that normaly are not containers but in some places they are..and the same with alot of objects and only way to find out is hoovering over evry singel object...

Then the number of items you get..you get something like60-70 items in the tutorial and evry enemy drops 3-6 items

you have to waste all your cash on bags and sell most items you come across and hope they aint important...there is no storage system

this dosent get better with evry spell takes a inventory slot....YES SPELLS and theres crapton of recipes for all kind of junk (all recipes i found this far is worse then your starting gear....)

spells seems to make alot of gear pointless...cast a spell that give +270 atk and +270 def makes your +17def shield pritty pointless..and you can lev up those spells

and damage spells the lowest is smth like 136....while melee hits are between 40-80 or smth..

the other problem is the only way you seem to be able to replenish hp/mp is using consumables (witch u rather sell to buy more bags) or rest at a campfire (meening alot of backtracking if theres even a campfire nearby)

the fighting system is simply u run up to a enemy holding left mouse button until it is dead...thats it you can increase your damage by skill points (simply increase your damage) and ability points (put in str to increase melee damage)

the voice acting is ok and the story seems intresting but it seems to me that the majority of the game is fighting and its not well made....i will try once more but hardly think i will change my mind

also the lock/lockpicking system is bad....you need runes to unlock stuff and there is LOADS of diffrent kind of runes and evry rune need 1 inventory slot and you cant store extra runes so you need to keep them all (minimal inventory) or sell alot and hope u got enuff off the right ones when you get to a lock (sometimes requer more then 1 of same rune)",1485355275,1485355275,False,8,1,0.424047946929931641,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First off, yea, there is a couple of bugs, but there not game breaking. One is when you 1st load up the game, the game is unresponsive, but that is easy to fix, you close it, close it in the task manager, and start it up again. This fixes it. The other bug i found is some enemies teleport around. I actually thought it was a monster skill at 1st, but i guess it is a minor glitch. As far as im concerned, neither of these bugs break the game much. I am having fun with it. I just did enough quests to own my own house in the game..shame i only had enough money to buy rugs and tables.

AS far as the game, yea, it does not hold your hand. First off, the quests do not mark where you go. You must explore where to go to the next quest. Older rpg's were like this. In a way, this does not really bother me, as you explore alot of the world for looking for your quest goals.

The other thing people complain about is the lack of inventory space. This is not a Final Fantasy game where you can carry 99 of every item in your backpack. I feel this game is more realistic in the respect you can carry only limited supplies. Even diablo 1 and 2 was like this, get used to it or play an easier game. Yes, this game is hard. It does not babysit your character. In that respect, i actually find that quite fun and refreshing not to being handheld on what to do in the game. Sure, if i wanted to play an easy game, i might like that, but i find this way also fun.  I recommend it if you can bypass the small bugs, and ignore the item limits you can hold. Don't let those turn you off the game. It has some strategy and fun aspects. 

i got this free from a friend. So thank you friend. I am enjoying this game.

UPDATED: Even after playing this game awhile, yes, i see more bugs, but nothing that i consider game breaking or that bad. The game is basically still fun to play and a ARPG basically. What bugs i found are some doors act weird when you open and close them on houses, some npc's get stuck on clipping issues, and other small things that are not that bad..

Just a suggestion, but i suggest buying it only on sale. Due to bugs it is not worth full price, but it is still a decent game for what it is.",1479109810,1480019760,True,37,3,0.724198997020721436,7,False,True,False,False,,,

This game is a fine example of what happens when a developer has a huge ambition to create a game but disregard the design and needs from the players point of view; complete disaster.

The game started on a tutorial island and already you can see there are actually plenty of features and contents. The rune mechanic is also fresh as unlocking chests require some kind of puzzle. The weapon system goes so deep there are binded cursed weapons already in the tutorial.

However, this game lacks in presenting these features to the players and interaction between players and the game is kept at minimal. Example, I spent minutes looking for the captain as presented in the hint box but he was just right beside me where I started because hovering my mouse over NPCs does not glow nor have any hint that they can be interact with. The example is just a small insight of how vague the game can be.

If you are a hardcore patient gamer who are really into RPG perhaps this would be nice. I don't know how the story goes but dialogue are voiced over so that is pretty awesome.

Every other things such as graphics, character creation and customization, inventory, minimap, camera controls and etc are mediocre. Nothing to shout about but its there, plain and simple and ready to be utilized.",1477032420,1477032420,False,10,0,0.616246938705444336,0,False,False,False,False,,,

While it looks fine, that's where the positives end. Theres a ton of confusing different parts about runes, as well as tons of other systems, which the tutorial doesn't explain at all. There's no objective markers, and the map has symbols above things, but they aren't labeled. Guys that it said had quests had nothing to give me. The quest directions are usually pretty terrible and wrong. Tutorial mission had me get a key, which I got, but it didn't work on the door, and there were no other keys around. Then on main island I'm left wandering around not sure what the main quest line is. Half of the stuff in the inventory I had no idea what to do with. Interacting is terrible, and instead of your movement key, it is L mouse which controls camera. This means clicking on an object to move to it and interact doesn't work. You need to walk up next to it then interact. Pathing is terrible. Your guy gets stuck on objects and won't go around. Other time he just stops in the middle of moving for no reason. L/R clicking on objects in chests doesn't put it into your inventory. You have to manually drag EVERY SINGLE item into your backpack. Somehow you use bags through a confusing system to have more space. Using runes on this object to open it like it told me to do just didn't work. Finally after wandering around with no clue what to do, where to go, and every path blocked off I gave up on this turd. Apparently other people have this problem too as quests are given to wrong location, some items are missing and quests are bugged, and it's just not worth it.

Play basically any other ARPG (besides Loki) and it's better than this. Also devs gave up on this immediately with nothing more than like 2 small patches and nothing for last 1.5 years even with all the bugs and problems people have been complaining about.

**Patches/State of the Game:
Well, despite Iggy's claims they're still supporting the game, the last patch notes are from 2015( see these two images- iggy claiming it's still supported, but latest patch notes being from Nov 2015 http://imgur.com/gallery/TbIsG . Check the discussion boards if you don't believe me) and from all I can see it's still utterly broken. http://www.dreamatrix.net/news/wod_updates.html which is their official site for WoD updates reinforces this.
**Graphics: 
Just..dont buy it. Please. For your own sanity. Look at this screensnip I just took. Marvelously detailed armour and then the actual character model... http://i.imgur.com/Zq0cmVR.png (note that's on the highest settings I could find, with a very recently built gaming rig, skylake processor, GTX1070 etc etc)
**Previous Titles:
Oh and a big hint that the game is just a pretty poor rework of LOD (Legends of Dawn), one of their previous, also negatively reviewed, games? The game executable itself is called game_lod.exe. That and a lot of the models, lore, etc are awfully similar. 
**Bugs and misc:
Alt-tab still tends to hang the game to the point you have to Task-manager crash it out.
Still able to get stuck in far too many places- and there's no unstuck, so you have to go back to your previous save
Random crashes- no obvious source, seemingly purely random.
They don't appear to have spell-checked or grammar-checked a lot of the quest text/conversation text, glaring errors in most text that pops up.
As in original review, the inventory system is a crippled mess. you'll end up with 50 or so different kinds of materials and recipes that you can't craft for ages, weapons and armour you probably won't ever be able to use and everything else, and a confusing inventory upgrade system on top of it.


Original Review:
Still seems to be a broken, clunky mess...and the crafting is ridiculous- you'll find your inventory quickly filling up with a massive number of crafting materials and recipes, but none you can actually make because you're missing one or two bits (some of which show up on vendors, but they have randomised inventories, so..yeah..may not even have simple stuff, not to mention it's often pricey as hell).
Plus on the point of inventory, there's an odd system of bags..where you buy a bag and can upgrade it's size by adding more bags (up to a limit), which is a cool idea..except a) a lot of the bags look the same ( I don't mean similar, I mean the exact same icon), and they no longer show their name once you've equipped them so it gets confusing which is which. They also don't list anywhere on them the maximum number of upgrades (total slots) they can have, which can lead to you buying too many of a bag and essentially wasting gold.
Despite what seems like a massive world, the whole place really is rather linear, and still confusing at the same time. 
A lot of the quest texts are unclearly written, which can lead you to attempt the wrong thing (or go the wrong place) which gets frustrating fast.
You don't really get many skills in the game, you (mostly) get Spells. Spells are odd too- you'll combine Runes (which, sadly enough is the name for both an item to unlock certain chests, and the items to make spells) to craft a spell, but that doesn't teach you the spell..you still have to carry the spell around in your bags, taking up inventory slots. Some spell combinations are ridiculous (both good and bad), and a lot of it really, really doesn't make sense.
Honestly, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless you're prepared for a lot of frustration",1461675013,1489264652,False,62,1,0.843177974224090576,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) here from Universal Gaming Reviews to bring you a short overview of Wave of Darkness. If you'd like to read our full, in-depth review for the game you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/wave-of-darkness-overview-and-review/

Wave of Darkness is an action role-playing game with a lot of features built in ranging from a spellcrafting system, rune based lockpicking, tons of weapon, resistance, crafting and lore skills, a huge array of achievements to unlock and a fun, challenging combat system.

We previewed the game when it was on Steam Early Access and I can happily say that the game has improved a great deal since then, it's a ton more stable, combat has improved quite a bit and the overall experience is much more enjoyable than it was.

It's great to see the developers continually updating the game and I have a feeling it'll only get better as more updates are released. 

I'll also say that I do agree that the graphics are definitely dated and the voice acting can be a bit spotty at times but if you're willing to give it a chance you'll find a well made and feature packed RPG underneath. 

Definitely worth a look 7.8/10.",1449099501,1449099903,True,4,0,0.354146301746368408,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:

The graphics in the gameplay and the audio are decent. The gameplay is very familiar for most RPG'ers. Solid title, tons of hours of play, but nothing that REALLY makes it stand out so far. All in all, worth a try for RPG fans. 3/5

  
The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:

First things first, this is a pretty solid game. 70+ hours of good, above-average RPG gameplay is nothing to scoff at. The graphics are not going to blow you away and neither is the music. However, the game does have pretty good looking load screens and the intro is pretty awesome, frankly. As for the game itself, this one certainly has more fighting and action than the last RPG I covered The Age Of Decadence. The crafting system is actually pretty manageable and can yield some pretty cool items, potions, etc. There is a lot to do, as there appear to be TONS of NPC's to interact with, side quests to engage in and a lot more going on than just the main story. However, all that being said....nothing really stands out to me about this one. It is fun, it has a huge world with tons to explore and there really are a lot of possibilities....it's just not really sucking my in story-wise so far. I find myself plowing through without being very drawn into the game at all. It could be a personal preference though. I'd say it's worth about $20 and sits at a solid 3/5. Give it a try if you love RPG's.

I'm loving this game! It reminds me a lot of Gothic (my favorite game) or Risen. Don't expect cutting edge graphics or animations.  The focus of the game is on story and exploration. The world is packed with stuff to interact with and to find and using your map is essential.  Yes, you can make bookmarks on the map.  The voice acting is great. Combat is OK; don't expect Grim Dawn style action combat. You don't actively block or dodge; combat is stat dependent. It can be a bit confusing getting started, just like Gothic was, but if you explore, everything is explained pretty well.  I also recommed watching the 3 tutorial vids and reading the manual.  Quests unlock areas of the game, so if you can't do somethng or somethng is blocked/locked, there's a reason. You can go do something else and things will work themselves out. There's minimal ""hand-holding"" in the game, ala Gothic. Quest givers don't have ! over their heads; you have to talk to people. And there's no ""Ta-Da"" when you complete a quest.  You have to figure that out yourself.  Did a merchant send you out to find a camp that was overrun by enemies and to recover a lost message?  Well, when you come on a bunch of ruined wagons and dead people, and you pick a message up off the ground, you can assume you solved the quest.  I can see spending very many hours in this game. The game really simulates exploring a new land pretty well. You have to annotate your map, you have to find stuff yourself and you have to figure out your route and your methods of accomplishing goals. To me, that's real immersion. The game is running well on my machine.   I've found only one annoying glitch, but Iggy is working on that and it didn't stop my progress in the game.

Despite this, the following at my honest and frank opinions on a promising indie game.
Wave of Darkness fits nicely into a genre that has been neglected some-what since the rise and rise again of the MMO. The likes of Baldur’s Gate and Diablo filled many hours of my gaming youth. This meant that I was somewhat excited to see what Dreamatrix were giving us when I received the key. 
Hesitantly I installed the game and launched, if I’m honest I was expecting to be disappointed. What I was given was a visual delight with some of the most genuinely pleasing aesthetics I have seen in an Indie title. This coupled with a soundtrack that helps to build on the feeling of the game, makes for a truly inspiring gaming experience. 
Like all new games Wave of Darkness does have some issues; however I have every confidence these will be resolved by the developers in due course. The camera controls are old fashioned and seem awkward compared to newer titles. Looting of mobs is easier with the latest update, however being able to drop items quickly into my inventory with a right click would be much easier and quicker than dragging and dropping. Whilst these slight issues are a little annoying they are far from game breaking.
The biggest disappointment came in the form of character creation. The developers have included three races, but what is lacking is any kind of indication in the character creation screen as to how these races interact with one another that might give an indication as to which one to play as. Furthermore there are limits to how you can make the model look, whilst this is not a massive issue in this style of top down RPG a little additional customisation is always nice. Again this in no way impacts on the game play. 
I am aware that I have only played for a little over one hour, so this review is based on first impressions, but in the cut throat gaming world, first impressions are vital, and in this case, over all I am impressed and will be continuing my adventure soon.

There is maybe what resembles a skeleton of a good idea buried here somewhere, the problem is where to even begin tackling a project that is clearly as immense as this indie action RPG hopes to be.

The point is I'm poor, and if I had to choose between a delicious meal of macaroni and cheese and playing this game for more than two hours...I think we'd all know what most people in my situation would do.  Thank you for your time, and I hope this review made you giggle a little.

Wave of Darkness was developed and published by Dreamatrix and released on November 5th, 2015.  The game was a Kickstarter campaign that successfully funded at over $20,000. 

Dreamatrix provided a review copy to The Hidden Levels and we thank them greatly for that. 

Ammendment: I have played through the fixed tutorial and learned how to craft spells and use runes for them. This aspect of the game is very unique and fun, crating spells using the faith can lead to some interesting combinations. I put together a ward with acid damage and armor reduction and enemies melted. I can see this having substantial potential but again certain aspects of the game simply need polish. 

I am ammending my review from not recomennded to recommended for those who want a custom character and spell building game, which needs more work to be fully finished. I state again, I ONLY recommend this to players looking for something a bit more challenging than a run of the mill experience. Below is my Original review for the sake of fairness. 11/8/15 


Original full review:
I was pretty hyped to start this game after watching the trailer and in game intro video. Then we got to the character creation and the graphics seemed to take a massive jump down in terms of quality. I had trouble with that but pressing on we made a character and ventured into the tutorial. The tutorial is bugged, and this is something that I'd suggest needs to be fixed immediately. Once you get to a certain point there is a door that will not open, and essentially the tutorial dies there. 

Into the game I traveled into town and found a quest to go gather in a swamp. I finally found a small gap i a tree that was completely black, moused over it to see it light up, and it ""zoned me"" into a swamp area. I fought a few things and instantly noticed that some mobs appear and disappear, the aggro distance for each mob is tied to another, and that mobs could get stuck in the goemetry and become invincible. This all mkaes for a relatively difficult combat experience. 

I tried my hardest to find some of the herbs or flowers from my 2 quests, but they seemed to not exist. Was the bug in the tutorial placed there to prepare me for the bugs in the game? I pressed on and killed mobs for another 20 minutes or so, and after a half hour of just swinging the sword I headed back to town.  

The map displays a vast and huge world with loads to do, so if fixed I think this game has some serious potential. The amount of loot you get and the unique crafting system are hampered by the bugs but still set this apart from some other ARPG type games. I can't reccomend it in it's current state but would suggest that I update this review after some potential updates and polishing has been done. I think this game could be great, it's just not finished yet.

I state again, I ONLY recommend this to players looking for something a bit more challenging than a run of the mill experience. Below is my Original review for the sake of fairness.""

Thank you for your review. We will further try to improve all aspects of the game. It's just hard to know what each player find confusing. Curses for example are something most players are unaccustomed to. We have added auto-identification of those items when they are equipped. Spellcrafting and rune-based spells were influenced by games such as Ultima Underworld. Difference is that we are using larger array of effects and are hoping to expand on that. Our biggest problem is that each player plays differently and some things that one player does all the time (for example creating spells) is something other player almost never does (for example, those players accustomed to play as pure warriors). More upgrades are coming soon and we plan to improve all the components. just as we sift through all the suggestions, corrections and improvements on our list."

Its basically the same game weve all played, but does it worse in a lot of ways. Youd probably enjoy your time more if you just up and bought Skyrim or Diablo or something.

""Can be explored in any way and whenever you want"" Funny then what are these hedgehog walls (which any functional being would have no issue climbing over or around) doing here? They arent any better than the invisible walls the game page says this game doesnt have. Oh yeah, and the cunning lack of invisible walls by using deadly deep water instead. 

""Allows you to combine and experiment with different character classes"" Yeah, maybe when you get a fair distance into the game. But you might as well just resign yourself to Melee for the time being, because you dont have a choice when you start up the game, only difference is that melee specced stats are more useful at the start than magery specced ones.

Thats just the start of the blatant flaws this game has, not to mention it actually doesnt look as good as the screenshots above, even on max settings. Its like playing NWN again, but far less functional.

Not worth the price, and not worth what i paid for it when it was on special. Maybe later if they fix some massive issues, but at the moment, steer elsewhere.

This game claims that its for the Hardcore Oldschool RPG fans. And im insulted, as i am one of them.

------

Because apparently two features they used ambiguously wasnt enough, heres some more of my experiences:

Tutorial is a joke, it barely tells you where to go. You are quite frequently expected to have any clue when the quest objectives progressed, and at the end of the Tutorial when it tells you to 'find your own road' to the first city, it fails to mention that there isnt one. Going right results in a blocked road and broken bridge. Up leads to water which will apparently dissolve you since youre water soluable (What? seriously?), Down does the same. And left leads you to a peninsula with loot on it. Guess how long it took for me to realise ""Skip tutorial"" was what i was apparently meant to do. (i think so, anyway. The quest straight up vanished from my quest log)

Looting is slow and overwhelming, literally turning the first few minutes outside the tutorial onward into an inventory management game.

The combat is simple, (and while very reminicent to other games of its type), is incredibly unimaginative. Bash/Cast/Buff/Summon/Etc. Nothing new, nothing special.

The map claims to be huge, and by scale it is, but literally only because your means of transport is a jog. The map itself is pretty average in size.

The ground itself has poor hitboxes and a wrong step when exploring could put you into a certain death situation due to the lack of a 'jump' button. (not complaining about the button, mind you).

the time it takes to bring up the save window (even on an i5 4690k and gtx970) is pretty obnoxious, considering certain other titles have zero issues with loading said menus.

Some tips that pop up suggest you to use taunts, when the button isnt even bound by default.

the character and weapon models look like something youd expect from the mid 2000s more than today. (think Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines number of polygons)

Only half the objects that can be interacted with indicate so (Corpses of kills do not at any point indicate so) and the rest only show up when you mouse over them. 

Looted objects remain in world (fair enough) but can be looted once more, and with many of them overlapping, mostly clipping into the floor, or straight up having iffy clickboxes (i had to click a cultists foot, once to get any loot) youll quite frequently spend post battle clicking over and over on all the corpses to make sure you didnt miss anything, since even an EMPTY lootable can still be looted again.


Its a common occurence that ""open world, go where you want"" results in a lot of lack of direction and confusion as to the focus of the game, and this is no exception by any means.",1446856660,1446892460,False,19,1,0.533197462558746338,4,True,False,False,False,,1447105191.0,"Wave of Darkness works on a new 64-bit engine with significantly performance improvements. The game is open-world and is able to go wherever he pleases.

If the city of Sidis Tarea is under siege and the guards don't want to let you inside (a complete stranger), that most definitely doesn't mean that the game has invisible walls.

The game doesn't offer professions the player can choose, i.e., the professions that could limit the gameplay. The usage of spells at the beginning of the game may be insufficient, and requires the usage of melee weapons as an assistance to the inexperienced players, but that can completely change in the game with the mastering of usage of spells. In example, the player can become a powerful mage that destroys hordes of monsters with ease, but it requires experimenting with spells and its intensive usage."

I played for an hour and requested a refund.  The tutorial island is terrible, the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view, all inventories are unintuitive, what is clickable on the screen is impossible to tell without mousing over it.  

The very first quest had improper info.  Talk to the quest giver then open a door elsewhere.  Get to the door, says talk to the quest giver.  Go to quest giver, says open the door.  Have to Google to find out there was a key in a box that I didn't click on.  No need to talk to quest giver.  This is the opening tutorial.  If these mistakes are here, who knows what else is wrong.

On the opening island there is only 1 enemy.  So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting.  So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy.  Seems fine, just like Diablo.  Figure I will get more moves later.  Nope, not fine.  Enemy doesn't die.  It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.  Enemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life.  I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP).  2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.

Perhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding.  I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it.  It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong?  Totally cursed.  Can't un-equip.  I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying I was holding a cursed item.  It should have said something across my screen when I tried to switch it out.  

Then looting is terrible.  Want to mine?  No animation.  Just opens up a window with some ore.  EVERYTHING is like this.  Can't even shift click to put it in your inventory.  Drag and drop.  Or click a picture of a hand to get it all at once.  

Map is fairly bad as well.  It's huge, as advertised, but ugly and hard to understand.  For instance, I wanted to un-curse my weapon.  I had to look up what a Shrine looked like on the map since it's not listed under the rest of the large icons that signify areas of importance.  Saw this complained about in another thread since I had to look this up to.  Got to the Shrine that would supposedly uncurse my weapon, but I saw no option to do so.  Accidently fell in the water next to it and died.  Submitted a request for a refund.

I don't doubt that it gets better as I go, but I'm not going to waste time here.  I found Dwarf Fortress to have a nicer UI.",1446783253,1446783266,False,219,24,0.727038383483886719,33,True,False,False,False,,1447077835.0,"""the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view""

Helpful messages are here to show what is clickable, usable or of interest to the player. These messages are there to be read and most of  them disappear once you click on the object in question. For example, message above the well will disappear once you click on the well.

Also these messages explain what certain object is used for - wells for water recharge, oracle stones to identify items, god shrines for sacrifice items and remove curses, runes to unlock locked crates and chests etc.

We have changed texts few days ago to reflect this. Tutorial island has few simple quests, some of which are chained together. Mostly quests 1,2 and 4.


tutorial quest 1: Arrival at the Docks (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)

""Today we have arrived at the docks of Sidis Tarea. Looks abandoned. No traces of people at all. Ship captain asked me to look around. Dockmaster's office is supposed to be to the east of here, near the end of the docks. That should be first place to search.""

Should be pretty self-explanatory. Go to the office to the east. It can be seen on the map since it's the first building you encounter. Once you enter the building, quest is completed and captain will give you next quest.


tutorial quest 2: Preparations for the Journey (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)

""Everybody at the docks seems to be dead. Whoever or whatever did this might still be around. Or they went to Sidis Tarea next. Whatever it is, it looks it might be
a good idea to get some equipment - weapons and armors before I travel to Sidis Tarea.
Captain said there's a garnison barracks to the north. Dockmaster should have the key for the weapons room.""

Note the ""Dockmaster should have the key for the weapons room."" part. Also, during conversation with the captain he says ""Weaponry is usually locked. Only two people have the keys to it - the garrison commander and the dockmaster.""

What you should do is just take key from the dockmaster's office and enter barracks. Also, toltip on barracks door is changed to tell you you should return to the dockmaster's office for the key. Just in case somebody misses quest log entry... and same during the dialogue with the captains.


tutorial quest 3: Searching the Warehouse (Herbalist at Sidis Tarea Docks)

""Journey to the Sidis Tarea may be dangerous. Herbalist on the docks says she can create some healing potions, however she lacks dawnleaf, one of most potent ingredients.
There's a warehouse in the northwestern part of the docks. I should go and search it.
I may be able to find some dawnleaf.""

Just go to the warehouse to the west and that's it.


""On the opening island there is only 1 enemy. So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting. So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy. Seems fine, just like Diablo. Figure I will get more moves later. Nope, not fine.
Enemy doesn't die. It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.
Enemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life. I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP). 2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.

This is regarding tutorial quest 4: Scouting the Road (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)

""Road toward Sidis Tarea lies east from the docks. It would be wise to scout ahead, to see if any danger lies ahead. If everything is ok, we could travel toward the city, and if not...""

We have changed this. Now the Cultist in question is handycapped to level 0 with ~40HP. He can be killed while staying butt-naked with worst possible character created, without any skills or spells.


tutorial quest 5: Journey to the Sidis Tarea (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)

""Strange cultists seem to be behind the attacks on the docks. We have to warn the
authorities in Sidis Tarea. However captain cannot spare more men to go with me
so it seems up to me to find the road that will lead me to the city.""

Just click on the boat to end the tutorial.


""Perhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding. I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it. It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong? Totally cursed. Can't un-equip. I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying

Auto-identify cursed weapons is also added to the game. Each time you equip cursed weapon, it will be identified.
Just as it says in the messages near the Oracle Stone or God shrine. One is on the small island at the north of the docks, other west of warehouse to the left of the docks."

I'll admit though, this game was kicking my butt so I'll have to figure out some good way to ramp up my weapons/armor/etc before going much farther.  

You can zoom into a closer almost horizontal view or zoom out into an overhead view.  You can rotate the camera around so you are moving in whatever direction you like, although the camera panning is a bit slow for my tastes.  No idea if this is an innovation as I don't play many RPGs.  But anyway, this seems to be a pretty good game but gosh, I don't know if I'd ever finish it.  I'm too old!

So, there's my little review.  The game seems very challenging to me but again, maybe I'm just old. :)  But I actually prefer a harder game than one that's too easy and you just sort of breeze through it.  When you beat a harder game, it's more satisfying anyway.

The combat can be a bit chunky but overall not to bad. The spell creating in great. After you created your spell, each time you cast it, it levels as well. There not to much in the way of skills as I can see yet but you do get attribute points in both character leveling and skills leaving. There are fast travel way points with in most locations.  There are some areas in the game that look like it can be easily swim across but don't temp this, as your character can't swim and will die.

The Good : - 

* Loot, loot and more loot
* Plenty of Bag space on your character 
* Spell Creation - Create your own spell and level them
* Open World

The Bad : - 

* Quests need to be easier to Identified in both receiving and handing in. 
* Combat can be chunky
* Way to many keys
* Can't Swim

The Neutral : - 

* Curse items

Overall a great game but can be a heavy in the pocket for the cost for early access game.

(getting more than 60fps most of time with a corei7 and a gtx 870 3gb). 

Other than that i am absolutely in love with the OST, its brilliant and so realxing ! the instruments used you don't hear often in games i love the relaxed tone of the ost really.

The character's animation is great, the gear and items you find ingame are full of style, also the ennemy's are so well designed great taste from the art designers of the game.

The game feels overall so freaking polished and it's much much fun, big open world full of marvelous detail what can i say this is what RPG's are all about, this game makes this to freaking perfection, you'r sunk into the game.

This might well become my GOTY RPG of 2015, i really am in love.

Сегодня наконец-то поиграл в новую экшен-РПГ.
Впечатления разные, но в целом положительные. Да, это не великая игра типа Diablo, но свою нишу занимает. Не забываем также, что пока игра в раннем доступе.

Плюсы:
+ Приятный графон
+ Довольно разнообразные предметы
+ Вроде есть крафт
+ Хорошие локации
+ Разработчики активно общаются на форуме
+ Обещано более 70часов гейплея.

Минусы:
- Простая до невозможности боевая система. И немного кривая. Но может это только в начале?
- Есть некоторые проблемы с управлением мышью (используйте WASD)
- Пока не поддерживается оконный режим
- Нет русского языка, а текста много.
- Музыкальное сопровождение отстой - одна и та же унылая мелодия

Выводы. Если знаете английский и любите игры экшен-РПГ, то в принципе можно купить. Тем более, что цена не особо кусается и дана щедрая скидка. Да, это не супер-пупер, но своего потребителя найдет, т.к. нормальных игр такого жанра мало.",1435205611,1435205715,True,9,2,0.341489672660827637,17,True,False,True,False,,,

   Зачем? Зачем я это сделала? Почему не посмотрела, что это творение Dreamatrix - людей, знаменитых чудовищной Legends of Dawn (которая некогда показала мне, что при должном старании можно испортить даже безотказные формулы экшн-рпг)? Как я могла не узнать интерфейс, который разработчики просто перенесли из одной игры в другую (вместе со всеми иконками, половиной GUI и большей частью моделек)? Откуда во мне столько веры в человечество? Ладно, важными экзистенциальными вопросами мы займемся позже, а пока просто послушайте.

   Как и любой качественный продукт, Wave of Darkness сперва встречает нас лаконичной демонстрацией своей сути: а именно, отказывается распознавать разрешение, вылетает при alt-tab и не поддерживает оверлей Стима. Все это - нежная и робкая прелюдия к тому, что ожидает игрока потом. Распаленный багами и крэшами, жаждущий увидеть больше, он уже даже не удивляется тому, что при первой загрузке мира игра выдает черный экран с несколькими менюшками поверх. Симфония из блеклого вводного текста и искрометных внутриигровых описаний (""неожиданные находки могут поджидать вас в местах, где вы не ожидали их увидеть!"") тут же начинают азартно соперничать за внимание.
   Впрочем, вам будет некогда читать текст. Ведь впереди - невероятные красоты самого движка, который обеспечивает рывки камеры при простом передвижении, блокирование общего вида отдельными элементами архитектуры и текстуры величиной в кунжутное семечко. Деревянные анимации. Разлетающиеся на несколько окровавленных кусков враги, не сумевшие пережить морального унижения от удара рапиры в пупок. Все это - и трупы уже убитых вами противников, которые останутся стоять молчаливыми памятниками самим себе, поскольку убирать модели - для слабаков.
   Герой не может автоматически подойти к предмету, который надо использовать. Механика сумок сломана (о, кстати, вы же соскучились по временам, когда ваш инвентарь был ограничен 14 слотами, половина из которых тут же забивалась ресурсами?), отдых работает не так, как заявлено. Неудобная карта совершенно не учитывает 3D-геометрию. Воскрешение может положить игру.
   Единственный положительный момент - можно сохраняться когда угодно. Но зачем? Когда вы перезайдете в приложение, все ваши сейвы исчезнут.

   Wave of Darkness - превосходный пример проекта, который вы можете получить, если из инструментов разработки у вас будут компьютерная мышь, рубанок и набор влажных салфеток. Говорят, можно предложить Смерти сыграть во что-нибудь в ваш последний час, и если вы победите, то она отступит. Просто покажите ей Wave of Darkness, и еще лет двадцать можете не беспокоиться о ее повторном визите.
   Так все и обстоит на текущий момент. Не знаю, буду ли требовать возврат. Может, подожду еще две недели в [strike]слабой[/strike] надежде на то, что парочка хотфиксов исправят хотя бы критические баги. А может, лучше не ждать.

Not only is Wave of Darkness an improvement over Legends of Dawn, but a whole new roleplaying experience, and the team has seemingly fixed all the problems that folks had with the first one. For example, while the game still does not hold your hand or put exclamation marks over the important NPCs (or even more insulting was Neverwinter's trail of ""bread crumbs"" which lead you right to the quest), Wave of Darkness makes you think. This time, there is an optional tutorial at the beginning to learn the basics before releasing you into the world. In Dawn, players were assumed to have read the manual old school-style, but gawd forbid anyone wanting to read these days.

There are lots more spells and items to craft now, and my favorite thing about weapons and armor: cursed items! This alone made me very happy.

They have tackled all of the bugs that I noticed, and even did some tweaks and improvements on the engine, which I have liked since Dawn, and I have not experienced any crashes or glitches during my play through (I am running Windows 7 Home x64).

All-in-all, I greatly enjoyed Legends of Dawn, and loved Wave of Darkness so far. If you're a fan of old school roleplaying games, and want to craft your own spells, potions, weapons, and armor, then this game is for you. While playingLegends of Dawn is not a requirement, it greatly adds to the fun, as this is the middle of a trilogy, and the story is worth it.

I love this game, and can't wait to see what's next. Thank you, Dreamatrix!",1435155104,1435155104,True,60,6,0.599528074264526367,2,False,False,True,False,,,

I think this is justified for 2 reasons:

One, because the help players get on the forums is MOSTLY personal dev to player emails. Not a lot of dev's take time like this to help people out. Secondly, I think a few of the comments here may be correct, as the game does not have a positive review as a whole. Which isn't fair. From what I've seen, it deserves one.

Another EDIT: I've finally fixed my issue. I'm not sure if it has to do with having two monitors of different screen region, but the game wasn't launching in 1920x1080 - though not being the correct region I still feel shouldn't crash the game and make it unplayable.
