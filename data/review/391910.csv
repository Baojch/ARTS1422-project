My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707447096,1707447096,True,2,0,0.45762711763381958,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The reason for that being probably because he thus far, been unable to commit and perfect to any given product, couple this also with the fact that his games often lack meaningful depth. Not that he is a bad developer. There is some genuine hope here, but unless he stops and really thinks on what makes a great game, he will only continue to produce and rehash uninspiring clutter.

This game was originally entered into the 2013 26th Ludlam Dare competition that one being the theme minimalism and can be found here‚Ä¶ 

http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=15359

Since then, he continued to work on the product to what it is today and you can clearly see a mass improvement. However, he, like most indie developers rely too much on easy short cuts to pad game content. Instead of interesting puzzles, we get the tiresome mazes with boring find and push button mechanics. Instead of the game being user friendly to limit being lost, wandering around aimlessly and going on a long push ‚Äòw‚Äô trek of nothingness, we get buttons placed in obscure places with no blinking or locating hints, backgrounds offering nothing more than geometric shapes and paths and staircases that go on forever. Regardless of this being 'ADVANCED' civilisation they haven‚Äôt invented an elevator? I have to walk from level 1 to 2 and suffer 5 minutes of motion sickness because of a stair case easy to clip into?

No story. No Lore. Other than you waking up in a chamber to find that rocks are falling from the sky, there‚Äôs a spaceship on fire somewhere in space and it‚Äôs probably due to the octopus machine monster breaking up Saturn. However, that is only a guess as there are no notes, no messages, no visual storytelling. There are two people in chambers like the one you wake up in, which merely hints your human nothing more. There are childish signs that says things like ‚Äòbutton hidden in maze‚Äô or ‚Äòwelcome to level 2 don‚Äôt touch the balls‚Äô as if an advanced civilisation would leave notes like that. Are you even trying to tell a story here? Or are you just creating a silly game with 8 different levels? If it is the latter then you fail in that too. Why?

BROKEN MECHANICS. The game does not renew your health. Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you save in the game, you will receive instadeath as soon as you respawn when your health gets to zero. From level 5 on-wards you come across alien like robot balls that shoot laser pellets. As soon as they diminish your health to zero, game over and you'll need to restart from the very beginning again. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Since the developer was not smart enough to place an automatic save system which also included YOUR HEALTH and there is no fast travel which he purposefully implemented into the game, it will soon become an impossible and vexing game to play.

In sympathy of customers who paid for this to have a good time here are some helpful tips. In level 1 there is a button hidden under the false floor in the hangar. Clip through the wall in the hangar at the back, if you try the front you will die. On level 2 just wait for a good space with all the dropping balls, move inwards half way then climb the slope to the top. Glitch elevator and Glitch Long Jump, you can fast travel using this glitch (not planned) the only decent and fun mechanic of the game. Press ‚ÄòE‚Äô stand on the block and then enlarge the block while standing on it, you will float upwards in the sky. If, as your jumping on it, push forward and enlarge, then you will long jump forward through the sky. How long can you elevate up? It seems endless. I even was able to get to the sun.

In conclusion, with broken mechanics, boring tedium pathing and puzzles, no invigorating lore, this game is as ‚Äòfallen‚Äô from great heights as its own depiction. Don‚Äôt buy it, at least until its really improved‚Ä¶

The game has a great sound track (though some may find it a little repetitive after a while) that fits in well with the   sandbox like  alien world.   The puzzles so far are pretty easy,  but you do have to find them.  There's   a moon like gravity that enables you to jump really high. Also you can create objects that can be used as stepping stones to otherwise inaccessible area's of the game and to help you complete missions.  While   wandering around, you are also  pelted with massive blocks of rock  that are constantly falling  from the sky.  If one hits you, you're dead.  you have a gun that shoots  photon like pulses that  destroy blocks when they are hit.  The gun is also used to activate the  switches that unlock other area's of the game.  You  can fly around using a jet pack, but you do need to collect blue fuel packs which can be found around the world.  There are other (pink) packs to find as well, these give you extra ammo for your  gun.  You can pick up objects, rotate them and even change their  size. 

The developer originally created this game in one of the Ludlum Dare  competitions, where the theme was minimalistic.  You can download the original version [url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=15359][b]HERE[/b][/url].  The game has been massively improved especially graphically since   then and now looks   really cool.    

I highly recommend you check it out.  I was looking for a you tube video to add  but as yet haven't found one.  Maybe i'll create one myself if i have time.  :)",1445031766,1445036669,True,45,7,0.716218411922454834,2,True,False,False,False,,,
