The sprite work is pretty good, and I did like the environments at the least, both the old and the remastered. The hd mode character art did not appeal to me at all, so I kept that as mostly 16 bit.

The combat mechanics had some neat ideas, but only in regards to boss battles. It makes normal encounters a slog. And maybe I didn't get far enough into the game, bu it felt like the last two party members felt like they were just there, maybe as chaperones? And why the hell is juggler guy only able at healing during combat? That is so dumb...

To be honest, it is impressive what they pulled off in making a homebrew genesis game in 2010, and the whole missible content is because of limitations the team had to deal with. And I did chuckle with the dragon kissing scene. I don't want to be harsh on this game, but I can't recommend this.

The game is general is not bad, not great in terms of battle system and dungeon crawling. I like how the dungeon design was done overall but it might be that my criteria for RPG level design are low, since the genre is poor at it in general. Everything was very slow even for and oldschool RPG - animations and such, and if you want to enjoy Pier Solar, you need to sit back and relax a little. No rushing it.
The final boss was somewhat hard and I enjoyed the challenge. If you want to play something oldschool and you are the Lunar type of guy, then this might be your game. Just do not rush it.

I'm not going to go into super detail because I tapped out somewhat early in the game, but quite frankly I think I saw what there was to see. As a love letter to old JRPGs it embraces some of their most terrible features, which would be somewhat tolerable if it was 1996 but not tolerable anytime after 2010. Some quick bullets:

1. Annoying and terrible dungeon design that hides chests behind invisible passageways occluded by a pixel layer. Gotta go grid hunting to find the hidden invisible passage to lead to a chest that half the time contains an antidote or something similarly useless.

2. No separated item and equipment menu, making gearing your characters a huge chore and hassle. Having to hunt down the new sword you found and unintuitively equip it is a pain in the ass.

3. The battle system isn't super complex but everything takes *forever*. A typical random battle takes multiple minutes to resolve due to individual basic attacks taking tens of seconds. The auto option, which would otherwise make this more tolerable, for some reason has the characters burning consumables, which is intolerable. 

4. Mysterious story flag points that don't flow together and are nonsensical. Almost at no point in my playtime did I figure out why I should care about anything that was happening. 

5. Old school grind requirements that, coupled with the takes-forever-and-a-day battle system, means the total playtime of the game is horrendously padded.

If I was 12 and this was all I could rent for two weeks from blockbuster, I'd probably push through it a bit more, but as it stands I just don't really have the patience to grind through a filler JRPG when there are plenty of other more interesting titles I could play.",1641878120,1641878120,False,10,0,0.64613640308380127,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is predictably random (ha), with every few steps leading to a turn-based JRPG battle system. This is the main drag on the game. The battle system asks you to either attack, defend, or essentially bide your time while gaining power without any truly clear motivation to do so. Progression is slow, and mechanics are explained minimally. This is clearly a game that relies on stronger predecessors to broach the topic of why they chose this system for this game.

Narrative is 90s nostalgia, with cute exchanges that, to their credit, actually make sense. The narrative is strong in flow. Sadly, it just doesn't keep momentum. What starts out as a coming of age mystery quickly devolves into a nonsensical series of events that fail to capitalize on what could have been dynamic character growth early on. It seems dedicated to being cute through and through.

World building is achieved with cultural towns that seem to exist on small islands (in the 13 hours I played at least). Each seems themed after a different ethnicity and culture, but this is never explored too deeply. It is instead handled with stereotypes and humor, which in and of itself can be a good thing if the tonality of your game is consistent, but the humor and the series bits don't flesh out well together, making this an uneven experience.

I did learn a lot about watermelons, and that was cool.

クリアまで24時間位でそこそこ楽しめました。
グラフィックは16bit、HD、HD+の3種類、BGMはFMとPCMの2種類から選択できます。

良い点(2015年のアップデートでの改善点）
・エンカウント率を0から8倍まで調整可能になり、
　戦闘メニューのオプションで戦闘アニメーションのオンオフ、
　バトルスピードを4倍まで変更可能でとても遊びやすくなりました。
・ショートカットボタンでいつでもダンジョンの入口まで戻れます。

気になった点
・イベントのフラグの立て方、次どこに行けばいいのかわかりにくいです。
　ダンジョンの最深部についたのに、何も起きない場面が何度もありましたw
　ノートブックのヒントがヒントになっていなかったりで迷います。
・謎解きが隠しスイッチや隠し通路を使う前提のやや難しいタイプです。ほぼノーヒントの謎解きがあります。
・グラフィックをHDモードにしていると、重要アイテムを使う場所や
　キャラが背景と同化して困る場面が何度かありました。
・自動戦闘モードがあるんですが、魔法や攻撃アイテムを使用しない設定にしたのに
　勝手に使ってしまうので結局手動戦闘することになります。
・魔法や技の解説がないので、使ってみて確認するしかありません。
・終盤のダンジョンで上記のダンジョン入り口に戻る機能を使うと進行不能になる場面があります。
・日本語モードだと一部アイテム名がERRORになっている(特に問題はない)
・ストーリーを進めると2度と戻れなくなる場所があり、アイテム取り逃したらもう一周プレイしないといけません。
　しかもミニマップやレーダーに表示されない隠し宝箱も多いので実績取得は難しいです。

高エンカウント率、戦闘のテンポの悪さは現在はアップデートで解決しています

ショートカットボタンからミニマップとレーダーの表示ができるので
設定しておくとアイテム探しが多少楽になります。
レーダーはグルグル回る光の方向に未開封アイテムがあると音で知らせてくれます。

父親のために少年ホストンが友人と薬草採りに森の洞窟へ向かうと古代遺跡を発見、その謎を探るべく旅に出るという内容。

[ゲーム進行]
ゲーム進行は分かりにくいところがある。数回話しかけないとイベントが進まなかったり、進行に必要なアイテムや通路が隠れていたりで、基本的には地道に調べていくしかない。
一応、現在の目標をメニューのノートブックから確認することができるので、何かをしたらゲームが進行したかどうかを確認することを推奨する。

[戦闘]
特徴的なのはギャザーシステムと防御アクセサリーだ。
ギャザーシステムは、従来のRPGでいう「ちからをためる」みたいなもので1ターン使ってギャザーを1段階増やすと、ギャザー１段階につき攻撃や回復の効果が50%増加する。制限があるものの最大5段階まで増やすことができ、仲間へ渡すことが可能だ。技や魔法にはギャザーが必須のものがある。ギャザーをいかに貯めるかが戦闘でのポイントなり戦略性になるが、ギャザーが必須と言っていいほどのバランスになっているために、毎回の戦闘序盤にギャザーを貯めるという手間が生じるが、ゲーム後半になれば戦闘最初からギャザーが少し貯まっている状態になる装備が手に入る。
このゲームには「防御時に反撃する」アクセサリーがあり、ギャザーシステムと親和性が良いと思う。反撃するのは確率によるので運が良ければ効果は大きい。ただ反撃するのではなく、攻撃してくる敵を「攻撃させずに」反撃するときがあるからだ。このため前衛に装備させて防御反撃、後衛がその間にギャザーを貯めるという戦略が採れる。もちろん、後衛が貯めたギャザーを前衛に与えれば反撃の効果が高くなる。

[マップ]
マップ構造は複雑な方だと思う。非常に入り組んだマップが多い。
特に後半に出てくる大きい街は街というよりもダンジョンかと思うくらいに入り組んでいる。また、通路を遮るようにオブジェクトがあるせいで、一見してどこが通れるのかが分かりにくいところが多い。

[アイテム収集]
アイテム収集は困難だ。マップの至るところに宝箱があるが巧妙に隠されていて、マップが複雑なこともあり集めるのを難しくしている。
ゲーム進行上、戻れなくなる場所が多いので取り逃がすと二度と取れない宝箱が多い。一応、後半で序盤の場所などに戻れるが全ての場所に戻れるわけではなく、主に中盤の場所には戻れない。宝箱の在処はレーダーを有効にするとミニマップ上に位置を示してくれるが、壁の中の見えない通路にあるような一部の宝箱は示してくれない。しかも序盤では後半になってからしか取れない宝箱の存在があるので、モヤモヤするかもしれない。アイテム収集を気にする人は注意が必要だ。

[ニューゲーム+]
一度クリアするとNG+モードがアンロックされて、キャラステータス、クエストアイテム以外のアイテム全てを引き継いでプレイすることができる。所持金は引き継がれない。本で覚えた技や魔法は忘れるが、再度本を使うことで覚えることができる。

ストーリーやキャラ、ゲームシステムは、古き良き16bit時代のRPGを思わせるような感じで非常に良い。しかし、オリジナルが古いためかゲームバランスについては、現代基準で考えると仕方ないのかもしれないが不親切さが目立つ。マップ構造が複雑なのは意図的であると思うが、個人的にはもう少し分かりやすければ良かった。戦闘システムはギャザーシステムがユニークであり悪くはないのだが、無理してギャザーを目一杯貯める必要性が低いのが気になった。ギャザーを貯めても敵の攻撃でギャザーが減ることがあり、ギャザー5段階必要な技や魔法は思ったほどの効果はあまりないように感じられるからだ。強いて言えば余裕があれば貯めておけば通常攻撃の効果が上がることの方が利点がある。
その他に気になる点として、エンカウント率や戦闘速度を調整できるのは良い。フィールドでの回復魔法使用が単体ずつの回復しかできず面倒、まとめて回復できるようなコマンドが欲しかった。また、フィールドでの回復の対象指定がフィールド上のキャラ隊列ではなくキャラステータスで指定できれば良かった。アイテム説明に紛らわしいものがある。例えば、毒矢の弓みたいな説明の弓があるが、実際は性能が高めな代わりに装備者が毒状態になることがあるというアイテムだったりする。あと、ボスはともかくとして印象的な雑魚敵がいない。
ゲームバランスにやや不親切なところがあり好みが分かれるかと思うが、それを許容して16bit時代の雰囲気に浸りつつJRPGをプレイしたいのならオススメだ。",1558347431,1558359890,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ein JRPG der alten Schule neu aufgelegt, viel Text mit guter Geschichte und immer wieder den selben kämpfen.

[h1] Einzelspieler: [/h1]

Man spielt Hoston der sich auf den Weg macht seinen Vater Medizin zu besorgen, durch diese Aktion kommt er mit einem Geheimnis in Kontakt die sein ganzes Leben verändert. Er macht sich mit seinen 2 Freunden auf um das Geheimnis zu lüften. 
In der Zeit bekommt man öfter neue Freunde zum Kämpfen hinzu und manche verlassen einem auch wieder.

Die Kämpfe sind rundenbasierend und per Zufallsprinzip, je nachdem was man für Ausrüstung hat (die man kaufen und finden kann) wird der Kampf schwerer oder Leichter. Die Kämpfe können auch ausgeschaltet werden um die Gebiete besser erkunden zu können.

Die Spielwelt ist immer vorgegeben ein Zurück zu früheren Orten ist nicht möglich, wenn man einen Ort per Schiff verlässt kann man nicht mehr zurück reisen!

[h1] Mehrspieler: [/h1]

Es können Lokal Minispiele gespielt werden die man zuvor im Singleplayer freigespielt haben muss.

[h1] Fazit: [/h1]

Zum Anfang hat mir das Spiel wirklich viel Spaß gemacht doch leider wurde es immer mehr zum Frust.  An sich steckt hier viel Liebe drin und Arbeit aber durch die ganzen Minuspunkte wirkt das Spiel eher wie Early Access.

Viele Kämpfe machen zum Anfang wirklich Spaß, auch das erkunden ist schön gemacht da man viele Secrets finden kann. Doch oft ist es so dass man sich nach einem NPC 30-45 Minuten die Hacken blutig läuft um ihn in den unübersichtlichen Städten ohne Karte finden zu müssen. 

Des Weiteren gibt es Geschicklichkeitseinlagen, wie über glatte Wege zu gehen wo man im richtigen Moment die kurven bekommen muss. Sollte man runterfallen alles wieder von vorne und das kommt öfter im Spiel vor (es war für mich schwerer als so mancher Boss Kampf).

Die Boss kämpfe sind auch hier wohl eher das Highlight des ganzen Spieles, sie machen auch recht viel Spaß aber wenn man verliert muss man die Texte die davor gesprochen werden nochmal komplett durchklicken (und das dauert meistens ewig). Es ist sogar manchmal so dass gleich mal 2-3 Boss hintereinander kommen und jeder hat gerne viel zu sagen und man muss sich nach jedem mal verlieren alle Texte und alle Bosse noch einmal antun, was wirklich recht nervig und sinnlos ist.

Ich kann mir zwar vorstellen das es früher so normal war zu spielen, aber heutzutage hätte man ein wenig mehr abändern können für Leute die nicht tausend Mal das selbe lesen wollen oder die anderen vielen Minuspunkte die ich hier aufgezählt habe.
Hier wurde wirklich viel Potenzial verschenkt, es hätte ein wirklich super Game sein können mehr Arbeit reingesteckt hätte. Wem also die Grafik und der alte Sound nicht stören dem rate ich eher zur Emulator Version, da kann man wenigsten Quick Saves benutzen und muss nicht jeden Kampf und Text noch einmal durchklicken.

Meine Spielzeit um es durchzuspielen war 25h (den Endboss konnte ich nicht legen, war mir zu schwer bzw. ab einem bestimmten Punkt macht er Attacken so oft hintereinander das meine Leute keine Attacken mehr machen konnten und sofort tot waren oder manchmal haben sie auch einfach keine ausgeführt.)

Also 25h Spielzeit für 15€ für ein relativ mittelmäßiges Release was viele Fehler hat. Wenn man es mal für 5€ mitnehmen will ist es OK aber mehr würde ich keinen raten zu zahlen. Ich würde dem Spiel ein Neutral bzw. mittelmäßig geben, aber da Steam nur Positiv oder Negativ hergibt muss ich leider eher zu Negativ tendieren bei diesem Zustand des Spiels.

Really I did. However, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a game than I was with Pier Solar. There is everything wrong with the game, and nearly nothing was done right. So, let's break it down. 

The story? One word. Convoluted. You'll go through a significant portion of the game without any real idea of your purpose, and when significant plot details do surface it is done so late into the game, that it just leaves you feeling rushed and confused, not to mention by that time you have likely long stopped caring about why you are ""out here"" doing any of this. 

Gameplay. Oh boy. Where do I start? First, let me go on a little tangent - difficulty. A game's difficulty should be based on challenging factors related to player's skill or willingness to strategize or even grind. This game however is really only difficult because it is cheap. It's a copout, the lazy way to make a game difficult. That's not to say it's impossible or I'm whining because the game is too hard. It's not. It is playable and beatable, but made annoying by the level of cheapness involved in the battles. 

A perfect example is player v. enemy advantages. A staple in many JRPGs, to be sure and usually designed in one of two ways: a roughly 50/50 chance to encounter either or an increased enemy advantage chance until the player levels up some predetermined stat(s) to put the chances in their favor. I believe Pier Solar was supposed to be designed in the format of the latter, but it didn't really pan out. You'll find enemies (regardless of their level and Agility compared to yours) getting significantly more advantageous encounters to you. And in a game as difficult as this, allowing the enemies to pummel you so frequently before you have a chance to retaliate is extremely frustrating and you'll eventually come to feel the game is cheating you. 

Design. I can describe it in one word too, labyrinthian. Good lord. Everything in this damn game is a maze. Field maps, dungeons even towns. What were they thinking? It reeks of a lazy way to artificially inflate play time and difficulty by makng players have to traverse areas longer to their utter frustrration. 

Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the dreaded minigames. To be clear up front, I'm not a fan of minigames, but it is common to JRPGs, so their simple existence is not something I will hold against a game. However, in this game not only are they very abundant and dull, many of them are forced, tied behind story progression. Nuh-uh. That is a big no-no in any game, and I won't say it's acceptable in Pier Solar either. Minigames are meant to be fun, time-wasting diversions, or at worst a necessary evil related to sidequests, but never should be tied to story progression. 

Presentation. Graphics are fairly standard fair for a 16-bit era RPG that was designed specifically for the Sega Genesis. That said, the Genesis was capable of much nicer looking textures and animations than this game provides. Yes, it was made by a small indie team, but I'm not inclined to let that be used as an excuse for inferior design choices. The game isn't ugly, but it certainly ranks nowhere near the top of 16-bit inspired titles. That said, I do very much love the character portraits and cutscenes that are very much reminiscent of the Phantasy Star titles. Kudos. 

Now that I've got my one positive out of the way, let's talk about the HD graphical overhaul. It sucks. It looks ""okay"" and all, but the problem lies in the fact the game wasn't designed for an HD overhaul in mind. You'll often find the artwork and incidental foreground sprites in the HD version will obscure your ability to navigate in this game making the mazes even more of a nuisance. So if you do decide to play this game, do yourself a favor, and play in the original 16-bit option. 

The music isn't half bad, I will admit. There are even a few pretty good songs in there, with only a couple that will really grate on you. Also, there is the option for the FM soundtrack (basically what you would come to expect from music in a Genesis title) and the PCM music (which was released originally as an optional Sega CD add-on to the game) with higher quality music. The Steam verison allows you to choose between the two on a whim. I'm not particulary nostalgic towards the Sega Genesis, so I found the FM soundtrack to be a bit annoying at times, but if you are one of those people who enjoy the way the Genesis handled music then you'll probably love it. If not, the PCM soundtrack is very nice. 

Now, for what is probably the biggest cardinal sin in my book, and would have been enough to make me not recommend this game, if not for every other glaring issue... characterization. Oh my. For being a game that wants to really drive home the fact that your core group consists of three childhood friends adventuring together, the game does a pretty piss poor job of making them relatable or even seemingly all that friendly with each other.  I think the designers were too busy with their utterly immature elementary humor they just throw into the game to be bothered with something as insignificant as character interaction.

I could go on, but I think I've done enough ranting, and drove home my point long ago. Basically, the game is tripe. It's an insult to anyone who is a fan of classic 16-bit RPGs.",1536366123,1537716881,False,34,3,0.722936570644378662,0,True,False,False,False,,,

why is it frustrating? for me its simple the minigames that you need to complete, to keep progressing. for example the sliding plattforms... i was so happy to finish finaly the magic school and i thought that would be the peak of frustration in in the game. i was wrong. at the last chapter you have to do this bullshit again and this time it sets you even further back if failed. so you have to run all around the basement and the staircases again and again if you fail the plattform. (wouldnt be a problem, but the movement in the game is realy bad for this. tried 3 different controllers and keyboard also, it didnt make any difference)

on the other hand, the soundtrack is mostly pretty nice, the graphics for that type of game is decent (i didnt like the maze struktures, even the most towns are mazes) the combat system works for me, even if its slow paste. the characters are well done and the story also. but at the end its pretty basic and missing some depth.

Pontos Positivos 

- Visual Cativante
- Trilha Sonora Excelente
- Ótima História
- Todo em Português
- Bons personagens, personalidades bem distintas e convincentes 
- Dificuldade ''um pouco amarga'' para aqueles que não estão acostumados com jogos do gênero, não é nada impossível, mas o jogo não lhe dará tudo de mão beijada

 Pontos Negativos

- Muitos combates aleatórios(Recomendo aos futuros jogadores que entrem em ''opções'' e alterem a taxa de encontro de inimigos que estará em 1x para 1/2 ou 1/4, eu joguei com 1/2, ficou muito menos irritante deste modo, lembrando que você é livre para mudar esta taxa a qualquer momento de seu jogo)
- Progressão de personagens um pouco lenta
- Falta de dicas durante o jogo, ficará perdido em alguns momentos
- Vale ressaltar que estes pontos negativos transcritos até o momento podem ter sidos colocados propositalmente pelos criadores, afinal é um jogo recente (2010) e foi totalmente inspirado pelos jogos clássicos da década de 90 do mesmo gênero, isto inclui os pontos positivos desses jogos e os ''negativos'' tais como lhes falei 
- Pouco variedade de inimigos, isto realmente me incomodou no jogo, em vários momentos eu fiquei perdido e acabei sendo ''bombardeado'' por inimigos no mapa, os mesmos inimigos todas as vezes, o que mudava era a quantidade de inimigos, mas eram sempre os mesmos, salvo uns 2 ou 3 diferentes que apareciam ocasionalmente 

Conclusão

Pier Solar é uma bela homenagem aos clássicos jrpgs, não fica nem um pouco atrás das consagradas franquias do passado e vale a pena cada centavo gasto na sua compra. Talvez seja o título mais fácil de recomendar para os retrogamers que buscam um bom JRPG. Todo em português e com ótimos gráficos, o jogo pode parecer convidativo, para novatos, mas só parece. Pier Solar é uma aventura extensa com um grau de dificuldade alto, exatamente o que os gamers das antigas procuram.",1489927358,1563456942,True,4,0,0.557471275329589844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

É um jogo de nicho, para fãs desse gênero (outros jogadores talvez achem ""Pier Solar"" chato). Bons gráficos e música, além de uma história que vai sendo descoberta aos poucos. Também gostei muito do trio de protagonistas.
E não é feito em RPG Maker!
Experimente jogar! Vale a pena!",1484795716,1494981264,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Negativpunkte: 

- Man erhält nur alle 2 Levelups mehr HP bzw. MP
- Nicht nur jedes Kampfgebiet ist ein Labyrinth,  sondern auch jede Stadt(!) Das stört irgendwann stark.
- Nervige Minispiele! Es gibt Minispiele die man bestehen muss, um die Story fortzusetzen. Ich will hier nicht spoilern aber ab da habe ich das Spiel nicht weitergespielt, weil es einfach zu nervig war.

Positive Aspekte:

- Ich finde die Story unterhaltsam, auch wenn viele Reviews das hier anders sehen.


Insgesamt kann man sagen dass das Spiel wohl nur für Leute interessant ist, die mit den negativen Punkten leben können.  Wenn ich mir anschaue dass ich laut Steamarchivements weiter gespielt habe als 97% der Spieler und es trotzdem nicht durchgespielt habe, kann man sich denken dass es vlt 1% der Käufer durchspielen.

However, should one turn off the encounters they would have to, at some point, do some extremely heavy grinding in order to reach a level for some bosses as they get progressively stronger.

The HD music is lovely to listen to.  They put detail into bringing it up to remake specs.

However, one thing must be pointed out for this: Money will be a necessity and will also take lots of time to collect.

First off, the time shown is wrong. I have at least 100+ hours in this game totally. Second off, let me mention the minor bugs with this game and the one bad one.

The worst bug is the Zephyr map bug. I wrote a short walkthrough that may bypass this bug. Please check the guide page for it or below. As for the other bugs, there minor and do not effect the gameplay very much. One of the minor bugs it has is the disappearing menu wheel, which happens sometimes during battles. The way to fix it is just push esc or some other button on your keyboard. This is probably has to do with the joypad on your pc.

Now, my Main review of this game pro's and con's:

PRO's:

`Interesting Storyline
`Unique Characters
`Skills and weapons differ for each characters
`Side quests!
`Mini Games!
`Some bosses have their own theme music
`A hardcore RPG. Some towns don't even have healing in them, and are few and far in between.
`Side Areas that are not relevant to the story, but are fun to explore!

Con's:

`Grinding for levels and repition of this type...
`The storyline waits till practically at the end to actually tell you what the heck is going on..
`Some bugs effect gameplay, mostly small, but one big one at Zephyr map was game breaking..
`Sometimes it takes awhile for the characters to ""talk"" in the game and you have awkward pauses at some points
`No hints on what to do next...but as i said above, hardcore RPG. It does not hold your hand...this is not really a negative to me, but i know alot of people will want this, so  i put it in con's for that reason..I actually like the exploring aspect of games like this and how you figure out stuff on the map yourself.

Final Thoughts:
All in all, a great example of a classic RPG from the late 1980's and early 1990's. Also, this maybe a harder rpg than younger people are used to nowadays. This is how the rpg's i played as were young, so now you know how easy the games are nowadays, you young people! This game does not hold your hand. It does have a tutorial library in the 1st village (like FF games).",1468099530,1488000639,True,17,0,0.697553813457489014,3,True,False,False,False,,,

個人的には懐かしい感じがして好きですが、宝箱の数が多すぎる(取りにくい取りずらい)、ヒントが少ないなど不満も結構あります。

[h1] ゲーム内容 [/h1]

ストーリーは王道で、システム等は、エンカウント率が高い、結構シビアな戦闘、ルーラ系の魔法がないと書いてしまうと酷いように思えるが、設定で戦闘中の速度やエンカウント率の上げ下げなども設定で可能なので、探索やレベル上げなどは上手く使っていけば楽です。

戦闘はギャザーと呼ばれるシステムがあり、ドラクエなどのテンションのようなシステムで、貯めることによってダメージや魔法の回復などの効果があがる最大５まで貯められる、スキルや魔法によってはギャザーが溜まってないと使えないなどもある、敵から攻撃を受けるとギャザーを減らされたり、自分のギャザーを仲間に分け与えるなどもあり、これを上手く使っていくことが戦闘の醍醐味である。

日本語翻訳もされてはいるが、例で例えると　世界せいふくみたいな感じが多い、意味などはちゃんと翻訳されているが漢字の変換などがこのような感じ、しかも魔法やスキルは効果の説明がない上に英語表記なので私みたいに英語がわからない人間だと使ってみるまで効果がわからないような事もあります。

[h1] 個人的に思った事や感想 [/h1]

なんか懐かしい感じがするJRPGで、仲間の駆け引きなども楽しめた、仲間全員短気っていうのも珍しいかもしれない。
個人的にはすごい名作とかではないが、SFCの頃のRPGなどが好きなら楽しめると思う、セールにでも気になったら買うのもいいかもしれません。

Der ursprüngliche Reiz des Pier Solar-Projekts war es ja Sammlern von Sega Mega Drive-Modulen eine Freude zu machen und diesen Zweck hat das Projekt ja auch mit Bravour erfüllt, wie man am reißenden Absatz der Module sehr gut erkennen kann. Leider bleibt bei der Retro-Sammelwut wohl wenig Platz für den eigentlichen Spielspaß. Dieser bleibt in diesem Spiel nämlich auf der Strecke. Pier Solar and the Great Architects ist zwar kein wirklich schlechtes JRPG geworden, ein guter Titel ist aber definitiv ebenso wenig dabei herausgekommen. Die zahlreichen Macken dieses Homebrew-Spielchens sägen viel zu sehr am Geduldsfaden.
Wenn man das Spiel, trotz allem, dennoch unbedingt zocken will, dann sollte man wenigstens auf einen Sale oder ein Bundle-Angebot warten, denn der Steam-Vollpreis ist mal wieder viel zu hoch angesetzt. Sogar professionelle JRPG's von Square-Enix und Falcom sind entweder günstiger zu haben oder nur 1-2 Euro teurer.


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- schöne selbsterstellte Grafiken und OST, die zudem in verschiedenen Stilen und Qualitätsstufen eingestellt werden können
- bietet die Möglichkeit die Zufallskampfraten nach eigenen Vorstellungen einzustellen oder sogar zu deaktivieren
- die Grundidee hinter der Story, also das, was es mit dem ominösen Pier Solar auf sich hat, ist sehr interessant und originell, aber …
- das Spielprinzip ist im Kern grundsolide und gewohnt unterhaltsam, aber …

Kontra:
- die Handlung braucht sehr lange um in die Gänge zu kommen. In den ersten drei Spielvierteln erfährt man nicht, worum es hier eigentlich geht
- eher uninteressante Charaktere
- harte Themen und zweifelhafter Humor wirken in diesem Spiel völlig fehl am Platz
- fast jede Levelkarte im Spiel ist als Labyrinth konzipiert, was manchmal sehr nerven kann
- die Kämpfe sind viel zu träge
- einige Rätsel und Minigames entpuppen sich als störende Stolperfallen
- weitere Detailmacken (unübersichtliches Inventar, HP und MP werden nur alle zwei Level-Ups verbessert, Probleme durch sehr linearen Spielaufbau, …)

It's absolutely a game which seeks to capture a simpler time in RPG history--games like Lunar for the SegaCD, and Final Fantasy IV for the Super Nintendo come to mind. This early-'90s period is my favorite for the RPG genre, and I still regularly play my old favorites from 1989 - 1994 via emulation. It's great to have a ""new"" game that hits the same notes, albeit, with some more panache in the graphics department.

Speaking of the new ""HD"" graphics, I have to say they are beautiful, and stylistically a good match to the pixel art of the 16-bit graphics set of this game, however, they often get in the way of my gameplay. I've gotten in the habbit of enabling the HD graphics for towns and then disabling them for dungeons because the pathways in dungeons are a lot harder to see with the paint-over versions of those backgrounds. This is even after the recent ""pathway decluttering"" that I see touted in the update notes.

In the case of both the 16-bit and ""HD"" graphics, pathways could still be a lot clearer, and there could be fewer obstacles to pathways around towns, etc. It's frustrating to realize that my character can't move forward because he is blocked by a flower, etc. There are also rare instances where a tile of the game is set to non-passable even though it is clearly a pathway tile, same as others in a series. Those instances are rare, and not hard to find my way around, but it's frustrating to navigate. Disabling the ""auto-corner"" behavior of characters actually made controls a lot easier for me. It used to be so frustrating that they'd hit a corner and then slip around it to someplace I didn't intend. If I had my ultimate way with things, I'd remove auto-cornering as a default behavior and clear a lot of obstacles from paths that are supposed to be passable. I think in that way I'd take this awesome game from a 80% enjoyment level to something like a 95%. The frustration in those cases I describe is not necessary, and doesn't seem like an intentional gameplay element.

Battles are pretty fun. I really like the ""Gather"" mechanic, as a whole. I like that characters can take and send each other's ""Gather"" energy as well. Leveling takes a while, but I'm okay with that. My old faves were also something of a grind.

Character art is definitely on tone for the period. I'm a fan of the '90s anime look, and the character art in Pier Solar hits that look very well, most of the time. The cinematic artist seems to have some hangups around cloth drapery and anatomy that rear up and get distracting from time to time, but I wouldn't have hired a different artist. I think the tone is dead-on and the little foibles are forgivable when they happen. I had some of the same misgivings about some of the cinematics in the original Lunar game for SegaCD. Interestingly, the pixel art versions of these assets seem to work better, as a whole.

The soundtrack by Zable Fahr, Tulio Adriano, and Tiido Priimägi is another case where I really appreciate the work that has gone into the ""HD"" version, akin to a CD audio soundtrack on a CD-ROM game, but there are times when I miss the crispness of the FM console synth version. There are times when the CD audio version sounds a little mushy where I don't think it's intentional.

This is all stuff you only really notice when you LOVE a game, so I'm pretty sure I LOVE 'Pier Solar and the Great Architects.' I intend to play it all the way through to the end.

It's easy to nitpick a game like this and hold it up against games built by much larger teams with a lot more money. That's a testament to how well Pier Solar hits that bar, even though it was largely a labor of love. That Kickstarter money they got was not at all a decent budget for a game of this scope, with all the intended target platforms. I'm glad we have the game, as is, on Steam.

Sadly, I forgot to post it until now. Anyway, this will be a spoiler-free review of the game so that I can give people the idea of what I like and disliked about it.
 
[b] Characters:[/b]  The characters have a plausible niche that feels like actual professions: One character is a botanist, another an inventor, and the last one is can read ancient scriptures due to living an archeologist life-style.  It is a bit refreshing to see such simple roles come to use during the game's narrative. Not just that, but the dialogue exchanged between the characters has a feel good tone to it.  In fact, even when you get a Game Over, the character dialogue exchange during the event put a smile to my face. It feels like the characters have life to them and you can tell that they've been best friends since childhood.
 
[b] Gameplay:[/b]  So this is a love and hate for me. Let me go over the parts that I liked: The tutorial on how to battle was rather neat. I like the fact that the trainer gets you started in learning how the battle occurs. The 'gather' system is pretty unique in terms of being able to use spells and it is cool that you can pass it to your friends so that they can use their skill quickly. I like how you have an indication if your attack is good against enemies in the air or the ground. It is a nice change of pace for RPGs to know if you can strike in the air or not.  However, I will go over the gripes: [i] These are not intuitive in finding it.[/i]  Now, I think that may have been purposefully set so that you explore as the character, so I can overlook that. What I cannot overlook is the fact that it was not intuitive to know where or how the save point exists. There is a little pot somewhere that I found as the save point by chance. There was nothing that gave me the introduction to the save point or the concept of it. Again, I found that by chance, so that was a bit more annoying.
 
[b] Gripes:[/b]  Cues/transitions. There are points where the game lacks it to where it gets annoying. Particular parts that I see are when people join the team, you don't get a cue when you are able to move again. One of the others are in various scenes, it feels like it ends abruptly. It's like you're expecting something to happen, but then the shift is '...Wait, that's it?' which I am not sure if it's because the transition needs to be slower or what. However, these are personal gripes.

[b] Overall:[/b]  I enjoy the game and I recommend people to snag it. Give it a chance, you may like it.

When I recommend a game, I typically recommend it based on how well it meets it's advertised hype.  After all, that's usually what convinces you to buy a game.  If the game doesn't live up to that hype, then you were cheated out of your money.

Pier Solar, while not a terrible game, doesn't live up to that hype.

The biggest hype of Pier Solar is that it is a port of a Genesis/Megadrive game.  Forget it, that has no factor here.  The graphics have all been updated so it looks like any other decent RPG Maker game.  The story never was up to snuff of genesis RPGs.  The FM based sound is the only thing that's left, but it's not on by default, so I guess even the developers didn't think that you would prefer the 16-bit version.

So the graphics are decent.  I don't need to explain that because there are screenshots, what you see is what you get.  But what's wrong with the story?  Well, I don't know entirely because I haven't played the whole thing, but after 6 hours I'm not sure if I want to play through the whole thing.  There has been zero real motivation.  The first chapter has been about finding a plant to heal the main's dad.  That's decent motivation for the characters, but I just met these people and have no reason to feel involved.  That part's over, so then they introduced a door that teleports you to a green room, we went to Pakistan, and now there are some furries.  That's neat, but there's nothing compelling about any of it.  Our heros are just exploring out of passing curiosity, just like me, and I don't think I have the stamina that they do.  Speaking of heros, I've spent 6 hours with the same 3 people and I don't dare try to spell their names without looking it up.  They are not compelling characters.  They are all young scientists who are good with weapons and magic.  If they could change weapon/element types, they might as well have been all the same character.  JRPG's are supposed to be deep and compelling, and that hasn't happened yet.

Everything else is pretty typical.  The battle system has a neat ""gather"" feature which acts as a multiplier while fighting.  Required for certain spells.  That's the only thing that seems worth mentioning.  Battles are actually rather simplistic because you can't seem to share elemental powers between characters.  Eg: fire based weapons are only available for the fire based character.  The overworld also has the typical ""get stuck on corners/can't tell what is or isn't a wall"" features that you expect from RPG Maker games.

You can't expect Phantasy Star out of every retro tribute game, and WaterMelon made a lot of effort for a comparable 16-bit game.  Without the 16-bit hardware, however, Pier Solar is just another of the many fan made RPGs on Steam.",1439746342,1439746342,False,2,1,0.39470374584197998,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So this is also a review in progress, so to speak. 

Pier Solar is essentially a mixed bag. It's a decent story with some awkward writing here and there, and it has a really lovely tileset (in most places) with atrocious layout. One of my issues with this game is some dungeons or towns just aren't straight forward enough. They feel to... maze-y. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just in most towns, when you barely know where your going, that causes problems. It doesn't help that in some cases, it's hard to tell where you can and can't walk. As I said though, the tile sets themselves are lovely.

Which brings us to another point. The tilesets are nice looking. the enhanced rendered visuals... not so much. The rendered version makes the background look like they were made in photoshop or illustrator, which would not be bad, had the characters themselves matched visually. But to be honest, it's sometimes harder to tell whats going on in the visuals with the rendered backgrounds. With the pixel art, it just pops out more. 

Story as I said isn't bad. I won't say anything on it, but I will say that some instances feel just as a matter of fact. One character joins because he/she just feels bad for you. Come on. And it's delivery (as far as I am anyway) just doesn't surprise. It's all extremely predictable.

The battles take forever... There is a system where you can charge up your energy to make attacks more powerful, but that takes up one full turn, and it opens you up to enemy attack. The saving grace is you can share your energy with your team mates, so that makes their attack even more powerful if everyone gives one to said team mate. The saving grace for that is there is a set up where you can turn off random encounters. I do this for exploring the dungeon, and grabbing chests. I use the battle system on mechanic strictly for grinding. 

All in all, dispite how much of this game gets on my nerves, I still really like this game. I think it's mainly for the fact that I am bias towards 16bit style JRPGs. So I am going to recommend this game, but ONLY if you are a purist towards that style of game.",1439185506,1439185506,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Zu den Kämpfen kann man sagen, dass es zwar Zufallskämpfe sind, was in einigen Spielen richtig nerven kann, sie aber in einem angenehmen Abstand stattfinden. Zudem hat man die großartige Möglichkeit, die Rate dieser Kämpfe zu beeinflussen. Von gar keine Kämpfe bis mehrfache Rate ist alles in schönen Schritten möglich. Wenn man in einem Gebiet ist, in dem die Gegner nichts mehr taugen schaltet man sie aus. Hat man einen guten Platz zum Grinden/Leveln gefunden, setzt man die Gegner hoch.

I had been looking forward to playing Pier Solar ever since I first heard about the game, so I was glad to see a digital version available for purchase on Steam.

It's not a matter of taste or me just not liking the style---I'll give anything the benefit of the doubt and I would continue to do so for Pier Solar, but I just can't go on.

Here's what's wrong with the game:
1.  The game freezes often.
2.  There are input problems when playing with a controller.  The developer suggested fix did nothing to help.
3.  The combat system is awful and battle times can be measured in minutes (usually 2 or 3 for every battle).
4.  The design of the maps is terrible.  Everything--including the towns--is like a maze.
5.  Often, there are concealed paths or platforms behind what is visible to you on the screen.
6.  The story moves at such a glacial pace that at 6 hours in, I still don't know what it is about.
7.  Nothing in the game seems to fit together stylistically.  There is a real lack of cohesion and everything feels off.

I didn't believe the negative reviews when I read them, because most of the points sounded minor on paper.  They really aren't.  Please learn from my mistake and avoid wasting your money on this game.  It is both frustrating and lifeless.

Good features:
+ Stylish graphics, switch between HD or classic 16 bit look
+ Great music, also able to switch to Sega Genesis sound
+ Quick to get you into the game, very fun upbeat story
+ Compatible with many controllers, even my SNES one!
+ Adjustable encounter rate: fight more or no enemies at all
+ Adjustable combat speed: great for when you're just training

Unappealing features:
- Steam overlay is bugged. Will move/select when typing.
- The controls can be strange. Not game breaking.*

* Holding a directional key seems to disable the use/talk button in the middle of dialog. When using a heal spell out of combat, there is a strange quirk where I have to hit the up button to scroll left, but the right button to scroll to the right. This is incredibly minor.
ALSO if you do have controller issues, right click the game on steam, go to properties, set launch options, and write dxjoy. This might make your controller more compatible. Be sure to map buttons once ingame of course.

I'd like to add that games of this nature are very rare. The HD graphics have incredible, well-detailed environments with some classic 16 bit sprites mixed in. It's a timeless work of art; these visuals don't age and are very pleasant to look at. Give the demo a try if you are interested, and take into account that the bad reviews are only from a handful of people. If more people decided to try this game out, the ratings would likely go way up. In an oversaturated indie market, where some of the most lazy looking, blocky games are highly praised, I find it hard to accept that Pier Solar gets hardly any attention; it provides beautiful visuals, great music, a lovely story and classic RPG mechanics that are both intuitive and pretty satisfying.

おそらくこれ以前かどうかで評価が大きく変わると思います。

このアップデート以前にプレイしたわけではないので正しいかわかりませんが、
・敵のエンカウント率を0から8倍まで自由に変更可
・バトルスピードを最大4倍まで高速化するオプション追加
・クリア後にレベル、装備、一部を除くアイテムを引き継いでニューゲームが出来る（つよくてニューゲーム）
これらが出来るようになってたので比較的快適に遊ぶことができました。
上記のアップデートを踏まえてのレビューは以下の通りです。
-----------------------------------------------------------------

HDリメイク化によりマップやキャラの顔画像を16Bitモード、HDモードと切り替えられるようになっています。
HDマップは息を呑むほど綺麗で素晴らしく、16Bitの方はノスタルジックな雰囲気があってこっちも好きです。
個人差があるとは思いますがHDマップの方は明暗がはっきりあるためか見え辛い箇所があるのが気になったので、私は一周目は16Bitモード、二周目はHDモードでプレイしました。
BGMも良質でFM音源とPCM音源で変更可です。

戦闘はオーソドックスなターン制に「ギャザー」というゲージシステムが加わったタイプです。
ギャザーは自分で溜めるほかに、味方から貰ったりアイテムを使って溜めることができます。
ギャザーを溜めることで攻撃倍率が上がったり強力な技を使用できるようになるので、その辺りのやりくりで戦略を考えることが可能です。
戦闘バランスは割とシビアなので装備などもしっかり考えないとあっさり全滅する場合も。

昔のJRPGによくありがちなミニゲームもいくつかあります。
ストーリーを進める事で開放される物と隠しアイテムを手に入れる事で開放される物があり、中には某爆弾男とそっくりなミニゲームが存在しているなどクスっとくる要素もあります。

ただしゲームシステムなどもレトロな部分が多いため不満な点もあります。
・オート戦闘はあるがそのAIが賢くないため手動でやったほうが早く殲滅できる場合が殆ど
・移動中に回復魔法を使用するにも演出がありそれが結構長い
・魔法やアイテム、装備の説明が不足がち
・終盤でダンジョンの出口にワープする機能を使うと進行不能になる場合あり
これらの点も今後のアップデートでもしかしたら解消されるかもしれません。


昔のRPGの良い部分悪い部分を両方併せ持ったゲームだと思います。
今風の親切設計なゲームじゃなければ嫌だっていう人にはお勧めできませんが、レトロなJRPGが好きでたまらないっていう人にとってはお勧めできるゲームです。

For some who want mainly Role-Playing aspects, meh, fine. But you should really make it versatile to allow skipping so people who don't care about the story can skip it. Even being forced to read all of the dialogue, the controls are gimmicky and probably one of the weakest choices for assignment I've seen, paired with nothing but story line to go off of for early progression. You don't need a tutorial, just literally like one minor hint as to what to do would be enough, rather than just hoping to accidentally figure it out. 

I am only interested in combat, so my review is based strictly on that. As of yet, I have experienced no combat in the first 15 minutes, which instantly makes me lose interest. There are two kinds of players, Role Players and Combatants, and some are both. Your game is too based on Role Playing that you lose 50% of your player base simply because you don't introduce combat early on. Many RPG games such as this begin the game with a Role Play scenario of a combat scene, giving both players a taste of what they're interested in. But, this game, you forego that and completely lose us Combatants by a slow and bland story line that we cannot skip to hope to get to combat sooner. I really want to see how combat plays out, but it honestly is not even worth getting there with how crappy the story is. If it was able to be skipped, and gave a quick 10-second hint at how to play, then it would be golden. About one day of work and you effectively increase your player population by double. But, obviously that isn't worth it, or the developer's didn't care enough and just wanted a Role Playing game. 

TL;DR:
If you enjoy slow Role-Playing story-based games, you may be interested
If you enjoy combat in RPGs, save your money, but more importantly your time. 15 minutes into a game and no combat is too long. I feel like I just read the Terms and Conditions for a game before I even logged in.

1. No pdf manual, no ingame explanation of things. I should not have to google or pay 50 bucks simply to understand the basics of the game, this is idiotic. 
2. No way to speed up text and the text has an annoying delay inbetween every dialogue box.
3. No way to speed up things you have already been through.
4. The quickly annoying beep inbetween every dialogue box. 
5. Why so much delay when finishing a battle? It seems that you made it so you hear the full song after a battle which gets old quick especially when the end of a battle takes longer than the battle itself.
6. Randomly getting coins or bars means little when you have no idea how much you got from a chest or what their value is.
7. What is with the 10 on items?(this is where basic tooltips, ingame explanations or a basic manual come in handy)

Now I am not bashing the whole game, but it does lack polish in areas. What it does great though is:

1. The script and characters are well done.
2. The game is beautiful.
3. The maps and the world are designed well.
4. The battle system while not unique works well.

It managed to captivate me in the way RPGs did in my youth.  I honestly didn't think I was going to enjoy it that much.

A few notes:
- Battles are reminiscent of Lunar both in the way of style and challenge.  Areas can seem gimmicky and lack variety in fights up until a boss or change of region, however.
- Sound is wonderful and fitting of the game's environments and mood.  Perfectly done in Genesis style.  The HD music is even better.
- The options to swap between original graphics and HD, as well as original and HD sound are nice.  
- Without listing all the reasons, I feel the game has some replay value (I can see 1 or 2 more playthoughs in the future for mehself).  Obviously I'm not looking at it with nostalgia goggles either.
- The characters are likeable, which is good due to the fact you'll be spending quite a few hours with them.

Overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.  There's not too many great RPGs on the Genesis, so this game is  welcomed by me.  I'd even go as far as to place it at my number three spot of favorite Genesis RPGs, falling short of only Phantasy Star IV and Shining Force II.  If you're a fan of those titles and also Lunar, then definitely try to pick it up if ya see it on sale, and give it a shot.

As a JRPG and RPG fanatic in general, I just can't justify telling people to go out and purchase or bother wasting their time playing this game because frankly, you're not missing out on anything at all.

I'm not going to spoil any plot points in this review, but I will be spoiling elements of the game play and areas so you'll understand my frustrations.

[h1]Plot[/h1]

It's a fairly standard JRPG plot, it doesn't do anything remotely new or interesting and brings nothing to the table. Same old tired cliches you've seen before but I suppose they were just trying to recreate that nostalgia and archetype's from the golden years of gaming. The three mains are likable enough but the rest of the cast is just kind of there and I didn't really connect with their personalities or designs. The villains are standard garbage stereotypes, not even going to bother getting in to it... They rip off just about every Final Fantasy game in existance, which is just another testament to how unoriginal and uninspired it is.

[h1]World Map / Game Structure / Pacing[/h1]

This game's structure and pacing is a bit of an oddity as it just decides to switch up the formula about half way through. For the first half of the game you basically choose destinations by pressing left or right on the d-pad and it will cycle through the available locales. At about the half way mark the developers just decided to start linking all the dungeons and towns together so it all becomes one giant clusterfuck of a maze. 

So you'll get a formula of Town - Dungeon - Side Town - Dungeon - Main Town - Side Dungeon Under Town - Warp to an entirely unrelated area with no way of going back - rinse and repeat for the rest of the game.

It becomes rather tiresome at the 90% mark when you have to walk through previously explored area's just so you can backtrack to pick up items you couldn't access before. There is a warp device given to you late in the game but it doesn't really help, it just allows you access to the previous ""chapters"" of the game that all seem to be separated by islands that are no longer linked together and must be accessed separately.

The worst feature of the warp device is that you can't just call upon it whenever you feel like, like the airship from Final Fantasy or the Flamme Drum from Secret of Mana... No you actually have to walk ALL the way back to the device and touch it on some arbitrarily placed square on one of the sides of it (it's different in each area) in order to continue on with the game.

This is what I'm talking about when I say the game requires A LOT of polish... Something this important shouldn't be overlooked... It's an essential part of the gameplay and it's confusing and obnoxious as hell to figure out due to lazy programming.

[h1]Completionist's Nightmare / Cryptic Secrets / Poor NPC placement [/h1]

If you're one of those people who enjoy getting 100% completion rates in RPG's... just forget it. There isn't a solid guide on the web because this game is such a sleeper cult game... I can't even use the word ""hit"" in there because I don't even think it reached those kinds of sales numbers. 

Either way, all the secrets in this game are cryptic and obnoxious, invisible walls with zero tells... just start walking in to everything and hope you find something. There are treasure chests in unreachable places that MUST be opened with a spell from a distance... I found this was a major design flaw because some chests I didn't even bother walking to, I would just open them through walls. I found this to be incredibly lame and lazy.

There are hidden dungeons and items, most of which are missable and you can never return to. There are side quests hidden all over the place as well and some won't even open up until certain points in the plot which can be rather annoying... You could talk to everyone in the city but after you trigger a main plot event, the people you talked to could have a quest for you to embark on but you've missed it under the assumption those characters were just background objects filling the cities.

There's also a side quest and a main quest in this game where they place an important NPC against the same coloured backdrop so it's nearly impossible to spot it unless you literally stop in your tracks and scan the area with your eyes... It's probably because of how quickly the game moves when your characters are running... The Genesis was notorious for creating blurred backgrounds due to it's ""superior blast processing"" >.< LOL.... what a joke.

Just be warned that you'll most likely never find everything in the game, I know I missed a dungeon and I couldn't return back to it because they give you a single opportunity to access it. I missed a side quest some where as well... and quite possibly a shop... even though I was incredibly thorough.

[h1]Glitched achievements[/h1]

I found all the master keys, never got the achievement for doing so... even though I opened all 8 treasure chests with the ultimate gear. This leads me to believe the ""Shop-a-Holic"" achievement is also glitched, among some others. Again, more polish required.

[h1]Battle System / Battle Pacing[/h1]

Terrible... just a terrible battle system. You have to ""charge up"" like Goku from DBZ so your characters can multiply their pitiful damage output and you have to have a full ""gather"" meter to use some of the best spells. If you so much as get hit before your turn comes up, you lose 1 gather and the spell is rendered ineffective. Your character will then miss their turn and spin around like a jack ass as to symbolize that they're confused. AWFUL DESIGN. 

There's still hope though, you can give away your gather to other party members to help them use their OP attacks but at the cost of missing another characters turn for that round and what's worse, it's all or nothing... You can't just give away 1 or 2 gather... NOPE, you have to give away ALL of it... 

So for example, a character requires 5 gather to use an ultimate special attack but the character only has 4, you can then request gather from another party member. However in the likely event that the member that you're requesting from has 5 gather... well you then proceed to steal all of it instead of just using some basic math... because apparently in this game 5 - 1 = 0.   :/    DUMB.

You'll get in to fights every 15 steps... Considering every dungeon in this game is a convoluted maze of eye tricks and illusionary walls, it's just an awful and frustrating mix. There's a spell that helps you avoid fights but it's literally only for about 45 steps and BAM, another fight. This means every 40 or so steps you have to recast the spell and watch some obnoxiously slow spell animation taking place... What ever happened to a symbol appearing next to your character's portrait to show you have some kind of spell effect active? Like come on... 

For a game made for a system with ""blast processing"" it's the slowest and most annoyingly paced JRPG I've ever played in my life... I think I'd rather play Final Fantasy Anothology on the PSX with the shitty menu load times than have to deal with how this game's mechanics work. I'm not even going to talk about that menu that shows up every round of battle... oh wait, I just did... jesus man.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]

It's a failed attempted at bringing a game as epic as Final Fantasy VI to the Sega Genesis platform and it just misses the mark on every single attempt... The game had a cool concept and appealing artwork but it ends there... Genesis was never a system for RPG's and I can see why now...

Unfortunately, due to many reasons I missed the opportunity to play original Sega Genesis release (as many of us too, I believe) and was pretty excited to hear that Pier Solar will be coming to more platforms, including PC, and even with enhanced graphics and CD-quality soundtrack! ""Now, that's pretty awesome chance to finally get to play this game"", I thought, and when it hit the Steam — the game was bought without a second thinking. Now, when the game is cleared, it is a good time to sum up my experience with it.

First of all, Pier Solar is a good game. I will not be original here, but if titles like Lunar Silver Star Story, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV-VI make echoes of nostalgic tremble in your hearth, then you should get Pier Solar. It has many qualities of a great game - wonderful characters, beautiful graphics and soundtrack, interesting story and an old-school JRPG charm.

You will be getting many random encounters with enemies (sometimes too many, he-he :D), looking for a treasure chests, crawl dungeons and oppose bosses. There's a bunch of fun dialogs out there, so keep talking with NPCs. Be aware that some of them have two and even three versions of replies to you, and sometimes it is necessary to talk with them three times to get an item or trigger some event.

Now for the part that is not so good with Pier Solar. There's a few flaws in the game that may poison your experience - nothing too major, but still the game would be definitely better without them.

Sometimes you will get stuck.

First of all, the environment design sometime will get you wondering where you should go. Yes, maze-like maps is classic for a JRPG, but there's more than that to well-designed map. I often caught myself missing the path to the next location or route to another area of current map just because it was looking like there's nothing interesting (dead end). Be prepared that if you feel that you got stuck and there's nowhere to go next - you should look more carefully for a path. Oh, and there's hidden paths inside the walls. Sometimes. Somewhere.

Second, the directions from the storytelling could be better. When you finish your quest in current location and should move to the next area, there was times for me when it was not so clear from the dialogs where should I go and what to do next. Most of the times you should just go to the next area, but there's few exceptions from this rule. Maybe I'm just getting too old...

Third, the Sanctuary and the damned platform behind the pillar. Seriously, I will be making a small spoiler here, but when you will get stuck at this point in Sanctuary (couple of hours from the start of the game), look for a moving platform that is hiding behind the pillar near the room entrance ladder. I do not understand what was the point of making such design decision, but I'm taking it as a bad idea.

In general, ""getting stuck"" was the most annoying thing that happened to me with Pier Solar. When you wander from corner to corner of the map and face endless random encounters, getting ambushed often and the game is not so quick in its battle system - it is not long when you will get bored from it. My advice is such — don't hesitate to look for a guide or ask a question in forums, you will get much more pleasuring experience from this game actually progressing through the story, and not from lurking in forest or dungeon.

Well, that's about it. I can recommend this game to any fan of JRPG genre.

[b]Some tips for the game that may be useful:[/b]

[list][*] There's a detailed walkthrough by Tim Maurer at GameFAQs for this game. As was mentioned above, I advise to everyone who got stuck to take a peek on it (just in case :D).

[*] If you played Pier Solar on Sega Genesis you may notice minor differences with this version. Same goes for the Tim Maurer's walkthrough — it was written for Genesis version of Pier Solar and contain very minor differences with PC version (you should get the Beaver in the forest).

[*] There's nothing inside the regular barrels and crates (apart from very few hidden items in some special places), do not waste your time on them.

[*] Some walls can have hidden paths, look at the radar and to edges of the screen - if there's some graphics ""in the middle of nowhere"", most likely you can walk behind the wall to get there.

[*] Sell unnecessary items (primary weapon and armor). The inventory system is very basic and you don't need a mess there.

[*] Metal and Gold Coins, blocks, etc. is money. Do not look for them in your inventory, after finding something like this in a treasure chest it will just add to your wallet.

[*] You will get new spells at higher levels. Some spells can be learned only from the books.

[*] Look for the accessories that can halve elemental damage, they're very useful.

[*] Have fun and enjoy this game! :)

JRPGを参考にしているターン制バトルの作品です。
絵が綺麗になり、BGMは中々良いです。

ギャザーという力溜めのようなシステムがあり、
後衛の仲間が力を溜めて前衛に渡すといった戦略も行えます。

個人的にはSteamではマイナージャンルという事で
相当甘い評価をつけたいところですが……
正直、あまり快適に遊べる作品とは言えません。
初期のSFCの無名メーカーが作ったようなRPGです。

・エンカウント率が高い
・魔法の演出が長い
・大抵ザコ敵は大群で出現
・敵の不意打ち率が高い
・SEに迫力が無い
・何が調べられて何処を歩けるのか分かり難い
・戦闘のファンファーレが終わるまで待機
・オート戦闘が愚鈍
　～　例　～
地上・飛行タイプくらいは反応する
かすり傷程度の仲間にもヒールをかける
意味もなくギャザーを使う
MPがきれると通常攻撃をしないで待機する事がある
一部雑魚相手に連打をしていると防御や回復を繰り返して
全滅しかかっている事がある


移動画面で回復魔法を使うのにも
いちいち長いアニメーションが表示されたり
プレイヤーを快適に遊ばせる工夫が足りません。

ギャザーシステムも魔法の威力を発揮するにも溜め、
全体攻撃を使うにも溜め行動と戦闘のテンポを悪くしているイメージです。

顔グラフィックの間違いや、AI命令の設定を無視したり
バグも多いです。
現在、Steam側の使用言語を日本語にしてプレイをすると
実績がバグって解除されない不具合があるようです。

SteamのプロバティでEnglishにして
ゲーム内で日本語設定にすると実績バグが解除されます。

シナリオの個人的な感想ですが…
一言でいえば主人公が空気に感じました。
あと色々日本人には理解しがたい展開が多いです。
それはそれでサプライズですが。

ノスタルジーに浸りたい方なら有りかもしれません。
それでも1480円は無いです、
セールの時まで待った方が吉だと思います。


～追記～
20時間程度でクリア。
アイテムにERRORという物が出たり
終盤、ダンジョンの出口に移動機能を使うと
別の大陸のダンジョンの出口にワープしてハマッたりテストプレイ不足です。

翻訳も複数人でやっているらしいのですが
翻訳のセンスが凄い時もあれば、日本語でokな会話になったり
出来はまばらな感じです。

The game works fine with the keyboard, but if you do plan on using a controller, I would suggest using the D-pad instead of the thumbsticks just because the movement seems a bit wonky with the thumbsticks.

Also just for anyone wondering, yes there are still black bars.
