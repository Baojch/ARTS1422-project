My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happineass of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

As a visual/interactive novel, this doesn't feature any notable gameplay, it's just a lot of clicking through badly written (and badly voice acted) dialogue that would never have been accepted or published in print, which poses the question, ""How did something this badly written end up on Steam?"".

To answer that question: When someone hoping to become an author is unable to get published in print, they spend $100 and dump their high school fan-fiction onto Steam, under the guise of a game.

This E-book features Choose-Your-Own-Adventure elements where you make some decisions that don't do anything to change the fact this is just an E-Book.  Nobody finished reading a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book and said ""Boy, what a great game I just played!"".   Because E-books aren't games.  And neither is this.

In fairness there's a couple of minigames, but wading through piles of badly written and badly voiced VN trash to find them just isn't worth the effort. 

The artwork here is mediocre at best, it's a hodge-podge of amateurish ""My First Wacom Tablet"" style drawings used instead professional looking game assets.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can create graphical assets properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is lacklustre, it's not a selling point.  While there are options to change the resolution for the E-Book, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the E-Book, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just point and click stuff like a browser/Flash game.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Visual novels/e-books are tedious at best... imagine the best novel you ever read, be that Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Twilight (if you have terrible taste in literature), but then translate that to a format where the words dribble out and you have to click your mouse every time you wanted to read the next sentence, instead of just turning the pages. You'd think it was garbage.

Now imagine that experience, but with much worse writing (because if these guys could write professionally, they'd be published authors and this would be on shelves in bookstores, and they wouldn't have to pay Valve $100 to self-publish this on Steam), and you have your average Steam e-book.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the E-Book is, we can measure the interest in a book by how much people bothered to read it.  MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the E-Book absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for Chapter 1, trivial to achieve, but less than 3 percent of players bothered to read that far before uninstalling the E-Book.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this E-Book was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the E-Book.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 3 percent of players bothered playing the E-Book for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this E-Book to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the E-Book?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this E-Book for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the E-Book just has a couple of players every week running up the E-Book and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate has the cash grab price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  You can get better quality books and comics for free online or from public libraries, or from bookstores for a fraction of the price of this ""game"".  Steam isn't a comic book store, neither is it Netflix, it's for games.  Your gaming rig is not a Kindle.  It's impossible for me to recommend things to PC gamers that aren't really games.

(If the above wording irritated you, you're going to hate the main character. :P For the record, I found her delightful.)

All joking aside, murder mysteries are fun logic puzzles when done right and lend themselves well to the crossover genres of visual/kinetic novel and simple choose-your-path type of story game.

Important ingredients to getting this right are:
[list]
    [*]Correctly organized logical deductions
    [*]Engaging characters
    [*]A plot that gains momentum as it unravels
[/list]

Beyond these things, anything else is really just what each author/dev/artist brings to the table.  Here we have some odd choices and a few tropes, but also a few slightly new twists on some old plots.  It makes for a fun game in testing the intuition of those who have read and solved many a mystery.

For those Dark Souldiers who need a game to beat them up with difficulty, well, this is not hard to beat.  I got every single ending in ~2hrs.  

But the point of these sorts of things is to craft a story and let you feel around in the dark for it, perhaps not so much to test your mettle.  In fact, to the game's credit, I have often found that making murder mysteries ""difficult"" often entails either withholding key evidence (making deductions without blind guessing impossible) or making the plots so convoluted that the logic becomes inherently dubious.  

This story places everything you need somewhere for it to be found.  The time limit is generous, but does provide a little bit of tension so that you feel a sense of urgency in moving things along.  Be true to your thorough natures, my fellow digital detectives, and you will crack the case.  

As a bit of a cake and coffee after serving up justice, you are rewarded with the ability to pursue several ""What if..?"" scenarios, just to see how else the dirty deed might have been done.  However, achievement hunters should not fret as the alternate endings are not required for your 100%.

I went in trying to solve a murder, but in the end, it turns out you can pin the crime on anybody you feel like. I found that really dissatisfying.

I enjoy any type of murder mystery games, this VN did well and I'm quite impressed with the ending. The story starts off with Ms. Fortune, a 9 times widow who was invited to a party thrown by Prince Titanico. Strange enough the castle he invited them to is more like a ruin, but Ms. Fortune didn't mind that and was quite interested in everything during the tour he gave them in the castle. With four other guests with them and a 'butler', Titanico was planning to announce something this night but unfortunately, when the electricity went down, the prince was found dead on the floor, stabbed, and strange enough Ms. Fortune found a dagger in her purse. She decided to solve the mystery herself and gather evedince before the police arrived.

You'll be able to access your inventory and show it as evidence to the people you are talking to, to support your theory. The map is easy to use, just by clicking on where you want to go next from the list, you can keep visiting the areas as many times as you want and search for anything you might use. However if you have chosen to play the 'timed' game it will be different, you'll have to work fast before the police arrive.

There are five suspected people, honestly, I suspected all of them, but I had a strong feeling on three of them, they all do have motives but it is up to you to find the real killer and support your accusation with the right evidence or you'll be the one going to the jail. The game has multiple endings, they are all fun to achieve and watch. 

The story is very well written and fully voiced, the cast did an amazing job, especially Ms. Fortune. I didn't like the artwork much, but everything else in the game makes it a good game to play and enjoy. You can save anywhere and reply your gameplay in case you've missed something.

Pros:
+Interesting story.
+Excellent writing.
+Well-done voice-over (Fully voiced)
+OK soundtracks.
+Multiple endings.
+Manual save.
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
- Average characters design.
- Short

The game is quite short but very well made. The story is interesting, if you enjoy Visual Novels or whodunit mystery games, pick up this one.

[h1]I liked...[/h1]
[list]
[*] The cast (Miss Fortune steals the show as the charismatic anti-hero, other characters also have fun personalities)
[*] The spoken dialogue (the game really comes alive thanks to its brisk script and good voice acting‚Äîit's fully voiced!)
[*] The endings (while the mystery is not very complex, a case can be made against anyone‚Äîand the game lets you run with it, even if you don't uncover the whole truth)[/list]
[h1]I didn't care for...[/h1]
[list]
[*] The confused sensibilites (the high-society private party evokes late 19th/early 20th century, if not for the hacker girl in shorts and crop top)[/list]
[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I enjoyed [i]MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate[/i] for its humor, lively cast and delightful Miss Fortune, which I'd love to see in a sequel or another story. The voice acting really fits and takes the game to the next level, even if the plot itself probably leaves something to be desired to the dedicated Agatha Christie fan. To a more casual player (like myself), I can highly recommend it.

Though it's a bit on the shorter side, it was still a lot of fun. I enjoyed playing as the MC; snark is the best. I also liked how there could be more than one solution to the murder if you put the pieces together well enough. Music and backgrounds were nice, as well as the voice acting. I wouldn't consider it too difficult except for me being unaware that I was missing a couple of pieces of evidence at one point. Yet, I had managed to pin the crimes on at least two people by that point so...not too bad haha. 

My only real complaint is with the character Lia and discrepancies with technology. To me, she ruins the atmosphere of the setting which looks like it's supposed to be set early late 1800s to early 1900s. Her attire looks 21st century, midriff and short shorts whereas the other characters are dressed appropriately for the time setting fancy suits, long dresses etc. She also is using a cellphone to hack email in a place where we are using an old rotary phone. Because, well if she has cellphone, why doesn't everyone else have one? The social elites would probably have the most expensive cellphone available, since they had the best everything and liked to stay ahead of the times. The fact that there's a timed breaker there is also out of place. 

These things don't detract from the fun mystery-- but if you're like me you'll find it a bit jarring immersion wise. Advice for future games is to figure out the setting, if you want an old timey feel or a modern one...Or if a fusion, like steampunk would fit setting wise.

[i] Title: Shadows, Rain, and Virtual Mysteries

[Scene: Ghostly Blues' office, bathed in the soft glow of flickering candles. Rain taps against the windowpanes, creating a soothing melody. Ghostly Blues, a spectral detective with a penchant for the paranormal, sits at his desk, surrounded by ancient tomes and mystical artifacts. Callie Pygian, his sassy and resourceful assistant, lounges nearby, her eyes sparkling with mischief.]

Ghostly Blues: (with a spectral chuckle) Rain, Callie. The city's tears falling from the heavens again.

Callie Pygian: (rolling her eyes playfully) Don't worry, Blues, I've got my trusty umbrella ready to shield us from the storm.

[Ghostly Blues nods appreciatively, then gestures toward a vintage gaming console resting on a nearby table.]

Ghostly Blues: Ever heard of MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate, Callie? They say it's a digital playground of mystery and mayhem.

Callie Pygian: (grinning) Oh, I've heard of it, Blues. It's like a detective novel come to life, with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of suspense.

[They settle in front of the console, the rain outside adding a cozy ambiance to their gaming session.]

[Scene transition: Ghostly Blues and Callie Pygian sit side by side, controllers in hand, as they dive into the virtual world of MMM. The rain outside continues to patter against the window, setting the mood for their adventure.]

Ghostly Blues: (excitedly) This game, Callie! It's like stepping into the pages of a noir novel, complete with shady characters and mysterious plots.

Callie Pygian: (nodding) And the art style! It's like a nostalgic trip back in time, with its charming vintage aesthetic.

[They navigate through the game, solving puzzles and interrogating suspects with a mix of wit and humor.]

Callie Pygian: (laughing) These suspects are as slippery as eels in a rain barrel, Blues!

Ghostly Blues: (chuckling) Indeed, Callie, indeed. But that's what keeps us on our toes, isn't it? The thrill of the chase, even in a virtual world.

[As they progress through the game, their laughter fills the room, blending with the soothing sound of raindrops outside.]

Ghostly Blues: (reflecting) This game, Callie. It's a delightful blend of mystery and humor, a virtual playground for detectives like us.

Callie Pygian: (smiling) MMM: Murder Most Misfortunate gets two thumbs up from me, Blues! It's a virtual rollercoaster of laughs and intrigue.

Ghostly Blues: (nodding) Couldn't agree more, Callie. It's a must-play for anyone who loves a good mystery and a good laugh.

[Fade out as Ghostly Blues and Callie Pygian continue to discuss their favorite moments from the game, their spirits lifted by the simple joy of virtual adventures in the midst of a rainy night.] [/i]

Haven't I heard this story somewhere before?

You play as Miss Fortune - 9 times a widow and as crafty as she is suspicious, it'll be your job to scour the mansion for clues when someone is murdered. What I love about this premise, is that you don't really care if justice is done, you just want to make sure no one pins the murder on you. I do think this concept could have been explored more as it is somewhat unique and exciting to an old genre... perhaps Miss Fortune will have to have another adventure for that one, as I don't think its explored to it's full potential in this one.

I have to admit, the setting and premise for the story are often overdone within the mystery genre; however, sometimes when you write in a genre you write about what you know....and hoo boy, do mystery novel lovers know this setting. That being said, the game is enjoyable and I found it nice to use the ""pacing"" button to let the characters speak, and then just enjoy the delivery of the lines. The voice acting was particularly entertaining, and it paired nicely with the unobtrusive ambient music.

I also couldn't help but feel that there was a little more planned for the story, and parts of it sort of wrapped up in the end.

For example: [spoiler] A certain character is obviously very much in love with another, and I felt it was only given that they fancied them.

All characters lines in the game are voice acted and it's really well done. I hope we'll see more of Miss Fortune (or Sir Prince) in the future.

The high point was definitely the cast, with Miss Fortune in particular having a number of lines that made me crack a smile at her dramatic and cynical comments.

Each character had their own distinctive personality, mannerisms, and motives, which made the multiple endings -one for each potential killer- seem reasonable. I also loved that everyone had their own color scheme, since it reminded me of the iconic house party murder mystery game: Clue.

There were a few things I did not love about the gameplay, mostly with regard to skipping or redundancies. It was somewhat annoying that moving from room to room always had an unskippable panning shot of the room before you could interact with anything, and an option to skip dialogue you had heard previously would be nice. Additionally, interactables in the room were sometimes hard to find or repeated (did we really need the tables in the dining halls to have multiple click points when they all said the same thing?), especially in the dim lighting.

Overall, I was entertained and would recommend it if you like snappy dialogue and murder mysteries that have a bit of humor to them. The price is a little high considering you can get all the endings by reloading a save from just before the accusation phase, but honestly I've paid more for games I've enjoyed less.

As the cast attempts to solve the mystery, a clock ticks down marking the time until the arrival of the police...

The presence of the timer definitely made the game tenser, but I often found myself skipping through the text quickly to finish collecting everything before time ran out. Thankfully, there is the option to disable the timer which allows you to absorb the atmosphere better. The characters are voiced well, and I was delighted to hear the wit of Miss Fortune, her interactions with the high-class Comtessa, and the banter with the rest of the cast.

It was a bit hard to suspend my disbelief at times. The clash of old and new technology felt jarring, and Lia felt out of place, being the only technically inclined person in a very old-fashioned setting. She was able to casually hack the phone company records to figure out who called the house, and would have preferred to hack their private emails if she needed extra information. Technical capability seemed to fluctuate as Miss Fortune seems clueless about wiring and electronics, yet she immediately identifies the timer device and implies that she was able to wire one up in school.

The gameplay was a bit clunky from time to time. Although the backgrounds were clear and conveyed the atmosphere well, some of the interact-able objects were a bit hard to distinguish from the background, further compounded by the fact that you can rotate 360 degrees. Transitioning between rooms takes a bit of time, especially when you go between rooms frequently. When replaying the game to achieve all the endings, I found myself wishing for an auto-skip feature. However, it was nice that the controls were explained clearly and concisely at the very start of the game.

The artstyle was charming, and each character is given a unique color for contrast. I'm not sure what's up with Comtessa's right hand, though. Perhaps she's an amputee from the elbow down.

The highlight of the game is definitely chapter 3, where you can blame anyone and justify it. If you mess up and have the tables turned on you, the game gives you some clues, some of which are misleading. These small hints are beautifully executed.

Despite criticizing aspects of the game, I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys adventure mystery games.

You should play this game...
-if you are curious about the interactive novel genre; this is a short and inexpensive game to help you ""test the waters""
-if you are already a fan of interactive novels; you will likely appreciate the unique features of this game
-because the dialogue is engaging (and often funny), voiced well, and led by Miss Fortune's dry wit and sarcastic remarks
-because the multiple endings stem from the fact that [spoiler]plausible murder accusations can be made against any character[/spoiler]
-(this requires much more clever scripting than simple decision trees like ""who do you date?"" or ""who do you kill?"")

You should not play this game...
-if you do not like interactive novels; it's mostly reading/watching/decisions, with some minor exploratory segments
-if you are an action-oriented or impatient player; there are no genuine decisions until the second chapter
-if you are easily frustrated; it's a bit tricky to [spoiler]find everything you need to access the true ending[/spoiler]

Overall, if you are able to approach this game as an immersive evening of mystery, I think you will enjoy it. Give yourself a good chunk of time when you first get started, think about what's going on, listen to the voice acting, and think of the first ending you find as ""your ending"". 

Note: I would also recommend playing without the optional time limit for the second chapter. In my experience, the game is more fun if you take time to listen to all the voice acting and don't have to worry about getting stuck not finding something important before you have to accuse somebody. You can always time yourself (the limit is [spoiler]1 hour 15 minutes[/spoiler]) to see if you would have been ready before the time was up anyway.",1495859213,1495859213,True,15,1,0.653127789497375488,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, during the proceedings, their host is murdered, and she finds herself being framed for the murder. It's now up to you to search the locations, question the other characters, and either find the true culprit or lay the blame somewhere else, before the police arrive.

The handful of locations can all be searched for clues, but this is where things go a little wrong. All background graphics use a washed out style where individual items are hard to distinguish from each other. That would work fine if their sole purpose was to be backgrounds, but it becomes problematic when you have to search through them. While the hotspots are adequately sized, there is rarely anything to really distinguish them from the rest of the blurry background. It doesn't really help that the locations can be side scrolled for an even larger area to sweep your pointer over in the search of a new hotspot. Reaching the end and finding out that you missed a crucial item is painful, as you do not want to go through the bother of mousing over all the locations again.

Meanwhile, interrogating the other charactres is largely delightful, due to good writing and mostly solid voice acting. Character sprites are overall well done, with enough different poses and expressions to keep things from getting too stale. While it is by no means a large game, it's still impressive that the entire thing is voice acted, and aside from one voice actress' delivery, I was impressed by the quality. There is a bit of intriguing world building going on, but it's really only hinted at, which is a shame, because it could have gone a long way towards explaining the vastly different accents of the characters. As it is, the accents come across more as an attempt to distinguish the characters from each other, which I believe could have been done more elegantly than forcing a foreign accent on certain characters.

So, is the murder mystery clever and hard to crack? Not really. As long as you find all those darn hotspots, Miss Fortune does rather well in solving most of the mystery herself. You are required to make a few crucial decisions and present evidence, but your character may reach conclusions based on that evidence that you hadn't quite figured out yourself. Regardless, the true culprit and method of murder is not that hard to figure out. Therefore, it is a rather pleasant surprise that you can reach different endings by framing each character for the murder, building up a false case against them. This is actually where most of the fun comes from.

While the engine (unity) is adequate for the task, one thing that's really missing is a skip function. Going though the game again is laborious when you have to click your way through the initial dialogue. Thankfully, the save system automatically saves to different files, and there are a few auto saves to help you jump to key places, but a true skip function would have been appreciated.

In conclusion, for the price being asked, this is a good, but short murder mystery, marred by poor location searching, but impressive for its dialogue and voice acting. I imagine that with one character's delivery being re-recorded, you could sell this as an audio drama at the same price, but here you get an interesting little mystery game as well.",1493798799,1493798799,True,30,1,0.779095828533172607,3,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a new take for me from a visual novel stand point, it was put together with great effort and it really shows from each character and voice for every line so far, its pulling me deeper and deeper into wanting to play more, and I will get to the bottom of this mystery if its the last thing... well probably not the LAST thing I do.

With great rendered scenes done in what seems like big screenshots, to moving mouths they tried to make sure every nook and cranny was grabbing your attention. I am quite enjoying myself, 
This was my experience from it and it contains no spoilers as I made sure to stop before anything got in too deep.
