You have access to all towers from the start of the game so it's hard to learn which ones are good for which enemies.

I was really looking forward to this game, unfortunately it is nowhere close to release ready.   I really liked the graphics on this game and hope the developers are able to make it work.

Here are the main problems I experienced in my brief playtime and how I'd like to see it fixed.

1) Towers should be introduced slowly over the first few story levels.  Currently once you start level 1 all towers are available with no way of knowing what each is good for.

2) Enemies, again level 1 and there were numerous different enemy types.  Introduce them slowly over a few levels so we can learn how to combat the different types.  Maybe a pop-up the first time an enemy appears telling us about them.  

3) Theme, This is a fantasy orc tower defense, I don't want my Gatling gun spitting pitiful little balls of light that slowly follow the enemy.  I want cannons, bullets, maybe a wizard.    And add some sounds and impact to the enemies.  The guns currently do so little damage you can't even tell if they are hitting the mobs.

4) Difficulty.  The game is way too difficult.  Enemies are too fast, too much health, guns don't hit hard enough.  Multiple separate paths on the first level.  Tone this stuff down.  Give us a few levels of 1 path to get used to the game.  make the enemies killable.

Some form of fixes are needed for the above points for the game to even be playable.  Below are some thoughts on how I think the game could go from playable to awesome.

a) First Person Towers.  Perks point to us being able to enter the towers for some first person action.  This sounds awesome, it sounds even better if we could control the guns while in the tower.  Imagine holding your 2 vivemotes up like you have a Gatling gun in front of you, the haptic feedback shaking your hands as you empty thousands of rounds in the approaching orc horde.  Maybe shoot for the legs to slow the enemy or go for headshots to do extra damage.  Some enemies could have armor, making it more efficient to shoot them in the extremities.  Unfortunately, I don’t know if it is even possible to enter the towers yet, I could not figure out how.

b) Movement, while I can access all the towers from 1 spot with the laser target, let me teleport around the board so I can lean in and get a closer view of the different areas of the map

* balancing -> not existing
* creative towers -> unfortunately not
* fancy effects (explosions for AOE attacks, etc.) -> not existing
* sounds -> okayish
* music -> gets odd very wuickly

My Suggestions:
* Write down a description on how to play this game (at least in the forums or somewhere!).
* Rebalance the difficulty level
* Rebalance and (Game) Design the towers from scratch (the look is okay
* add effects which represents effects of the tower (explosions for aoe, size depending on power, etc.)
* Keep the beautiful graphics",1462907115,1462907115,False,27,0,0.681262075901031494,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Optic is pretty nice and the controls works well, but it feels more of a early acces game than a finished product.

First of all it starts without any introduction or tutorial, you have to figure it out on your yourself.
Yes when you played TD games before, you don´t need long for that, but it starts at a very high difficulty level.

I tried the first map several times and dont managed to beat it. Because it´s random what sort of creeps and which node they are coming from.
I think the starting waves are also to big or maybe the towers are to weak.

You don´t get any feedback at all. 
How many HP have the units? How big is the wave and from which node are they coming next? 
When you want to upgrade your skills, the upgrade points are covered behind a tree and you have to guess or go back to the main overview to see it.

A lot of this things may be patchable, but at this state its not worth the money.

Pro
Nice medievil cartoon graphic
Basic but solid TD mechanics.

Contra
No Tutorial
The Game gives the player no feedback on the creeps and waves.
