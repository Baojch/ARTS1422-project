Players take on the role of a crew member aboard a steampunk airship, working together to navigate treacherous skies and engage in intense battles against enemy airships.

One of the standout features of Guns of Icarus Alliance is the emphasis on teamwork. Communication is key as players must effectively coordinate their actions to pilot the airship, man the guns, and repair damage during combat. The sense of camaraderie and cooperation that develops between players is truly rewarding and adds a layer of depth to the gameplay that sets it apart from other multiplayer games.

The graphics in Guns of Icarus Alliance are stunning, with beautifully rendered airships and environments that really bring the steampunk world to life. The battles are intense and adrenaline-fueled, with each victory feeling hard-earned and satisfying.

Overall, Guns of Icarus Alliance is a must-play for fans of multiplayer shooters and cooperative gameplay. Its unique concept, engaging gameplay, and strong emphasis on teamwork make it a standout title in the genre.

There are definitely things that could be improved, but the core is great, and you can have plenty of fun with it.

But, the playerbase is far too small. PvP is often not even really an option due to the low player count, and a few PvE modes do require at least 2 players due to requiring multiple ships. You can still have some fun solo on a the other PvE modes, but admittedly, that's not where the game shines and is really best with multiple people (if only so you aren't forced to always be the pilot). But if you've got a few friends, it's very fun in PvE.

As for why the playerbase ended up so small, perhaps part of it is just that the game didn't get quite well-known enough in the correct time window to be able to grow. Another potential problem is that there isn't exactly a huge amount of unlocks, be they gameplay or cosmetic, which may have lost those who ""somewhat enjoyed"" the base gameplay, but need a little more incentive to stick around, which admittedly is probably a lot of people.

I know the devs do fairly regularly host PvP events, though admittedly, I am more of a PvE player. I was a backer on the Alliance expansion/game/whatever you want to call it, and I don't really regret it all that much, because I do enjoy what PvE is there.

I don't know if the devs will read this, but if you guys do, I just wanna say that I do think you made a good game. It's a shame it never really took off like it could have, but I do hope you are able to one day revisit the idea.

The game's graphics and sound design are top-notch, which only adds to the already immersive world that Guns of Icarus Alliance has created.

The game's developers are also incredibly active in the community, constantly updating and adding new features to keep the game fresh and exciting.

Rozgrywka oparta jest na pojedynkach sterowców, którymi można dowolnie manewrować, naprawiać je i strzelać z działek, które są na nich umieszczone - nic rewolucyjnego na tyle, by można było spaść z krzesła. Trailery jednak były bardzo obiecujące i zapowiadały prostą grę do sieciowej kooperacji na kilka godzinek. Z nadzieją na chwilę zabawy gra trafiła u mnie na ""kupkę wstydu"" i czekała, aż sobie o niej przypomnę. No i sobie przypomniałem, ale gra niestety zdążyła w tym czasie umrzeć - według SteamCharts średnia z ostatnich 30 dni to 3,9 gracza. W praktyce oznacza to tyle, że nikt w nią nie gra, co ma decydujący wpływ na jej ocenę. Niby jest możliwość grania z botami, ale sztuczna inteligencja w tej grze jest strasznie prymitywna, więc ""zabawa"" samemu wygląda trochę jak mierzenie się z niewidomym kto zgadnie więcej kolorów na okładce kolorowanki - trzeba się postarać, by przegrać.

Dziwię się, że ta gra ma oceny bardzo pozytywne, gdy w tej formie przypomina niegrywalną, pustą w środku wydmuszkę, a nie pełnoprawny tytuł warty choćby kilku złotych. Jedyną nadzieją jest przekonanie kilku znajomych, by wejść razem do gry i spróbować się zmierzyć przeciwko sobie. Wtedy może jej zakup miałby sens. W każdym innym przypadku jest to bezcelowe.

Warto na koniec dodać, że chociaż gra jest dystrybuowana w oparciu o model b2p, to pełno w niej mikropłatności, które atakują gracza z każdej strony. Przypomina to gry usługi z chin albo jakieś mobilne potworki robione od szkicu w Unity. Szkoda.",1677259099,1677259205,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

It´s a pity I didn´t find out about it sooner. Even if I have started playing during the game´s 10th anniversary, the PvE community warfare is still going strong and it is now easier than ever to become a faction leader! Occasionally I can find also a PvP match, but I actually prefer co-op PvE in this game.
The basic gameplay loop revolves around 3 roles of airship crew: pilot, or captain, just stands behind the wheel and controls movement of the ship. The ships generally turn like a barn, so it is quite tactical and you need to predict the movement of the enemy ships. The engineer plays like a non-violent melee FPS or repair simulator: you just mash damaged components of ship with variety of tools. The strategy comes from using the right tool on the right component at the right time. The gunner is the least important, because engineers can also use guns mounted on ship, but gunners can improve the stats of the gun and can also change to different ammo types.
The graphics are still very solid, because they are a bit stylized and not trying to be super realistic. The smoke and fog effects are beautiful and the lighting changes the color palette of the whole scene. When your ship descends from a dark blue-ish gas cloud into a valley filled with last light of the sun just before the solar eclipse, the view is simply breathtaking!
Because the game is a multiplayer one, it all comes down to your ability to communicate (and to get along with) your crew. Some captains can be irritating with their demands, but they are just doing their job. As a new player, I have experienced only friendly behaviour from veterans, who also always offered me assistance. The community is small but very dedicated and new player friendly!

While the team based focus of the game was welcome, and inspired the game to have some ""viral"" success where most PvP only games don't, it was short lived success.  The focus of the game is pure PvP, there's no single player content.  Developers must learn that other players are not an acceptable substitute for adding content to a game.  Developers often opt for PvP-only as developing single player content is difficult and requires capable storytelling, writing, level design and a wide range of other game development skills and talent. The vast majority of PvP-only games fail because they don't go ""viral"", and without players, the game dies.  If there was a single player component, there would be a lasting substance to the game, however, in this case, while the game enjoyed a honeymoon with enough people to fill servers, that time is long over.

You'll get more enjoyment out of this than anything else you'll buy for this price. Just do it. Now.

Guns of Icarus is a game about teamwork, fighting smart, setting up loadouts to suite your play style, hectic communication, and the grand satisfaction of a ship kill. Definitely a game best enjoyed with a crew of your friends in discord, but given the price, the hard part is having three friends.

Each crew member will need to fill a role, from pilot, gunner, and engineer. Pilot, well, pretty self explanatory. Best for that guy in your group who doesn't really like shooting games. pilot is actually super involved, and there's a big difference between a good pilot and a great one>

Gunner, pretty simple, man guns, shoot things. Figuring out which weapons with which ammo types is most effective in which circumstances is the name of the game here. Remember, you are aiming to do three things: Disable components, destroy armour, damage hull. Each weapon/ammo combo will be more or less effective at doing these three things. Also, don't slack on doing repairs! the engineer can't do everything.

Engineer, fix things, boost things, on occasion man the guns. ON OCCASION! Gunners will have ammo and weapons boosts, you do not. If you are blocking a gunner from doing his job, you're not doing yours. Doesn't seem as fun, but a good engineer can give massive boosts to the pilot and gunner, as well as keeping your ship in tip top shape.

The hardest part of course is getting these three roles to work well together.

Combine that with a decent amount of customisation, choosing between different ship types, and weapon loadouts, it makes for a lot of variety and freedom.

Overall, I recommend, although the servers are currently dead, you only really need a total of 16 players online to have a really good time, and hopefully this sale with help with numbers.

Graphics: 7/10, Could be Better.
Gameplay: 7/10 Pretty fun and hectic, but has its flaws. Each Role has its ups and downs.
Playerbase: 3/10 The Games playerbase is pretty small, which is incredibly sad. 
-------------------------------- The Actual Review --------------------------------------------
    Lets start this off with a simple message: I do recommend this game. Its incredibly charming and incredibly fun.
Its unfortunate that the playerbase is pretty nonexistant. However this game despite that is still incredibly good. Hopefully the community some how gets revived. As for how the game handles:
The gameplay is quite simple in some aspects, You and 3 other players (Or AI) are tasked with managing an Air Ship with 3 Roles for 4 Slots: The Captain, the Gunner (You can also be a third engineer), and 2 Engineers. 
The Captain:
Your goal is to pilot the ship, and get you from Point A to Point B while coordinating the Crew. Its probably the hardest of the Roles to play and master.
The Gunner: The Gunner can use different Ammo Types in order to maximize your weapons effectiveness. This allows them to be a fairly important role, and the easiest to play.
The Engineer: The Engineer is essentially whats going to keep your ship alive. They are focused on repairing modules, buffing modules and turrets and general upkeep of the ship.
With this all being said, the game is incredibly fun. This is an old game but its worth picking up, especially for the price.
Final Verdict: Extremely good game, Price of $4.99 is fair, it has sales at times which drop the price as low as $0.49 making it an extremely cheap but worthy game. Glad I stumbled upon it",1635785859,1635786136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The combat is very fun, flying the ship is well implemented and fun, and the class abilities can be very fun to use. All in all I would recommend this game to anybody with a good group of friends to play it with.

The ship vs ship combat is very fun. With 3 classes to choose from, gunner, engineer, and pilot. Each class has role specific abilities and are generally pretty easy to pick up and fun to play. The different focuses of the different classes makes each one unique to play. 
While the gunner is trying to use special ammo to wipe enemy ships out of the sky before they wipe you, the engineers has to try and keep up with the ship damage, running around to repair damaged parts and buff them to keep ahead of problems. The pilot maneuvers the ship into optimal firing positions, helps direct overall what needs to be done. Things such as what to focus on repairing first, what ships to focus fire on, and where to move the ship. Combat is intense and fun for all classes and working together with your friends to keep your ship going and destroy the enemy is extremely enjoyable.

[b]HOWEVER[/b] if you do not have a group of friends to play this with, then I would absolutely not recommend buying this game. The online servers are very close to completely dead and getting a full lobby can sometimes be near impossible. There are AI's that will take the place of players on your ship to keep stuff running despite not having enough players and while they are pretty good the most fun part of the game is communicating with your ship and basking in the chaotic steampunk airship battling fun.

Overall I would definitely recommend this game if you and your friends want a fun and intense game to play together. This game is perfect for large groups as you can have up to 16 players in a lobby. For those that want to just buy the game for themselves, I would recommend against it. The playerbase is very small and while the AI isn't terrible, playing this game with a group of friends is where this game shines.",1625978199,1625978268,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Instead of doing anything about the abuse towards other players in this game, Muse Games' moderation staff actively enables their bully friends. This is not a rogue staff member - all of them up to Muse's lead Howard Tsao are fully aware but refuse to do anything.

To make matters worse, Muse Games is also actively disregarding European consumer protections by failing to provide all personal data they store, after multiple requests. These developers think they are above the law.

As it stands, I cannot recommend this game, or anything Muse makes to anyone.

After spending some more time in game. I feel I need to change this Review.

The game suffers from severe Elitism. They call it, ""We're a Close Knit Community"" But really means, ""We've been here so long, it doesn't matter what other people think."" They can be pretty condescending to some people, and expect you to know everything from the get go despite the tutorials being somewhat unapproachable.

It still suffers from a lack of player base. Big time. Barely 18 people on at any time. And no lobbies again unless some Mod, GM or Dev has placed it up for one of their weekly locked games. 

On top of that. If they believe it's in their best interests to pressure someone into doing something they want you to do, they will do so. All under the guise of, ""It's for the fun of it.""

Compromises in game are ignored or overlooked. In game concerns about not wanting to pursue certain roles are swept aside ""For the Good of the rest"" and not ""For your own enjoyment"".

Let's be honest here, we don't play games for other people enjoyment, but for our own. And when a bunch of elitist people try to force you to conform to their ideals it certainly doesn't promote personal enjoyment.

With a low playerbase, elitist players who look out more for their own enjoyment, and ignoring other peoples enjoyment and offers to compromise to try and reach that state. If I could rate this game well i'd be rating it fairly low.

I can't possibly give this game a positive review. The bad experiences while playing this game now greatly outweight the good. Immensely in fact.

Approach this game at your own risk. And be prepared for potential pressure to conform to other peoples wants, over your own. Be prepared for empty lobbies if it's not a lobby headed by this GM or that Dev.

If that's your cup of tea then good luck. But don't go into this thinking it's going to be easy.",1613837891,1621141851,False,35,0,0.687346816062927246,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Super Teamspiel mit klaren Rollenverteilungen. Im MP- und Singleplayer-Modus nimmt man gleichermaßen an globalen Karten/ Fraktions-Zielen Teil.

Individualisierung der Schiffs-Waffenbestückung ist ausgewogen, wie die Individualisierung der Spieler-Ausrüstung.


Was ich nicht so gut finde: 
Das Menü wirkt ein bisschen unübersichtlich aber mit etwas Zeit hat man den Dreh raus.
Das Spiel vermittelt im Intro und generell Atmosphärisch eine Rollenspiel- oder eine Fraktions-Orientierung.
Rollenspiel und Fraktionsspiel-Charakter existiert nur auf dem Schlachtfeld bzw. der Karte und ist sonst eher statisch. Die Maps hat man schnell alle gesehen.

Sure if you play it every single day, it gets a bit boring, but you'd have to do that for like weeks on end to stop enjoying this game.  This is a great ""Friday Night"" game with some friends.  It's really low key and doesn't take too long to learn and get good at it.  

And at the end of the day, the community is super positive so you don't have to worry about how well you're doing.  Everyone plays this game to just have fun, and honestly - that's pretty amazing these days.  So if you're sick of the CoD mindset, and want to play a strategic team-based game where you can be a mechanic, gunner, or PILOT while just enjoying the game for what it is - this is your game.

Also, this game was something like the 14th certified game on the MLG platform.  It should have been so much bigger than it was.  I am acquaintances with a couple of their development team, and they are just awesome people and are highly involved with the community.. even though there's only a couple hundred people playing at a time, they still care enough to set up events and make matches where they augment the rules for some truly silly game play (for instance, a match where there are virtually no resistance or breaks.. can we say bumper blimps?).

If you haven't played this, you need to.  It's not expensive, so buy it for you and three friends.  I guarantee a good time.

The game mechanics can get a bit complex (as with GoI Onlne).  I've been around for a little while, and there are many things I don't understand yet.  My recommendation is to get a microphone and talk with the community in lobbies and during the matches.  The player base tends to be very welcoming and helpful.  We want new players to join and feel welcome, so we are more than happy to explain complex bits and support ya’ll where we can.

As a side note: For the full experience, you really wanna be on the official discord for the game and the discord for your faction (if they have one).  The lore and speculating on the game and world at large are part of the fun.  It also gives you a group to learn from and steal the knowledge off of.

The player base is a bit small (20-70 players online depending on the time), but those that play tend to be active in both matches and in the external discords.  A group also puts on regular events/ training classes that are designed to help new and existing players.  The Devs also are pretty active in events and matches, so don't let the low numbers discourage you.

Mit dem Kauf gibt es das Hauptspiel direkt mit dazu. Netter Zug von den Entwicklern!

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In “Guns of Icarus: Alliance” spielen wir jeweils als Crew von 4 Personen auf einem Luftschiff. Dabei spielt ein Spieler den Captain und Steuermann, während der Rest der Gruppe aus Schützen und Mechanikern besteht. Ziel ist es, die anderen Luftschiffe, ebenfalls mit 4 Mann Besatzung zu vernichten und sich gegebenenfalls mit Verbündeten zu koordinieren. Um nun einen Vogel vom Himmel holen zu können, muss der Pilot das Schiff so fliegen, dass die Schützen zunächst die Panzerung und dann den Rumpf des Zeppelings ins Visier nehmen können. Obendrein können auch verschiedene Mechaniken wie der Ballon, Waffen und Motoren angegriffen werden, was die feindliche Crew vielleicht in ihrer Beweglichkeit einschränkt. Der Mechaniker ist dafür natürlich ausgebildet, um Brände zu löschen und die Maschinen wieder flott zu machen. Aber das kann je nach Schwere der Beschädigungen schon mal ein wenig dauern. Grundsätzlich kann übrigens jeder Spieler auch jede Aufgabe an Bord übernehmen, jedoch gibt es spezifische Fähigkeiten und Ausrüstung für die jeweilige Klasse. So kann der Captain die Maschinen überlassen, der Mechaniker hat mehr Werkzeuge und der Schütze kann Spezialmunition einsetzen. Aber hey, wenn das Luftschiff eh gerade komplett abraucht und ich als Steuermann Nichts mehr machen kann, dann kann ich auch den Schraubschlüssel schwingen und den Motor hinter mir reparieren. Übrigens gibt es mehrere Luftschiffe, die man zudem verschieden ausrüsten kann. Spielübergreifend kann man sich noch einer Fraktion anschließen und durch Siege so Ressourcen gewinnen, aber das ist eher eine Nebensache. Im Gegensatz zum eigentlichen „Guns of Icarus“ ist „Alliance“ bewusst augerichtet, gegen computergesteuerte Feinde zu kämpfen. Zum Einen kann man das als Training ansehen, aber sich mit vier Schiffen und 16 Spielern gegen die fiesen NPCs zusammenzuschließen…Ja, das hat schon was.

[b]Story[/b]
In der Welt von “Guns of Icarus” gibt es mehrere Imperien, die miteinander im Krieg liegen. Besonders groß wird die Geschichte aber nicht vertieft, dafür erlebt man aber seine ganz eigenen Geschichten. So denke ich immer noch an so manche coolen Manöver meiner Crew auf meiner “Isabel”. Denn wenn man sein Schiff benennt, dann wirkt es doch schon viel intensiver, oder? So gelingen in Absprache mit anderen Captains schöne Angriffe und ich denke auch an die LAN-Partie zurück, wo wir mit 16 Leuten, also 4 Schiffen, gegeneinander und zusammen gekämpft haben. Wir waren alle Anfänger, alle haben durch den Raum gebrüllt und alle hatten riesigen Spaß. 

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Die Grafik könnte vielleicht etwas aktueller sein, jedoch ist das Spiel durchaus ansehnlich. Außerdem steckt ja auch ein eher kleines Team hinter dem Spiel. Übrigens kann man sich seine Spielfigur auch recht umfassend anpassen und auch neue Uniformen freischalten. Beim Fliegen erlebt man zudem ein schönes Freiheitsgefühl, was durch Windgeräusche auch verdeutlicht wird. Aber auch die Gefechte sind sehr knallig und gerade das Trefferfeedback fühlt sich richtig gut an.

[b]Fazit[/b]
„Guns of Icarus: Alliance“ setzt Kommunikation unbedingt voraus. Die Crew muss gut zusammenarbeiten und auch wenn man sich gut koordiniert, vielleicht kann es die andere Crew einfach besser. Am Besten findet man als 4-Mann Truppe zusammen und wagt sich gemeinsam an das Spiel heran. Das Tutorial ist dabei sowieso Pflicht. Wenn man aber den ersten Schritt getan hat, so wird „Guns of Icarus“ richtig spaßig und man teilt Siege und Niederlagen als Gruppe. Da das Spiel nicht mit knallharten Belohnungen kommt, ist die Community auch recht entspannt und es bleibt meist das Gefühl, gut gekämpft zu haben. Für mich war das Spiel auch einfach ein Höhepunkt auf der LAN-Party, den ich sicherlich nicht vergessen werde. Also, auf in die Lüfte mit euch!

Best Sea of Thieves like game.
Undiscovered and hidden below a lot of [strike]shitty[/strike] average games on this platform.
[b]Guns of Icarus is one of the best to spend a good time with friends.[/b]
The game has PvP and PvE modes.
Gameplay is not very complicated. The hardest part is steering the ship and needs some time to get acquainted with it.
I especially recommend it for people who are into post-punk, fantasy or loves view of the ground from above.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Beautiful stylized graphics - a little bit east inspired.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Very addictive especially when playing together with friends. The gameplay is very dynamic during clashes.

[h1]Audience[/h1]
For everyone who wants to enjoy playing together.
Especially recommended for people who are into post-punk, fantasy or nice views.

[h1]Score[/h1]
8.5/10

[h1]The Problem[/h1]
The problem of the Guns of Icarus is small player base.[spoiler]I had not known about its existence before while I follow the game industry quite intensively.[/spoiler]

I know that's been said in the reviews for this game already but I wanted to reiterate it because it's true. The Aesthetic of the game alone was enough to draw me to it but the game play is fast paced, the mechanics are easy to master, and it's a hell of a fun game to play with friends. I've been playing since before 'Alliance' came out and all the continued support is very encouraging for what this game could become in even a few years. I mus say, Guns of Icarus is one of my all-time favorite games.

Pros:
- Heat of the moment combat
- play with friends in private or public games
- game is still being updated
- very cheap, especially on sale
- beautiful game world and amazing steampunk art
- good community (at least the people I've met)
- ship's and characters are customizable aesthetically and mechanically.
- the main game modes are co-op but there's PvP available for you competitive friend groups.

Cons:
- small player base (but bigger with you here, perhaps)
- no campaign (there is lore though)
- game play can get repetitive
- not as fun without friends

Highly recommend. At the very least, a few rounds and some laughs with your friends should be worth your $4.99",1593666176,1593666176,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

极为丰富的游戏体验,游戏性非常好:自定义飞艇,驾驶飞艇,炮台射击，维修船舰，PVP，PVE ,阵营战役，对于新手来说的游戏体验有点差，有射击,但不是特别考验FPS能力,对驾驶飞艇的舰长的要求可能比较高,虽然游戏服务器在国外,也可能是游戏人数少的缘故，裸连很少出现掉线之类的情况
在查阅了官方网站后，这个伊卡洛斯之炮的世界观等是真的可以吸引到想我样的家伙缺点是英语能力欠缺的人,还是有些难以游玩(我也是靠百度翻译个单词 个单词查的WEEEEEE NEEEEED CHINESE )
无论是与小伙伴们一起完成ALLIANCE里剧情的任务目标，还是与小伙伴们一起共同驾驶飞艇，进行飞艇之间的对抗，这款游戏非常适合(虽然我个人来说是没有朋友,只是个人游玩，泪目)
玩家船长到达8级(还是几级来着) PVP模式就解锁了所有舰船和炮塔
PVE的模式则似乎需要完成自己所属阵营的定等级，来解锁相应的船舰和炮塔(有些剧情模式的炮塔真的好炫酷啊啊啊啊啊啊

Peccato che la pigrizia o fissazione degli sviluppatori sia quella esclusiva di aggiornare contenuti già esistenti, aggiungere elementi estetici e non so che altro di poco rilevante al game play pressoché identico da sempre.

I miei consigli:
Aggiungere sottotitoli di altre lingue cosi da capire nel proprio idioma tutto quello che c'è da sapere e rendere un player consapevole di quello che deve e non deve fare.
Aggiunta di modalità di gioco con nuove idee di base oppure di tendenza.
Aggiunta di sistema di combattimento tra giocatori (fanteria) con possibilità di abbordaggio e appropriazione della nave nemica.
Sistema di match making da rivedere per renderlo più efficace.

You might, understandably, be forgiven for thinking Guns of Icarus Alliance is a single-player game, considering there is also a listing on Steam for Guns of Icarus Online. Actually, both listings are for the same game, which is entirely online. So, yeah, that's disappointing.

Speaking of disappointing, let's talk about the premise of the game. You might also be forgiven for thinking Guns of Icarus is an ""airship combat game,"" but that's really only half the story. What the game is, rather, is a first-person co-op shooter that happens to be set [i]on[/i] airships. (Airships very clearly inspired by early Final Fantasy games.) This difference is key, I think. It's astonishing how incredibly versatile the medium of gaming is. You can play as literally anything—even, memorably, something as perfectly abstract as a gust of wind—yet the vast majority of games out there simply put you in the shoes of some dull human. How boring! In a game about airship combat, I'd at least like to, you know, play as an airship from time to time!

The basic structure of Guns of Icarus is pretty bog-standard. You're on a small airship and have one of three jobs: pilot, gunner or engineer. They're all rather self-explanatory. Your job is to either angle the ship so that the turrets' firing arcs reach your enemy, fire at the enemy, or repair damage. The only interesting thing is the conceit of being on a small airship instead of inside an arena, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun leaping through the air from deck-to-deck, knowing that if the angle was off I'd careen overboard and fall down a very, very long way. But beyond the novelty of the premise? I'm not really seeing any reason to stick around. Seems like a fun time for co-op with friends, but otherwise?

Отрицательных эмоций ничего не вызывает в этой игре, можно (и нужно) играть в команде из как минимум 3 человек (лучше 4), а можно играть одному и в команду дадут ботов.
Подходит для любителей максимально реалистичного управления техникой и ведения боев. На каждом дирижабле есть команда из 4 человек,  каждый из этих людей занимается своим делом, а конкретно:
Механик - чинит повреждения, следит за целостностью дирижабля, тушит пожары и вешает улучшения на движки, и защиту на корпус\пузырь. Может стрелять из пушек, но имеет всего 1 улучшение для стрельбы.
Стрелок - стреляет из пушек, имеет 3 дополнительных улучшенных режима стрельбы. Дополнительно может помогать в починке механику или тушить пожары, но придется выбирать что-то одно.
Пилот - пилотирует дирижабль, может выполнять по одной функции каждого из членов команды, но как правило времени у него на это нет.
Управление очень интересное, но легко привыкнуть, тут не получится зажать W и маневрировать. У каждого вида дирижаблей есть свои характеристики подвижности и прочности, а так же уникальное расположение пушек. Есть очень маневренные но легко бронированные, есть почти стационарные но тяжело бронированные, при любом варианте все дирижабли в управлении сложны т.к. моментально сменить направление полета невозможно даже с помощью перков. Как и стрельба точно в цель возможна только в упор, у каждого типа пушек и даже снарядов\патронов есть своя траектория и скорость полета, которую можно изменить с помощью перков, по этому приходится брать упреждение. 
Имбовых, или очень сильных дирижаблей нет, как и имбовых классов (хотя объективно стрелок редко когда оправдывает свои перки, по этому берут механиков), в игре баланс доведен до максимально возможного уровня, какой можно только вообразить при таком количестве перков и вооружения. 
Единственный минус этой игры - отсутствие какой либо адекватной рекламы. На игру можно только случайно натолкнуться, или узнать от друга (что маловероятно). В связи с чем в игре отсутствует онлайн, в самые топовые моменты на моей памяти было 1000 человек, в среднем в день 100-200 человек.

Это DLC должно было решить эту проблему если не полностью, то, хотя бы, частично.
Собственно, ставим вопрос, справилось ли оно со своей задачей?

И да, и нет.

С DLC пришли фракции, глобальная мировая карта, где фракции играют с монеточками, думая, где атаковать, а где защищать. (не путайте с открытым миром) Пришли и новые корабли, элементы кастомизации, в общем, косметика, которая призвана подчеркнуть в вас вашу индивидуальность. (А ведь она так нужна при таком количестве игроков!) В любом случае, приятный бонус.

Весь геймплей дополнения направлен на Co-op, то есть, воевать придется против ботов, что очевидно. Существуют различные миссии на 1, 2, 3 и даже 4 экипажа. То есть, ко-оп до четырех кораблей по четыре человека. А если меня чему-то и научила улица, так это арифметике! Четыре на четыре... Это будет так-с... Шестнадцать! Хороший такой кооператив. Задания тоже различаются. Где-то банальная атака стационарных целей, где-то их защита в разных форматах, привези-увези, убей, отрази волны, убей босса. Геймплей, в целом, не изменился. Так как это боты, то врагов вы встретите заметно больше. Много вам подобных экипажей, а ещё самолётики не дадут заскучать, а также не забудьте про стационарные структуры, некоторые из которых тоже не дадут себя в обиду. А на блюдечке с голубой каёмочкой ещё и босс прилетит под эпичную музыку, убийство которого зачастую необходимо. Зато за его убийство бонус дают! Кстати о бонусах, помимо бонусов существуют ещё специальные грузовые маленькие корабли, которые по своей сути безобидны, но за их уничтожение вы тоже получаете свои бонусы. Например, улучшенная выживаемость.

Вы закончили миссию? Поздравляю, вы получите опыт на классе, фракции и-и-и-и...Монетки! Неужели валюта, за которую можно покупать что-то интересное для себя? Почти. Это очки, которые нужно спускать на мировой карте, чтобы ""финансировать"" операции по защите или атаки, закупая туда солдат различных сортов или проводя другие махинации. Если не таить греха, то эта идея не доведена до ума, ибо скучна она как школьный КВН. Возможно, я просто должен был в себе разбудить патриота своей фракции, но нет фракции лучше, чем Единая Россия.

В любом случае, поиграться можно даже с одним другом в команде, оставив два места на корабле для ботов, отказавшись от прочих союзников. Вы всё так же будете получать опыт, монетки и всё такое, но геймплей может быстро надоесть. В этом кроется плюс своеобразной независимости от онлайна.

Обратная сторона состоит в том, что онлайн игры завис где-то на планке от 40 до 180 в среднем, в какие-то местные события, ясное дело, онлайн ещё выше поднимается, но согласитесь, что этого мало. А теперь тот онлайн, что есть в наличии, разделён на два лагеря: PvP и PvE. Найти живую душу для игры стало немного сложнее, хотя по личному опыту скажу, что быстрый поиск в PvE даже смог мне подобрать напарников и собранные экипажи.

Новые пушки и корабли, кстати, довольно интересные. И даже имеют некоторое преимущество перед стандартными кораблями, либо так просто кажется. Хотя, один корабль из PvE контента не пустили в PvP, ибо его характеристики были слишком... Выдающимися.

Последним пунктом отмечу, что в игру завезли неплохую музыку, в конце концов. Завезли временные и динамические топы игроков фракции, то есть, систему лидеров. (Лидеры играют некоторую роль на мировой карте) У фракций милый лор, хотя, субъективно, стиль мне их не особо понравился. Лору и фракциям нужно какое-то развитие. Разработчики до сих пор устраивают совместные игры с аудиторией, победителей вознаграждают предметами из магазина, часто на выбор победителя. А некоторые карты даже способны радовать глаз!

Statistics are split between the original PVP-only mode and the PVE expansion released years later, so while my displayed time is 1,400 hours, the true number is closer to 4,000 hours. 

Guns of Icarus has contained my highest highs, and lowest lows of video gaming - and the truth of the matter is, I cannot recommend it to anyone. The gameplay in a vacuum is robust; the concept is strong and when achieved properly is a highly engaging and challenging experience that leads to a sense of camaraderie with other players rarely possible in other games. Unfortunately this experience is /entirely/ reliant on a community vast enough to homogenize the average skill level to a point where disparity is easily managed. As it stands now, and has for multiple years, the community is barren - limited to a die-hard few and an oblivious fewer that rarely if ever leads to a sense of progress or purpose for new players to experience. A jaded vet community that actively dissuades inexperience and a tonedeaf developer that consistently tugs at my heartstrings with the potential for greatness tires my soul of this video game. No amount of developer and community stat-fiddling is going to accelerate the /core paradigms/ of Guns of Icarus - the only thing that will achieve that is community. Muse has a communications issue when it comes to expressing how their game is played and what to expect when joining for the first time. This game desperately needed a single player campaign mode that more comprehensively expressed the mechanics before burdening others with their inexperience - I use the past tense because it is much, much too late for this. 

While I could expound on a plethora of other technical issues with this video game, I feel that it is unnecessary - I believe a majority of these things will /never/ be updated and it is much more pertinent to what players will actually experience to focus on the aspects that keep the game running, or not running as it currently stands. It's a shame to finally admit - as a player that has been here from the very start - that I will never suggest this game to anyone.",1575996501,1575996878,False,361,21,0.910758376121520996,20,False,False,False,False,,,

You get to play either the captain, gunner or engineer, but you are not limited to the actions of your class. The main problem with Guns of Icarus is that the gameplay mechanics are (despite looking complicated at first sight) very bare bones and consequently the game gets boring really fast. It also doesn’t help that the PVE mode is not really fun and PVP servers are on life support. 

When playing Guns of Icarus, you can’t help but feel that this should have been a great game. Unfortunately, when the steampunk mask wears off, you are left with dull gameplay.

I had the opportunity to play with a dev from Muse games, who unfortunately was also one of these incredibly toxic players, who heckled me on voice chat and continuously yelled at me to quit. Sure, I'll quit. It's not like I owe Muse anything to keep playing the game.

The only way to enjoy Guns of Icarus nowadays is to get it with a friend group that is a perfect multiple of 4 and never play a public game, just run some missions co-op with each other. In that scenario, the game really shines. Otherwise, the game you wish you could be playing doesn't exist.

I've played about 60 hours between this and the base game, so i'm hardly what i would call a veteran, but then i consider a vet 600-1000+ in a good game.

I liked much of the combat and it was fun to play with 3-4 of my friends casually so i even avoided most of the *%^#%$#% of the limited playerbase, however this game lacks far too much especially content to keep one playing. my review might be somewhat different if the devs weren't too lazy to balance bard (the gist of their statement why they wont add it) boarding would add so much to this game but without it even in the best context this game has little to offer.

Now to the main reason why i dont recommend this game, simple. Airmen exists, it has everything this game needs and more including a although single very dedicated dev who consistently brings out good enjoyable content, and it is bearly affected by playerbase.

玩法方面，这个游戏也让我感到非常乏味。你只需要控制一个飞艇，在空中与其他玩家或NPC战斗。但是问题是，战斗的方式非常单一，缺乏策略性。你只需要不停地点击鼠标来射击敌人，完全没有任何深度可言。这让我很快就对游戏失去了兴趣。

最令我气愤的是，游戏中经常出现各种各样的BUG和故障。有时候我会突然卡在墙壁里，或者游戏会突然崩溃。这让我感到非常沮丧，觉得游戏的质量非常低劣。

总的来说，Guns of Icarus Alliance是一个令人失望的游戏。图形简陋，玩法乏味，音效糟糕，BUG和故障频繁。我真心不建议任何人去玩这个游戏，因为它完全没有任何乐趣可言。",1568479844,1710038643,False,2,0,0.525139689445495605,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Just buy the game, and get your friends to play. They have new PvE game modes-- 100% makes it worth returning to. And since there's such a small dedicated player base right now, it's easy to land yourself on the leaderboards. 

My advice? Pick a class and STICK with it. Get good at it. You're gonna blow slime at first, but after you get the hang of things, you'll find out what load-outs work best for which modes on which ships. It helps if you stick with crews during match-making (even if they are a little green), because you'll synergize after a few matches together. 

Biggest take away? Don't give up! You'll lose a lot of matches at the start, but don't be discouraged for long. You'll meet those couple of players that love playing the game and playing their rolls and it'll click. Next thing you know you'll be storming every game mode on Hard like a mad lad.

Usually with these titles they are a hit and miss for me. Yet this game (after watching some preview videos) had so much going for it (co-op, interesting setting, cool looking gameplay) that I was in shock over how bad it was and it forced me to write a review to warn other gamers about this game.

Story:

Literally there is none it is the future and instead of boats, cars, airplanes, or trains people trade their goods over blimp like contraptions that look like a huge ark tied to a huge zeppelin. Yet the problem is there are pirates attacking them so that's where you come in. You are a no named pilot who (oddly doesn't need to steer his blimp) must defend his cargo and repair specific areas to make sure you make it to your destination A-okay. 


Gameplay:

Basically this is a defense game where you have to make sure your ship makes it to its destination in good condition. There are 2-5 areas of the ship that you can manually repair and a nice amount of stationary weapons all over the ship to send those nasty pirates back where they came from. Now I know this sounds like an interesting concept and I know I thought it did. I mean here is a pretty decent sized ship, cool looking stationary guns, and infinite ammo how can this game go wrong? well it somehow manages to screw up all the appealing features.

The first problem right off the back is the controls ohh the controls. Now if you want to turn around or strafe you need to use the mouse. Now imagine hitting either right arrow or the ""d"" key to move to the right like in most PC games not in this game. Instead it physically turns your character to face the right side. Now I wish I could describe it better and I can't the control scheme is all off. 

Another problem is the weapons. Now I don't know if its the placement of the weapons or what they exactly do..probably the combination of the both. So there is different variants of guns on your deck. Yet they just don't feel powerful or just seem useful against the pirate ships. One example is a chaingun looking thing. So you are like ""cool a chain gun I can totally wipe those pirates out within a minute."" Well no this HAS to be the slowest chain gun in the history of videogames. It is very slow firing and it even has a short ammo clip.You have to upgrade it after levels,but still not that useful. Another gun is a BIG turret/rocket launcher thing. Now once again you are like ""epic since the chain gun sucks lets see the rocket launcher."" Well sadly its pretty useless. The rockets move way too slow to even scratch the pirate ships.Another gun is a massive electricity gun that can take out a big horde, but it takes too long to charge. Also in terms of placement some guns are in very useful areas while most aren't.

Finally the biggest problem with this game is it made mostly for the multiplayer. The ship is too big and there are too many attackers for single player. You could be fighting a whole pirate horde on the right side of the ship only to see 1000 more on the left attacking your ship. There are 2-5 spots where you can repair your ship in specific areas (like the cargo hold,zepplin,engines) but if you are by yourself its too much from fighting to repairing its just overwhelming.

Multiplayer:

Could be fun if someone was on it. See the biggest reason I wanted this game was for some Co-op fun I think it could handle anywhere between 4-8 players (don't quote me on that though) and to my dismay there was only 1 other player with me. We played a round but I just couldn't have a fun time there is a lack of communications (we couldn't type to each other the game doesn't support it or never told either of us how to) and the game went from over whelming to too easy. We easily managed the pirate horde with our horrible weapons. Yet another map we were totally overrun with pirates and lost. I think it was from both the weapon type and placement of the weapons on the ship. It was just a very bad experience definitely not like the gameplay videos. 

Graphics:

Now I am not a graphics whore. I really don't expect a lot from indie developers in the graphics department. Yet this game is just awful to look at. The sky literally looks like a large dirty blue sheet of paper that had drawings of clouds on them. I can not express the ugliness of the game and once again not what was advertised. (PS I can play most games on high with my PC this game was on the highest setting and to my dismay looked horrible.)Also you can play this game on a web browser..so you can imagaine how great they must look.

Audio:

Guns sound like guns engines sound like engines it was the least I could hope for.

Pro's

Interesting concept, could have some fun co-op moments, the ship looks cool and you can customize and upgrade it.

Con's

Bad graphics, bad controls, the online mode is horrible, can barely play single player, Once you buy it the game is yours forever you can't return it, can't chat with your partner in multiplayer, the placement of weapons,no one plays online,just really disappointing.

Overall:

This really surprised me in a bad way I really expected a fun time with this game. I really dislike this game if I could I would somehow someway return it but I can't do that since its a digital download title. This seriously gives a VERY bad name to both digital download titles and indie developers. If anyone reads this and thinking about this game just don't it really is for co-op and there is literally no one on this garbage and for good reason.",1562060067,1562060067,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are some good things about this game. The customisation options available for your character and ship are rather extensive, for example the hat of the mad hatter from Alice in Wonderland and even after being out for several years the graphics for the game are pretty good and the game could most likely run on lower end computers and if you did manage to get into a game with a decent amount of people you would get to work as a team to take down the enemies which is rather enjoyable.

Although due to a lack of players it becomes very boring very quickly. During my time playing it I never actually got into a game as all the lobbies had a few players but not enough to start the game. Even fighting against bots in practice mode became boring as you could only fight one on one and you had to take the role of captain which stops you from trying out the other classes because you will get blasted to smithereens as the bots won't pilot the ship themselves. although this was fun to begin with it soon became boring as the bot was rather easy to defeat.

Overall i would not recommend this game unless you have a large group of friends to play a private match with because you would spend more time trying to join a game than you would playing it, also fighting bots in fun for about half an hour but it soon becomes repetitive as you are fighting the same bot over and over. Back in the day this game was full of players and it is rather sad to see it empty now as this game was full of life a few years back. I think that it is better to save your money and wait until you find a game that is worth it.

Like last years expression ""You can't fix stupid"", you can't fix idiots that constantly mouth off or are 30 yet are as immature as a 9 year old latchkey kid.

Game concepts like this usually fall flat with random pickup groups because sadly for the human race, a higher percentage of gamers are morons that don't know their arse from their elbow, have little awareness outside of themself, think they funny as George Carlin, and don't give two #$%@ to want to play as a team even though success depends on it. 

Same with the battlefield games, or anything that has a squad, etc., that would benefit greatly from a team effort. Maybe works one out of ten times when you end up with group of people with an IQ of at least 80 and don't have a AH personality.
Only really works when you are in some kind of guild/clan that regularly play together.

And normally as part of the problem I'd turn off voice chat but it's an essential part of the game.

Maybe someday someone somewhere will apply machine learning to the game design. Something to automatically group the idiots together so they are isolated, then group the other non-toxic sensible players that are at least trying to play as a team..",1559960803,1559961826,False,7,1,0.523569703102111816,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I've owned Online for a long time and I'm a bit sorry I waited this long to check it out. That's the best testimonial I can give! :) It's got depth and nuance beyond what i was expecting.

I believe that in part it comes from simply splitting up the operations of the ship into a 4-person crew. In ""other games"", a lot of these ""crew activities"" might be something u hit one button for, and it happens in an abstract way ""offscreen"" and magically your ship is repaired. Turning every simple activity into something that an actual crew needs to coordinate actually causes interesting, fun, and intense gameplay to emerge.

I can vouch that there is a small but active, and friendly, helpful playerbase.

It seems you can learn most of the mechanics in PvE, to your heart's content, (which u can even play totally single-player, with bots,) but MP was my destination.

Most of the PvP activity I have seen is in EU which gives me a 100-120ms ping from ""US East"" but the higher latency is much more tolerable in this game than it would be in an unforgiving FPS like CS or CoD-whatever.

Even at times when I have hosted my own matches, people have joined pretty quickly.

For what it's worth also, normally I would say ""beware"" when entering a competitive fps-like game late in its lifecycle, because you're going to be playing w/ all the old pros, etc. But, for example, I played a match where, based on numeric levels, at least, the teams appeared ""stacked"" and I thought we were going to lose pretty bad. Also, I actually had been on the opposing pilot's crew and I knew he was good, commanding the team w/ mic, piloting very well (which includes knowing what you're working w/ afa guns etc. -- the technical details of the other stations of the ship!), etc. And I was going up against him as a pilot, now. Long story short: we lost 4-5 and it could have easily gone either way. Once we were in-match, the ""skill difference"" (for lack of better term) kinda disappeared (in ways), just due to the fact that any one ""elite"" player's impact is going to be distilled because they are 1/4 of a crew. Also, the match was 2 ships vs 2 ships, so ... there's just a chaos factor there that's hard to describe but Von Moltke's famous adage ""no battle plan survives contact w/ the enemy"" comes close. ;)

Anyway yeah I've played like 3 pvp games so I could easily show up next time and get crushed but ... that's my impression at this point.^",1550282834,1550282834,True,10,0,0.585614800453186035,0,True,False,False,False,,,

An amazing game. The game strongly revolves around cooperative gameplay with your crew. It is not very mechanically dificult, the difficuly arises more around strategy and coordination with other players. It can take a while to learn but once you get the basics and play with an experienced crew it's the most fun game experience.

One of the few competative multiplayer games i've played that actually requires communication and cooperation.

I like to call myself a veteran of this masterpiece of a game. It's a sad story.

Started off so fun, so strong, but lack of true content (A few maps every now and then, but it just felt like it wasn't going anywhere) made me stop playing (Along side some rather political statements made from the mod of their Discord server).

PROS: * The gameplay is amazing from 3 different roles to play. Each with their own purpose and ability. Gunners get all sorts of ammos and reload faster with better aiming using their ability. Engineers get all sorts of tools to fix and prevent damage (Or increase the use of parts) of the ship, able to sprint across the ship (The only one who can). While the Pilot (my favorite one) gets alot of tools to use on the ship, at the cost of the parts on the ship (Sorry engineers!). They are also able to manipulate their turning and speed using their ability.

and, we have an entire selection of PVE missions, maps, factions, and each faction having a unique boss!

* A huge selection of ships, guns, ammos, and tools. Allowing all sorts of combos of ships in their own right. A slow scout ship with a huge sniper ship waiting in the dust for the scout to find a target for them. Two fast dog fighter ships charging into battle together to quickly wipe out one ship. Perhaps you prefer a more hit and run style, they got that too. This game has all sorts of ways to play that it never really gets all that boring to actually play. 

* Customizations. Hats, clothing, colors, themes, decals on the side of your balloons. It's a small plus but still one regardless

* The final pro of this game, the music. The music in this game is art, literal art. It was the first soundtrack I bought on purpose. 

MIDDLE GROUND: * It's progression system feels like total ship! (See what I did there?) along with a huge amount of ""Achievements"" it just feels like I DON'T feel like I achieve anything in this game. There is a bright side. This means all ships, all weapons, can be unlocked nearly instantly. Allowing any combo (Back to the pros!) of any ship and any weapons you want.

CONS: * Dead player base. It hurts me to say that, it really does. This game is such a niche genre on its own right though. SO it is slightly expected to be this way. 

* Lack of real content besides maps. Other than the ""Expansion"" Alliance, there has not been a serious content patch. 

It hurts me, it really does. It's like seeing your best friend fall on his face over and over again. You wanna cry but you laugh just a bit. Then you stop laughing. Cause he stops getting back up. You try to help him up too, buying the game for all your friends just hoping a few will try to stay and play. Then you walk away. Realizing its over. 

I love this game, I do. It hurts me to thumbs the game down. All cause of a dead or dying player base

game wise? 9.5/10

Not great for long playtime, but it's really fun to pop on with friends and goof around for a bit.

The summary:
The game is designed around 4-player co-op, bots provided if necessary, and has you and your team crew an airship, with three classes of pilot, engineer, and gunner. Pilot directs the flying chaos that is your airship, gunner shoots stuff, and engineer tries to keep the whole mess afloat. The nice thing about the classes is that while each class specializes in their task, they can assist the other classes if need be. Everyone can shoot, repair, or fly, the only difference is equipment perks. You have a choice between whether you want to play PvP or play some specialized missions, and you can join a larger faction to claim territory as a team, which adds a nice overarching objective. Oh, you can also unlock different parts to build your own airship so you can have whatever odd combination of model, guns, and paint you feel like. And if you don't like the cosmetics the store has on offer, go vote for better ones in the workshop!

The specifics:
Graphics are cartoony but good, the game runs without bugs as far as I can tell, music is on point (and available as DLC if you need it), and the gameplay is pretty fun. The one complaint I have is that the game isn't as intrinsically rewarding as others due to an arcade-y feel to it, but that's easily remedied with friends or chill teammates. Character/ship cosmetics available for (cash) purchase, but definitely nowhere near necessary to enjoy the game or get an edge.

TL:DR: Part 2:
Get it if you want a casual online meetup game, grab it on sale if you're not that interested.

Fun fact: The devs host a  battle between them and the players every so often, if you beat them you get free stuff.

The game itself is 7/10 [i]if[/i] you are into this style of game play. That is multicrewed vehicle co-op.

--------------------------------

[i](This review is rambling, disjointed,  and spur of the moment. I may or may not come back and clean it up later. I was inspired to post one quickly just because of how some of the ""Most Helpful"" reviews came from people who seemingly never actually played the game.)[/i]

Solid game, but not without its flaws. The biggest of which is the grind. This just simply isn't a style of game that works well with having a heavy grind. Having skills, items, and ships locked behind ""Play X matches with (insert faction here)"" gets to be pretty tedious when each match can take up to 30 minutes.

Reading through some of the reviews for the game though I was rather surprised to see how many of the them apparently never even bothered to click the ""Create Match"" button (some with dozens of hours!) and hop on out here to claim that ""You need (insert insane number of players here) to even play the game!!!"".

That is [i]completely[/i] wrong. A single match takes anywhere from 1 to 16 players across a max of 4 ships. Any empty crew slots on a ship are taken over by (very capable) AI. As an example, a group of 4 players can decide to each fly their own ship, all be on a single ship, or anything in between.

And yes, again, you can very easily play alone. The AI crew [i]will not hold you back[/i]. They're actually better than most of the random players that you'll come across. As long as you tell them what to do with the quick commands.

As far as the gameplay goes? It's pretty solid. The ships are very different from each other, so choosing one to suit your style goes beyond just ""How many guns does it have"". Handling, what types of guns can it mount and how many, the layout, engines, etc are all things that you can consider to find one that suits your play style.

The weapons are as equally varied. There is everything from a minigun that is effectively a point and click to cannons where the gunner has to consider their own speed, target's speed, distance, and relative movement. The weapons also inflict different types of damage. Some are great at starting fires, other are great at stripping off armor, and some are well suited for popping the ever so critical balloon.

The mission types are... OK. They're fun, but they aren't quite enough of them to suit my tastes. They effectively boil down to ""Defend"", ""Kill Everything"", and ""Go Here"". Which, in the context of airship combat is certainly fun, but after a while it leaves me wishing from something more.

The sound and music are good. Just by listening you can tell what weapons are being fired, what the captain is doing with the engines, and so on. And the music is certainly fitting. I can't really expand on the music too much as I never listen to a game's music as I prefer my own. But, don't take that as a hit against the game's music. It's just me.

The graphics... Are passable. Some things look good (the ships) and some things look terrible (the characters). The post processing is absolutely horrific though. I'd recommend that everyone completely disable that setting at least once to see the difference. It just clouds, blurs, and obstructs your vision.",1537551914,1537551914,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You need a few hours to learn how to play in the different roles (captain. gunner and engemeer), but once you understand everything it becomes really satisfying.
If you're a new player be a noice guy and listen to more skilled players, so you will learn how to play properly even faster. 
If you're asking yourself what game you shoud buy, I advice you to get Alliance, because you will get a copy of Online too, so you'll have both PvP and PvE game modes.

Then suddenly,

We try out Alliance.

It's pretty ok. Still can't name myself TwoFarts, so I'm still TwoFats. Other than that, it's always a good time to go up in some dumb airship with some people you know and some you don't, and kill all the bad people who insulted your tiny hat. The game has a small playerbase, but it's ok becuase almost everyone I've met is chill and sometimes even slavic. Make sure to rush B during defense, blin. There was this one guy who was whining about a new guy not knowing how to play, but it was ok because everyone made fun of him for being a whiny crybaby who has no girlfriend who takes a game way to seriously, and I personally trained the new guy so he's mediocre now.

Also MUSE fix your AI director normal is way too easy and any other difficulty is literally the dArK Souls of Guns of Icarus. DOn't matter if the AI pull back once you are close to die, there is an absurd amount already guuning for you and they just kill you anyway. was once in a 4 ship lobby vs. hard ai and so many enemy spawned that we got surrondeed and poundered and not in the fun way.

if you area playeing the game i recommenrd defense is the best also MUSe hurrry up with endless defsense ok?

I had hoped that this game would be better than it's predecessor but it's the polar opposite of what made it's predecessor somewhat good.

You would think that PvE is EXACTLY what this game needed. And you'd be right, because it is.
You would think that the PvE is similar to normal PvP matches, and that it solves the issue of having a lot of people required to play a game that has an extremely thin community. You are very wrong.

The fact is that to play PvE you still need a full crew on your ship (No surprises there) but you also need to find a match with 2 full crews, which is honestly ridiculous. I  can see that they wanted to make it so that the whole fleet would work as one but even if you DO find a match, no one talks between each other to coordinate smack, not like it helps anyways BECAUSE:

The AI is garbage and they will just throw dozens of them to overwhelm you.
It is not even funny, the AI will literally RAM YOU, go right up next to mountains, sometimes CRASH INTO OBSTACLES, and you will STILL DIE, because there are 6 ships doing exactly the same.

Bu incelememizde sizi ilk saatlerde sıkmazken daha sonraları bunaltan bir oyuna bakacağız...
Guns of Icarus kesinlikle ve kesinlikle takım ile oynanan, free takılmak isteseniz bile buna izin vermeyen, illa savaş gerektiren bir oyundur. Neden böyle pat diye kötülediğimi sorabilirsiniz. Evet kötülemememin sebebi şirketin elinde güzel bir malzeme varken bunu yalnızca gemi savaşlarına odaklı bir şey yapması bana göre aşırı derecede saçma olmuş. 

Şimdi oyuna geçmeden evvel müziklerinin gayet hoşuma gittiğini söylemek isterim. Ayrıca oyundan evvel karakterimizin ve gemimizin özelleştirilmesi beni baya bi umutlandırmıştı. Hatta ve hatta bir birlik seçip onun adına savaşmamız istenmesi bile beni heyecanlandırmıştı. 
FAKAT oyunu oynamaya başladığımda hayal kırıklığına uğradım diyebilirim. Güzel bir trailer ı varken training i güzel bir şekilde gösterirken, hikaye ile çok da alakası olmayan savaşlara girmekten, sürekli onu bunu patlatmaya çalışmaktan artık gına geleceğiniz bir oyun olduğunu malesef görmüş oluyorsunuz.

Şimdi burda bana kızan kişiler olduğuna eminim. ""Ulan gerizekalı ne bekliyodun ki zaten?"" falan dediğinizi de duyar gibiyim. Fakat dediğim gibi firmanın elinde çok harika bir malzeme var ve hikayesi de gayet ilgimi çekti. Bunu yedirmek adına sürekli savaşmaktan ziyade free takılacağımız, içinde rpg ögelerinin de bulunduğu açık dünya haritasına sahip bir oyun da yapılabilirdi bence. Hatta ve hatta savaşlarda onu vur bunu öldür tarzı görevler yerine daha yaratıcı görevler verilebilirdi. Veyahut savaşları görev olarak verebilirdi.
Sonuçta arkadaşlarımızla oynuyoruz evet. Fakat aksiyon manyağı biri değilseniz ordan oraya koşturup gemi patlatmaktan en fazla ne kadar zevk alabilirsiniz onu gerçekten merak ediyorum. Oyunun haritaları gerçekten büyük. Oyundaki grafikler gerçekten harika. Aksiyon dur durak bitmiyor evet fakat bence bu oyun böyle olmalıydı kanımca.

Oyunun serverleri var fakat çoğu şifreli. Yani anlayacağınız üzere herkes kendi arkadaşlarıyla bu oyunu oynuyor. Kendiniz bir server açsanız bile yarım saat sonra oyuna başlıyorsunuz. Oyuncu sayısında ciddi şekilde eksiklik var. Yani oynadığım süre zarfında üç haneli sayıları geçtiğini görmedim. 
Oyunda farklı roller var ve savaşta işe yarar özellikler barındırıyor. Fakat botların birçoğu aptalca hareketler sergiliyor ve çoğu zaman diğer işlere bile kendiniz koşturmak zorunda kalıyorsunuz. Yani bu oyunu oynamak istiyorsanız arkadaş şart. 

Kısacası umduğumun çok altında olan, sürekli amaçsızca bir şeyler patlattığımız, görevlerin ve savaşların mantığının hemen hemen birbirinin aynısı olan, elde güzel bir malzeme varken bunu bana göre çok kötü bir şekilde bize sunan, serverlarının azlığını geçtim aktif oyuncu sayısının beklediğimden çok çok altında olan bu oyunu ciddi söylüyorum sağlam bir arkadaş ortamınız yoksa kesinlikle ALMAYIN. Serverlar dediğim gibi boş, oyuncular kurduğunuz oyuna yarım saatte anca geliyor, oyun arasanız bile şanslı değilseniz 15 dakika beklemeniz gerekiyor. Yani tamamiyle multiplayer üzerine kurulmuş, keşke hikayesi olsa dediğim, hikayesi olmasa bile en azından RPG ve açık dünya olmasını beklediğim bu oyun beni gerçekten hayal kırıklığına uğrattı. Grafikleri ve müzikleri güzel olabilir. Fakat yine de kurtarmıyor.

Just as a quick disclaimer, I have been a fan of the original Guns of Icarus and had over 200 hours. The concept of steam punk pirate ships in a pvp setting would catch the interest of just about anyone. I will giving as objective a review as possible, as even if I don't reccomend it, I want you to know I wish I earnestly could. 

[b] The Good [/b]
Guns of Icarus Alliance has an interesting addition of PvE which, in theory, would have only bolstered the game's already interesting gameplay.The DLC, adds some cool looking ships with some fancy clans to join as well. 

[b] The Bad [/b]
With so little I found about the good in this game, we're going to dive deeper into why this game frustates me as well as the legacy players of the days of old. 
-The gameplay is stale
I have found that being a captain is GoIA is honestly one of the most boring things to do in a PvE scenario, having only played 3 hours, I found little to no variety in the maps that essentially feel like glorified fetch quests. GoIA adds a system to fight over territories where the grind feels unrewarding and ultimately feels like a waste of time. 
-Hardly any new content as a whole
For $15.00USD I would not reccomend buying this. This new 'game' is hardly worth 5 with the amount of effort it feels went into the development. The pvp meta has changed very little in the 2 years I waited to play this (coming from GoI) Meaning that with no new ways to really change up the way we fight on ships, the new content leaves much more to be desired. 
-Poor Map Design 
As the maps are generally linear, or have very limited spacing in regards to objective pathing, the game just feels like a very shallow objective simulator. With no real effort to make challenging maps, the game becomes stale very quickly. 
-Clunky UI
This shouldn't need too much explaining, the menus just feel excessive, not clean as they probably intended. 

[b] The Ugly [/b]
This game has just been handled incorrectly for years. Plain and simple, watching mistake after mistake being made, the only reason I was even wanting to play this is because it was being given out for free, allowing me to review it fairly. The fact that very little has been done to change anything significant in the game. I LOVE this game in my own way, but the fact that there is no feasible way to revive this player base breaks my heart. I used to binge this game constantly but then as alliance launched, I felt torn as even now, this offers nothing interesting enough to warrant a price tag. If anything, this feels like it should be free DLC, thats honestly how little it really has to offer. All I can say is, I wish Muse the best, should they learn from their mistakes, their next game might change the world.

Starting with a woefully lacking playerbase,  this game requires up to two full parties of players to launch a match, even in a non-PVP match.  You can make by with less than two full parties, but the duties of those players persist, and the NPCs only work to a certain level of skill.  This said, All the problems stated below only get worse as you fill player roles with NPCs... if you can even get a match started due to the lack of players at a given time.

The roles are unbalanced and their rewards are equally unenthralling.  a good 80% of lasting rewards are ship upgrades, which only applies to the pilot of any given team.  On occasion, you'll unlock a small handful of the dissapointingly limited amount of cosmetic options, but those options will feel too far distant from each other unless you have a chance to play Pilot.

The job of each role themselves can vary slightly, but generally:
* The Pilot need only control and direct the ship,  using items that come at the cost of the ship's health (which has to be rectified by the engineer). A good pilot can make the team, they require an understanding of their ship, it's limitations, and how quickly or easily it can be repaired or be removed from a sticky situation... but you won't find many good pilots
* The gunner need only really point the gun in the right direction and hold down the fire button, but they're at the mercy of the pilot's skills, as there is very little auto-track targeting, and as a gunner you get zero say in the weaponry mounted on the ship.
*The Engineer does everything,  from reparing damage from other ships, repairing damage caused by the pilot, to ignoring the core role to leach out extra DPS or cover for a pilot alseep at the wheel.  The game suggests an unenforced two-engineer-per-ship standard, but due to the demand of the job, you'll likely end up with two gunners and a pilot on your team.

The kit your class/role takes into the game to drive the position is creatively poised, as you can take up to a certain amount of a selection of role-appropriate skills plus one crossrole of each other role.  This is where role flexability seems to end, however, as each class has an independant level and requires grinding to become optimal.  There is no opportunity to change roles on the fly if you need to juggle positions in a pinch (despite the fact that you can with strict limitations due to the crossrole options).  


I've played a fair deal of this game, before and after the alliance expansion, and though I really enjoyed it with a static group of friends, the grind and monotony takes it's toll.  It's lack of real variation of play, unimpressive in-game rewards, dying playerbase, and strained but forced role role exepectations make this game a hard recommendation.  Grab it if you can get it on sale/free, and only if you can get 3-7 more people to join you in the mix.   It is worth your time and money, but only as long as those friends hold out... otherwise you're better off getting an old MMO and grinding it out there for all the good it'll do you.",1530318136,1530318136,False,20,3,0.622887313365936279,0,False,False,False,False,,,

基本は『Guns of Icarus Online（GoIO）』と全く同じで、そこにPvEモードと國取り合戦が追加されたものとなってます。本作を持っていればGoIOも実質不要です。
4人一組で飛空艇に乗り、全員で船の操舵・修理・砲撃を行なって敵飛空艇を撃墜していくのが「Guns of Icarus」の特徴。
4人で全てを弄るのではなく、クラスごとに割れて作業を行なうので誰が何をすべきか明確に分かる分、遊ぶのも慣れるのも簡単です。

最大16人というのも4人一組が4隻、これでPvP又はPvEができ、足りない部分においてはNPCが参加して補完されますが、あまり知的じゃ無いので可能ならフレンドと4人一組で人員を埋めるのが望ましいです。
醍醐味であるPvEは、様々なルールどれをとっても敵の数がかなり多く、フレンドと遊ぶゲームとしてはワイワイ遊べて良いもですし、状況報告し合ってミッションをクリアした時の達成感は今でも面白いです。

PvPについては、マッチングはGoIOと併せて行われ、全ての要素を触ることができます。逆にPvEモードはアンロック方式で船やスキルを解除していくので本作本来の楽しみ方ができると思います。
なおPvEをプレイする際は、人数が多いほど楽なのでできたら8人ぐらいで遊べると最高です。",1529998128,1529998195,True,24,0,0.74653017520904541,1,False,True,False,False,,,

Guns of Icarus Alliance is a game developed and published by Muse Games, the same people behind Guns of Icarus Online, Guns of Icarus Alliance is a sort of expansion to the main game

The game features all of the content from the original title, but with the addition of player-vs-environment cooperative experiences, an ongoing war between six elite factions vying for control of a world ravaged by machines, and an ever-changing world that is constantly being shaped and reshaped by the players

If you ever played Introversion Software's Uplink, you'd feel right at home with Hacknet. It is a hacking simulated game where you enter into people's computers, steal their precious data and earn cash

The Guns of Icarus franchise is a fantastic indie game series especially to play with your friends, from piloting a ship to fixing the damaged hull to firing flames to the enemy ship. Guns of Icarus Online and Guns of Icarus Alliance truly show how it feels like to be on a ship!

This game has allot of potential. However it lacks basic game features that most multiplayer games have these days that I find it frustrating to mention because its not an aspect that needs to be discussed however it is behind the reason failure of why this game is slowly dying... They mix their new players with competitive players so you will always have a ship with one or more newbies. The problem is because the newbie doesnt know how to play. They need to be constantly mentored on how to operate the ship and how to to their job. Its fun at first because you might actually learn some new leadership talents through this game... However it is dull when you keep coaching players almost every round I play... about 15% of my gaming experience is held with actual pros. At the end it leaves the player angry because you wasted soo much time playing this game that you always have somebody ruining for you and if its a newbie its sad because he wont enjoy and nethier will the player who is most loyal to the game.
The tuturials are weak in comparision... the game is trial and error learning... though it would have been better if they simply advised the players on how to operate a ship rather than learning first hand on board and usually not getting ir right until after 20 times. Would have been nice if they allowed professionals to design tutrials for players so that its not necsearry to keep training players... 
Simply IT should have been a Casual lobby for training and learning.. Competitive lobby for Veterans and skilled players...

Oh boy what a blast !

Airships vs. Airships, with many possibilites in outfitting your character as well as your ship to fit your playstyle, many types of ships for you to discover, and a generally very helpful community and devs. The gameplay is something very unique, and is very well executed. 

I have to say, if you have a bunch of friends and want to have a great time together, get this game! The only downsides are the generally low amount of players and the complexity this game shows in the beginning. Neither of them is much of an issue however: the co-op mode is difficult enough to provide you a challenge against clever bots, it features many gamemodes, and you don't need to wait for many teammates because the AIs will listen to every command you give; the game is indeed very complex at start, however by replaying the tutorial and reading the not-so-long manual, you definitely will get a grip of what's going on, and can then hone your skills in co-op! 

You will rarely run into people raging (I've never encountered any myself except from my friends shouting in my ear), maybe some people will speak a language differnt than yours, but there is always a built-in voice command if you don't feel like talking yourself.

TL;DR : This game is a fun game to try out, with friend or without. I definitely recommend it with friends, but if you prefer to play solo then either wait for a discount, as the enjoyment in singleplayer is rather limited.",1528855079,1528855079,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Because I feel it's important for indie devs to have feedback, I wanted to hand out my opinion so far:

The bad points: 

- Questionnable UI: It required us one full hour to get accostumed to the weird elements. Most games now have the social tools in right bottom of the screen, this game has it in top left. Notifications have no sounds. We didn't manage to play the tutorial together, and it ruined a lot our immersion into the game. We almost dropped because of that. When you receive an invitation to play a game, you don't have the option to accept or refuse. Rather, when you click on the notification, the game automatically understands it as if you accept the invitation. So it's bad. A little green square with ""accept"" and a little red square with ""refuse"" would be far more intuitive. Another thing I noted, if you leave a game (in coop supposingly), you cannot resume to the party you are in (as usual) and so, you can't configure your loadoat, if you can, I didn't find how.  

- The worst thing in a game that is supposed to focus heavily on strategy and build up, is that you cannot see what your teamate choose for their tools. It makes most choice you make redundant because the game doesn't give you the option to visualise easily your allies' loadoats. For example: the special ability, that is equivalent to an ultimate in most moba games, can be wasted if two ingies picks the same (or reduce greatly its effectiveness). There should be a way where you are in game to see your allies loadout as well, or at least now the cooldown of their ""special abilities"". 

- The whole thing about factions. While the game seems to emphasise a lot on that, I don't see what it brings to me as an individual player, nor I see what imput I have in the whole war when I invest the money of the ""war chest"" somewhere. It just feels like it's pointless. I don't feel involved and it's wrong. There are no tutorial or guides in game that is clearly shown to explain the mechanics. The only thing I know it's the factions when you reach a certain level gives you access to weapons or ships (I suppose). The mechanics about the faction should be more properly explained. 

- I have a mid-tier setup and the game lags heavily, even with the lowest setting in coop, making it almost unplayable at some points, especially during boss fight when there is a lot of particles. At some points, it feels like a chore to play. 

- I saw in some guides it's useless to pick anything else for a tool than the spyglass. Then, why would you enable the ingies and the gunners to choose the other equipments? It feels pointless and just confuse more the new players. There should be a note in red at least that the piloting equipments aside from the spyglass are not usefull if you don't pick the pilot. 

The good points:

- Despite what I said previously, the game is still fun to play. The game delivers what I expected it to sell: a team-based game with steampunk ships. This aspect gives this game an unique flavor where you cannot find elsewhere, because the player itself is completly absorbed in one bigger entity called the ship, that functions in the maner of a hive mind. 

- The option to play with IA and the opportunity for other players to join your game is great! Despite what's the other reviewers postulated that this game is dead, I was pleasantly surprised that some people joined our game. So far, I have little thing to say about the community, since I only met two or three people but they seemed mostly involved toward the goals fixed by the game, which is nice. 

To conclude, so far, I have a positive view on this game. Let's see how it will develop in the future.",1528638348,1528638436,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,True,False,False,,,

There is a larger MMO territorial control aspect to this game.  The type where you see a big map and contribute gold towards some outcome in the near future.  I wish developers could figure out a way to have to player directly experience these activities to make the ""war"" more inclusive instead of a map that control.

Guns of Icarus Online, вышедший аж в 2012 году, продолжает развиваться: разработчики делают новые патчи, игровое сообщество, несмотря на очень на низкий онлайн, функционирует. Но этого недостаточно для игры, напрямую зависящей от игровой аудитории. Поэтому дельцы из Muse Games решили, как говорится, подкинуть дров в котел и выпустить крупное обновление с новыми деталями и улучшениями. 
Guns of Icarus Alliance – так окрестили апдейд разработчики – привнесет игре новый игровой режим, целый ряд кораблей, пушек и динамичных карт. Первое, что вызывает интерес – режим. Создатели реализовали давно обещанную карту гильдий, на которой отображаются подконтрольные крупными группировкам территории. Теперь перед игроками появится возможность сплотится с другими пилотами в онлайне для захвата и контроля больших земель. 

Крупным альянсам предстоит не только нападать, но и защищаться. На каждой контролируемой территории есть база, захват которой обуславливает захват всей территории. Игроки смогут строить турели, укреплять строения для более эффективного отражения вражеских атак. Нападающим же гильдиям придется подготовить хоть какой-нибудь план наступления. 
Продолжая тему нововведений, стоит отметить увеличение максимального количества игроков в PvE до 16. Это поможет кланам совершать рейды на боссов для сбора ресурсов. А уничтожать боссов игроки будут новым оружием, летая на новых кораблях, каждый из которых потребует свою тактику содержания. Например, тот же боевой Anglean Corsair, имея несколько уровней технических палуб, потребует от команды развитых инженеров.",1527933383,1527933383,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Good:
+Can be run in LQ settings with a medium-tier laptop
+The airship combat leaves room for meaningful tactical choices
+Engineer/gunner jobs are somewhat casual roles, pilot/captain has the depth
+The leveling system is pretty. You get level ups pretty frequently to avoid the impression of being locked out á la some high-revenue games ( *cough League of Legends, CrossFire and Battlefront 2 2017 cough* ).
+It is not pay-to-win. Only cosmetics are sold. There are plenty of free costumes, so there is absolutely no pressure to spend extra money on this game.
+There are community events. Overally the community is pretty cool and non-judging even if you suck at the game. I haven't experienced a single griefer in this game.
+There is a lot of complexity in the ship and crew configurations. You can choose your TF2 style hats, items and special powers, rename the ship as ""Your Mom"" or ""You Are Adopted"" and pick some wacky guns for your ship. Very quickly you unlock half a dozen different ships, though the starter one seems to be in casual sense the best. No running through multiple decks for half a minute looking for that pesky balloon to repair on that one.


The Bad:
-The major battles can get unplayable laggy, to be point inputs drop like crazy and simple tasks like aiming with the gun and getting it to shoot reliably requires silly stuff like double-tapping and annoying levels carefulness
-It feels like a job and consequently attracts the MOBA flavour 3L1T3 PR0 gamers who view it as such and are super serious about winning.
-PvE aka ""CO-OP""battles feel like endless slogs are worsen the ""feels like a job"" impression. Killing in PvE is ungratifying as the enemies keep respawning at a rapid rate (often exactly behind the player ship that is awful for killing fun factor in many ways)
-PvP games are simpler and less dull, though there are much less players for that
-The feeling of windedness from 
-The min-maxed PvP tactics. Everyone picks the weapons that are most cheap and most damaging, killing the variety. I see a lot of fire weapons being used.
-The ""World"" i.e. the tabletop risk game where players dump their otherwise worthless ""war coins"" (!?) to advance the progress bars of their faction. It is boring busywork.
-The main gameplay is outright repetitive. For instance, an engineer repairs, guns and pilots, a gunner mostly guns and occasionally repairs his gun and pilot pilots the ship. 
-Trying to get the full view of the ship and its surroundings is very difficult, let alone navigating yourself to where you need to be on the ship. On some ships, it can easily take 20 seconds of dedicated moving just to get to a remote part of the ship to fix it. Did I mention the game feels like work?
-The player retention is horrible. Finding players to play with is difficult. Mostly because of how inherently non-casual it is in how much WORK-like dedication it takes to properly play it. It practically has a reverse fun factor: the longer you play it, the worse you will feel. In comparison, the match rewards feel like nothing and the game feels like waste of time.
-It is a bit grindy. Nothing progresses if you do not play, preferrably for the win as defeats yield considerably less goodies regardless of the level of effort on the part of the player.
-It randomly crashes. It is outright unplayable in the defaul DX11 mode and still occasionally hangs in the much more stable DX9 mode, that you can only enter by running the game from Steam app library page.
-It has voice chat. The XBOX Live cancer is possible from those SERIOUS BIZNEZ -crowds. You have been warned. The lack of player retention makes this pleasantly rare, though.
-It is made with Unity. This is a very, very, very bad thing. I had to set my ATI settings to power-saving mode to stop it from overheating my GPU. Every Unity game has this effect and pretty much means it is a diarrhea turd. That is the sugar-coated way to describe it.
-The overuse of signaling gets easily on the nerves. Those repeated audio bites with some voices are godawful.
-The lack of variety in mission objectives. Kill, destroy or protect by killing and destroying, with occasional pressing of G to rope a floating supply balloon for bonus points. It gets old after the first time you do it. You'll end up doing it constantly if you keep playing this game. PvP and PvE are similar in this sense, except that PvP enemies have the variety of a human mind. Holy jumping boredom, Batman!

In summary, if you like airships and overly complicated, feels-like-work Team CO-OP games, this one's for you. 80% score . If you want to have a consistently casual, fun experience, your dissatisfaction is likely. 20% score. Because of the crazies who are likely to enjoy a game like this one, I have to technically recommend the game. Maybe it is better with friends. I got the free promotion entry and frankly it mostly feels like pain and I would have regretted paying any money for it.

По сути апдейт с сo-op режимом выживания против ИИ.
Новые корабли,пушки,фракции,костюмы,исправлены баги.
Игра подойдет не только  любителям steampunk,хоть сеттинг игры именно стимпанковский.
Единственный её минус-маленький онлайн,иногда опускается до 100-200 человек.
Комьюнити игры-минимум школьников и максимум серьезных отыгрывающих роль людей.
В общем,советую всем,цена-смешная,при этом получаете в библиотеку и DLC Alliance и оригинал GOI.Пару десятков часов веселья обеспечены.
Но прийдется выучить английский (80% игроков англоговорящие).

And first tries were a bit tough, silent teams, lots of enemies, falling overboard.
All that said once you really get the hang of it- awesome cooperative possibilities.

The airships are very diverse and done with love, lots of positions and tactics possible.
And the players community is very good, even with the influx of new people.

Faction system feels that it comes a BIT too early, not much of conscious choice.
Though you can change your faction later on.
The strategic layer of factions is both simple and interesting, it does feel like a real war.
Faction leadership switches every 4 days, and the players that contributed the most get to form a sort of a war council.

Another issue is the game offers a lot of things that could be paid for for free, and the paid parts are very decently prized.
For example: you cant really buy weapons or airships, just earn them ingame.
Only paid parts are decorative items/styles/paints etc.

One where you get a starter ship and you join a faction and you do things with that faction. You can have a ship and you can go out and attack and claim areas. You can have full AI crew until players take over. You level up by killing enemies and doing objectives and maby there are some story missions. as you level and get funds you can then get better ships and weapons but that means that the amount or size of enemies will scale with you as they see you as a stronger force. With maps you could go around and sight see. Dick around with others and feel alittle bit more like your flying a ship. Every map currently will always feel like a ant farm. you have a small defined area and small tunnels you can move threw. Il recommend this but I dont really recommend this just its idea. The Fact that their still is no real single player is slightly rediculous. The Concepts this ""DLC"" added were good ideas but they were added as generic as any low level dev or dev team would in the form of a map that you click a few things on and thats it and a slight alteration of the exact modes that are pvp with the exact map style. You Immediatly are thrown into a map and you either kill or capture a point and DONE!
Rinse wash repeat... no time to just fly around and look at the map or jack around. the same ships over and over because humans always tend to play the same 2 ways over and over... either the worst way or the best way. If they had a HQ with points you capped on a huge map woven from the smaller maps all together with a bit of space between them that would have allowed for so much more. the AI fights could have been larger and more thematic. and their could also then be pvp inside those pve fights... the entire game isnt bad its just small and limiting. you always immediately have to proceed to the same 2 things and then bam its done and its done in a small tight area with very to no freedom to do anything else.

We have yet to try the actual PvP mode of the game but since our little circle was never about competitive gaming we are not likely to do so for now.
The problems we experienced came from our lack of knowledge about the game. For example, you can not actually choose the ship you use the way we have imagined, along with starting a casual/custom PvE game.
Start playing folks, this game is a must-play. Never have I, or my firends seen such a game as this. Complicated yet understandable, hard yet enjoyable, PvP yet PvE.

I have enjoyed many great experiences so far and met some great people. Unfortunately, it also attracts a noticeable amount of frustrated people who transfer onto others far too excessively.

The pros:
- Fun mission based adventures allow for great teamwork and camaraderie with a real need to become a tight-knit unit for higher level challenges.
- Smooth game physics, an immersive environment, and a stable game build.

The cons:
- A faction system where the limited number of regular players are further split into small groups/clans who attempt to compete with each other for world dominance. This is where the game is unable to deliver sustainability and becomes polarised which in turn sees players drift away. Players and groups can get overly absorbed by the never ending war. As such, it can cause players not to mix with 'outsiders' and can get needlessly bickery and hostile. 
- Intolerant controling menaces who would benefit from joining an air ship rage support group to discharge their pent up frustrations elsewhere.
- A lack of matching tools to support newer players. New players are thrown in with experienced players and it is not always a pleasant experience due to the skill range.

Overall, an eclectic and dynamic masterpiece that just needs to remove its polarising features to make it more about the adventure and not the endless cycle of territorial loss and gain.

Это DLC должно было решить эту проблему если не полностью, то, хотя бы, частично.
Собственно, ставим вопрос, справилось ли оно со своей задачей?

И да, и нет.

С DLC пришли фракции, глобальная мировая карта, где фракции играют с монеточками, думая, где атаковать, а где защищать. (не путайте с открытым миром) Пришли и новые корабли, элементы кастомизации, в общем, косметика, которая призвана подчеркнуть в вас вашу индивидуальность. (А ведь она так нужна при таком количестве игроков!) В любом случае, приятный бонус.

Весь геймплей дополнения направлен на Co-op, то есть, воевать придется против ботов, что очевидно. Существуют различные миссии на 1, 2, 3 и даже 4 экипажа. То есть, ко-оп до четырех кораблей по четыре человека. А если меня чему-то и научила улица, так это арифметике! Четыре на четыре... Это будет так-с... Шестнадцать! Хороший такой кооператив. Задания тоже различаются. Где-то банальная атака стационарных целей, где-то их защита в разных форматах, привези-увези, убей, отрази волны, убей босса. Геймплей, в целом, не изменился. Так как это боты, то врагов вы встретите заметно больше. Много вам подобных экипажей, а ещё самолётики не дадут заскучать, а также не забудьте про стационарные структуры, некоторые из которых тоже не дадут себя в обиду. А на блюдечке с голубой каёмочкой ещё и босс прилетит под эпичную музыку, убийство которого зачастую необходимо. Зато за его убийство бонус дают! Кстати о бонусах, помимо бонусов существуют ещё специальные грузовые маленькие корабли, которые по своей сути безобидны, но за их уничтожение вы тоже получаете свои бонусы. Например, улучшенная выживаемость. 

Вы закончили миссию? Поздравляю, вы получите опыт на классе, фракции и-и-и-и...Монетки! Неужели валюта, за которую можно покупать что-то интересное для себя? Почти. Это очки, которые нужно спускать на мировой карте, чтобы ""финансировать"" операции по защите или атаки, закупая туда солдат различных сортов или проводя другие махинации. Если не таить греха, то эта идея не доведена до ума, ибо скучна она как школьный КВН. Возможно, я просто должен был в себе разбудить патриота своей фракции, но [strike] нет фракции лучше, чем Единая Россия.[/strike]

В любом случае, поиграться можно даже с одним другом в команде, оставив два места на корабле для ботов, отказавшись от прочих союзников. Вы всё так же будете получать опыт, монетки и всё такое, но геймплей может быстро надоесть. В этом кроется плюс своеобразной независимости от онлайна.

Обратная сторона состоит в том, что онлайн игры завис где-то на планке от 40 до 180 в среднем, в какие-то местные события, ясное дело, онлайн ещё выше поднимается, но согласитесь, что этого мало. А теперь тот онлайн, что есть в наличии, разделён на два лагеря: PvP и PvE. Найти живую душу для игры стало немного сложнее, хотя по личному опыту скажу, что быстрый поиск в PvE даже смог мне подобрать напарников и собранные экипажи. 

Новые пушки и корабли, кстати, довольно интересные. И даже имеют некоторое преимущество перед стандартными кораблями, либо так просто кажется. Хотя, один корабль из PvE контента не пустили в PvP, ибо его характеристики были слишком... Выдающимися. 

Последним пунктом отмечу, что в игру завезли неплохую музыку, в конце концов. Завезли временные и динамические топы игроков фракции, то есть, систему лидеров. (Лидеры играют некоторую роль на мировой карте) У фракций милый лор, хотя, субъективно, стиль мне их не особо понравился. Лору и фракциям нужно какое-то развитие. Разработчики до сих пор устраивают совместные игры с аудиторией, победителей вознаграждают предметами из магазина, часто на выбор победителя. А некоторые карты даже способны радовать глаз!

So when Muse released Alliance, which promised and featured pve combat on top of the pvp content, i, like probably many other, was skeptical; what could they have added on top of the current game, and how would they have approached pve? Especially since it was considered a standalone release, and requiring old players to pay the price of a full game for the new content. It isn't until recently, following a massive sale on the game and a promotion by Muse, that i have the chance to try out Alliance.

Verdict? Boy, they delivered.

The implementation of new features really help the game, such as the introduction of AI crewmates. PvE was handled excellently with a plethora of maps and gamemodes with varying difficulties. I can see myself running out of options to play, however, so adding new modes and new maps, perhaps new ships too, in the future will help the longevity of the game. 

The overarching plot and factions are interesting, though a little bare-bones at the moment; each faction feels colorful and unique; in fact, the factional enemy ships from pve use unique models, from the light mook ships to the titanic boss ships, and the overworld campaign feels satisfying in a way that it rewards players for their contributions, make their efforts feel like they pay off, and pave way for storytelling through important events.

Overall, i consider GoI Alliance to be an excellent step up from GoI Online. While it's still rough around the edges, i can safely recommend this game.",1526411854,1526411854,True,16,1,0.685804963111877441,0,False,True,False,False,,,

[h1]1. Геймплей:[/h1]
Вы инженер или стрелок или пилот. У каждого из этих классов есть скиллы которые уже открыты и немного закрытых - разблокируемых  с получением уровня, который начисляется отдельно для каждого класса. Первая проблема заключается в том, что награды за победу в матчах насколько ""никакие"", что мотивация ""фармить до ycpачки"" полностью отсутствует. Каждый из  классов вызывает дискомфорт разного характера. 
[h1]1.1. Инженер:[/h1]
Вы носитесь по вашему кораблю, конструкция которого специального разрабатывалась для вашего неудобства. Суть инженера заключается, очевидно, в ремонте посудины, которая каждую секунду, то горит, то разваливается. Иногда складывается впечатление, что корабль не кусок фанеры, гoвна и ржавых металлоконструкций - а живое создание. И оно само хочет умереть. По вам дали очередь из подобия тяжелого пулемета? Пол корабля загорится, пол корабля сломается. А что вы? У вас есть 3 инструмента и важные блоки корабля, в которые надо стучать, чтоб они чинились. И 90% времени вы будете смотреть на текстуры этих важных блоков. Интересно? Нет. При заходе в игру вы начинаете любоваться просторами каньона или рунами города с высоты полёта вашего корабля, а через 10 мин игры вы понимаете, что не можете себе этого позволить. Потому что промедление на 10 сек = провал операции. Возвращаясь к истории про конструкцию кораблей - представьте, что 2 важных блока корабля находятся в его трюме в упор друг к другу. Но разделены стенкой и входы в эти части трюма располагаются в разных концах корабля. Зачем стенка КАРЛ? Просто чтоб инженер долго перебегал??? 
[h1]1.2. Стрелок:[/h1]
Как можно было бы догадаться по названию, задача стрелка  - перебегать от турели к турели по кораблю и стрелять во всё что ""само напросилось"". В арсенале стрелка различные типы боеприпасов, подходящие для разных целей, но сам геймплей стрелка это обычный турельный шутер, который иногда вклинивают в игры (когда, например, вы стрелок на крыше хаммера и вам надо сопроводить конвой с гуманитарной помощью). А тут, представьте, эта вся игра стрелка. Да, он занимается перебежками, да он может слегка помочь инженеру в экстренной ситуации починить гнилое корыто, да он выберет подходящие боеприпасы. Но это всё 15% от его основной деятельности.
[h1]1.3. Пилот:[/h1]
Пилот - он же капитан корабля. Он же человек, которого не заставишь оторваться от штурвала и потушить двигатель. Он же якобы занятой. В отношении пилота всё просто. У него есть скиллы типа ""керосин"", ""парашют"" , ""ускорительная жижа"" итд. Как выяснилось, все пилоты независимо от уровня (который должен характеризовать его опыт) прожимают эти ""скипидары"" , после чего наступает скорая кончина. Или ниче не меняется, кроме поломки от этого буста. Пилот сидит за штурвалом посудины, его обзору мешает сама посудина и её компоненты. В управлении ничего замысловатого нет, но и удовольствие от этого получить достаточно сложно. 
[h1]1.4. ПвЕ и ПвП:[/h1]
В игре присутствует и то другое, но независимо от режима делать вы будете одно и тоже. Одинаково лететь, однаково стрелять, одинаково чинить. Всё ваше удовольствие держится исключительно на вашем воображении. Вы смотрите  на убогонькие текстуры двигателя, долбите молотком, но представляете себе как вокруг вас идёт напряженная борьба - мир в огне, смерть, агония и кровопролитие. А на самом деле: Стрелок затупил потому что его турель вращается по узкому радиусу и он просто слегка не дотягивается мушкой до вражеского корабля. Капитан летит по прямой, но с таким видом, как будто упахался. А одинокий бот мечется по палубе и не знает чем себя занять. Экшн прям! На один сессионный замес может попасть несколько союзных кораблей, у каждого свой капитан и действуют они совершенно не слажено. Это разные люди, скорее всего говорящие на разных языках, с чем то своим на уме. Заргенули - молодцы. В ПвП очень тяжело осознать проблему поражения. Сейчас у вас целый корабль и вы апгрейдили все компоненты. Через 5 сек его просто разорвало как хомячка. Кто виноват? Что надо было делать чтоб этого не произошло? Как можно было спастись? Умелые игроки знают ответы на эти вопросы, но вы - новичок. Вы уверены что хотите поиграть 50 часов, чтоб найти ответы на все вопросы? Вы просто перечитайте п. 1.1., 1.2., 1.3. - ибо ваша деятельность никак не изменится через 50 часов. По количеству народа - не скажу, что игра мёртвая, но и обратного я утверждать тоже не буду. На матч в перемешку с ботами вам хватит народу. Но это только благодаря тому, что людей всех уровней, наций и ботов перемешали. 
[h1]2. Графика и оптимизация: [/h1]
Почитав обзоры, я почти поверил что это старая, прожженная и отполированная игра. Работает даже на утюгах и тамагочах. Но нет. При определенных спецэффектах игра проседает по фпс как и у ютубных обзорщиков, так и у вас. Некоторые внезапные фризы и просадки по фпс могут стоить вам жизни. Не факт, что вам поможет скручивание ползунков в опциях на минимум. Так же в опциях меня сильно огорчила невозможность отключения эффекта film grain. После взрыва корабль разделяется на какие то черные кусочки фанеры и падает вниз исчезая в текстурах. Совершенно ничего эпичного, совершенно некрасиво. Модельки персонажей топорненькие, анимации примитивные. Есть неплохие варианты кастомизации персонажей как за донат так и бесплатные. Локации от красивых-до убогих. Либо красочный зелёный каньон, либо угнетающие, криво налепленые руины города в полумраке. Ваш персонаж для ремонта бьёт и молотком и гаечным ключем и разводным ключем...хорошо что огнетушителем не бьёт. С этим как то особо никто не заморачивался. 
[h1]3. Звук и музыка:[/h1]
К музыке разработчики подошли со всей ответственностью. Музыкальные композиции радуют, не сильно отвлекают, чередуются, меняются при встрече с босом. Можно даже не отключать музыку. Со звуком получается немного неестественно и увиденное совершенно не совпадает с услышанным. Вас уже разрывает на части, всё в огне, в баллоне дыра, турели строчат из последних сил, но команды капитана звучат задорно и непоколебимо, а вы как сидели в носу ковыряли, так и ковыряете. Узнали вы об этом, только потому что вспомнили, что кто то стрелял и на всякий случай - не сходить ли вам и не проверить, что там с корпусом? А корпус уже написал завещание. 

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Покупая эту игру, вы просто приобретёте фундамент для своего воображения. Сами представите себе веселье и экшн. Сами придумаете себе красоту полётов на дирижабле. А разработчик просто перетасует вас с буржуями и ботами. Представьте, что вы едите чизбургер, но вместе котлеты и сыра вы между булок вставили свой же палец(кто о чем подумал) и кушаете его. Потому что вам продали его с пустотой внутри, которую вы либо заполняете сами, либо чизбургер будет без сыра и котлеты. Исключив своё же воображение - совершенно не нашёл в игре ничего стоящего 349 руб. Игра обречена на вымирание и даже переход на фри ту плэй её не спасет.

I loved the first game, however I find that even running on a recent machine (1050Ti 4GB, 16 GB of RAM, Intel 7700 2.8 GHz ) isn't enough for a smooth experience. Unfortunately, exceeding the requirements does not net you steady 60 FPS even on very low settings, because PvE battles get quite busy and that tanks the performance quite hard. It's a shame because the game itself is good: the mechanics were already fun in the previous game, and the PvE is a very welcome breath of fresh air, yet these issues remain.

This game is great for playing with people who have a microphone. It heavily relies on the pilot of the ship to not put the crew in danger, as well as the crew to understand each other at what should they do. It's not worth for two people to be repairing the same component when another critical one is in danger, but in the heat of battle you can't figure this out right away. Those subtleties determine if the crew is efficient, combined with voice chat or even in game commands chat.
Spotting randomnly can give the pilot a big heads up rather than be hit by surprise.

The game isn't lacking in players, most of them are polite and don't criticise you, unless you deliberately sabotaged the ship by not playing the basics of your role. I have to stress out the importance of playing the tutorials / replaying them.

Do not be afraid of taking the role of the pilot if you have a good common sense at you, the players nevertheless won't insult you if you play badly, but that doesn't mean you should take your ship in the middle of an enemy raid.

+ Thrilling air battles. Smoke, fire, bad weather, explosions.... Airships creak and groan in the wind, and behave in a believably sluggish manner. Seconds count while you try to balance staying aloft with the need to put out as much damage as possible.

+ Interesting ""soft"" class system. I say ""soft,"" because everybody on the ship can technically do almost anything, but can only specialize in one of three areas. Engineers can fire weapons, but don't have the ammo skills of gunners. Gunners can repair things, but only get one tool. Pilots can leave the wheel to shoot and repair, but are similarly limited to one skill per off-class (i.e. one tool and one ammo). The end result promotes teamwork and skill, while punishing dysfunction.

+ Varied tools, skills and ammo types, each with benefits and drawbacks.

+ Singleplayer. While there is no campaign, and game types are limited since you can't have AI-piloted ships on your team, the game nonetheless offers some PvE for loners and people who prefer private matches.

+ Steampunk. The aesthetic, from ships to factions, is terrific. The backstory behind these visuals is unfortunately superficial, and there ain't a plot to speak of, but it's sufficient to set the stage for the main event (aerial chaos and destruction).

+ Friendly devs. I don't know all the details, but Steam has apparently stopped allowing certain ""Buy x, Get x free"" packages. To get around this, Muse Games offered a ""buy one, get three free keys"" deal, redeemable by sending them a screen grab of the Steam receipt via e-mail. They were soon swamped in receipts, of course, but have been working feverishly ever since to respond and get everyone their keys. It's above and beyond the call, and they seem to care about their player base.

CONS:

- Some animations are clunky, and walking around has a very retro ""floaty"" feel (like you're just a camera in motion, not a person).

- Interface is busy, and the ""help text"" pasted over every button and panel on the screen is nothing short of obnoxious.

- Microtransactions. Quite a few of them. ""Cosmetics only"" as the old line goes—some of it can be earned by playing, and the devs seem to be giving items away to players who defeat them in special weekly (or monthly?) matches. However, if this sort of content didn't really matter, then companies wouldn't hold it back to sell at an artificial premium later. When customizing your character's appearance is part of the game, cosmetic microtransactions affect gameplay by definition.

That said, there's nothing pay-to-win about any of this. Also, it's hard to complain too much since Muse Games has been so cool otherwise, to say nothing of the aforementioned sale and free keys. Still, the in-game real-money shop is a notable and sour blemish.

A few things I would like to see down the road are
-More than 4 person crew
-Bombing missions

-Ball turret on the bottom of the Airship would be sweet!

Then I remembered I got it free from Humble Bundle back in October. I just hadn't gotten around to playing it. It seems I really didn't miss much. I'm sure this type of game is for some people, but it just isn't for me.

I did all the tutorials. I found them excruciatingly boring. But I figured, well, it's not really fair to quit now when I haven't even played one online co-op game. I'm sure that where all the fun is. So I got on the queue to join a coop game. This is the day of the daily deal on Steam, surely there's lots of people online. Well, I was on queue for about 3 minutes so it wasn't that bad. I can imagine a normal day, however, when it's not the daily deal. 

Anyways, I get stuck as an engineer. Great, the one class that I was most bored with in the tutorial. You basically run around and bang on stuff or put a fire out. Maybe you get to shoot stuff if you're not taking too much damage. And sure enough, that was the whole game for me. We successfully completed our wave too. There were some rewards. But the biggest reward was being able to quit the game.  The game mechanics were just too simple and not very fun. The graphics are outdated. The UI and gameplay are clunky. (However, this game would probably be fun in VR & everyone has a mic and headset there.)

PVE in Alliance is a game changer compared to the original game IMO. Previously when it was PVP only, there was a small extremely experienced community, and you'd just get wrecked as a new player. PVE provides an on ramp that was badly needed for new players. You join one of six factions that compete against each other (by completing objectives in PVE) to take control of different zones of the world map.

The maps are great, there are a variety of ships that look and feel very different (including some that are faction specific), special ""boss"" class ships you go up against, and lots of different weapons to customize your ships loadout. You can also change your character's loadouts, appearance, and class.

Note that it is class based and playing as the captain class can be a problem when you are a base level captain playing with randoms. No one wants a captain with zero experience to cost them the mission. However, if you level up by playing with friends it is no problem, and your captain(s) in your group can level up and learn to play well enough to be taken seriously by randoms. Each class has a variety of different ammunition types, items, and active abilities they can equip (such as automated repair kits, speed boosts, etc) and you should coordinate all of this as a crew so you are prepared for any threat.

A lot of the missions have multiple allied ships working together, so you have 2-4 ships each with a 4 person crew. Sometimes we'd have 16 people and the captains would coordinate with both each other and their own crews (which is totally awesome) or I'd just be playing with 3 other friends manning one ship as a crew, or we'd all be captains of our own ships and our crew members would be bots. (Great way to level your captain class)

It is very teamwork focused, naturally, and offers an experience that's quite different from the likes of Vermintide and Left 4 Dead. Everyone needs to work together. If you have a mic and at least one friend who would play it with you, I'd highly recommend it.

In the PvP game even during prime gaming hours it can take more than 30 minutes just to get a game started as you wait for players to join and ready up. With this PvE game it's easy to play solo or with a friend; basically the wait time to get in a game has been reduced to zero which is a huge plus.

In the PvP game the small population base consisted of a few veterans preying on a few hapless newbies and not much in between. Matches were seldom balanced. The great thing about this PvE game is that you can adjust the difficulty settings, so the challenge level can always be just where you want it. Higher difficulties allow for greater rewards for completing missions.

What sort of rewards, you ask? Well the main reward is coins, which allows you to help your faction. There are six different factions to choose from, each with their own look and a few faction specific traits. These factions are constantly attacking and defending territory on a world map. It's up to you to look at the map and fight in the locations that will best help your faction, then spend the coins you've earned to help capture or defend territory.

It's an interesting mechanic that attempts to give purpose to your battlefield successes, and you'll see similar systems in multiplayer ""games as a service"" such as Planetside 2. Of course I'm sure it's impossible for one faction to conquer the whole world, the system is set up to prevent that from happening, and if some group of players got together to try and thwart the system I'm sure the devs would step in to stop them. So really it's more like an illusion of progress than anything, but basically it gives players a goal to work towards.

If a player is particularly successful they can be temporarily promoted to faction leader and issue commands to their entire faction which is pretty cool. The commands are usually along the lines of, ""Let's attack territory X and defend territory Y!"" Although rank-and-file faction members are under no obligation to follow their faction leaders it's often best to do so as faction leaders can apply buffs to their entire faction in specific battles.

The AI opponents range from small aircraft that deal minor damage to massive spawling bases with multilayered defenses that need to be systematically picked apart. There are a large variety of missions, maps, and airships to choose from, and there is some amount of randomization with the enemies to keep things fresh. Also, if you play the PvP game you can earn coins to spend in the PvE game (not that I can recommend PvP in its current state).

The game has minimal music. Sound effects consist of gunfire, roaring engines, howling wind, ect. There is a storyline but it's limited to an intro cinematic and a large encyclopedia that you can peruse as you're waiting for your game to start.

The game is still being actively updated. Just a few days ago in February 2018 they released a new airship for you to fly.

The $15 price tag is way too high and one reason why the player base is so low. Wait until it goes on sale for $5 or less and play it with a friend and you'll end up with a fun PvE airship combat game!",1520174858,1524949900,True,25,1,0.682725012302398682,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Figured I'd see how this holds up after a few months of not playing any PVE.

While this game doesn't have the fun i have with GoIO, and I have gotten burned out on the grindyness of it; I take a few months away, when i pick it up again I find myself wondering ""why did i stop in the first place?""

the PVE is fun to distroy tons of the AI ships (perticularly if it's from a faction my own is activly battling) but as mentioned it does feel grindy.  But it's grinding to try and help your faction (1 of 6 different factions)  conquer (or Liberate) various territories. 

At certain points, after a faction has enough resources, or territories in general it will trigger a war where 3 factions team against the other 3.  Although a 2v2v2 would be very interesting to see, and i would love to see it - hint, hint - reform the Northern Guard - -  ^.~

One very cool thing is they are keeping a Lore record of how these wars go. One where the top 3 players from each faction will be remembered in the Lore, which i find is just super cool world building.

So, to sum up:  I find i burn myself out on this much quicker than GoIO, upon revisting, it quickly reminds me why i played it enough to get burned out in the first place.  Really can't help but love it all over again.

The community is nice, albeit quite serious and geared towards veteran players. There are still updates, so it is still an active environment. 

(The release of Alliance replaces the original Guns of Icarus Online, but it is basically the same client. It adds a PvE campaign with an online progression feature, which is currently the main interest of both the developer and the community)

The gameplay is multiplayer only, but you can start a private server with AI. Communication or teamwork are quite important, but there are quick commands available and not all classes need to engage with it as intensively.

Flying a ship feels very cool and there is some tactical depth available, thus feels rewarding. Strategic superiority is superseded with instant fun however with the gunner which feels at least as great as flying when bringing down enemy ships. The pacing of it all is rather slow, but still quite intense. All-in-all it feels very immersive and just overall enjoyable, but there are some things I'd like to see different.

Which brings me to the lesser part of the game in my personal opinion, the engineer and repairing mechanic. The discrepancy lies in the fact that on-board gameplay is very frantic. This is most obvious in the very weird and fast movement and animations the characters have, I feel it distracts from the general gameplay and immersion.
Most importantly nobody likes whacking at things in a game 60-80% of the time!

The draw in this game is flying and shooting in multicrew ships, if the focus on engineering stays this strong it isn't going to pull in new players. The rest of the game is still very awesome, but I'd like to see some rebalancing in this area to keep playing it.

_____

Let me explain further for those who are willing to bear with me:

The different ship components get destroyed easily, parts take very little damage to this end. On the other hand they are just as easily repaired. This premise requires crewmembers to run around like crazy aimless chickens sometimes to keep everything working, and there are plenty of components to go around. The result is that PvP matches can be very long (30+ min.) if the engineer is doing good but nobody is shooting, or the complete opposite when he's making a mess.

I think it would be more enjoyable when damage models were different so that more is needed to destroy any single component, but it would be a lot harder to repair that certain component. Which would result in harder choices, but faster kills. This would also make it possible to enable a more realistic tone of charachter movement and animation.

In the end it is still a very fun and enjoyable game, and I will continue to play it for some time. My issue was more of a 'What if?' scenario than anything else. Please come and try it yourself, the game is very stable and active so it will never be a waste of time.

You are very dependent on other players. If you have a captain that doesn't communicate, you have basically already lost. Sometimes they even scream at you, which is quite annoying. 
Because so few players are active, you often get bots as your teammates. As a captain you need to control them with commands, which is hard.

The key to the game is communication. between the crewmembers, crew and their captain and between the captains, not only during the match, but already in the lobby!
Add some tactics, coordination and use the map (hide in clouds, sneak around mountains and place tactical mines) and victory is yours :D

+ Nice Steampunk style
+ Different game modes that each require different tactics
+ Friendly and helpful community, always ready to answer your questions, give advices, coach you or just have some nice chit-chatting. There are many different clans who will welcome you and help and teach you to get into the game.
+ Devs keep adding content, balancing ships and weapons and helped me with every problem I had
+ regular fun events (community and fight-the-devs) where you can win items or titles
+ no pay2win: everybody has the same chances, there is no upgrading or unlocking items that give you an unfair bonus, only stylish cosmetics are available. The outcome of the match is entirely based on skill, tactics, communication and teamwork

While I prefer the PvP part of the game, the PvE coop is nice and fun too. It adds a wide variying set of ships and guns and gamemodes and tools and special abilities and also a more colourful visual style.

Guns of Icarus Alliance was something that Guns of Icarus Online really needed:
-Being story driven which stills goes on depending of what faction wins and the alliances between them.(Creating more challenges between players and also hooking you up to create more replayability.)
-Each alliance has it's own values and items such as weapons,ship and vanity.
-Maps get slight changes depending of the winner in the end of the let's call it ""season""
-More items sadly not all of them implemented on PVP but slowly getting there.
 
in my opinion this game feels loved by the devs and this alone when playing the ammount of detail and the way classes interacts with each other and the way that you can occupy a class place even tho you only have 1 class item to be of use......
Don't get me wrong the grinding for quest items such as vanity is too hard and requires a lot of time spent here for that to happen which if you work or have a life that requires you to leave your home and do something else beside playing games ....I stopped playing due to grinding  but always come back to play with friends.

GoI Online is an excellent game. Alliance adds, on top of the PvP mode, a PvE play option. It adds some new content, in the form of new missions and Special Abilities, but the base gameplay is the same -- but the opponents are bots. And if you've played Online, you know that fighting bot captains isn't fun because they are dumb. It doesn't matter how many you have to fight at once, or if they add boss fights. The captains are still bots.

On top of that, playing PvE matches is a near necessity for advancing in the ""overgame"" (as I will call it; it has no official name as far as I know). On the surface, this third mode of play is the coolest mechanic ever -- a global, risk-style map that makes every game worthwhile, and adds a depth of strategy above the round-to-round combat. In practice, this discourages playing the better gamemode -- PvP -- in favor of MMO style grinding. Competitive MMO style grinding.

Consider what would happen if we replaced all the progress made by playing PvE with just a meter that automatically filled depending on what you targetted. The overgame now appears vividly hollow. Go back to how it is, and it is that, but with incentive to grind.

Only buy this version if you absolutely love the base game and are craving for more content or want to support the developers. GoIO deserves it.",1510694888,1513386360,False,4,0,0.534934461116790771,3,True,False,False,False,,1515614119.0,"Ohai!

El juego se basa en un cooperativo bastante fuerte para lograr mantener la nave a flote, tu y otros 3 miembros se tienen que encargar de mantener la nave en el aire cuando todo se este quemando y desplomandose al suelo, para esto cada miembro tiene un rol especifico de entre 3 especialidades disponibles.

-Capitan: es el que tiene control total de la nave y hacia donde dirigir la misma y cuenta con habilidades especiales para usar en situaciones dificiles, como invulnerabilidad en los motores, un boost de velocidad enorme para cargar contra naves, un amuleto para hacer que la nave gire mucho mas rapido, etc..., tambien en el papel es el que da las ordenes para los demas miembros, ya sea que reparen, disparen, etc...

-Artillero: miembro especializado en manejo de armas y diversos tipos de municion y puede llevar 3 tipos diferentes, tiene habilidades para soltar minas, empujar a las otras naves lejos con aire del globo, recargar las armas mas rapido y para girarlas mas rapido de igual manera, etc.

-Ingeniero: miembro que se encarga de mantener la nave a flote mientras todos corren en panico, tiene diferentes herramientas especializadas para diferentes labores, como la maza para reparar lo que no esta roto, la llave inglesa para reconstruir lo que ya esta roto, extinguidor para apagar llamas, spray quimico para hacer partes de la nave inmune al fuego, armas especiales de bufeo o incluso una maquina que repara sola las partes de la nave de manera mas lenta, y de igual manera cuenta con habilidades especiales como reconstruir todo lo que este roto de una vez, o inclusive un dron (Choppy) que se puede desplegar para que ataque a los enemigos y de algo de tiempo para escapar.

Eso si nada mas a tener en cuenta que las habilidades son para el Alliance y no para el pvp por razones de balance. El juego cumple bastante con lo que ofrece, y para lo que cuesta y la cantidad de contenido que tiene es bastanste razonable.

El juego esta lejos de estar muerto, el que no tenga 30mil jugadores simultaneos no significa que este en el olvido, a mucha gente le gusta exagerar y mas aun con el crossplay con ps4 casi siempre hay salas abiertas.

Sorry to hear you’re having this problem. Lets have you try a few solutions below:

To make sure the build has downloaded properly. Right-click on the game in your game library, select Properties, go to the Local Files tab, and click Verify Integrity of Game Cache.

If that doesn't work lets have you try resetting your startup options:
1) Right-click on the game in your Steam library, go to Properties
2) Select ""Set Launch Options""
3) Enter the text ""--resetToDefaults"" (no quotes) and hit OK
4) Launch the game
5) After you’ve done that remove the ""--resetToDefaults""

It could be a DirectX matter, simply right-click on the game in the library select properties and a window should pop up showing 'Set Launch Options' as one of the buttons. In that text input enter: -force-d3d9.

You can also try disabling your Steam overlay when you start up the game to do this, right-click on the game in your Steam library, select ‘Properties' and uncheck the ‘activate Steam overlay' option. Press OK and start up the game again, this should result in a more stable launch for you.

Should none of these options work for you can I have you grab us a log file? Instructions are below:

On a PC, look for your client log file inside your Steam folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\guns of icarus online\GunsOfIcarusOnline_Data\output_log.txt

On a Mac, open the Console app in your Utilities folder. Find Unity on the side panel (it’ll be under ~/Library/Logs if it’s not expanded), and the file we need is player.log.

On Linux, look for your client log in the following directory:
~/.config/unity3d/Muse Games/GunsOfIcarusOnline

You can email this log to feedback@musegames.com and we'll take a closer look to help address this problem with you, thanks!"

Short Opinion: 

still a dead game

Long Opinion :

  The player population is semi existent because they cross platformed with Playstation. However, the amount of turnover with players is a huge issue.  If you play the PVE you will be playing with mostly lvl 1-10 players.  This is a huge problem because these players always lack the basic knowledge of shootting armor and hull with the correct guns amongst other things.  So if you wanna play Guns of Noobs online and train crews constantly than have at it.  

The way the overall Alliance faction map works is still just a mystery to most. Not that its even worth talking about since its basically a moot point. The only thing people care about is leader spots in factions because its give a sense of personal pride to grind more efficiently than the others.

Playstation players also dont have the ability to join four ship lobbies so theres that.

Why you would even make nighttime maps, maybe because its a lazy way to make new content.

Alliance did not live up to the hype, its more of a dlc really.

Still has population issues.",1507761002,1526562378,False,29,3,0.572965383529663086,6,True,False,False,False,,1517314814.0,"Hi there! Almost missed people responding to this, sorry about that!

To clarify:
What we originally wanted is to make a new game and integrate the old one into it. Unfortunately Steam didn't offer an option for this, so now the way it works is that the Guns of Icarus Online client is actually just the Guns of Icarus Alliance game with all the content of Guns of Icarus Online, and buying Alliance will now seem like an upgrade.

There is no MTX in this game, and that was always really important to us. Being a small indie studio we can and want to take the stance that players shouldn't have to spend money to play a game. 

Cosmetics are purchasable, but you can also win them at our bi-weekly Fight The Devs games, we have given away over 300k items for free.

Tripel Coriander: I always recommend the community calendar. There is a huge hype with events, and they are guaranteed to have full lobbies :)

Guns of Icarus is an older game now, having release in 2012. In it you play as either a pilot, engineer, or gunner, and run an airship in arena-based battles of up to four ships versus four ships in PvP or four ships versus endless-ish ships in PvE. With 74 hours into the game I think it’s safe to say I’ve played a lot of it over the years. Not as much as others, but more than most.

So gameplay wise you’ll be limited to one role mainly for the entirety of each match. As a pilot you’ll get to steer the ship, use abilities to do anything from speeding the ship up, leaving toxic gas in your wake, or a number of other things. You’ll likely also be in the captain role and get to give orders to either your AI crewmates or player partners who will hopefully listen to you. Occasionally you might go to repair something as well at leave no one at the helm as you can carry one tool for every role you are not and three for your selected role, which allows some capability for crossover and strategizing.

As a gunner you’ll be mainly working on the guns, obviously. You can load your guns with specific ammunition with various effects from incendiary, to heatsink, and even explosive. Of course you might have to do some repairing of your own gun or maybe even of the ship if things get so dire.

As an engineer you will be running around frantically trying to repair things as they blow up, get set on fire, or get shot up. You’ll be able to repair things faster, rebuild things faster, put out fires, buff guns, or even auto-repair things. Sometimes you’ll also be asked to do some gunning if there’s nothing to repair

All of these classes balance each other out really well since no one class can quite completely do the role of another. They also even have special abilities they can use. Engineers can sprint, gunners can reload faster, and captains can move the ship faster and more maneuverable all for a limited time. All in all the gameplay base here is really solid and makes for a really enjoyable experience already.

The graphics are charming and unique but certainly not revolutionary or even “good” for that matter even back in 2012 when the game was released. There’s not really any heavy level of production to this game. It received just enough to not be void or ridiculous, but most attention really went off to the gameplay. There aren’t many issues really. Some multi monitor issues depending on your exact setup but that’s not necessarily the game’s fault as far as I know. For example my friend didn’t have any issues with that, but I did. However we use very different monitors and he runs AMD whereas I run Nvidia and AMD is admittedly much better with multi-monitor frameworks.

You can fully customize your ships with color designs and ornaments and set up exactly what guns you want on it. Your only real limitations in that regard are the things available and the weapon slots you have on every ship. Ships all have different stats. Some are better than others in different situations and excel at doing very specific things sometimes. There’s entire metas on how to play certain types of ships. Although I learned the hard way that things that work in PvP aren’t necessarily going to work in PvE.

The AI in both PvE and PvP are pretty incompetent. They’re not very smart, are a nightmare if you are trying to solo run a ship (although my friend who runs solo constantly disagrees with me, but he only plays PvE), and they just are dumb and do things wrong and play about as bad as a brand new player would. Meaning you shouldn’t really get this unless you plan on playing with other people and I’ll mention more on that later. You can’t really put AI into PvP matches, nor can you have an AI pilot a ship when a player is present or in a PvP match. They can only do that in PvE for some reason.

The game itself gets an 7/10 from me here. It’s a very fun solid base. There’s some small issues with the game itself, but just small things. For what this game tried to be it certainly nailed it on the head. Although admittedly it’s not actually that much so it’s nothing that deserves anything higher than an 8 no matter how well it does it. But this isn’t the end of this review. The most important point has yet to be made and it’s pretty negative and basically why I bumped a point off the score I wanted to give it.

Now this is where things are going to split up between Online and Alliance because this game is marketed very strangely and impractically and I can only recommend buying one of these two.

To start, Online is the PvP only edition of the game. It is the original game and you can pick it up for a mere $5. That sounds like a great deal, right? Well just wait. 

Alliance is the PvE expansion to the game. However, when you buy it you’re getting and paying for both the expansion AND the base game. It’s $15, meaning the price of the expansion is twice that of the original game. That’s a bit odd don’t you think? Well not so much.

Guns of Icarus had a very strong launch. Youtubers advertising it everywhere. Good marketing, good emails, and just solid work all around. It sold many copies and even successfully kickstarted an “adventure mode” which turned into Alliance (which is not even close to what adventure mode was supposed to be) and didn’t really receive any flak over it at all.

The huge issue here is that Guns of Icarus after a while had a very hard problem at maintaining its playerbase. Less than one month after its release there were over a thousand people playing it every day. At its peak there were nearly five thousand every day. This is in a game where you only really need eight people in one match for an optimal experience so these numbers are pretty good. After a while that number descended into only a few hundred every day and the daily peak was around four hundred. Still enjoyable, but harder to find a match given differences in skill level and all. Recently it’s gotten even worse. After the launch of PvE I think the developers just gave up trying to maintain a healthy PvP playerbase because now only a max of fifty to sixty people even play every day. The peak is about forty or fifty and during the night it will plummet down to ten people playing at once. And keep in mind this is across both PvE AND PvP. Ten people playing. A bare minimum PvP match without relying on AI needs eight players. A full one needs thirty two. That’s more people than you’ll even normally find online at this point. Because of this PvP is virtually nonexistent. You can’t find a match and if you can it’s small, uninhabited, and filled with AI.

The PvE fixes this a bit though because then you and a group of four friends or four of the other ten people playing the game can get together and take on endless hoards of AI. Technically you can have up to four ships of four so sixteen people fighting AI in several game modes, but you’re lucky at this point if you even sign on to see that many people online.

When it comes to Guns of Icarus Alliance then I’m going to have to recommend it; especially if you can rope some friends (preferably 3 others) into playing it with you. But do note that you’ll be supporting a company that is simply not trying anymore and that is trying to milk what they know is the last leg of their game by charging three time more than the dead PvP mode by its lonesome, which they’re STILL SELLING even though you can’t find a match to begin with.

I love this game, but the team behind it sucks. Don’t buy it support them. Only buy Alliance if you want to fight cooperatively against AI. PvP is dead and it’s never coming back. Remember. Fifty player peaks. And it only gets worse from here.",1506902374,1506902374,True,33,2,0.65562969446182251,6,False,False,False,False,,,

The only thing that comes remotely close is my current investment in Final Fantasy XIV. That being said, this game was a gem. It's a diamond buried beneath a mountain of issues that plague it to this day, and I hope to god that one day, Muse or another developer looks at this game, it's concepts, it's heart and soul, and they see what I still see in it, almost 7 years on.

First and foremost, the game has stopped receiving updates beyond bug fixes and small balance adjustments, plus the occasional ""we're gonna test this out to see what happens."" I first started playing approximately one year before the Alliance DLC was set to launch, so I got a very good taste of the PVP aspect of the game before the PVE was introduced to ""revitalize"" everything. And it worked, more or less. But it wasn't enough to pull this beloved gem out of the dull veins it had been buried in. Alliance became the crutch for reasoning as to why the PVP mode stopped receiving updates. How come we haven't gotten a new map? The DLC takes priority. Why are some of these balance issues still in the game? We're working on Alliance. I couldn't tell you for certain if those were true and honest statements, and I don't have a problem believing them if they were. But 3 years on, it became an eyeroll to hear ""please divert your feedback to our forums,"" and still getting told that the DLC was taking priority.

It's not a secret now that the original campaign pitch for ""Adventure Mode"" became what we know as the Alliance DLC. And while some aspects of the original pitch were present in Alliance, a lot of what people were REALLY excited for didn't make the cut. New maps and new gamemodes with a focus on vs AI combat, as well as the new ships, tools and guns that completely changed the way you played, all of that was added. And it gave us a lot to do for the first year or so. But there was no progression. There was nothing to work for. And after doing those same missions every week, pouring your resource coins into the same points every week, realizing Chaladon was a stacked faction and your only chance of fighting them was to be in the Baronies, when there's supposed to be six factions altogether, it was horribly monotonous. And hardly anything came around even after the DLC released publicly. 

The biggest appealing factor to me about Guns of Icarus getting a fully-fleshed out Adventure Mode would've been the story it could tell. The world of GOI is interesting to me, and while the combat was clearly enough to keep me playing when I was younger, that wasn't enough after a few years. When Alliance was first getting teased and we were given the run-down on all the factions, I was ecstatic for the potential world-building and story-telling at play! But nothing happened when you won certain points. There was no ""major events"" in the world, or in the game, to tell the player ""hey, your choices are going to impact the story here!"" That never happened. And it was disappointing, because the world had so much potential to tell any kind of story they wanted. And instead, they chose to let the game rot out until the only active members were the people who picked it up during a Steam sale and played for a few hours before dropping it completely.

The game can still be incredibly fun when played in clusters of friends or amidst community events. But those have more or less died. One of the last major events that was hosted for Guns of Icarus, the Chaos Skirmish, had it's final run last April, on the 7th anniversary since it originally started. Since then, reunions skirmishes spring up every few months. But the game is otherwise dead with an active playerbase of less than 30 people. And it's sad to see, when I know how much fun I used to have with all those people. But casually playing Guns of Icarus wouldn't happen unless you were happy with just playing the PVE mode and praying the AI were competent enough to shoot your guns while you flew the ship. 

I think one of the final nails in this game's coffin was the development team. There's a plethora of issues here, and there's some things that I couldn't publicly talk about for sake of privacy. But to give a concise summary, player vision and developer vision were the Sahara desert and the north pole. Feedback was typically poorly received, and more often than not, some developers were outright rude to their own playerbase. Not saying that every player was a ray of sunshine, but sometimes, there would be an innocent question from a new player, and startling yell of frustration from a developer. My own theory is that there was some internal disagreements as to where the game was supposed to go after Alliance was released, and it culminated in nothing getting done at the end of the day. The quality of updates staggered significantly after that first year of Alliance's release, leading to some incredibly unpolished maps, guns, balance changes, etc. 

The game ran rather poorly on anything with worse than a GTX 1660. I know because I have one, and it can barely reach 60 FPS some matches. During the intense moments in a game, I stumble down to 30 FPS. I used to play the game on worse hardware, and I'll be honest, I don't know how I tolerated it for the longest time. The dreaded clouds, or tar clouds specifically, would make FPS plummet, even worse if your ship was caught in one. And if you weren't used to stumbling around at 15 FPS, odds are your ship just sat there and bled to death.

To say some positives, the game still has that potential. When people get together and we're all just f*cking around and finding out, it's fun. It's exciting to try something new that you haven't done before, and go ""holy shit, that worked!"" Or to completely cock up your build and say ""we'll make it work, everything's fine!!!"" when the whole ship is on fire. There's a high skill ceiling when it comes to the combat of the game and how it all works together. But it's rewarding and satisfying to pull off. It's also fun to shout f*ck it, and plow straight at the enemy and see what happens.

The artstyle for this game is still a charm. Steampunk is one of my favourite aesthetics in any type of media, and Guns of Icarus' early outfits and ship designs have that down to a tee. I think some of the Alliance designs aren't quite what I would imagine, but it doesn't matter to me at the end of the day, since I already have my favourite outfit and favourite ship. Graphics are a little dated at this point, especially considering it still runs poorly on less optimized devices. But I think with some dusting off, most everything in the game is still up to par with modern expectancy of a game's visual quality. It doesn't have to be HDR and beautiful 4k rendering, since you're rarely gonna be watching your friend's character models for longer than a few seconds during combat. But it'd be nice to see it get some TLC. 

I stand by what I said originally, the game is a gem. There isn't anything quite like it, and there hasn't been for a very long time. But with lack of developer care, poor communication from said developers, and a dwindling playerbase with lessening patience for updates, the game is settling in its grave. And I will mourn what it used to be until the day Muse remembers what it was that gave this game heart and soul.

Guns of Icarus Online, muhteşem bir oyun. Hemen hemen hiç bir eksiği olmayan, yıllar geçtikçe gerek grafik, gerek arayüz ve gerek event ve içerik olarak çok gelişen bir oyun (bir ara Skyball denen süper oyun modunu kaldırdılar, o ayrı konu)
Alliance ise, bu PvP moduna bağlı, süper, über gelişmiş ve ayrıntılı bir PvE/PvP modu. Ve, oyun o kadar ayrıntılı ki sistemini nasıl anlatacağımı kestiremiyorum şu anda. Bir sürü mükemmel ince ayar, ayrıntı, mevzu var.

Bu ""yan oyun""da, bir faction seçiyor, çeşitli görevler ve çeşitli taktikler kullanarak (ki, inanın bana neredeyse sınırsız bu ""taktik""ler! Dengelemeler mükemmel!) ""war effort"" elde ediyor ve bir miktar ganimet topluyorsunuz. Bu war effortlar, haritada belirlediğiniz (faction olarak belirlemek, herkesle birlikte hareket etmek en doğrusu) noktalarda saldırı ya da savunma yapabiliyor, o bölgelere asker yığabiliyor, var olan kaleleri güçlendirebiliyor, düşman görevlerine sabotaj düzenleyebiliyor... Çeşitli kaynaklarda üst sınırı toplayan faction olunca da, factionlar bölünmeye ve allianceler oluşturmaya başlıyorlar, çünkü oyun gelişmiş oluyor. Bu defa, oyuna da adını veren alliancelerin çok daha çetin ve hırslı savaşına tanıklık ediyoruz. Ve, tüm bunlar, oyunun ""lore"" kitabına hikaye olarak işliyor. Süper emek mi harcadınız? Delice taktiklerinizle düşmanı alt etmeyi mi başardınız? Adınız unutulmayacak ve efsaneniz hikayelerle nesiller boyu aktarılacak!
Yahu, milyar ayrı güzellik var bu oyunda. Alın, aldırın.

Belirtmem gereken bir konu var. Şu anda oyuncu sayısı az. Çünkü, öğrenmesi birazcık emek isteyen bir oyun. Ama sıradan bir oyun ne kadarını sizden talep ediyorsa, bu da o kadarını ediyor. Sadece... Sosyal olmanız lazım. Sormanız, soruşturmanız, anlamaya çalışmanız ve yağtığınız şeyleri (özellikle tayfnaın kaptanıysanız) açıklamanız lazım. Oyuna girip beyni dönen birkaç oyuncu devamını getirmiyor haliyle. Ama, o kadar yıl oldu, hala oyuncu bulmakta zorlanmıyorum. Çat diye girebiliyorum. Çünkü, daima birileri var oralarda.

Eğer harhangi bir şeyi sormak veyahut birileriyle oynamak isterseniz, oyun içinde de aynı niki kullanıyorum. Her türlü sorunuza itinayla cevap verir, hemen her konuda destek olurum.

While I dont like it when you are taking rp too serious, this update feels like they hired a Chef to determine the exact amount of rp spicing, they can put in. You have an individual choice of faction (which can be changed later) with which you will fight for territories on the dynamic map. The faction leaders are chosen in short intervalls, whcih means its easy to be a leader if you do a lot  for your faction. Since the leaders are elected by their contribution to the faction, you can expect the leaders to be A. The Achievement hunters B. Really good players or C. People that take the faction ( and rp) serious enough that they want to be a faction leader  all the time. As a faction leader it is advised to discuss battle strategies with your fellow leaders, but conversations between leaders can be about literally anything. Don´t belive me? Alright then, let me give you an example of the most funny thing I have seen long time faction leaders do a (semi) serious conversation about:

AN ARMY.....

OF TALKING TOASTERS WITH WEAPON KNOWLEDGE, manufactured by a small group of mercenaries from all the different factions, so the plans dont get into enemy hands ( I know there is sometimes a shortage of gunners but wtf)


Sometimes I fell like this is Politics in a nutshell. 
So there you have it: you basically have a pve mode with more ships, more guns, abilities and Politics.

Good with friends as it involves teamwork
Lots of replayability with pve, pvp and lvl progression

Nice community
Nice faction features with unique things that can be unlocked for other factions after you've reached a certain lvl
Role lvls, different roles have different lvls and you have an overall lvl that is an average of all of them gives a more accurate gage of skill

Cons
Not too many players
PVP can be a stomp since theres not too many players
Shipload outs are completely dependant on the captain

Overall if you have friends to play with in the same region its definitly worth your money or if you enjoy these kind of games really.

The overall very positive reviews is very misleading.  Most of them is from the hardcore player base that has stuck around since the beginning.  Or community ambassadors.  Not to mention there are very few reviews to begin with.  

All Alliance did was kill PVP in general.  Split the player base till there was nothing left in PVP.  Why you all decided to go for the colorful fancy pants designs of the ships in Alliance mode versus the post apocalyptic vibe that was compelling I will never understand.  And then insult to injury adding those ridiculous ships to PVP.  That was nail in the coffin for me.

Review of gameplay:  Chaos.  No ryhme or reason much anymore.  Playing AI who have very few tactical approaches.  Ram you or shoot you.  Best part of Goio was the mind games.  Little airplanes dive bombing you?  Why?  Those ships dont fit in anywhere in lore or otherwise.   Its all senseless nonsense.

But the real kicker is the years of not listening to the community.  The balance changes that nerfed and buffed shit that didnt need to be buffed or nerfed,  the blatant disregard for its player base and their opinions.  listening to people that self-appointed themselves as our community ambassadors (ATRUEJEDI)  and Muse listening to them instead of us,  it all just took a huge toll.

-Une très belle ambiance. Des graphismes très convenables, une belle Ost, des design de vaisseaux et personnages originaux et attachants.

-Une variété correcte : possibilité de jouer en PvE comme en PvP, et possède dans chacune des deux options plusieurs modes (protection d'une base, parcours d'infiltration ou survie par vague, ect... en PvE, match classique, système de capture de points, ect...en PvP)

-De nombreux vaisseaux équilibrés et diversifiés, le système de deck pour l'armement des dirigeable comme des outils des personnage est bien pensé.

-Un système de faction sympatique et assez prenant, basé sur une carte évoluant en fonction des joueurs. Avec en plus une progression personnelle au sein de la faction permettant de débloquer un vaisseau et une arme spécifique à cette dernière (ceux des autres faction se débloquent après coup via un achievement)

-Très fun. En PvE comme en PvP, à plusieurs. La communauté est dans son ensemble sympatique et le jeu peu à la fois se jouer de manière très stratégique comme de manière plus relâchée, tout dépendra des niveaux de difficulté choisis.

-Très soutenu par les développeurs : event nombreux et réguliers.



Points faibles du jeu :

-Si l'on peut jouer en solo, c'est très fortement déconseillé, le jeu peut devenir frustrant et monotone, les IA n'étant pas les compagnons de vol idéaux, est vraiment fait pour jouer à plusieurs.

-Peut parfois paraître redondant, surtout en PvE, lors des séances de farm pour le classement de la faction.

-Peut parfois planter de temps à autre, quelques bug par endroits, rien de très graves, cependant.

-Peut paraître un peu cher. N'étant à la base qu'un DLC de la version PvP qui ne coûte que 5 euros.

-La progression peut paraître un peu longue, si l'on est pas un hardcore gamer.

-De temps à autre, les joueurs se font rare, trouver un match peut-être compliqué.

Despite the fact that Muse Games had a very cleaver idea when they thought of creating a steampunk-ish scenario, (there aren't many steam punks pvp/co-op flight simulators around) I feel like the lack of company experience and poor implementation prevailed. There are quite a few downsides to the game that are sure to make your gameplay the worst possible. I won't even cover the discussion about Guns of Icarus Alliance being charged as a separate game when it was actually promised as what Guns of Icarus Online should be after being developed.

- Despite the advertising of having a growing community, Guns of Icarus Alliance doesn't. This makes the matchmaking proccess a lot longer than it should. You can easily wait for 20 minutes to get your room set-up with all players and have your game last just as much as you waited for. Muse even presented a way out for this, creating single player missions, but they just feel like a band-aid to a much bigger problem.

- Character costumization isn't that great. Since there are few achievments for each class, you basically get different clothes based on your level, meaning that every level 20 will have the same possibilities, except for the color you use to dye your outfits (or if you pay good coin to get exclusive content). 

- Poor controller compatibility. I've played the game for almost two years now and virtually no updates were focused on improving the experience for players that use controllers. Not only you cannot have access to each action on your controller, but there are also a lot of buttons that don't do anything, which just makes it look like they just focused elsewhere.

Lastly (and also the main reason I'm writing this) we have the costumer service. There simply isn't one.

You won't have an opportunity to play this good game with such a low player base unfortunately. Also, don't support devs that split player bases with DLC and faulty advertising.

Bought this thinking it was a sequel or the next in the series of Guns of Icarus. However, turns out it was a DLC for the base game Guns of Icarus Online. The community was already very small for this multiplayer game so splitting it further with this DLC was a horrible move by the developers.

Yes, you could knock me down a couple points for not doing more research to determine this was DLC and not a new game to take the series further as a sequel normally would. However, the point here is that splitting the already small number of players even further was a huge mistake. No level of effort on matchmaking have I even been able to get a game where more than 2-3 players joined for a match in which you need 10.

I love the concept of crew gameplay where you have different station and need to fight other airships with their own crew. I've gotten some good experiences out of the original game, but sadly it's come to an end because the player base isn't there.

There are some single player modes in game where you can play with bots, but the experience is just not the same because the enemy AI is just not a challenge. When raising the difficulty to higher levels the enemy ships just become bullet sponges and do not try more sophistacted tactics or prove a challenge in that realm. They simply do more damage and take more damage.

The way this dlc was promoted didn't sitt well with me. In he End I bought the game due to a low player base in GoI and what can I say the new game does not only not give old players a little thank you it seems like a plan B solution.

What do I mean with that?
- There are new maps, but most of them are restricted to certain modes
- the hitboxes are a little bit off.
- The PVE is as boring as can be, with unispired WKII airplaines, freely in your back spawning Blibs and a big varity of missions. Like the one where you have to destroy a few stations, while under enemy fire, or the one where you have to standby in a reach of enemy bases til they self destruct while under enemy fire... you get the point.
- The grafics actually look worse than in the original when it comes to verything that is not on a ship
- But theree are factions now. There is quite a bit of lore for them if you are interested, but if not, every faction has a new ship and a new weapon. Also they have a never ending war on who wears the most stupid uniform ( I think they are all winners).
- Than there is this faction war thing. Honestly I dind't look much into this, but it seems like you can deploy in a war zone , which doesn't mean you actually get to fight there. No, you just do normal missions an get gold for that and a bit of poionts for the deployment zone. The gold you can use in the deployment zones too. If you factions has enough points you win the territory and get a ressource. This thing is, wht's really makes me believe that this wasn't the original plan.
- You can play pve with just one ship now (probably interesting for old goi players, but it seems to be a cure and an ilness for the game, due to it's low player count).
- also the workshop still isn't a real workshop, its more like steam greenlight for stuff.

There are always games to join, even during off-hours, and after some 50+ or so games I've only had two people complain in a match (to be fair, they were mostly co-op matches, maybe the pvp matches are worse).

The game's strength is in how well it balances first-person action with strategy elements, though I could see that being a con for some, as you really have to be good at both in this game.  The learning curve might be a bit high for people who just want to shoot things, and the action might be a little too fast-paced for those who only care about tactical battles.  For those who like both, however, the game is amazing, and best of all it's wrapped up in a wonderfully detailed steampunk setting.   

Overall, I've had a great time in the game, and after 30 hours or so I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface of strategies and techniques.  Between the different roles/ships/loadouts there are a lot of possibilities for customizing your playstyle.

4人と言っても友達5人以上で2人と3人とかに分かれて2～4隻で同じチームでも出撃可能。
人が足りないところはNPCが担当する事になる。
ゲーム形式はWorld of TankやWar thunderのようなマッチ形式。

基本的にどの飛行船も砲門数と修理箇所を考えると人数が足りない設定なので操舵を担当する船長（Captain）以外は船の中を走り回って攻撃＆修理する事になる。

PvPだけのGoIOnlineは初めから全ての船をいじれるが逆にそれだけなので飽きるのが早かった。
PvEでは戦闘に参加したりしてスキルや船、新しい砲をアンロックする事ができて楽しみが増えた。

船はアーマー（Armor)と船体（Hull)の耐久度があって、砲はそれぞれ対アーマーや船体向け等の砲があるので船長役はそれらの砲をどういう風に配置するか考えたりするのは面白い。

ただ、船長は実際のところ砲座につくことは稀なので自分が配置した砲が効率的なのか、射角が取れているのかが実は分からない。（ラムアタックできるので船長も操船しながら攻撃できます）
そもそも気に入って使っている船が実は乗組員からしたらものすごく修理個所がめんどくさい配置だったりする。

なのでソロプレイは不向きで知り合いなどで「3時下方向に敵船！」とか「射角がとれないよ！もうちょい左！」とか言いつつワイワイやりながら戦闘が終わった後に「あの船の修理箇所どうだった？」とか「砲の配置、あれでアーマーと船体削れた？」するとかなり楽しい。

ただ、なんだろう。
個人的に底が浅いというか比較して悪いけれど、上記のWoTやWT、World of Warships等に比べて中毒性が低く思える。
それが船の種類のせいなのか、ゲーム性なのかは自分でもわからないので合う人、合わない人はどのゲームでもいえるけれどあると思います。

上記のように友人たちと一つの船をみんなで動かす一体感とかはすごく楽しいのでオススメではあるのですけれど・・・。

アップデートで船が増えたりスキルが増えたりしているので今後に期待。

The community has never been large enough for it to work, and it's been a detriment to the game for years.

The ships in Alliance are a disaster, which is in stark contrast to the beautiful ships from the original Icarus game. In the original Icarus game every ship looked plausible. Every ship looked like it was designed from either a need for functionality, or put together to be as functionable as it could be (the junker). In the original Icarus, gun positions and arcs seemed to have a thought out purpose for their locations. If you look over every ship with your eyes, you'll see that every piece of those ships is there for a reason.

Run your eyes over the ships in Alliance. Not one of them makes sense. They are jarringly erratic in design, and most seem to lack any reason for their designs. Take for example the Judgement ship. It has smokestacks on top of it's balloon. Why are they there? What are they connected to? What purpose do they serve? Or look at the Magnate; it has walkways with rail guards for some of the way, but then those railings just stop, and that walkway continues, with nothing stopping you from a fall. Who realistically would design a ship like that? Would you walk around on something like that? These are just some of the many design ""WTF's?!"" that every ship in this g ame has. Just design for design's sake, with zero thought for functionality. Whoever designed these Alliance ships needs to have a long talk with the designer of the original Icarus ships.

The issue with the Alliance ships isn't just functionality or design, it's actual mechanics as well. Going back to the original Icarus ships, each has a distinct play style, tactical uses, and configuration of gun placements that make sense to each ship's overall design. In Alliance, not so much. I couldn't describe to you the unique role for each ship in Alliance because every ship functions, handles, turns, and flies very similiar to each other. There is no variety in styles or tactics. The gun placements on every Alliance ship is the worst part of the whole design! The placement and arcs of these guns seems erratic, as if someone just chose at random the placement for each gun on each ship. There is no advantage I can see for using any of the Alliance ships over thir much older, and much better designed original Icarus ships.

In short, the key feature of this airship game- the airships, are a mess. A terribly designed, insipid, candy-coated disaster. If there is any reason to not play this game, it's because they key feature of it fails to deliver across the board.

I have 44 friends on my steam list that own Alliance, and 77 friends who own the original Icarus game. Of that number, only 2 of my friends recommend this game throuh Steam (one of them is a MUSE employee). I cannot in any capacity recommend Alliance to anyone. This game fails to deliver in even the most basic aspects, such as UI, and is simply not worth it.",1496413767,1496418121,False,37,1,0.505076110363006592,4,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]A primer:[/h1]

I had the orginal Guns of Icarus Online back when it was popular (Logged about 42 Hours on it). The game itself is alot of fun dont get me wrong. However, without the playerbase numbers it used to have you simply just dont have a community to fuel a game type like this. Dont get me wrong: I love GOI, but I have some heartburn with this ""game"".

(For Referance:

Online = Guns of Icarus Online
Alliance = Guns of Icarus Alliance)

[h1]What is Alliance?:[/h1]

Alliance fixes a MAJOR issue Online had, the lack of PVE. Something that honestly could have kept the game alive from the start imo. However, today its released as a 20 Dollar DLC to a 5 Dollar game, which considering how little content is actually added? It seems more like a money grab than anything. While it acts like an actual game on the steam store it actually needs Online to function. To rectify this issue they actually bundle Online with Alliance and basically just leave Online (which was once the actual game provided by these people) as a now gimp'd version of Alliance. Stupid? Yes. It kinda spits on people who bough Online for full price back in its prime because now its basically just 5 bucks off this new game.

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

[list]
[*]Do I need to buy Guns of Icarus Online for this game to work?

   No, the game is bundled with Alliance, it seems that Muse's scope for this game changed rapidly multiple times and is listed as both a base game and DLC on their own FAQ part of their site. So naturally there is confusion there when it seems even the publisher doesnt know what this game is

[*]How good is the player base?

   Pretty empty, buy this game with friends. Otherwise its so low you'll be waiting forever to find a game. Plus Pubbies sometimes arent the best of players. Play with people you can communicate with and know are in your skill set

[*]You said that its not really added much content? What got added?

   Basically? Factions. New ships and guns [u]THAT YOU HAVE TO LEVEL UP TO UNLOCK[/u] and just PVE mode where what you do is go around and fight your way through multiple enemy ships and not die as you shoot the oil rigs/manufacture plants/etc over and over and over again. Its the same search and destroy stuff repeatedly. Its pretty lackluster.

[*]You have to level up for the new ships and guns?

   Yes, you do. and from an hour of play? I didnt even level up once. You need to grind pretty hard to make any decent progress it seems and quite frankly? The gameplay is repetititve too. Rush B and destroy the tower and move on with your day at full speed.

[h1]The Review:[/h1]

This game is pretty solid gameplay wise, dont get me wrong. It does what its meant to. you get on a flying boat with a giant freakin ballon taped to the top of it by some jank manner, add a few guns, and you play the worlds most hardcore game of battleship but instead its in the sky, steampunk, and you can move in all 3 Axis at will. Different ships offer different weapon mountpoints and each have their own stats. Pretty solid and fun if you're new. Grab a bunch of friends and get to gether and just go ham working together and its even better.

That said if you're one of those early adopters from Online? This.... really doesnt seem that great. For 20 bucks or whatever price you get it on sale you literally buy the same game you bough back in 2012-whenever Alliance came out but with PVE and a pitiful discount. Good job Muse, this really does screw over your early adopter playerbase. If i got a notification that said: Hey alliance is like 5 bucks for you since you had Guns of Icarus Online before Alliance's release. I would say Hey man its 5 bucks, grab my buddies who used to play Online and we all hop back on. That's how you breath some life back into a playerbase by bringing the vets back who will likely be dedicated to the game if the content is good.

However..... Muse decided to screw up and offer for a limited time no less the ""Discount"" they gave to those who already had Online. You still get gimp'd 15 dollars for a world map, factions, and shiny toys you have to grind to unlock. 

[b]NOT COOL[/b]

20-15 bucks is what this game is worth without a sale if you're completely new to this francise. NOT something you should have to pay for literally buying the base game a couple years back. Not to mention that you dont even get an extra copy of Online if you already have it Which would have made this a bit more worth it if you did. Which really does completely screw the customer here.

Furthermore: The gameplay thats added is..... lackluster....

Drive, Shoot stationary target while rushing through a crowd of AI ships to not die, kill said target, rush to it, repeat.

There really isnt any challenge here. And if you know what you're doing its even less difficult. Theres no massive 4 crew battles, theres not enough playerbase to support it, and if you're lucky you'll find a 2 crew battle MAYBE a 3 crew. 

On top of this you are only paying for:
-A rather repetitive game mode
-New stuff you have to grind to unlock anyway
-A world map that probably wont get much action due to poor player base counts or will be dominated by a clan that snowballs
-Some new maps to play on

Thats.... really it. Not much else. And the grinding is SLOW. When you're level 1 in a faction you'd expect a few wins and a loss to result in at least SOME EXP that gets you out of level one in said faction.

Nope, barely over halfway..... greeeeeeeeaaaaat. And you need to hit presumably something more akin to a prestiege to unlock the other factions ships so you can use them. Let alone the painful grind to levels 6-8 to just unlock your factions special weapon and ship.

This has just resulted in some really poor incentive to play. The player feels like they're getting nowhere and the content they PAYED MONEY FOR is something they cant even use because of a steep level gap. Which I personally cant justify under any reason. This is hindered further if you're solo. Because you'll struggle to find the games to even gain EXP with to begin with if you dont wanna just constantly rely off AI gunman/engineers constantly. Which is stupid anyway.

At least with a few friends you can play multiple roles and switch in and out and have a blast together, not constantly get railed by a poor playerbase.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]

[i]Pros and Cons are weighted by ""+"" or ""-"" symbols respectivly, 1 being not too impactful, 3 being very impactful to the game and its quality[/i]

[u]Pros:[/u]
+Fun with friends (you'd need 3 plus yourself at a minimum)
+Good Visuals
+Solid gameplay 
+Rather extensive character customization which is nice
+The items you can take for loadouts are pretty well balanced
+It seems Muse will continue to support this game

[u]Cons:[/u]
---Almost impossible to unlock any of the weapons/ships solo rendering a solid portion of this DLC unsuable which for 20 bucks they should all be automatically unlocked for you
---Repetitive PVE
---Massive price for what is really just a standalone DLC that should be 5 bucks, 10 for the Online/Aliance bundle
---If you own Online you're screwed. You get secondhand updates from the Alliance update pipeline. Its an afterthought by this point. Not a good way to treat past customers Muse. 
--Nearly dead player base
--Some people have complained of crashes and visual issues
--The playerbase CAN be toxic. Especially if you deny a reccomended loadout or run something that somebody doesnt like.
--8 Dollar costume pack? Really Muse? You're bleeding your playerbase as it is.
-Some weapons tend to have a must have ammo type. Like Greased in the gatling gun.

I've been playing Alliance since long before the Alpha went temporarily public (so I've been at it for about a year now). I'm quite happy with how well the release turned out as far as content is concerned. So, while it's not the open-world RPG-like experience many of us were expecting when the kickstarter took place, Alliance's co-op sets a good pathway for a greater future in the life of Guns of Icarus. It's a step in the right direction, and I'm excited to think of what might be achieved in the future, hoping towards the fulfillment of the dreams had when ""Adventure Mode"" was first conceived.

All in all, solid gameplay. It may get repetitive here and there but I like it that way. Interactions between factions get pretty cheesy at times, specially when some of us start getting into our characters and go full lore junkie on others. It's great casual fun and it feels great.

While not quite as ""open world"" as originally discussed on Kickstarter, Alliance mode forges forward with a whole new vibe of teamwork and gameplay. I know a lot of people are very concerned that it hasn't ""lived up to its hype"", but what we have now is a stable, fun system that the devs can now expand on as we go.

Alliance brings some -much- needed PvE to the game, which finally ends the unfortunately imbalanced PvP matches for new players. I know a huge amount of people who refused to play, or stopped playing, because of many of the PvP matches being reputably hit-and-miss. A new player who loses 0-5 in their first ten matches because of stacked teams is basically just going to walk out the door and not look back. I almost did the same when I was new.

PvE allows new players to learn the ropes in games with reliable difficulty options. They can explore the ships, try all the weapons, experience the player tools, and practice their tactics with friends before trying out PvP.

I think with a dedicated PvE mode (and considering how often GOI has been included in sale bundles), we'll see a steady increase in players, and less people will be put off by the PvP since they'll have something else to try out instead.

I am changing this from a Down Vote to an Up Vote -ONLY- because I believe in this game and our Devs. And if you've been here since the beginning like me, I think you should too. 

I've heard word that the guns are being balanced for release into PVP. I love the Shrike, which we already have. Many are calling for the nerf of the Seraph missile launcher, but I think people just need to learn how to play against it.

The PVE is bland and kind of boring. The Faction goals and world map is a great idea and you can spend your PVP earnings into it which is great. I understand we are trying to attract the PVE/casual crowd, but I don't feel as though that is GoI's audience. We want to shank each other... in air ships.

The new ships, lore, guns, and content in general is awesome! I look forward to more in the future! (Maybe a pirate faction...? :o)

Then a wild creative idea appeared: A PvE extension! It was a welcome addition for the existing players and also a valid reason to return for me (I'm not a hardcore PvP player).

GoI Alliance, simply puts you on an airship, gives you a wrench and few other things (varies) and wants you to keep that airship afloat and destroying AI controlled airships at the same time.

One of the four players aboard becomes a pilot, who -apparently- pilots the thing. Rest of the crew picks one of the two roles: gunner or engineer. Gunners operate the guns and destroy other things. Engineers repair & maintain everything and keep the giant scrap of metal afloat for others to continue doing their jobs.

I was lucky enough to find a dude with hundreds of hours in a co-op game, and he tought me all about the faction system. 

Heres the basics of the faction system, because it is a little wacky tacky, and I don't want it to ruin the gorgeus game for anyone:

There are four factions, they fight to qounqer territories, but not in real battles. You play a game, and the points you win go to whichever war effort you signed up for. If a faction conqers those lands, it gets those resources.

Leveling up for a faction can get you faction specific guns abilities ranks, and at approxamatley level seven, a very powerfull faction ship.



I really hope that helped.



I definitley reccomend this game, and would've payed 40 bucks for it, and had no regrets.



There are some cons though, but they are few:

1. The game runs an excelent frame rate, but for some reason, it just shits chrome out.

2. It is a little complicated with the faction system

          PvE expansion to ""guns of icarus online."" guns of icarus is an online team based airship combat simulator. you pick from 3 classes pilot, gunner, or engineer. each ship carries 4 crew typically 1 pilot 1 gunner 2 engineers. pilot spends almost all his time flying except on a select few ships where he can sometimes shoot or repair one item. gunner spends most time shooting and fixing the guns he shoots, tho helping engineers repair is not uncommon. engineers spend most of their time running around the ship repairing everything, and depending on the ship shooting as well.
          the ""alliance"" expansion to ""guns of icarus online"" creates a less competative varient of guns of icarus that is more noob friendly. at the same time the expansion adds unlockable pve ships and guns (test ships/guns that will eventually be balanced and thrown into pvp). the alliance mode is not just for new players dificullty settings, it allows for older players to have a challenge as well.
          ""guns of icarus alliance"" also adds a faction war system to the game where multable factions fight for control of a risk style map based off decisions made by players in that faction. currently there are 4 factions eventually there will be more.

Pros:
1. comunity is much more polite in pve (pvp varient some experienced players had zero tolarence for new players)
2. grind factor in this game is so low it almost doesnt exzist (only the pve class specails, guns, and ships are unlockables)
3. game is 100% skill based minimal grind means all players are on equal footing (minus the games learning curve)
4. guns/ weapons are unique to eachother and require various amounts of skill to use (praise hades... best gun IMO)
5. pve engineer equipment makes engineering even without shooting more interactive (ship parcore ftw)
6. each ship is unique and its weapons are fully customizeable (putting the right weapons on a ship is key to winning)
7. team based combat makes game great to play with friends (even noobs are deadly when they are cordinated)

Cons:
1. current lack of map variety (only one map per PvE gamemode as far as i can tell)
2. faction conquest/risk feels vert disconnected from the actual combat in game (just click where you want to help fight)
3. lore is awsome but game doesnt do anything to make you feel like your in the world (mostly because lack of maps)
4. very high learning curve (this could be a pro or a con depending on who you are)
5. occasional toxic people (its a 100% multiplayer game even tho pve is more chill than pvp some people are just toxic)
6. forced to fight on blue team in PvE (I HATE BLUE TEAM)
7. no RED ship ornament (also i can only paint bloon Red not hull)

What i think is missing: (some for current build others i expect would require another expansion)
1. to add to map varity and immersion... make climate / background and some models change texture and color to reflect where you are deployed in world map
2. virtual lobby / overlay lobby with the town you are deploying from (make it a default shape similar to map variation idea so you can see other shipmates / crew
3. ground targets / battles (even in modern warfare people dont just fight in the skies)
4. open world to fly in with merchant/pirate style missions with pve and pvp elements (and towns to visit / walk around)
5. ability to create your own airship (limited enough that said ships will stay roughly balanced)
6. ability to paint ship hull (and Red hull paint)
7. more ship ornament (not just a Red one... but i want a RED one)",1492037251,1492037251,True,6,0,0.524877190589904785,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has taken quite long to release and I had almost given up hope to be honest but it's finally out and it's good.

This review is mostly for owners of Guns Of Icarus who are debating whether they should buy this or not... honestly it depends if you enjoy playing GoI. The concept and the community behind GoI is great... the thing that was missing the most was some kind of goal to work towards in my opinion. This has been fixed with Alliance. You have Co-op missions (which can be downright unfair and hard if you don't know what you're doing) and you have a large worldmap full of territories you can conquer for your faction. Bonus here is that one of the things that were a little bit offputting for new players was sitting in lobbies, waiting for people to slowly flow in and then possibly get stomped by experienced players... this is elegantly solved by being able to do missions at your own pace and gather proper experience with the ships and weapons you'll be handling.

Speaking of Factions, there are 4 of them and each one will eventually grant you access to a new weapon and also a new ship. There is more purpose, more motivation, more things to fight for... and it's done well. But at the end it's like Guns Of Icarus.

If you did not enjoy GoI, chances are Alliance will not make you like it. If you really like GoI and you were simply looking for an excuse to play again, by all means, grab it and hop on in.

I'm going to treat this review as if you never played Guns of Icarus a day in your life! I will be covering the original content (PvP) and the recently released Alliance DLC. A TL;DR will be at the bottom just above the video link. 

Graphics: Decent for a game that released in October of 2012. Guns of Icarus holds its own, i'm uncertain if they made adjustments to the games graphics with Alliance since i haven't played in many months prior to Alliance but it does appear so. It could be the increase in map and ship variation. But particle effects are rather impressive. The fog and smoke look really nice. The lighting is quite good as well. I like the character models and customization options but the optional film grain effect is something most people seem to turn off (i personally enjoy the effect) The game oozes atmosphere, has great weather effects and the steampunk setting invokes feelings of nostalgia for me as a Final Fantasy VII fan. But most textures, especially enviroments look quite flat and aged. 

Sound: Outstanding! Everything from the gunfire to the clanking and clicking of tools fixing broken ship components sound great. The music has the right tone and pacing to keep you engaged throughout. There isn't much to say about the sound other than it's pretty much perfect. 

Controls: Solid, i haven't messed with the controller. It does say only partial support on the store page, but i have a feeling that's not quite accurate and controllers most likely work just fine. Keyboard and mouse function as you would expect. Moving around on the ship can take a tiny bit of getting used to as things feel slightly floaty at first. Many a greenhorn hath fallen to the crushing wastes below! YE BE WARNED! Gunning works great with realistic drop and accounting for both ships headings. Controlling the ship as the pilot is a breeze for the most part, but it's always good to have a crew who communicates with their pilot, those sails aren't transparent... talk to me people! 

Performance: Very smooth sailing. I occasionally see some FPS dips when the particles really fly and the smoke/fog are thick. But i play on max settings with a GTX960, an AMD 4ghz 8 core processor and 32gb or ram. Most anyone can run this on anything short of a potato on low-mid settings.

Gameplay: I'll break this down into two parts PvP and PvE.

PvP: There are a few different game modes, standard deathmatch, A king of the hill mode and Crazy King which is a variant of King of the hill with alternating control points. Mostly you're going to be blasting holes in ships! You can do this with a wide variety of guns, ammo and ships to fit them on though the new Alliance PvE ships and weapons appear to not be in the game just yet until further testing. Essentially it boils down to a lot of fun, a lot of cooperation between you and your team and hopefully a spot of tea or two! 

PvE: This is the exciting bit, more maps, more ships, more guns, more everything! There are 5 different modes, defense, assault, search and destroy, intercept and infiltration. With a total of 4 different difficulties ranging from normal to hell. Hell is quite a challenge even for veterans iv'e heard. I don't have the balls to try it yet, don't judge me! When you first load up alliance you will be asked to join one of four alliances. Each have their own unique gearset you can unlock, but other than that it's mostly just to give people an enemy to fight and a flag to fly! 

There is a map with which you can choose to deploy your efforts, you can contribute gold to petition for reinforcements or bolster your defenses. At the end of the battle the winning team will gain resources. Once the is war won, the hero's of that battle will go on leaderboards, and the history of the battle will make its way into the lore of the game! I must admit i do wish there was more to faction wars, perhaps a nice aesthetic item for the winning side, but the devs are open to suggestions and trust me, iv'e suggested it! There is a leadership mechanic where players who contribute the most have a chance to toss their hat in the ring as a leader. Being a leader allows you to instruct others where to deploy, i'm uncertain what or if any other abilities apply to the role yet, but nevertheless it's incentive to play and keep coming back. 

TL;DR: This is a jolly good time m8! With devs who care, are active on forums IN GAME and host events, and have done so for 5 years! If you like ship to ship combat, if you like co-op, then this is a safe and worthwhile purchase! Now tally ho and all that!

Zu den 4 neuen Schiffen aknn ich bisher nur die Erfahrungen aus der Dev-App abgeben, da diese nun im COOP erst Freigespielt werden müssen, gleichsam auch die neuen Waffen und die Sonderfähigkeiten.

Ich gehöre leider zu der Sorte Spieler die Ungerne etwas Frei spielt, ich will bei solchen Spielen immer alles sofort zu beginn.
Aber dies als Kritik anzuführen ist eher kleinlich, zurück zur Thematik.
Die freispielbaren Schiffe sind allesammt sehr schön entworfen und heben sich gut von den bisherigen Schiffen ab (also nicht nur eine weitere Galeone im neuen Pixelgewand).
Ebenso sind die neuen Freispielbaren Waffen sehr Interessant, wie bspw. der Zielfolgende Raketenwerfer (Schwarmraketen, die dorthin fliegen wo man hinziehlt).

Bei den Missionen sollte Muse im laufe der nächsten Wochen/Monate ruhig noch eine Schippe drauf legen, mehr Abwechslung, auch wenn es nur Karten wären, ist nie Verkehrt.

Vom Missionsaufbau gibt es die Übliche Bekannte Kost wie Suchen und Zerstören, Basen Zerstören, VIP beschützen (kein doofen KI sondern eines der eigenen Schiffe spielt dann den VIP. Man kann nur hoffen das der Kapitän dann kein Hobbyrambo ist), Eigene Basis Beschützen sowie Ressourcen Sammeln, bei gleichzeitigem Schutz eigener Einrichtungen.

Interessant sind die Bossgegner, die in manchen Missionen Erscheinen, je nach Schwierigkeitsgrad lassen diese einem den Arsch auf Grundeis gehen ^^.

Im generellen kann gesagt werden das auch für Eingespielte Besatzungen bei hohem Schwierigkeitsgrad nurnoch wenig Luft für Fehler bleibt, so muss dann nicht nur die eigene Manschaft effizient funktionieren, sondern auch die Restlichen Teamschiffe und deren Besatzungen.

Was durchaus noch Wünschenswert sei währen mehr Individuelle Gegnerschiffe (größere Optische Varianz).

Mit den nun ausreichend Gefüllten Servern ergeben sich lustige, teils langwierige Partien, bei denen auch ordentlich Fetzen (und Stahl, Gummi sowie sonstige Schiffsartige Kleinteile) herrumsausen.

Für den momentanen Preis empfehle ich den Kauf für jeden, der Coop-Spiele mag wie auch für diejenigen, die Guns of Icarus selbst noch nicht besitzen, da Alliance auch das eigentliche Hauptspiel, und somit den PVP-Teil mit enthällt.",1491757170,1491757170,True,4,0,0.558351218700408936,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Except they released it as a seperate game, but integrated GOIO, to avoid splitting the playerbase.  So if you buy GOIA, it will include both the PvE and PvP elements.  If you already have GOIO, you get a discount for GOIA.

GOIO was a PvP 3D airship combat game between two teams.  Always 4 players on a ship, but each team could have 1-4 ships.  So a battle could have 16v16 players.  You walk around an airship like you walk around in an FPS-game.  Except here you have no weapons to shoot, just your tools to crew the ship.  There are 3 roles : pilot, gunner and engineer.  In theory every role can perform any task on the ship, but obviously a gunner is better at shooting and an engineer at reparing things.

In GOIA, you can play various co-op missions against an AI director : together with friends, with random people, or even with bots.  It also includes new maps, new ships, new guns.  You can join a faction, and unlock ships and weapons from that faction.  Factions compete for territory and resources on a world map.  Gameplay is very team-based, voice chat is almost a must on harder difficulties to coordinate.

GOIO was fun, but GOIA makes it a lot better.   I believe it's also easier to pick up for new players, going through the tutorials and then playing missions against AI's of increasing difficulty.  That was one of the issues in GOIO, beginners ending up in battle against veteran players were having a hard time, and probably not sticking to it.

A warm recommendation if you are looking for a game to enjoy with a couple of friends.",1491595195,1491595195,True,18,0,0.610924422740936279,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The devs are constantly engaged with the community.  Matter of fact, I played several games with two of them just last night, and there are always Devs, Mods, or Community Ambassadors (CA's) online to answer questions, engage new and old players, set up games and competitions, and generally have a good time.

The game itself is like no other game I've ever played, or that is coming out.  It's a fully three dimensional ship based, teamwork oriented experience, where communication between fellow shipmates and other captains is life and death.  A well coordinated team will win over a silent team nearly 100% of the time.  

New to the game?  Open up.  Talk to your crew, your team. Listen to other players suggestions, don't be afraid of playing a role you're not used to (pilot for me).  And most importantly, have fun. The purpose of this game is to build community, foster friendly rivalries, and create new friendships.  All the while blowing up steampunk blimps with guns.

Guns of Icarus Alliance is a wonderfully fun PVE addition to the game and will test your ability to work as a group with a crew. You will have to choose from an interesting selection of specialized airships, decide what to equip on it, and what tools/ammunition your crew will be using to turn every other object in the sky into smoldering scrap. You will have to constantly adapt and react to situations because plans A through J all went out the window pretty quickly, the ship is now on fire, spiraling towards a cliff face while the pilot and gunners are desperately trying to get the baloon and armor repaired with shoestrings and duct tape because the engineer fell off the ship while attempting to jump across different hull sections to quickly reach and fix the left engine someone destroyed when they thought it was a good idea to put moonshine in it to make it go faster.

New ships, weapons, equipment, special class abilities, factions and wars to tie it all together, weekly leaderboards to climb and a bunch of people to have fun with.

My Guns of Icarus Alliance launch story:

Got onto alliance on launch day with a friend

Started clan Fix It[Fix] as a sort of joke so we had a tag, expecting it to expire soon due to insufficient members

Joined the F̶j̶o̶r̶d̶  Fab Baronies faction

Decided I wanted to become our G̶l̶o̶r̶i̶o̶u̶s̶  Fabulous Leader and started working on climbing the faction leaderboard

Some players had fun with us and asked to join the clan

We had a blast flying, breaking, and repairing airships with these players and they got some of their friends into the game/clan

Some more players noticed us having fun and asked to join [Fix]

A competitive spirit developped and soon most of the clan was trying to get on the faction leaderboard

Had some fun in some matches with/agaisnt the devs with clan mates with prizes on the line

One week, hundreds of matches, thousands of destroyed airships and a bucketload of fun and laughs later, the Fix It clan got 4 of the top10 leaderboard positions helping me reach 1st place, and despite only having 10 members is the most active clan at the time.

10/10 Would fight for an entire week with newly-gained friends to lead a fabulous nation again.

Now Alliance adds even more to the novel playing scheme. More ships, more weapons, more tools the player can carry around, more skills... and everything within an action packed, online RPG like game mode where you join a faction and fight to gain territories and resources for it.

その他にも、PvEモードのみで使える特殊スキルや衣装なども実績を進めて行くと獲得出来、ボリュームはたっぷり有るように思う。

WORLDを開くと、所属国の戦場が表示され、一つを選択する。
その後ゲームをプレイする事で、獲得したポイントを選択した戦場に加算して自軍の優位性を高めていける。

AllianceでGoIOを初めてプレイする人でも各クラス毎の入念なチュートリアル（英語）が有るため、大凡の基礎は学べるだろう。

The most Team-Based game out there, with a Development Team that cares about their female player base.

As a female gamer I know that most of us are deeply uncomfortable admitting to be a girl online. It comes with a very rough learning curve, and a lot of harassment either way.
Either you are only good at a game because you somehow cheated advantages through the magic of your sex, or god forbid, are bad at something you ""fake geek girl"" and how dare you try something new. 

I usually played games where I could avoid being identified as a woman, obviously, because video games are still a very hostile environment for a female identified creature.

But Guns of Icarus surprised me.
It's so team-focused, that people actually LISTEN to each other.
What you say has immediate relevance and not reacting to it can be the difference between life and death. 

Over the last few years Guns of Icarus has attracted a really diverse and amazing player base that is made up of multiple genders that are represented in every lobby and even in the Dev Team itself.

Devs like Keyvias, Ayetach, and Josie have made it their legacy to make sure every issue and report is resolved quickly and discretely.

No matter what gender you are, don't let the voice-chat scare you from this chance to join this amazing community, and this fantastic game.

You are going to make a lot of friends!
That's not a promise, that's a threat! 

And PS. If you are a fellow female gamer, new to this game, feel free to add me and I'll introduce you to the other Girls of Icarus :D

TLDR: it's good!  A lot of the issues that drove me away from pvp: stacked lobbies, 30+ minute wait times; I've experienced none of these issues with this new PvE expansion.

The gameplay is awesome.  fighting hordes of airships and planes is exhilerating and exactly what i was looking for with this expansion.  there are four difficulties that are curved wonderfully.

ignoring their actual names, they come down to:
""for new players"" gameplay
""casual"" gameplay
""challenging"" gameplay
""I have 500+ hours in this game"" gameplay

it works well, and finally having a server browser in this game has improved the overall experience dramatically.  They've made very good UI improvements, in particular to the menus.  I used to find them frustrating, now they are very workable.

Edit:  the factions have really started taking shape now.  Idk, though.  I'm still on the fence.  in concept, it's awesome.  it gives you a sense of purpose and drive to try and win fights for your faction.  on the flip side, it's so fragile.  if your leaders arent active, you're at a major disadvantage in territory control.  they change weekly, so this shouldn't be a huge issue, but i felt it was worth mentioning my oppinion on that.

On a technical note: missions.  while i like that they are trying to encourage factions to take risks to achieve goals, these are very unbalanced.  Most missions are just defend x number of times successfully, or gain these resources in such and such a time frame.  thats fine, and the rewards are not overpowering the rest of the system.  But some of the missions are flat out insane.  requiring conquest of several territories to complete.  now this too, would be ok, except every faction does not have such a challenging mission.  they seem to be distruted randomly (from what i can tell), and mostly they are quite easy.  but i really dont like that one or two factions will just get hosed every week on one of their missions.  Every faction should have a set of similarly difficult weekly missions.

In my personal oppinion, i think it could be very intriguing if some way to initiate pvp challenges between factions could come into play.  Maybe only a leader could issue or accept a challenge, and they would have to assemble a team from faction members.  essentially wagering a territory.  although perhaps not a flat, ""if we win we get this territory"", but rather, a situation where you would just get a massive War Effort bonus at the ""wagered"" territory.  Just a thought.  Would make the pve factions that much more immersive.  plus, i think it would discourage players from hot-swapping factions.

Regardless, i only have minor complaints.  i guess factions still seems a tad underwhelming to me, but the gameplay is excellent, and they've made large improvements to the game overall.  I'm enjoying the heck out of this, and i highly recommend it.",1491292348,1491870017,True,15,0,0.56547778844833374,1,True,False,False,False,,,

You should buy Guns of Icarus Alliance (not Guns of Icarus Online). Alliance includes all the content of Guns of Icarus Online, but also allows you play PvE, and to top it off, it is cheaper too.

Guns of Icarus is a cooperative crew-based shooter, set in a steampunk world. Teamwork is paramount. Each airship is crewed by 4 players, meaning that you want to be playing this game with friends. If you don’t have any friends who want to play, then make some in game and/or join the official discord.

I’m not going to go into too many details about the gameplay, but the rough overview is that you have one pilot who moves the ship and communicates with allied pilots. You also have three other crewmembers that fire guns and repair components on the ship. There are different ships, gun loadouts, ammo types, tool loadouts, etc. to choose from.

Cosmetics can be purchased, but provide no gameplay advantages, and many can also be obtained by leveling up ingame or attending community events.

The playerbase is small. You'll see the most players during weekly events or during US/EU evenings.

+Cool steampunk setting

While it is a shame it came so late in the dev cycle, to have been with this game and dev since launch till now...you gotta give them props for pulling off something this big for a studio their size. 

There are generally two types of players in GOIO...those who love this game to death and become iconic within it's community, and those who come from straight of FPS games and are expecting CoD with airships. If you are a CoD with airship player, you can just go away now.

GOIO has been, and remains to be the most unique and also probably the best PVP/PVE COOP title in the sense of, you either rise or fall based on your ability to work together. If you can't work with others well, this isn't the game for you. As a veteran player with well over 1000hrs in this game, it is often hard to find a reason to start it up because of bad players. Yet, if you get into the community, join a clan, find good crews, it makes up for all of that. There is an incredibly deep game for those that really try to master it.

Alliance, like it or not, is a needed addition to GOIO. PVP may get the attention in the gaming leagues and global events, but PVE is where the majority of the playerbase generally is. That is a fact that has been published in the gaming industry. Blizzard has admitted this on numerous occassions.

To achieve a decent PVE title in the midst of a PVP airship combat game, Muse took a page from a classic game mode that has been included in a few titles. Soul Caliber 2 Arcade being the oldest one in my memory. In that it had a conquest mode where players could join factions and conquer the world. The modern day version of this is seen in For Honor.

If this concept interests you, then you'll find enjoyment here. The maps are decent enough but unfortunately, there isn't as many unique ones as you'll probably want. Which is similar to For Honor. However, there is an AI director in charge of the maps which will change up spawns and when certain enemies attack so it isn't as predictable as For Honor. You could sometimes get a boss ship at the last part of a mission, or sometimes at the start. Things like that. 

The UI...well it's vastly improved from the old days, however, it can be quite complex for new players. Best take it slow. Look around the edges of the screen for options and other key settings. Also ask in global chat. Most of the time other players are generally helpful and there are CA players around that assist at all hours.

The new ships are a mix of fun and quirky. The new guns become almost must haves in some cases. And the special abilities for characters really can turn a certain defeat into a come from behind win.

Ultimately the experience you have in Alliance will be dependent on your teammates, if you choose to fly with others. It's the same as the PVP mode. However in Alliance you can choose to just go solo. You won't see all the maps or gametypes in solo mode, but you can avoid people if you don't like the crowd you're attracting. Something you couldn't do with the original PVP GOIO.

So take it from someone who has been in this game a long time. If you like raiding in MMOs where you have to work together with others, GOIO in either mode is for you. If you are a solo FPS player who has a short attention span, neither game is for you. There is a learning curve that looks harder than it actually is. But for those who master it, this game becomes amazing.",1491209427,1491209427,True,10,0,0.525608360767364502,4,False,False,False,False,,,

*If you are after a more indepth review there are plenty here, this is just a quick TL;DR, [strike]well it was when I started XD[/strike]*

[b]Guns of Icarus Alliance is an exercise in co-operation with both your crew and those of your allied ships[/b]

Whether you are rolling through the dunes with a crew of your closest friends or scrambling to put out the fires as you panic with a group of people whom youve known for minutes, the outcome remains the same

Either you go down with your ship in a blaze of glory, or you and your crew stand tall above the wreckages of the mass's

You play as one of 3 classes (pilot, gunner, engineer) each with their own role and a multitude of tools and unlockable abilitys on a ship of 4 people and must work together to keep your ship in one piece, often with allied ships to look out for you, and of course, for you to look out for 

the game contains 4 factions each with their own unlockable weapons and ship, 
the Fjord Baroneesse, Merchantile Guilde, Anglean Republic and The Order Of Challadon,

Each Faction can play with one another so do not worry about beeing lock out from playing with your friends, and your choice has a long standing effect on the world map, each match adding reputation and power to the faction of your chooseing

*it should be noted at the time of writeing this you can unlock other factions equipment latter on, aswell as change faction*

GoIA can be a bit grinding at times though it isn't always a terrible thing is such a game as this. Can't help when you get some random on your ship doing dumb things, but heck that's every online game. I would like a few more mission types to make sure things don't grow stale. That and more maps/locations of combat. When do we get the ""floating land mass"" stage where the pilot has to be at there best hitting tight corners while going above and under floating pieces of land? Then we should make things truly difficult with a hurricane stage.

Having used some of the new ships and weapons in the Alliance open beta-testing periods, I can say that without a doubt they are all really cool, and while they are powerful weapons and tough, rugged ships, I can honestly say that the enemies are balanced to keep it challenging, especially with the addition of large raid-boss type enemy ships.

Been playing Guns of Icarus Online for a while when Alliance came out. Played the beta back in January, and playing again as it's out now. It's pretty awesome all-around. If you liked Guns of Icarus Online but maybe found it too easy or too tedious to find other people to compete with, then you'll love Alliance!

Guns of Icarus Alliance pits you in a single team fighting against waves of enemies, with a boss at some point. It has great difficulty and great balance - they're not a pushover, but they're not impossible either. That is, unless you're mad and play on Hell difficulty, in which case, you're in hell.

But you're not just fighting enemies for the sake of fighting enemies. You have to join a faction (You get to choose between the Anglean Republic, the Fjord Baronies, the Order of Chaladon or the Mercantile Guild), and, as you win more matches in Alliance, you give progress to some place or other - either attacking a new place or defending one of your contested territories. There are brand new ships, abilities, and weapons to choose from, but don't be fooled! You don't get to pick out the best setup on your first time in. You have to actually earn it, through sweat and tears (though that's mostly due to a broken AC unit), as you progress through more and more fights, you'll eventually be far enough to unlock your faction-specific ship (each faction has their own ship!), and so on and so forth.

I just came out of a session with a bunch of friends, including one who I had to push into buying Alliance, as he didn't like the original game much. When we got off, he asked me how soon we could play again. It's that good.

The Guns of Icarus Online game is really quality content, and Guns of Icarus Alliance is even more quality content to add on top. I barely ever rank games more than 7.5/10, and Guns of Icarus Alliance is a solid 9.5/10. Guns of Icarus Online is a strong 8/10 in comparison.

Guns of Icarus Alliance finally brings PvE to Guns of Icarus. It comes with 4 game modes over 8 maps. 4 PvE factions (with 2 more comming soon) each with their own exclusive titles, outfits, hats, exlusive ship (1 per faction), exlusive light gun (1 per faction) and heavy guns comming soon (1 per faction).
Modes are: 
Defend the base
Search & Destroy (you have to survive 5 waves, without loosing 5 ships - for whole team)
Infiltration (you have to escort 1 player ship, VIP, without that ship dying once)
Recovery ( you have to recover stolen cargo from enemy, before they destroy your refineries that are on their escape route)

Enemy waves are generated by the AI director - whose task is to give you just enough challenge (limited by the dificults selected - dificulty indreases enemy health and enemy dps).
Ammongst the enemies in PvE you have in adittion to NPC shis also aeroplanes and huge boss ships (these have 3 stages, and you have to aim ath the glowing red weak spot).

New ships and new light guns are locked behing faction progression (you can freely switch factions, but in beta there was a penalty in your standing in yuor previous faction -  I haven't tried to switch since full release).
PvP weapons work better than the PvE exclusive weapons in my personal experience (it could also be much better familiarity): PvE exclusive ships while very ornamented, they are lot harder to learn due to unusual weapon placements, but feel as effective as PvP ships.

Alliance also comes with with a meta game where factions are trying to conquer as much taritory as possible (each faction has it's own set of resource goals it wants). With each match you earn resources and progress in the land you are deployed in - for your faction (both in PvP and in PvE). You can spend those resources for extra progress of your faction or delay enemy faction. Top 10 contributing players in their faction become faction leaders - allowing them to change faction meassage, wherever they deploy each player from same faction deployed in the same zone gets extra faction progress (that motivates other players from same faction to attack or defend same zone as their faction leader - thus indirectly directing how their faction wages war).

I could go all technical on this but im not.
I have been playing Guns Of Icarus, so this is now Gun of Icarus Alliance. Becouse of the new mode.
This game is airship combat. It is very heavy on teamwork, it i amazing what you can do with a crew that works toghter.

There are two game modes, pvp that i have been playing for ages, and i still love it.
Then there is the new alliance mode that is pve.
In alliance mode you have factions and fight for territory, and resources.
Witch Empire will be the last one standing?

The thing is still the same in pvp or pve teamwork. You work for the common goal.
Just different enemies, and it is fun, it can be chaotic, crazy and hilarious at the same time.

The communicty is full of of fun people, the lobby of icarus can be fun and stupid sometimes.

So join a faction and have some teamwork and have some fun.
Go bang stuff if your the enginner.
Hit on things if you're the gunner.
Scream orders around if your the Captain.
Dont run around like a crazy hamster on the boat.

The devs are playing the game and interacting with the community.
The community have tournaments and other competitions in the game.

So do i still like the game?
Yes i spend alot of time playing with friends and laughing and talking.
I spend alot of time helping new people to get the teamwork going and teaching them.
I will yeall at yuo but you are going to have fun and going to come back for more.
I mean the game is much more fun with a microphone :)

So my honest opinion the game mechanics works.
The players are mostly friendly and fun.
The community overall is very good, and that is why the game is still around and expanding.
This is the game you can hop in for a game and then leave or play for houers.

I know i spent far to much time in this game :)
And im still going to spend more time in it.

The conclusion is i have +450 games in my library and this is one of the top 5 games i spent most time in.
I have meet people that after several hundreds of houers are more than friends, from all over the world.
So the devs created more than a game, they created a game that demmands teamwork, and that creates friends.
Thats the reason why i keep comming back to the game. I have even come to turns with Harry the AI.

At the start, you select a faction, and the map displays its conquest. 'Deploying' in a certain location will make the results of your gameplay go towards its conquest. Fun, a little repetitive, not as hectic as PVP, but still tactical.
8.5/10

Content:
Alliance adds several new ships and weapons unique to each faction. It keeps many similarities from main game, and all of its ships and weapons. What Alliance lacks is enemy variety. There are currently a couple ship types, plane squadrons, stationary cannons, and boss ships. I would like to see a little more variety.
7.5/10

Player base:
Small, but helpful. I was readily welcomed to the game, and given several tips on what to do. However, not too many people play at the moment, so it may be difficult to get into a game.

If that description doesn't have you amped, we can't be friends. It's garnered an impressively tight knit community that not only polices itself, it contributes directly to the lore and flesh of the game's universe. 

Alliance mode is the long awaited cooperative expansion to GoIO, and it's something that is simply amazing for several reasons: One of which being that Guns of Icarus Online used to have a very robust competitive scene, one that featured prominent and even incendiary figures that were both loved and hated by many in the community. These teams fought every week under extreme tension for the title of COGS Grand Champion,  but almost all of them started out as friends -- getting to know these people, then getting to fight against these people, has been an incredible experience.

Now, Muse Games has done what very few developers do: They've listened to the community and produced an extension of their world so that we can team back up with our old friends and fight -together- instead of against one another, while still maintaining some semblance of competition in the form of a massive Territory War (think Soul Calibur 2). Ducks, Gentlemen, Merry Men and Cake alike can team up to form a fleet. This is fucking awesome, guys.

For those who are new to the community: Get in here. There's a bit of a learning curve, but we've always been open to teaching and strengthening the community as a result, and Muse Games is one of the friendliest developers you will ever meet. People have been mean, nasty and even downright hateful to them at times and still found a welcome place in the community -- many people have been turned from toxic players to ardent supporters in this way.

+Teamwork-focused play
+Airships
+Stratigic planning and execution.

I'll go into each in more detail below, but that's the TL;DR. If you check off two boxes above: get the game! 

Teamwork
With the basic ship requiring four crewmembers to run, Guns of Icarus rewards the crew as a whole, not the individuals among them. For example, you can be the best gunner in the world, but if the pilot can't get the guns to bear on the target, you'll have a harder time. The same goes with piloting. You may be a great pilot, but if the engineer neglects the engines your ship will quickly be dead in the water. The same goes for engineering, you may keep the components up under pressure, but if the gunner fails to take out the enemy ship's guns or the pilot puts your ship in a 2v1, well, there is only so much a single engineer can do!  

At first, that may sound like a circle of blame, but the end-result is quite the opposite. Players are not selfish because selfishness and solo-carrying are not in the equation to begin with. The net result is a great feeling of comradery and a friendly, welcoming community. 

Airships
The airships feel amazing to fly and crew aboard. Skimming over dunes, weaving through broken cities, and deviously setting traps in canyons. If you like the feeling of sailing, and you like the feeling of sailing IN THE SKY, then this game NAILS that feeling.  With alliance, you no longer have to conted with any PvP anxiety, just climb aboard with your friends and have a blast sinking enemy ships. There's nothing better than sinking the map's giant boss ship in one last zooming pass! 

Planning and Execution
There are many options when it comes to ships, guns, loadouts, maps, and skills. The net result is a lot of interconnected parts that are rewarding to figure out. Want to try sitting back and sniping with your ship? Put on some long-range cannons and rockets! Want to get in close? Swap them out with a gatling gun and a flamethrower. Every ship has multipule strategies and ways of attacking depending on the ship's and crew's loadout and map. 

Alliance doubles-down on this. It's quite rewarding figuring out how to speed-run an attack mission, or hold the defensive line with just a single ship. The strategies and weapons for PvE can differ from PvP, making the game more interesting to learn and plan for all a level's intricasies.

Ein tolles Spiel. Es macht sowohl in PvP als auch in PvE verdammt viel Spaß. Hinzukommt, dass sich beide Modi unterschiedlich spielen. Mit ""Alliance"" erhaltet ihr beide Spielmodi; ""Guns of Icarus online"" ist bereits in ""Alliance"" mit enthalten.

Ein großes Lob geht daneben auch an die nette Community. Sowohl in PvP als auch PvE sind alle sehr hilfsbereit und erklären gern den Neulingen die Spielmechanik und die Taktiken. Im PvP-Modus kann man die Teams nach den Matches durchmischen, sodass man im nächsten Match auf der Seite seines Gegners kämpfen kann, wenn man mag.

Neben PvP und PvE-Missionen gibt es noch eine Art ""Meta-Game"", in welchem man sein durch Matches und Missionen hart verdientet Gold ausgibt, um seiner Fraktion, die man zu Beginn wählt, Rohstoffe und Territorium zu sichern und zu verschaffen. Da man mithilfe der PvE-Missionen ebenfalls ein vorher ausgewähltes Territorium fördert, hat man einen hohen Wiederspielwert.

Wer nicht gern Multiplayer spielt, der kann die PvE-Missionen aber auch allein mit einer KI-Crew spielen. 

Der ingame Sprach-Chat funktioniert wunderbar - ist jedoch keine zwingende Voraussetzung für das Spiel, weil es zudem einen Text-Chat gibt. Außerdem kann man zusätzlich Befehle via Tastensteuerung nutzen.

Die Grafik ist schön anzusehen und die Karten sind liebevoll gestaltet. 
Kein Pay to win! Ausrüstung und Items spielt man durch Lvl-Ups frei. Jede Fraktion hat ihre eigenen Items zum Freischalten.

I played the Skirmish variant for many many hours, so part of my review is also biased from having played PVP daily.
The reason for my low ingame time is because I am launching the game through the original guns of icarus launcher.

gameplay:
The gameplay is solid and very coop oriented.
Although I myself am bored of the PVP aspect, there is tons of fun to have in that part aswell.
The Gameplay transfers well into PVE, as the aspect of coordination is still needed to complete the tougher difficulties.

Social aspect:
Goio have always been the game I have met the best online friends in, we still talk and play to this date. We recently moved back into Alliance.
If you are interested in getting into the faction dominance, you will find a lot of social aspects to it. - Coordination is the key to victory
Instead of being salty like all those old players from skirmish writing negative reviews, I decided to look as this expansion as just a game. It is a game that allows me to play with the people I enjoy hanging out with. And to our luck more friendly faces have shown up and its just an enjoyable game to do coop in.
I suggest you join  a clan and make friends since it make the game a lot more enjoyable.

PvE feels very refreshing and can be at times quite challenging even for an experienced player. I'm not really into the world conquest and faction stuff but I really appreciate the new ships and guns. PvE can also offer chill games as an alternative to a more competitive setup of PvP.

This is a game unlike any other I have played.  Muse games recently released Alliance in order to create a PVE play mode for their base game: Guns of Icarus: Online. Now, the two meld together to create an experience which caters to the tryhard competitive type, the casual players, and everyone in between.

The amount of teamwork this game offers cannot be compared. You simply have to try it out. Ask questions if you have them – it is the friendliest community I have ever been associated with. The action is great, the downtime is slim, and the impact you have as an individual is huge. 

You are one player of a group of four responsible for keeping an airship running and gunning. You have the opportunity to partner up with other ships of the same crew size to take down the enemy. Captains of these ships must communicate, coordinate, and conquer the battlefield in order to secure victory.

There is a grinding mechanic for those that like that type of thing – it is essentially a world map that uses Risk like behavior. It can be fun and immersive but it is not necessary if you just want to blow shit up.
The developer to player communication is like none I have ever seen. I just recently talked to a developer LIVE while meandering about the user interface looking at different un-lockable items like costumes and achievements. Furthermore, they do a thing every Friday called a Fireside Chat on their twitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/gunsoficarus they talk about the game and answer questions live. It’s a unique experience I have never had before. It feels kind of surreal. 

Overall, I like Alliance. I am a big fan of the PVP mode and this PVE mode is just as good. I’m glad they made this game and I’m glad I caught it on sale. 

I understand that my review may be biased. I like this game immensely as I have never played a game that matches the style this offers. I like flight simulators, I like teamwork based games, I like the idea of a leadership role, and I like tactical positioning. I am a huge advocate of PvP for this game on the competitive level. I feel no other game can compare to the amount of coordination it takes to win.

Although it now runs under the correct appID, I am not sure why it is sold as an entirely new game, when it clearly is not. All of the exact same content is available under 608800 or 209080 as long as this DLC is enabled.

That being said, this game is supposedly the delivery of a Muse's second KickStarter campaign for Guns of Icarus from 2013 that raised over $200,000. The campaign was for a *DLC* add-on called ""Adventure Mode"". The full add-on was supposed to be completed by June 2014. The core features of ""Adventure Mode"" as stated by Muse in the opening description paragraph of their Kickstarter:

""A persistent online post-apocalyptic steam & dieselpunk world 
Crew or captain your own ship and experience airship combat taken to new levels 
Explore towns and take on missions to help them develop and grow...or bring them to ruin 
Politics and intrigue with six player-run factions, each vying to stake its claim in the world 
Robust and accessible economic and political systems that drive the action""

In reality, the only thing that is fully delivered here is the second item, which is just a vague description of their original game, and not a unique aspect of this add-on. The fact that 2 of the 6 factions aren't done after this extremely extended development cycle is concerning, to say the least. The core premise of the fundraiser was clearly not realized.

There were also stretch goal features that were not met (walk-able towns, etc.) but the developers repeatedly promised that they would secure additional funding to support the stretch features if the core game was funded, releasing the entire project as several [url=http://i.imgur.com/pfTnrkt.png]""smaller DLC"".[/url] They very quickly back-pedaled on that stance upon securing the core funding. However, two stretch goals WERE met, ""More game modes"" and ""More boss ships"", with no clear representation in this 'finished' product. Again, the core premise of the fundraiser, and the stretch goals reached, were clearly not realized.

I have a hard time believing this is all just a misunderstanding, as this is not the first time they have over-promised and under-delivered on a KickStarter campaign for Guns of Icarus. They initially funded GoIO with a [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/musegames/guns-of-icarus-online/description]KickStarter in 2011[/url] that promised features that still haven't been implemented. Things like ""Extensive customization with lots of weapons, engines, and decorative ship parts"" or ""Campaign with mission, factions, trade, and crafting - dynamically affecting battlefronts and alliances"" still aren't in the game. As far back as 2012 if not earlier, there were stats for [url=http://i.imgur.com/lR3DMj3.png]crafting commodities, alternate ship components, trade items, and even *goats*[/url] buried in the game code, but never actually implemented in game. I believe they are still part of the game code, just completely abandoned.

I understand developing a game is hard and projects change, but is having two KickStarter campaigns for the exact same game premise, and then having *both* dramatically under-deliver normal? I really hope not.

Muse tends to be clowny like that.
Anyways, because of this, the first part of this review focuses on the PvP aspect of this game for anyone, who is not familiar with Guns of Icarus yet.

[h1]Regarding PvP (A copy-paste of my review for the original Guns of Icarus Online; Yes, it was exactly the same bloody game as this; Yes, I know that's kinda stupid)[/h1]

It's such a shame that so few people come around to try and learn to appreciate Guns of Icarus.

I find it really hard to enjoy non-coop multiplayer games these days. It seems like competition and rankings is all they're about now. Getting in a matchmaker, being thrown out there against a couple of faceless opponents you're never gonna see again, have a minute or two to pick your champ/hero/loadout/whatever, go. No wonder communities go to ♥♥♥♥ if you don't even have a moment to think about the fact that those other players are actual human beings.

But GoI? It's just different. And I couldn't even exactly tell people why, at least not without wasting a couple of paragraphs overanalyzing every single aspect of the game and my own personality. Somehow it manages to take away all the angst, salt and frustration that usually comes with multiplayer (well... most of the time). Instead of always competing in some sort of league where everyone is his own overzealous soccer mom, it feels more like a nice evening at a board game bar, playing with some friendly strangers, not so much against them.
Guns of Icarus is something that very few multiplayer games can call themselves in my opinion. A thing I can only describe as ""comfy"". Something I haven't experienced like that since way back when I would spend my whole time playing WCIII fun maps with random people and I'm so glad to have found a game that could give me that again.

If recent multiplayer experiences just don't really seem to do it for you anymore absolutely give this game a try! Maybe It's just what you need!


[h1]Regarding PvE[/h1]

Well, there you have it. The PvP game that plays like a co-op experience now has an actual co-op mode. 
And just like many other ""veterans"" I'm somewhat torn in my opinion on it. 
On the one hand I naturally welcome all and any new content for one of my favourite games, but on the other hand it's not really something the dedicated players ever asked for, which is unsurprising, since we were evidently fine with the game as it was. 

Due to the new tools, special abilities and eventually ships and weapons, it plays significantly differently form the original base game. Especially newer players will probably have a hard time coping with the fact, that some of their favourite loadout options may not be available in PvP. My biggest fear is, that this will create a devide in the community, effectualy leaving both modes with fewer concurrent players than the base game had before.

The whole faction and world-map meta game is pretty shallow and lead ad absurdum by the fact that everyone is gonna jump between factions all the time anyways, in order to farm unlocks and achievements. 
It may have been a neat idea at the time, but in the meantime I think For Honor has already proven, that it's little more than background noise.
But hey, Guns of Icarus (at least in my opinion) was never a game that had to rely on giving you arbitrary rewards for every match. It remains to be seen, whether the co-op missions and the pseudo Risk that comes with it will be fun enough to see significant play after most players have ground out all their desired unlocks.

My recommendation is to not buy this game solely for the PvE content. The heart and soul of Guns of Icarus will always be the super chill skirmish mode.",1491043284,1491219544,True,13,1,0.475402742624282837,2,False,False,False,False,,,

I'd had great fun in the last installment of Guns of Icarus, but I wasn't sure if Muse was just looking to make some kind of cosmetic, irrelevant addon to their game. Over the last few hours this worry has been dispelled. There was a time where I had genuine fun with Guns of Icarus, and Alliance has put me back in the saddle, and I'm definitely glad to have started playing again.

The appeal of Guns of Icarus, to me, has always been working together with a team, to struggle and get better. Finally, the developers have actually enabled a system to where my contribution means something in a tangible, readily viewable way, and I feel like I'm having an actual impact on the system. Muse doesn't really bother with any flowery lore, and I'm glad they don't. They give me exactly what I wanted. A solid gameplay experience, that I can get better at the game with friends, and meet new team members along the way. That's really all that I wanted and they delivered it well.

As well, this one of the first times I've seen an indie game has active multiplayer again. I haven't had a single issue finding a full lobby, and the new players have been genuinely eager to learn from more experienced players. It's pretty rare that I actually get to see that, and I'm surprised that Muse was able to actively foster that. But I suppose PvE is definitely a stronger enviorment for people to learn than PvP. As well, Muse hasn't slacked off on offering a challenge-seeking experience for more veteran players, with harder gamemodes. And it's actually been a challenge on the upper difficulty levels.

As for the obvious question of cosmetics, Muse has done a great job of thematically designing new cosmetics based around the faction you're playing. If you like the aesthetic of a faction, you can fight for it and recieve gear related to it. But they don't lock you down either. One you pick a faction, you can switch any time if you wish to attempt to get gear from another faction. It's a nice touch, and adds a bit of longevity to the game.

All in all, for the price tag, I would definitely look in to purchasing this. Muse has actually put some love into making this, and I've had an incredibly enjoyable experience so far.

Totally worth the money and wait. There are 4 factions currently active with 2 more to add. New ships, guns and outfits for all the factions. A new world map to fight over resources and territory!

When you have been in the game for close to 4 years it's refreshing to have something new that can give you a challenge. #hugsformuse #GoIA",1491036083,1491036083,True,18,2,0.532460629940032959,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't regret trying to get back into it. Worth the time and monies.

So the way to log hours for this at the current status is a little wonky, since it runs off the base game. However I gotta say that after a bit of time playing, making a few friends, talking to a couple of devs on the ingame chat... It's a really nice game! For the price you get a fair bit out of it, especially for new players the majority of the community is welcoming and willing to help.

Every game I've played has been enjoyable one way or another, sure some frustrations with players but that's to be expected and I can't blame the game or development for this, it comes down to communication, positivity and trying to be the best you can be while having a good bout of fun. Nobody should expect AAA quality in every spot but then again; plenty of ""AAA"" games really haven't been living up to that.

Definitely recommend to friends if you have fun playing it, help the game, get the player base up because it definitely deserves some good recognition!",1491019904,1491019904,True,59,2,0.595419168472290039,3,True,False,False,False,,,

meh.
I regret humoring the idea of giving it a go again.

Lovely.

There are so many things wrong with that I am at loss where to start precisely.
Let me start with core then - the gameplay.

In a nutshell it is as follows:
Pick a faction, pick a location to deploy, play a match PVP or PVE thus contributing around 100 points towards needed 25000, spend accumulated currency towards the needed points, repeat until you unlock one out of 4 new ships. Or was it guns? Whichever - you got the idea.

Maps are few and those are extremelly boring, bland and look nothing like the original game. The jungle one looks so bright and green that it belongs in Far Cry 3.

Basicly, that is about it. A handful of new stuff, suprisingly stupid AI, and idle farmer in one.
You do not really get a new game and it just barely hits the amount of content to be called DLC but, for obvious marketing reasons, however, alliance is called a game.
Dont be fooled by that ""generous"" free base-game. Alliance simply will fail to run without it, since alliance itself is nothing more than useless and grindy mechanic strap-on with few new ships.

About matchmaking:
Non-existant for pvp at the moment due to lack of players and servers, which can be explained with Alliance launch but at the same time tells a bit about playerbase status (spoiler alert: devs had many peaks over 2k and many opportunities to secure that playerbase, but how and why they fuck that up over and over again I explained in another review).
Useless in pve, where it assigns me to servers of different continent with whole two perfectly healthy EU servers running, as well as stuffing brand new players on board of my ship. Well, at least it is PVE - they can't mess up balance in PVE, right?... right??

About new tutorial:
Good job.
Try again.
Good job.
Try again.
Good job.
Try again.

Those two samples used repeatedly in succession for gunner's tutorial pretty much sum it up for you - cheap and useless.
It does not teach shit, rather it simply tells player to do X because tutorial said to do so.
For additional annoyance there is also main menu tutorial, showing you where various buttons are - which should not be, for any reason, neccessary in a normally designed menu. Did not bother to read, having this thing forced on me at least four times since I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon GoI in 2015, but noted that those pop-up windows love to be barely visible and try to hide off-screen.

Just to quickly wrap it up - a few extras, since I frankly dont care for a year already:
Advertising in launcher.
Outdated manual since 2015.
Grindy or/and impossible achievements with a total count of 800.
Beg players to write reviews @ Launch base game through alliance link, making it impossible to log time in alliance and, therefore, to write a review.
Same incompetent developers as before.
Thanks for a free key, chumps, after I shook down refund from you.

Quindi sbloccate le nuove navi e giocatele solo nel Coop e NON nel PvP perchè non potrete usarle altrove

VE LO DICO....COMPRATE ALLIANCE SOLO SE SIETE VERAMENTE APPASSIONATI PERCHE SINCERAMENTE SONO SOLO DEGLI ACHIEVEMENTS IN AGGIUNTA CHE TI DANNO LE NAVI DOPO MOLTO!!!
