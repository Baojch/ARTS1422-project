Моя улюблена частина серії Civilization. 
Графіка не набагато гірша за 5 частину, але при цьому споживає на порядки менше ресурсів.
Дипломатія, яка реально працює (привіт, Civilization 5)
Суттєвий візуальний крок вперед порівняно з Civilization 3. 
Приємний і зручний інтерфейс, анімовані персонажі, які досі викликають ностальгію, музична тема, яка досі залишається однією з найбільш впізнаваних у ігровій індустрії. Анімовані сцени спорудження великих чудес світу, по яких можна вивчати історію. 
Все наведене вище - моя суб'єктивна оцінка, яка абсолютно не стосується мультиплеєра, але перевірена майже всіма рівнями складності АІ-супротивників та всіма фракціями. Скачав і запустив буквально для того, щоб перевірити, як буде працювати на Win11, і все одно застряг на дві години :)

Ну а загалом - кожна гра серії Civilization, це як ""Джуманджі"", люди сідають за партію десятирічними дітьми, а закінчують - постарівши на пару десятків років, зарісши бородою і в лахміттях, які ледве нагадують одяг.",1708616248,1708616248,True,9,0,0.6467629075050354,0,True,False,False,True,

The algorithm promotes religion. I did a lot of Confucianism for example (after Aztecs turned my towns with Judaism) and made good progress, got fission & fiber optics in 1929. What is wrong, Confucian monasteries expire with the Scientific Method. Buddhists are OK, and Christianity can build too: and why should any religion lose monasteries? Plus, both Montezuma and the Chinese would say Confucianism is “heathen”. ; )

To look to the Declaration of Independence or Thoreau alike, the algorithm probably should not promote barracks within cities, “among the people, a standing army” as king George did, but it was not a good example.

I haven’t really played the VI, only tried the demo, so I don’t know how things are there, but the IV is too much history, for civilization as a process: historically, there have been slavery or feudalism among people, but never among all people, and they couldn’t be requirement for corporation and other good economy. In reality, slave power to purchase goods is zero, and history is not always the best picture for progress. The game would yet make one discover, though I skip most despotisms and “jump” to free religion and free speech: when slavery is offered, I click to keep the old ways and don’t change (Montezuma offers slave slaughter to celebrate!).

Money is not rewarded enough. Montezuma could be making a few pieces of gold and try trading tribalism and fish; my Therebabba making more than a hundred gold per turn and being free speech, is still lower in the ranking. Vast territory, though important, is not the same as advanced civilization; my Therebabba would rather expand when it’s affordable. 

The screenshot here is a development without slavery, feudalism, monarchy, and state property for a form of government (only discovered, because the game forces it, but not implemented; mostly after time, like Feudalism, one turn after Corporation); it's free religion, free speech and corporation, one turn of anarchy for each. Towns are  on their default auto or autarchy, I tweaked only two or three I believe, for more food. Industrialism may be quite important to get, to keep up with the progress — The Manhattan Project is one of the wonders, it takes from town economy, not the research; I'd be tweaking for more happiness right after I get the industrial cash, got Broadway and Hollywood already. ; )

Broadway and Stonehenge in New York; the Sistine Chapel, Kremlin, Statue of Liberty, and Hollywood in Washington; the Eiffel Tower in Boston; the Great Library, Hanging Gardens, and Notre Dame in Atlanta.

The civic upkeep is 78, income 973, so industry is really necessary. All have Constitution, of course.

For civilization as a process, landmark establishments might look better coming with a timeline, rather than as the Oxford University in Boston for example, or the Manhattan Project as well as Kremlin in Washington. 

Anyway, the game is absolutely detachment from reality, so it is good, when you need some ""time off life and everything"". : )

For reality, feel welcome to read a real fable, about philosopher Honeybee. : )

And if it weren't for the dozens or even hundreds of hours I've spent playing Civ3, coupled with fatigue from its limitations and dumb AI — Civ4 could, potentially, became my favourite instalment in the whole series. Looking back, the fourth part seems to be the most polished and competent iteration of the iconic franchise. Especially if you compare the basic versions, without the paid DLC and add-ons, which the creators of the series are so like to abuse nowadays. Sid Meier's Civilization IV inherited the best features of its predecessors, polished its mechanics and made a lot of small changes and improvements to the well-established formula. Thanks to a much more user-friendly and informative interface, fancier graphics, mature stylistics (hello to cartoonish Civ6 and Revolution) and FullHD resolution support — the project looks and plays pleasantly to this day. And the amount of starting content, old and new civilizations, as well as the presence of alternative leaders are surprising. Of the drawbacks, I could mention the traditionally inadequate behaviour of the AI (especially when playing at marathon speed on huge maps with the maximum number of opponents), as well as the ""unfair"" difficulty, which increases not via the ""cunning"" AI, but through a system of bonuses for computer opponents and penalties for the player. But both of these problems are the scourge of the entire series, which the developers have successfully ignored for over two decades. Despite its solid age, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a great starting point for getting to know the series, especially if you're not interested in online multiplayer. Unlike the newer instalments, Sid Meier's IV is much less demanding in terms of hardware and finances but is just as addictive.",1707823392,1707823392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,

Unfortunately 5 will always be my preferred option due to combat alone. Seriously, combat in 4 (BTS) is awful, and significantly holds the game back in my opinion. I come back every once in a while, but I never stay long. Recommend if you're looking for a cheap/ low spec entry to the franchise or prefer background complexity over proper turn based combat. This game blows the whole franchise out of the water until a war starts, which depending on your playstyle might not even be a large portion of the game. God combat fucking sucks though, whose idea was it to make air power useless at a certain strength % against ships?

-Most people have their hours in BTS, disregard mine. I don't have a ton on for 4 anyways but it was the first I got not counting Revolution, so the rose tinted glasses hit hard.

Also Take Two is a genuinely shitty company, and you'll have to agree to their privacy policy to get in. I don't hate valve, but you could probably just pirate a copy without all that jazz. Beyond that, I genuinely don't think Firaxis or 2k have earned your money anymore, seeing what they spent it on for 6. The game is practically live service at this point, and civilization 7 probably will be. If you're really committed to doing things the legal way I'd work through GoG and minimize the profit made off of you, they also have Alpha Centauri which is quite probably the best IP with Sids name on it. Even if you have plenty to spare, respect your dollar more; it's the only power you have in the digital marketplace.

Нападёт именно на то же место, где закончилась предыдущая война. Завоёванные города, выжженная территория без дорог, тысячелетия войны - эту нацию ничто не остановит. Покорить окончательно её тоже не реально. Как итог, вы и эта нация внизу турнирной таблицы, примерно в два раза проигрывая по очкам остальному миру. Сценарий повторился несколько раз.

《文明IV》絕對是一款經典遊戲，感覺與其他《文明》遊戲不同。 這個遊戲有很多東西，你肯定會學到很多，尤其是如果你是一個新玩家。 作為一名新玩家，我建議玩定居者難度遊戲，因為這將促進你的文明，讓你更容易學習和玩。

優點：

這是一個經典。

有這麼多有趣的機制需要學習。

有很多領袖可供選擇和發揮。

生成的地圖相當不錯。

播放一些歷史場景。

A.我很聰明。

用你的文明征服或附庸整個世界，或者外交與和平。

不同的勝利目標，如，統治，文化，科學，宗教，外交和得分。

建立你的軍隊末日，這樣就沒有人會違抗你。

Nuke每一個你不喜歡的文明。

打造世界奇觀。

和你的朋友玩多人遊戲，也許最終會互相憎恨。

非常有趣的mods玩。

就我玩這個遊戲的時間而言，沒有bug。

新玩家友好型。 （有點）。

壞的：

圖形是舊的，但這並不是一個大問題，因為這是一個老遊戲。

很難用mods玩多人遊戲。

地球地圖很難看。 我建議下載GEM（巨型地球地圖）。

成就難度：

*沒有成就*

結論：

我不得不說，《文明IV》是一款近乎完美的遊戲。 我絕對可以整天向專業人士介紹這場精彩的比賽。 《文明IV》會讓你玩上幾個小時，學習幾個小時，你會想打那一個回合，離建造奇迹或組織更近一點，等等。我有時會因為這個遊戲而忘記時間。 我強烈建議你玩它的資料片《超越劍》，因為你會從遊戲中獲得最大收益，但它要求你購買《文明IV》，這樣你才能玩《超越劍”資料片。 總的來說，《文明IV》對任何4X玩家來說都是一個巨大的推薦。 最後，小心覈武器製造者甘地。

As a leader of one of the eighteen civilizations of the base game (that can become even more with the two expansions, Warlords and Beyond the Sword) the player is expected to explore the surrounding lands (in a potentially procedurally generated map) and expand their city borders, found new cities or conquer others to gradually become an empire and eventually win a campaign that spans from the stone age to the near future of 2050. Victory can be achieved in many ways, from being the first civilization to reach outer space, to remaining the only civilization that is left on the map. The most interesting and addicting factor of Civilization IV are the choices the player takes, each one leading their civilization’s progress in a different direction. The technology tree is interesting and varied, allowing to focus on military prowess in one game or scientific progress in another; each choice could be the better one, depending on the map, the adversaries and the success in building world wonders or founding religions. Accompanying these potentially endless games are decent graphics that are clear to understand despite the complexity of the system and an incredibly (and award winning!) soundtrack. The Warlord expansion adds six more civilizations, more leaders and unique scenarios to the main game, but is otherwise unremarkable. The Beyond the Sword expansions is a lot better, adding ten more civilizations, more leaders, more unique scenarios and late game buildings; it also adds natural disasters and expanded victory conditions, making the end game a lot more interesting.

From its engaging gameplay mechanics to its intricate diplomacy system, Civilization IV is an experience that is as fun as it is intellectually stimulating.

At the heart of Civilization IV lies the core of its gameplay, which revolves around building a thriving civilization from scratch. Players begin as a small tribe with limited resources and gradually expand their reach across the map by developing new technologies, building infrastructure, and negotiating with other civilizations. The game offers a variety of paths to victory, including military conquest, cultural dominance, and scientific advancement, giving players the freedom to play the game in their own way.

One of the game's standout features is its diplomacy system, which allows players to forge alliances, trade resources, and negotiate peace treaties with other civilizations. The system is deep and nuanced, allowing players to use a variety of tactics to achieve their goals, from coercion and bribery to charm and flattery. The system also takes into account each civilization's unique characteristics, creating a dynamic and unpredictable playing field.

In addition to its gameplay, Civilization IV also boasts stunning visuals and a beautiful soundtrack that immerses players in the game's world. The attention to detail in the game's design is impressive, from the unique unit models to the lush environments and cityscapes.

Overall, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a true masterpiece of the strategy genre. It combines engaging gameplay mechanics with an intricate diplomacy system and stunning visuals to create an experience that is both intellectually stimulating and immensely enjoyable. Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer to the franchise, Civilization IV is a game that is not to be missed.",1682486599,1682486599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,

1. My playtime is a lie. Beyond the fact that the DLCs act as standalone games, and your playtime on them doesn't contribute to the base game, I also owned the CD-ROM version back in the day, and played it until disc rot made it literally unplayable.

2. The base game isn't the definitive way to enjoy this game. Get the Beyond the Sword expansion, because you're honestly doing yourself a disservice if you don't.

Now, onto the review.

I am a historian. It's an integral part of me. It's what I've studied, it's what I explore in my free time, it's what I can talk about for hours without a pause. Civilisation 4 is a large part of the reason why. It came out when I was pretty young and I was always terrible at it, but for hours an hours on end, after I came home from school, I would play Civ 4. Hundreds of hours. Thousands of hours. I played this game for [b]years[/b] almost religiously. As mentioned above, the CD-ROM I played it on eventually succumbed to disc rot because of how much I was handling it.

Even without Civilisation's long and impressive pedigree, this is quite possibly the perfect historical 4x game. It's easy to jump into at low levels, but with layers upon layers of strategy to dig down into. The graphics are aged, sure, the sound design is rough around the edges, and even through my extremely rose-tinted glasses I can acknowledge that it has its jank and weird moments, but getting through that rewards you with an endlessly replayable experience, always fresh, always there, always ready for you to make your mark on the world. It [b]oozes[/b] charm and care. The technology quotes are narrated by the late Leonard Nimoy for Christ's sake! (One of his only non-Star Trek related video game credits alongside Kingdom Hearts, funnily enough.)

I still go back to it, year after year. Partially out of nostalgia, yes, but also because it hooks me like no other Civ game really can. Civ 5 is excellent, yes, and SM:AC probably some of the best science fiction ever put into video game format, but Civ 4 will always be my beloved.

And, if you've somehow extracted all the dopamine from the base game, fear not. The modding community for this game is prodigious, and it even comes bundled with a few of them to give you a taste. My personal recommendation, if you find the base game too slow or not detailed enough, is the truly ludicrous mod of Caveman2Cosmos.

I've only played almost 20 hours of civ 4 currently. I've played thousands of hours in civ 3 since i was a kid and i think it's safe to say it's my favorite turn based game, or was until i played civ 4 that is. In my opinion they are virtually the same game, with civ 4 having a few slight improvements (and one or two things i don't like as much)

Some of the changes are not necessarily an improvement or a detriment, just makes them different. There is some different music although civ 4 does retain some of the same soundtrack. I really enjoy both soundtracks. I havnt found a way to make armies in civ 4 yet and i found them instrumental to military victory in civ 3. The graphics in civ 4 are slightly cartoony and i kinda liked the look of civ 3 better. But that's just  my opinion. I also don't care for the way artillery seems to work in civ 4 where they get into direct engagement with an enemy each instead of bombarding, which changes my gameplay a bit. I do like that i'm challenged to change my play style which has made me a better player while the game still remains pretty balanced. 
In civ 3 i found it easy to expand exponentially with spamming settlers, but it civ 4 i found the maintenance costs too great and i was forced to slow down. I really like the way maintenance works now. Instead of many of the buildings coming with a certain cost(some still have cost requirements), the cost is attributed to the city itself. And instead of having corruption costs the further you are from your capital, you simply have maintenance costs and the courthouse still serves the same function in both cases. 
Another reason i found it suitable to slow down expansion was because i used to play civ 3 with the barbs on sedentary. Maybe i just havnt figured it out yet, but there doesnt seem to be way to alter the barbarian behavior or even to alter the amount of players manually in single player, although it of course changes based on the map size. I figure some of these things i used to do in civ 3 were kinda cheating and i really needed the challenge to become a better player. Here are some things i've had to work on in order to be decent at civ 4:
I used to automate my workers. Yes, im very noobish for doing this after all this time and after actually studying the behavior of the workers i realized how incredibly lazy i had been for not micromanaging them. In civ 4 i really need the economy boost to continue my expansion. so i end up building a lot of cottages at first while keeping a careful eye on my food, trying to maintain a small food surplus for growth. And don't forget that building settlers and workers effects population growth so build accordingly. 
In order to boost my economy i cut down forests to add to my production. This one is pretty obvious and i  used to use it sometimes but found i never really needed to manually use my workers in civ 3. Of course if i had been playing above noble (the balanced difficulty) this would have been a requirement.
These days i usually keep my science at either 0% or 100%. You will make more money and research will be greater in many cases than if you stay at 70% for example. This may changes as you continue to build libraries, universities, ect... 
After playing civ 4 i felt like i had been getting away with ignoring a few fundamentals of civ 3.
Pros:
In civ 4 unit selection, cycling is not as glitchy and usually will rotate through the stack instead of some random unit somewhere else although it still seems to do it sometimes. 

the map regenerate button is awesome. Especially useful in civ 4 for regenerating a new map because they always stick my capital next to an ocean.

The players also seem to be more evenly spaced out from one another at the beginning of the game but that may be due to not manipulating too many or to few AI when i choose the settings. 

Cons:

There seem to be less options for generating a new game, although some have also been added liked having a pressed or natural coast.

I miss the old artillery.


All in all Civ 4 is mostly an improvement over civ 3 and i would recommend someone holding out playing the older installations to give it a try. 

I also feel the need to add that the base games seem to have roughly the same civs. With the civ 3 gold edition there were a lot of civs added. There do seem to be extra civs in the civ 4 expansions which are separate and i have gotten to them yet.",1668548767,1668548767,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,

Recomendo o CIV 4 e anteriores, mas não recomendo o CIV 5 para cima. 

Este jogo possui:
- Animações;
- Considerações por suas escolhas;
- Cada descoberta gera impactos para mudança de governo (inexistente no CIV 5 para cima);
- Não tem cidade-estado;
- A diplomacia e relações entre civilizações dependem unicamente e suas ações;
- O Zoom é mil vezes melhor que o CIV 5 e superior;
- Tem movimentos pelo mapa de animais, efeitos de unidades e a interface é bem mais 'na mão';
- É leve, roda em qualquer PC;
- Tem pacotes do Tipo civilizações antigas, colonização, guerreiros o que complementa a saga

I say this as someone who has played every civilization game except for Civ VI. I got the original game as a birthday present from my parents and became obsessed with each one since, so I know the strengths and weaknesses of them. The early civilization games were good, but had flaws. For instance, if you screwed up even a little bit, your game was finished. Never ending wars were a constant issue in civ 1-3 to the point where it became like Orwell's 1984; ""we were always at war with Ghandi..."" It was only truly fixed in this game where peace treaties became binding and it was not possible to cross borders without an open borders agreement (in the old games, you could keep troops in your opponent's territory and they would have to tell you to get out or declare war, after which most AI would declare war). So Civ 4 (this game) fixed these issues whilst still retaining the core gameplay which was utterly decimated in Civ V and newer versions. Later versions changed the core gameplay a lot and added complexity which doesn't really complement the game at all. Most people were happy that unit stacks were removed (i.e. you could no longer have 20 riflemen, 10 artillery, and 5 catapults on one tile) and with other changes to how combat works, but I feel that it ruined the game. It made combat more strategic in a way, but also more complicated in a bad way for gameplay & enjoyability. It's hard to describe exactly why, but Civ IV had the best of both worlds: the beginning of improvements that made civ better whilst also retaining the game mechanics and spirit of the old civ. 

Oh, and I actually have 300 hours on this game, plus a bit more from when I owned it before having a steam account. I don't know why, but it reset my hours when I reinstalled this game on my new PC.

Edit: i must have been on drugs when i wrote this review because civ IV with BTS is the best of the entire civ collection, i think i got confused with civ III, i bought each civ game so my steamy account had juice from yesteryear in it and i think ive not actually played civ4 till now and to me it takes the good bits from civ 3 then pumps them up for civ4. 
The good bits i've noticed so far are the icons and ui style are ripped straight from civ3 but with civ5 graphics for most of the rest, the rivers work similar to pre civ5 games and are animated too unlike civ5, trees are also animated and grow and decline in civ4,  the troops also stack which i used to love in civ 2-3 and make it feel bigger somehow, ive not reached late game yet but tube vids and other web pages show a much better end game than any civ game.
The voice acting is by Spock ❤ and each troop has it's own speech and you can actually hear what they are saying unlike other civ games, the graphics are not dated in my opinion and work really well for this game plus the game is really quick loading and playing on modern pcs compared to other civ games.
Also the modding community is pretty huge for this game and once ive played a few dozen games of vanilla civ 4 BTS i will be adding a few mods and there's a few which totally change the game giving even more value, some mods are none workshop so you will need to install from none steam websites but it's easy to install, and there is an inbuilt map editor from the get go not like the annoying ridiculously hard to use one in civ 5.

With this fourth attempt, the series has cleaned up almost all of its old shortcomings. The interface is nearly as streamlined as gameplay this complex will allow, and the controversial “strategic resources” from [i]III[/i] have been made more plentiful and less decisive. In fact, due to overhauls of several mechanics, especially combat, this is probably the most balanced these games have ever been. It feels more organic than past titles as well – large cities spill out into adjacent tiles, the spread of religion across societies is only moderately controllable, and there are more numerous and interesting options for government style, unit promotion, and Great Person behaviour. The only remaining issues that aren’t endemic to the genre (such as game speed) are in the presentation. Outside of the famously incredible title theme, the music is quite boring, there are some odd sound effect choices, and the jump to 3D visuals had mixed results.

But games like solitaire and the ubiquitous merging games found on cell phones and computers today simply bore me to tears.  I have been playing Civilization from when the very first edition came out in 1991.  I welcomed CIV II and CIV III, but the advent of CIV VI gave me the strategy game I really was looking for.

I play CIV IV because it gives me the opportunity to win by diplomacy, cultural spread, and the space race as alternatives to outright war against the other civilizations. I play just the desktop mode, and generally customize to run the largest maps with marathon speed to let me really get into micromanaging the cities and units in games that might take me months to win, depending the real life time I have available to me.  

For me it is the journey  I take in developing my civilization, rather than the winning over the others that I enjoy.  I set the game to always be in a state of peace (which I know is unrealistic) and dive in to the complexities of diplomacy and culture to either work together with the AI's civilizations or to entice them to join me through my culture development (usually by culture bombing the border cities by having Great Artists move to those locations and creating their Great Works). 

I have yet to find another strategy game that caters as much to those players who don't enjoy warfare focused games as they do to those who are more interested in military conquest.

И не смотря на то что я успел поиграть V-ую и VI-ую часть и ознакомиться с III-ей, IV-ую часть Я ЛЮБЛЮ БОЛЬШЕ.
Дело не в ностальгии, нет. Есть полно игровых аспектов, которые заставляют вернуться сюда и надолго.
Да, я знаю что некоторые механики и функции в 5-ой и 6-ой части заставляют покинуть эту часть, чтобы окунуться в ту атмосферу которой тебе не хватает в 4-ой (у меня лично это: графика/границы и торговые пути в Civ5, создание своей религии и микро менеджмент в Civ6, в целом большое кол-во наций и более облегченная стратегия боя)
Но как по мне механику коррумпированности городов, механику захвата городов культурой, многоуровневые отряды (когда по 100 юнитов на одной клетке), более сильные ИИ (из за развития стратегий в 8 клеток), механику вассалов, постоянного союза и города варваров зря убрали/упростили в последующих частях. Это те вещи, которых не хватает для более сложной стратегии развития и войны, которой не хватает профессиональным игрокам.
К тому же здесь более удобна специализация городов, что позволяет развиваться не от клеток, а строений, жителей и специалистов в самом городе. И это один из пунктов, позволяющих выиграть партию при малом кол-ве городов, а в последующих частях (особенно в CivVI) всё зависело от кол-во территорий и от развития районов, что уже сразу могло сказать кто победит и люди начинают покидать катку не доведя её до здравого конца.
Я уже молчу про интерфейс и художественные заморочки разработчиков. Да, текстуры желают лучшего (хотя модов, улучшающие графику, полно), но анимация постройки Чудес Света, загрузочные экраны, простота типизации юнитов и зданий, саундтреки, возможность полюбоваться самой планетой - это то что у меня крутилось в голове на протяжении 3-ёх лет когда я покинул эту часть цивилизации и перешёл на более поздние.

Вообщем Sid Meier's Civilization IV - one love. Вы как хотите, а я останусь тут! Можете позвать в партейку другую; буду рад. Особенно если вам надоела Civ5 или Civ6, и вы не играли в эту. Советую хотя бы попробовать. Здесь СОВЕРШЕННО другая механика и она кардинально отличается сама по себе от всех частей, как предыдущих, так и последующих.

Hearts of Iron IV and Ark: Survival Evolved being those two other games. It was a Mitigation measure to ensure i wouldn't spend a whole night playing due to the sheer craftsmanship of these 3 Games that would keep me at my keyboard thinking about what to do next. it's a diplomatically polite way to admit to the Addictive properties behind the Designs of all three Games. HOI4 was the first inclusion but without thinking I had no doubt Civilization IV already stirred the same experience from the whirlwind of a mind under Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, thou very mild and mitigated when the ""Hyperfixiation"" symptom that Asperger's Syndrome is known for comes into play).

good buy for only 5-7 USD in a Steam Sale for every Expansion. Beyond the Sword Especially i Consider the Definitive Civ 4 Expansion since Warlords and Colonization were likely more of a Gameplay Experiment.

Might of Been the Nintendo Switch Version as my only Experience of Civ VI but the Cohesion of the Experience Especially when Compared to Civ IV... It did not hold up. the same song being used through the entire game with different time period sound fonts felt like a broken Record and at some points I don't know when it transitioned to Another Era. At least Civ IV had a Better soundtrack for this from it's own Ancient tracks and Antiquity down to the Rennaisance and Medieval Pieces from Public Domain. Civ III Tracks even made it in. VI barely felt like a True Sid Meier's Civ game though i can blame that on my General Incompetence with a Controller and the Tech and Cultural Trees Feeling Awkward. Also used to IV's Squares instead of Hexagons. I Felt like the Map Needed to be Bigger, i Ran out of Room quick in a my Capitols to Build Manufactories and I had a Whole Continent to myself in the New World. 

It Hit uncanny Valley when i went to China to Sent an Embassy there and Realized that not only Qin Shi Huang was the leader of China instead of a Later dynasty like the Ming or Qing but that They Had Bullet Trains in the Early 1900s (I was Expecting WW1) and that the Hunnic Migrations never Quite had it's Consequences End with the Poles being Further West then the Vistula (The Rabbit Hole that Is Studying the Fall of Rome to see How it could Repeat when MIT (that Massachusetts Institution of Technology) Literally Predicted not that long Ago that Society will collapse Bronze Age style Within this Century). At Least Gilgamesh was a Good Friend when they Founded the New World in the Late 1800s. At least somewhat predictable in the Event that Medieval Europe never was subjected to Muslim Expansionism since Discovery was Fueled by the Fall of Constantinople and the Sheer Will to Bypass the Silk Road under Ottoman Control. Yes Learning History is something else i do to Stave boredom like it's the Plague and i found many Humors while doing so; Plague doctor jargon aside to the Blood letting table. suppose i'm such a late bloomer that i only now think of the idea of making custom scenarios. ideas are a dime a dozen and products and prototypes are the Gold of the Gold Standard that Backs a Worthy Suggestion. I digress my rant, my ADHD turns me into an Abraham Lincoln and Vladimir Putin when it comes to Keeping the Unions between Country-states together and keeping a concise meaning in a world wall of the different shades of print

Better experience over graphics any day would happen to be the Bias i Shine like a Motto at. the Tier list war amongst the Franchise Playerbase has convinced me thoroughly that Civ 4 is the Best Civ Game. if it wasn't for that i would have never come to know that IV was the Final and Apex of Sid's work; Akin to How Final Fantasy 9 was Composer Nobuo Uematsu's Final Game (where he composed solely, he was passing 10 to a successor concurrently) and in his own words ""Magnum Opus"" though i Consider FF6's Soundtrack to be the Best.

A: Yes I turned on comments because a Humanly debate amuses me when video games fail to accomplish the ole Roman Bread and Circus mechanic used by most modern deep states and Our Civilization's Very own Political Machine.

Perfect if you want to just chill, drink coffee, relax, and multi-task; since it's a turn-taking game. This is the one you want if your computer can't quite run Civilization 5 properly and it's the one you buy when Civilization 3 is just too primitive for you. Yes! This one's sure got a bundle of a bunch more spice than Civilization 3; however if you're looking for less of a challenge then turn back, right now. The A.I. still practically does almost everything it can do in it's power; once the planet-map's made; to completely work against you.. The only way I've discovered of keeping up to them and becoming somewhat of a super-power-nation, is to go with the flow; and hope to Jesus Christ that you've got some really great resources in the early game. (You want either a massive river or river-system/delta, you want one of your cities to be on the coast with fish, or/and any amount of stone/copper/iron/silver/gold/gems/diamonds in your close-reaching-grasp.) ((Big fertile lands of rivers with great farmland is just perfect for building up a large population to get things done or simply to raise a simple/large army/navy; although, you're definitely going to want at least one city in your empire to be on the ocean with some sort of type of fish... And don't forget to go nuts over things that either bring you much money: or things that'll upgrade the quality of your peoples' tools/weapons.)) A small army with an abundance of copper can easily annihilate a massive army of simple people who don't have access to creating bronze weapons out of a certain tin/copper consistency. I hope the game takes into account that hardened bronze takes at least 3 years to become hardened to almost it's maximum potential. It'd be even more silly if you had stone walls before the enemy tried breaking in with their soldiers, armed with bronze weapons: because if you researched archery and have some guys with bows/arrows in your walled-city - it can be crazy-difficult for the enemy to break into that. So, no... You really don't need copper and tin to become powerful, though, you need them to make bronze if you're going on the offensive. Which reminds me, if you choose to make your nation a slave-trade, which happens in the early game: after researching the ability to have bronze, you can become a slave-trade. I highly recommend that you do become a slave trade if you want to be successful at an incredible rate because it's simply one of the steps Mankind has to take in order to compete strongly with many other nations of men. (It's practically the only way to become a strong super power in the early game which usually means you actually have a shot at survival; I've done many games without doing the slave-trade thing and it always ends up with my nation getting left in the dust and fighting off against hoards of barbarians or simply getting erased by an enemy nation, who did decide to become a slave trade.) ((But to become a super successful slave trade, towering over all of your enemies, nearby: you absolutely need a source of copper connected with roads to your most military-enhanced city; which's usually got to either be your capital city or one that you created a barracks in, right off the bat.)) As far as becoming an extremely massive slave-trade, you really need to conduct assaults with the dudes who have bronze, 2-handed, axes.. Often just a few of these bronze-axe-men combatant armies can, easily and absolutely, wreck an enemy nation who isn't immersed with an amount of abundant copper. It's necessary to conquer these militaristically 'weaker' nations because: as a slave trade; you need to enslave many other people, you can't be enslaving many of your own people or there'll be turmoil in the streets and wonders of your own empire! As a slave trade, you must conquer at least one other nation; no matter how kind they are; or suffer radical and economic collapse. This is how you can become an economic powerhouse in the early times of the world or be prepared to be easily picked off a tree and eaten by; barbarians, your own people, or/and another slave-trading empire: it's practically like this anyway... To tell you the truth, complex strategy and being responsive in many ways are how you take off from being a slave trade. Choose a good religion for your people which suits the overall strategy of you and your empire. If you don't go a strong religious route and are not very successful in becoming a good and quite religious empire; then be prepared for your empire to go into revolution after revolution against you. I personally, always try to hit religion at the same time that Christianity is introduced in the game-match; it's also alright to take that religion from another nation: as long as you end up on top of them, at some point; power-wise. If your nation's the one that Christianity happens in via enabling a bit of liberty so it's much more possible - then you have the best ability to subdue the other nations, both with peace, obligations, or simply war. If your nation's the first Christian nation; you've really got the game in the bag and you really ought to save the game right then and there. I say this because the rest of the game's going to require much more, complex and responsive, immensely great strategy and tactics. Pick up as much iron as you can by this time; you need to prepare for the era of the future world wars: if they even erupt. You have to get ready to make complex machinery on an industrial level; definitely become a monarch along the way, too. You need oil deposits. If you don't have at least 2 deposits of iron connected with roads to your military production centres; and if you don't have at least one deposit of oil connected in the same way; you don't stand a chance in a world war. Become a thinker like an industrial revolutionary leader!!!!! If you don't have at least 2 units of infantry and at least one unit of some sort of combat-vehicle; like tanks, bomber-planes, or artillery: then go back to that save file that I told you to make, earlier. If you don't; then if a world war happens: and it's highly likely in this game: you're getting stomped and your nation will belong to another in a hurry. For the amount of raw, non-politically-correct, and difficult: realism: I give this game a 10/10. It really doesn't need the hottest graphics and sure lacks a bit in the quality of the sprites and what you get visually: this game isn't even for a wide screen monitor.. But, for what it's taught me about just how competitive you need to be as a people; in order to survive for thousands of years, even making choices that're considered major mistakes today: in order to maintain your people on a competitive level... I will not take off any of my rating for the lack of great visuals. (It's not the worst game on a graphic and visual level, but it could sure use a wide-screen version.) You're all the very best for reading my review and dedicating your time to check out my profile! Thank you all very much for your time and energy, take care, have a good time, stay safe, enjoy, and good bye for now!!

You balance the development of your cities' infrastructure, the quantity and quality of your military, your research projects, and trade routes. And using whatever means you can, you vie for victory by achieving any of a variety of victory conditions, such as being the first to colonize space or by becoming the uncontested global superpower.

I played the balls absolutely off of Civilization II back in the Windows 98 days. It was an exceptional game for its time. But Civilization IV became my favorite entry into the late 2000s. The territory game mechanic in particular was a much appreciated improvement, in addition to graphical, UI, and music modernization efforts.

I only ever have two complaints with Civ IV, or with most of the Civilization games, One, that city management over long periods of time can be obnoxious to micromanage. It can be time consuming and aggravating to try and keep your cities keeping up with their infrastructure, and some of the later AI improvements to help automate this aren't always the best. Two, sometimes you get absolutely whacked by a large number of units that appear suddenly out of nowhere deep within your territory. I wish Civ IV had the mechanic included in even older Total War games to reduce this frustration, namely the ability for military units to construct watchtowers to maintain visibility (instead of requiring engineers to build forts).

In single playthroughs, these are not nearly enough to eliminate the fun of the game. But it does prevent playability without long breaks of time in between game installs.

Pros:
+ Nice graphics (for its time)
+ Nice UI (for its time) and map navigation
+ Large variety of Civs, Units, and city buildings
+ Hatshepsut is a cutie

Cons:
- Micromanaging can be exceptionally time consuming, which can make longer games boring, and hurts replayability
- You can't build watchtowers with military units to help with map visibility, guaranteeing that large stacks of enemy troops will somehow zip past your suburbs to whack you deep behind the actual front.

Rating: A- (for its time), B+ (for 2021)

A Youtuber with a channel called RazingHel has a three part series that I found to be very edifying as a newcomer to Civ IV, and I will include a link to the first video in that series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgBnpbaQFo4.",1626847558,1626847558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Trudno było wtedy nie zachłysnąć się ogromem produkcji, tym bardziej biorąc pod uwagę datę wydania, ponieważ konkurencyjne tycoony zostały wtedy zmiecione niczym zabudowania po uderzeniu bomby atomowej. Wielkie miasta, mnóstwo smaczków historycznych, ciekawe animacje, olbrzymie wojska, a do tego względnie proste założenia: zjedz, albo zostań zjedzony. No i utwór ""Baba Yetu"" w menu, którego można było wtedy słuchać godzinami.

Oczywiście, grafika się zestarzała, user experience może już nieco odstraszać, a pewne rozwiązania wydają się być żywcem wyjęte z ery kamienia łupanego(dosłownie). Nie zmienia to jednak faktu, że jest to naprawdę wyjątkowo udana strategia, która nie przytłacza ogromem opcji czy możliwości, co niejednokrotnie potrafi odrzucać na przykład w przypadku gier rozgrywanych w przestrzeni kosmicznej. Łatwo tu zrozumieć podstawowe założenia, ryzyko jakie niosą poszczególne decyzje czy ocenić dalszy kierunek rozwoju.

Ta część kładzie ogromny nacisk na bezpośredniość rozgrywki. Chcesz handlować technologiami kosztem bezpośredniego rozwoju rywala? Proszę bardzo. Wypowiedzieć wojnę już przy pierwszym ujrzeniu facjaty jednego z oponentów? Nic prostszego. Podczas rozbudowy nie dbasz o swoje miasta? Zatem będzie się unosiła nad nimi zielona chmura odoru i zanieczyszczeń, jasno informująca cię o jego rynsztokowym stanie, uniemożliwiając tym samym ich jakąkolwiek adorację. Krótko.

AI naprawdę ciekawie kombinuje, choć zdarzają się tam decyzje irracjonalne. Nie są jednak przesadnie namolni, a wszelki kontakt ograniczony jest do minimum. Ciekawym smaczkiem jest możliwość dyskutowania z władcami o poszczególnych oponentach, celem poznania ich relacji międzypaństwowych lub rozmowy na temat łączących was umów, zamiast serii tabelek czy infografik. Nadaje to nieco bardziej dyplomatycznego tonu i pozwala bardziej zaangażować się w świat gry.

Trzeba jednak zwrócić uwagę na chyba największą bolączkę gry, jaką potrafi być jej chaotyczność. Granice rozszerzają się bardzo nieregularnie(co jest świetnym ukłonem w stronę realizmu, rujnuje jednak nieco przejrzystość), jednostki mogą stacjonować na jednym polu w dziesiątkach oddziałów(znów, świetna sprawa pod kątem faktycznych konfliktów zbrojnych, ale ogromne utrudnienie przy odczytywaniu możliwości bojowych rywala), a do tego często niesprawiedliwy, losowy system siły bojowej, oparty na procentowym prawdopodobieństwie wygranej. Generalnie, w pewnym momencie po prostu trudno nad tym zapanować. Ale taki już chyba po prostu urok tej części.

Co tu dużo mówić, naprawdę świetna opcja dla fanów starszych strategii, chcących raczej zabawić się i poznać niuanse serii, aniżeli analitycznie podchodzić do rozgrywki. Świetna opcja również dla młodszych graczy, którzy nie czują się jak galery na morzu w skomplikowanych grach z trudnym progiem startu, więc mogą spokojnie zbierać szlify w starszym wydaniu.

Polecam wszystkim, którzy jeszcze nie grali w żadną część serii Civilization, mając jednak na uwadze, że ta konkretna odsłona nie nabrała smaku z wiekiem niczym wino. Nadal jest to dobra, nieco humorystyczna strategia z zacięciem, która przy odpowiednim zaangażowaniu zaoferuje rozgrywkę na wieeele godzin. I będą to, w moim odczuciu, naprawdę dobrze spędzone godziny.",1625840550,1625840550,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

Szkoda, że ta gra ma tak małą popularność. Dla osób, które nie wiedza, jest to gra strategiczna która nawet ja, który  grał w tą grę ( łącznie z dodatkami) naprawdę sporo czasu, to nie jestem w stanie obczaić 4 poziom trudności ( z 9). 
To teraz tak, jeśli poszukujecie dobrej gry strategicznej i nie przeszkadza wam nieco starsza oprawa graficzna, to ta gra jest dla was ;).

Na początek, pierwszy powód by w tą grę zagrać. Cena. Za niecałe 50zł macie tą grę i 3 dodatki. ( mój ulubiony dodatek to Beyond the Sword). Moim zdaniem naprawdę warto.

Następna rzecz. Gra jest niesamowicie rozbudowana, jak w nią gram, to nie chce mi się wierzyć ,że to 2005 rok! Bardzo fajna muzyka, wszystko w tej grze jest wyraźnie przedstawione, pełna kontrola nad miastami. Bardzo, bardzo dużo technologii. Różne rodzaje mapy, dobrze rozwinięte iq przeciwników. 
Ta gra ma wszystko co powinna miec dobra gra strategiczna. Wszystkie następne części na tej bazują.

Gra ma ogromną moc wciągania, szczególnie gdy toczymy walki, zawsze chcemy jeszcze i jeszcze i jeszcze tu coś zrobię, a tam wyślę wojska, a tego zaatakuję, a tu się trzeba obronić a tam w mieście ludzię głodują trzeba się tym zająć. No i z tego wszystkiego wychodzi, że jesteśmy przyklejeni do tego ekranu godzianami.

Do tego tryb fajny tryb multiplayer, troszeczkę spowalnia grę, ale z takimi komputerami co dzisiaj mamy, nie będzie odczuwalna różnica.

PODSUMOWUJĄC
Jeżeli lubice gry stratgiczne, troche retro to wam tą grę zdecydowanie polecam. Mimo to, odejme 1 punkt, z uwagi na to, że nie jestem ogromnym fanem gier strategicznych.

И если бы не десятки, а то и сотни часов, проведенных за Civ3, вкупе с поднакопившейся усталостью от игровых условностей и местного ИИ — именно четвертая часть ""Цивилизации"" могла стать моим любимым выпуском серии. Ведь, оглядываясь назад, четверка кажется наиболее вылизанной и грамотной итерацией культовой франшизы. Особенно если сравнивать базовые версии, без платных DLC и аддонов, выпуском которых нынче так любят злоупотреблять создатели серии.

Sid Meier's Civilization IV унаследовала лучшие черты своих предшественниц, довела до ума отдельные механики и внесла уйму небольших изменений и улучшений в устоявшуюся формулу. Благодаря куда более удобному и информативному интерфейсу, похорошевшей графике, выдержанной стилистике (привет вырвиглазно мультяшным Civ6 и Revolution) и поддержке FullHD разрешения — проект смотрится и играется приятно по сегодняшний день. А количество стартового контента, старых и новых цивилизаций, а также наличие альтернативных лидеров приятно удивляют.

Из недостатков можно отметить традиционно неадекватное поведение ИИ (особенно при игре на марафонской скорости, на огромных картах с максимальным количеством противников), а также «нечестную» сложность, повышение которой достигается не за счет «хитрости» ИИ, а за счет системы бонусов для компьютерных оппонентов и штрафов для игрока. Но обе эти проблемы — бич всей серии, который разработчики успешно игнорируют более двух десятилетий.

Несмотря на свой солидный возраст, Sid Meier's Civilization IV отлично подойдет в качестве отправной точки для знакомства с серией, особенно если вас не интересует онлайн-мультиплеер. В отличие от более новых частей, четверка куда менее требовательна к железу и финансам, но затягивает ничуть не меньше.

______________________________________________

When I found out that Civilization IV had been out for a couple of years, I was still playing its predecessor. And if it weren't for the dozens or even hundreds of hours I've spent playing Civ3, coupled with fatigue from its limitations and dumb AI — Civ4 could, potentially, became my favourite instalment in the whole series. Looking back, the fourth part seems to be the most polished and competent iteration of the iconic franchise. Especially if you compare the basic versions, without the paid DLC and add-ons, which the creators of the series are so like to abuse nowadays.

Sid Meier's Civilization IV inherited the best features of its predecessors, polished its mechanics and made a lot of small changes and improvements to the well-established formula. Thanks to a much more user-friendly and informative interface, fancier graphics, mature stylistics (hello to cartoonish Civ6 and Revolution) and FullHD resolution support — the project looks and plays pleasantly to this day. And the amount of starting content, old and new civilizations, as well as the presence of alternative leaders are surprising. 

Of the drawbacks, I could mention the traditionally inadequate behaviour of the AI (especially when playing at marathon speed on huge maps with the maximum number of opponents), as well as the ""unfair"" difficulty, which increases not via the ""cunning"" AI, but through a system of bonuses for computer opponents and penalties for the player. But both of these problems are the scourge of the entire series, which the developers have successfully ignored for over two decades.

Despite its solid age, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a great starting point for getting to know the series, especially if you're not interested in online multiplayer. Unlike the newer instalments, Sid Meier's IV is much less demanding in terms of hardware and finances but is just as addictive.

What hurts 4 versus 5 and 6 is that technology and media distribution has changed, so I miss what the 2 newer ones actually improved. I am having to reteach myself the old ways of Civ.

Da ich lediglich Civ IV und Civ VI gespielt habe, kann ich wenige vergleiche zu den Vorgängern ziehen. 

Das Gameplay besteht aus dem Managen, erschaffen und Zerstören von Einheiten und Städten. Die Städte stellen den Kern des Spiels dar, dort werden Gebäude und Einheiten errichtet. Um die Bauzeit verschiedenster Produktionen zu beschleunigen, kann man in den Städten Bautrupps errichten. Diese modifizieren die Felder um die Stadt herum mit diversen Gebäuden und Einrichtungen. Um weitere Truppen und Gebäude freizuschalten, muss man forschen. Die Forschungsbäume sind umfangreich und an die Zeitalter, welche das Spiel abdecken möchte, akkurat angepasst. 

Das Kampfgameplay, hängt beinahe ausschließlich von den Feldern, auf denen sich die Einheiten befinden, und den Spezifischen Kombinationen der Einheiten ab. Beinahe jede der Einheiten besitzt Felder mit Boni. Ebenfalls wichtig, sind die Einheiten welche aufeinander treffen, so sind Lanzenträger beispielsweise stärker gegen Kavallerie als gegen Infanterie. Bei einem aufeinandertreffen zweier verfeindeter Einheiten, werden nun also die Felder beider Einheiten berücksichtigt, welche, genau wie die Kombination der Aufeinandertreffenden, Modifikationen zur Grundstärke der Einheiten bieten. Aus der Differenz dieser Stärke wird dann eine Siegwahrscheinlichkeit vor dem Angriff eingeblendet. 

Die Grafik des Spiels ist den Umständen entsprechend gut, und vor allem der Artstyle, ist allen anderen Teilen der Reihe überlegen. 

Das Online-Gameplay ist simpel einzurichten und lässt sich jederzeit Lokal sicher um zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt weiterzuspielen.

I wound up getting this game again during the Summer Sale for nostalgia, and was pleasantly surprised to find it still held up 15 years (!) after release!


Music: Great quality, great selection, not to mention the Grammy-winning ""Baba Yetu"" as the main menu theme. 9/10.

Graphics: Dated, but very well detailed on max settings. Mods like Blue Marble exist that push things even further. 7/10.

Gameplay: Many consider this the best Civ game, including me. Civ IV gave this series its modern look and feel, and it is a formula that is still in use even with Civ VI, 15 years later. Where this loses its point is the lack of an interactive tutorial for new Civ players, but the Civilopedia is useful to help with this. 9/10.

Learning curve: Easy if you've played a Civ game before, hard to learn if you haven't. The Civilopedia has some info, but you'll need to figure some stuff out yourself. 7/10


Final Point Tally: 32/40 (Excellent)

Final Verdict: Buy this game. The expansions are not needed but will enhance the playthrough further, though they are not compatible with each other (to my knowledge).

文明4 刀剑之上在中文系统下打开游戏会弹出XML Load Error，强行进去后文字标签不正常。

所以我写了个工具来解决这个问题，请自取~

---== 文明4 刀剑之上 XML Load Error 修复程序 v0.1 by Tom Willow ==---

原理：游戏内有些XML文件带有欧洲语言的特殊字符，例如德语的ü。
在中文系统下，这些特殊字符由于ASCII码超过127，会和后面的</German>等标签
粘连识别为中文，导致</开头的结束标签不能正确识别。
本程序运行时将扫描所在位置处所有XML文件，在发生粘连的位置加空格，以解决此问题。

使用方法：将本程序放入游戏文件夹（例如 Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword），然后运行。

It's a bit hard to talk about Civilization IV today. In many ways, Civilization IV is, you see, arguably the last genuinely great Civilization game. In many ways, its successor, Civilization V, is a superior game--more polished, more focused, with greater depth and better balance--and the definitive Civilization experience. But at the same time, I can't help but lament how unambitious subsequent Civilization games are--and that lack of ambition seems to be a patter currently affecting all of developer Firaxis' output. Rough around the edges though it may be, Civilization IV is still a fantastically engrossing and addictive turn-based grand strategy game, with hugely ambitious standalone expansions that radically transform the core rules and mechanics. Going back into Civilization IV today, one might be disappointed by the lack of modern polish--most especially the absence of tooltips and proliferation of awkward iconography in their stead--but despite it's self-evident age, I think Civilization IV still stands proud as a landmark 4x game.

And if Civilization IV on its own does not merit revisiting in the wake of Civilization V, its expansions--most notably Beyond the Sword--most certainly do.

But, also coz you can zoom in now on the world map and on units. You can still stack units in this game, which i love to do. I mean, lets face it, who doesnt like stacking a hundred units to continually pillage other cities, or to just wipe them from the map. 
I have probably around 100 hours in game time playing this game, but for me, i had the non steam version, so steam never kept track of those hours when i bought the steam version. And why i bought the steam version, was coz oneday, i think it was last year, i went to have a game of Civ IV non steam version, but Microsoft had done a update to Windows 10, and it essentially killed the non steam version of the game, so i had to rebuy the game on steam.
The pros :
The tech tree is pretty extensive with heaps of different technologies to research.
Heaps of different units to make.
Different scenarios to try.
Nice visuals for its era.
Nice soundtrack (if thats your cup of tea....or coffee) :)
Different lengths of game time to play, I.e; play a marathon length game or a quick length time game.  With marathon, it takes more turns to research items, to build improvements,etc. Where as quick games, the research, build times, etc are cut down so you can play more quickly, advance more quickly,etc.
Several DLC's to choose from...Or buy the complete edition where you get all dlc's included with base game.
Repeatability in playing the game over and over again.
Community modding content available. 

The cons : 
The DLC's...I have never agreed with a company that makes games, and then releases DLC's as an added extra purchase. I think thats just being greedy and the companies taking advantage of us players.  
The ONLY time i dont mind companies doing that, is if you are buying add on's for a MMO that i might play, which in turn keeps that game going. 
But not these sort of games where you buy the game, the DLC's SHOULD come with the base game. Its like they are charging us 2,3,4,5 times for the same game. With that being said, im going to contradict myself and tell you to go look at my profile and see how many DLC's i own :D.....Just because i dont agree with their methods, doesnt mean i wont buy their DLC's ;)
There are a few minor bugs in the game. But nothing game breaking. For worst case, its a visual bug, where the units, instead of walking to the next tiles, its like they just vanish and appear on the next tiles. Sort of like a warp i guess. Or if they do move to next tiles, they dont walk, they slide. 
Or, for me anyway with this one, i cant watch the intro of the gmae and then play the game, it just flat out crashes every time. Soon as the 2K logo shows up on screen, i have to click the mouse button to skip it to get to main menu. OR watch the entirety of the into and wait for it to load the main menu..Again, nothing game breaking. 

My thoughts :
Its still a great game in its own right. Civ VI offers non stackable units where as Civ IV allows stacking, so, its almost 2 different games with 2 different strategies for the player. 
Still has plenty of life in it along with plenty of entertaining hours of gameplay in it. 
Well worth purchasing if you like turn based games.

Civilization IV is, for me, the peak of the Civilization franchise. It's much more accessible and user friendly than the first 3 games, but isn't overly streamlined like the most recent games. It can be played casually and you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you can go deep into the micromanagement of it and make the game a lot more complicated, if that's how you prefer to play your strategy games. This flexibility is another of its strongest aspects, which is heightened due to the extensive modding community. It is the largest and most active modding community across the entire franchise (in my experience). There are some truly amazing mods that can completely change how the game is played and what it's about. My personal favorite would be Caveman 2 Cosmos. It has 5 times the technologies of the base game, which expands each era into its own small game of Civ. It is extremely long and adds dozens of new mechanics, so it might be too much of an overhaul for some people, although I still recommend giving it a shot.

10/10 (with Caveman 2 Cosmos mod)

So much good work went into this game.  From the graphics to the sounds to the gameplay.  While its not perfect I believe it is worth it for a low price.  I prefer this game over all other Civ computer games, although Civilization Revolution is by far my favorite it is only for console and I am tired of playing it.  I have played it so much.  I have also played Civ 4 PC a lot, way more than steam shows, because I also have the CD version of the game installed.  That is because I prefer to mod it and the steam version is not as mod-friendly IMO.  Although it can be I suppose if you install it to something like C:\civ4\ or some easily accessed directory.   Being able to modify most aspects of this game is really awesome.  It really is a game changer.

I have figured out that if you use custom continents and use tiny map and 4+ continents and only 2 other civs the game can be quite good.  It is a grind though.  I wish I had another human to play this with it would be awesome, however it is a huge time commitment and you will find it extremely hard to find someone to commit that time at the same time, as you.

Also I have modified the XML to remove all leader traits and change a couple unbalanced early game units.

I am liking a lot of the music in this game now, but not all of it, but I am modifying that as well since you can easily replace the MP3's in the game folder.

Well below here is my negative review, it is kind of funny, but true..  after I finished my first super long space race victory game..... space race in this game isnt for me, it's very tedious and feels like a chore, espcially compared  to Civ revolutions.... I was super suprised at all the global warming near the end of the game, LOL, I guess it was because of all my coal plants and and a few nukes detonated over China capital, lol... I have now modified the global warming chance also in the XML files.... seriously though it was out of control there was like 3-4 tiles every turn turning to desert in my main cities and it was pissing me off big time...
------------------gonna leave it for fun---------------


I have bought this but mainly played Warlords, however it is basically the same thing.  As a huge fan of Civilization 3, I wanted to like this game so much.  The graphics are well done, and the camera does not allow rotation which I much prefer in any strategy game.

  Of course the first thing I noticed is the game is totally unbalanced.  The Africans get an attacking unit right at the start that can move 2 spaces and other civs cant move 2 spaces for like 200 more turns.  The ""industrious"" leaders all get a +50 or is it 100% bonus to great wonder building speed.  Why is that unbalanced?  Well because this game is 70% building great wonders there is a great wonder for almost every technology.  These types of things are  unacceptable in a strategy game really and I noticed they have all been fixed in Civ 6.  Well, what I did is I modified the XML files of this game.  It is surprisingly modifiable and that is a plus.  Of course you can't modify a lot of things and it is a hassle to figure out.

Okay lets talk about the audio.  You have Nimoy narrating which is fine with me, but when he tries to joke, awkward.  The sounds when managing cities, which you have to do alot, are annoying.  The music system is rediculous.  So what happens is it plays the ""world theme"" unless you zoom in, and then it plays your ""civilization theme.""  It gets louder and softer depending on your zoom level, and there is a spot in between where it plays no music basically.  This is also the spot where the graphics look the best but its still playable.  Now if you play it zoomed out like most you are going to find the ""world theme"" to be not very good, and when it changes to the modern age you will have some disturbing modern classical ""doomed world"" theme to listen to.

Speaking of doomed world, the game tries very hard to make it feel that way, closer you get to the end, you will be bombarded with GLOBAL WARMING destroying your cities I kid you not.  Also on the ""Internet"" wonder they have a picture of AL GORE and I think they paid him to be in the game and use his global warming MYTH that I guess he has a copyright on?

Now lets talk AI.  The AI is just as bad if not worse than Civ 3.  Barbarians appear out of nowhere anywhere there is fog of war, as do other civilizations that attack you.  I don't think other civilizations have to even research or produce units in their cities at all.  Their units just show up out of the fog of war after a certain amount of turns.  Modifying XML files probably does not even affect a computer controlled opponent.  When in war, they will have maybe one invasion force, if you defeat that or they cant land or regardless they are going to go around just destroying your fishing boats and fishing spots.  Most annoying thing ever and not fun.  The AI will never attack you, until about 1850 AD and if you are winning, and then of course they will always declare war on you.  The enemy moves don't animate properly most of the time, leading to enemy just magically appearing without the camera tracking them or even showing them at all.  Due to the way the game shows multiple units there can be a huge force under one weak unit and you cannot tell.

Other forms of victory like space race is way too difficult and then the game just ends with no reward but a short crappy cutscene of you staring at earth from a window.  Nukes are underpowered and unsatisfying.  If you play the game with ""standard"" size map get ready for your game to last 100+ hours.  The map size changes on the type you choose and its really hard to create the right size map.  There are in reality no random maps there are continents, pangea, or waterworld, and one called fractal which I have found just creates continents or pangea.  I like to play maps with both continents and smaller islands and this game will not generate a map like that.

I highly recommend Civilization Revolutions over this, a great game for xbox 360, not perfect but way way better.",1560774096,1561033510,True,0,0,0.45649072527885437,0,True,False,False,False,

[h1] 역사적으로 훌륭한 게임. 하지만 손은 잘 안 가는 게임. [/h1]

본작은 굉장히 역사적인 게임입니다. 바바예투(BaBa YeTu)라는 명곡을 남긴 게임이기도 하며, CIV 3에 비해 UI적으로 크게 개선되었습니다.
실제로 플레이해보면 그래픽적으로는 확실히 Civ 5에 못 미치나, UI적으로는 굉장히 Civ 5와 비슷함을 느낄 수 있습니다.

다만, Civ 5, 6의 깔끔한 그래픽과 UI에 익숙해진 플레이어로서는 손이 잘 안 가는 게 사실입니다.
굉장히 역사적인 게임이니 respect하는 마음으로서 추천드립니다.",1556801883,1556801883,True,3,0,0.438045710325241089,0,True,False,False,False,

What I want from a game is frequently being given lots of not-obvious decisions that matter, where the right answer can be deduced through careful thought and thorough knowledge of the game.  I'm wanting a game where these choices matter far more than the dice.  What I don't particularly care about are the graphics, the story, or the ""emersive experience"" of feeling like I'm really talking to Cleopatra.

In Civ IV, one worker option is cottages, which are the short-term loss/long-term gain option.  Civ IV balances it well enough that thinking long term isn't necessarily the right choice; you have to assess the odds of a war within 10-50 turns and think about it.

Another home-run is the civics.  Many of the options are niche-strategies, but collectively, it's likely that you should eventually choose a niche.  For instance, one average, theocracy is bad.  But sometimes, a war is coming, and the free experience motivates building an army and crushing someone.  Even in games where I don't do this, the fact that I had this option looming over every single turn from turns 100-200 drives home how open ended the game is for players who want to explore the frontiers of just how high of a difficulty level can be beaten.

Also more so than Civ V and VI, I find myself taking different tech paths each time, which helps keep the game fresh and different each time.  In Civ V, I quickly felt like I had found the ""right"" strategy, and was now only testing to see how far it could take me.  In Civ IV, I've never felt like I've mastered it, or even close.",1555734406,1555734406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

[u]Graphics[/u]:
By now the graphics are a bit dated, though the relative simplicity retains its charm. Nothing better than seeing your Panzer tanks tearing through barbarian warriors wielding those chunky clubs.

[u]Gameplay[/u]:
Turn based. Strategically place your cities to maximize growth and production, while seeking out game changing resources like iron, coal, and oil. Produce workers and settlers to work and expand your territory, various military units to give your empire the edge on the battlefield, and buildings to give your cities vital perks. Construct wonders grant bonuses and give an edge in many areas. Research technologies that boost your advantage over your neighbors. Spread your religion(s) through your own lands and those of other civilizations, giving you a common cause. 

[u]Soundtrack[/u]:
One of the parts that makes the game timeless. Immerses you in the current age, from beating on tribal drums to [i]Miserere mei Deus[/i] to Piano Concerto no. 20. And who could ever forget Civ IV's theme?

Even so many years later, Civilization IV is a classic. Lots of replayability, with two DLC that add new civilizations, units, wonders and scenarios. Full price or on sale, worth your pennies.

После экспериментов с 5 и 6 частью серии я решил вернуться к Четвёртой Циве. Как же она хороша.. 

[b]Сюжет игры[/b]:
Вроде бы есть, но я его не увидел.

[b]Достоинства[/b]:
– Довольно-интересное дерево технологий. Всегда нужно думать, что тебе сейчас выгодно, а что можно оставить и на потом;
– Возможность играть разными стратегиями;
– Довольно адекватный ИИ (хоть и раздражает иногда);
– Понятный интерфейс, Всё удобно и на своих местах;
– Часы внутри игры и возможность поставить будильник.

[b]Недостатки[/b]:
– ИИ. Иногда его действия не поддаются осмыслению;
– Экономически и культурно развиваться тебе не дадут, обязательно будет война (как бы я ни играл, мне всегда объявляли войну);
– Игра затягивает, хочется сделать ещё ход, а за ним ещё ход... А потом уже утро.

[b]Вывод[/b]: Шикарная игра. Можно играть за одним ПК и получать удовольствие. (В пятую и шестую после этой игры лучше не играть).

Моя оценка 9 из 10. Рекомендую.

The gameplay is pretty self-explanatory: you get to control a build one of the myriad world civilizations, and you must defend it and defeat your opponent. There are different ways to defeat your enemy, but it must be done before the time limit elapses. This s a turn-based game, which means after you play your turn, the computer plays its turn, and so on. Lots of different resources are available, for example gold, fish, iron, copper, ivory, stone, and more. With the passage of time, your civilization progresses from stone age all the way to the modern age. 

One of the major drawbacks of this game is the amount of effort and time that one must spend on managing the myriad resources in your territory; for example, if you assign villagers to cut down a forest, you must constantly check whether they have finished cutting a particular patch of the forest. After they are done, you have to order them to cut another patch of forest, for they will not do it automatically. Also there are so many different technologies and warrior upgrades available that it is very difficult to keep track of the prerequisites for each. For example, if I want to upgrade my arrowmen to crossbowmen, I must meticulously research the technologies/warrior required to get it done in the right sequence.  While the AI in this game is incredible, the difficulty of the game is extremely frustrating. Personally, I could not go past the third level of difficulty because of the ENDLESS twists and turns. And as I have mentioned before, this game is INSANELY addictive. For this reason I think the cons of this game outweight its pros.

In my opinion it is the best game of the civ brand.
In this one is introduced for the first time the world religions aspect, that was absent in civ III, are perfected the government forms meccanics (is up to you what to chose), the diplomacy with other nations and the different resources that you can find on the world map.
All those aspects are related togheter and more tattical oriented.
The tecnological tree is more deep and interconnected. To search for a tecnolgy, before of an other, have a real strategical meaning now.
The militar units choice is more tattical then civ 3 and 5. You can put more then 1 unit for square and you have to chose the unit on the base of the use you will do of it, giving so a deeper strategy  then the other games where a tecnological advanced militar unit was taking all others obsolete and meaningless.
Plus is added a better veteran promotion bonuses sistem.

You can personalize your games in many aspects, you can set the game speed and dimension on your taste.
There is a multiplayer section where you can iven play in two players directly on your computer.

That is so interesting to me, that you can build the beginnings of villages and towns. Civ 5 is great too, as it has a darker feel, and the strategy of single unit per hex is great. The ideologies make for some incredible end game world wars. Civ 6 did a nice job on the city regions, like campuses and so on. But if you want something simple that will surprise you if you've only played 5 and 6, then try Civ 4. For me, the lack of villages and towns in Civ 5 and 6 was always sort of confusing to me. I kept wondering if they were just implied within the farming communities or what. But Civ 4 eased my wounds.

Sid Meier's Civilization IV, however, was the crucial turning point of the game series, aesthetic and graphics-wise. Civilization IV also brung in new features such as a built-in and accessible World Editor, where you can assemble maps, and simultaneously place nukes in 2000BC to annihilate Gandhi incase he gains nuclear technology in the distant future.
It also brung in actual terrain, like hills, grasslands, 3D forests, mountains and even moving rivers! It also brought a huge modding community dedicated to updating this game with their own, such as Realism Invictus and Rhye's and Fall of Civilization.

Nonetheless, Civilization IV has some bad things. It essentially lost it's sterness and a little bit of realism after the implementation of easily accessible cheats, and kinda looks like something a young player would be on, hours and hours during the day. 

In conclusion, Civilization IV is the default turning point of Civilization, and effected the recent games such as Civilization V and VI. It brought a huge modding community and a likeness graphically and aesthetically.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Extreme modding flexibility. You can do some slight modification with XML, but man, you can do A LOT with python. The engine is so robust that you can play a fantasy world (Fall From Heaven 2), a civil war (RevolutionDCM), the neolithic age (Caveman2Cosmos) and so much more.
[*]Cities have their own identity. There's no bullcrap about some third world colony somehow making your citizens mad; not every war is Vietnam. Not to mention, culture is actually culture, foreign nationals will hate you and want to return to their country. This is further enhanced by RevolutionDCM.
[*]Your empire-building choices are diverse. There's no single answer to every choice you make; you have to design your cities to develop your country. You can move towards having industrial powerhouses, settle cities specifically for commerce and tax money, settle in far lands to establish cultural dominance, establish a corporate center, fill your coffers with the tithe of a holy city, feed your citizens specifically to enslave them, and so on and so forth. You have to work for your +50 gold, not click on some OP religious bonus.
[*]Your government is flexible. Communism and Fascism isn't fully fleshed out in the game probably for fear of poltical backlash, but all of the obsolete policies before modern government do have their merits. A caste system helps you with making sure you have a lot of merchants, slavery ensures you have fast production, mercantilism makes sure the benefits of trade isn't shared with your enemies.
[*]There is a war before war. Civ4 espionage and diplomacy is especially well-developed as there's no such thing as simple friend or enemy. Political blocs do exist, and there will be civs that support your power to ensure their safety, but they all have their intrigue to make sure you're not too powerful. Information war and proper war-planning exists in this game; if you don't have vision of your enemy's cities or units, you might end up with a severe counter of axemen destroying your swordsmen. Destroying your rival's economy can be done through espionage as well as poisoning the wells of their wonderful cities can hold them back, and yes, there is a chance for you to destroy a 1-turn progress towards building a wonder.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*]You need to think. Civ4 isn't dumbed down for the wide market like Civ5 or Civ6.
[*]You will lose track of time.
[*]No Steam workshop. This is an old game.
[*]Old graphics, but with the right mods it can be repaired.
[*]Turn times may get very slow, especially with huge mods like Caveman2Cosmos.
[/list]

In my opinion, I think playing without victory conditions can be very fun as role-playing countries can be a wonderful experience, and developing mods can be a joy as Civ4 becomes your alternative history simulator.",1537312273,1537312273,True,29,8,0.676286041736602783,0,True,False,False,False,

TLDR: Vanilla version of CivIV:Beyond the Sword. Play that instead for better covert ops, quest lines and more.

Civilization IV is a great place to go back to when wanting to see older mechanics and design choices in this series. However, given that the vanilla version of Civ IV is a simplified, more accessible version of Beyond the Sword. It is difficult to recommend it over the more recent Civilization games which also streamline those designs and mechanics.

So my recommendation would be to play a more modern Civ if you need to get past the learning curve or get familiar again with the basic mechanics, or go to Beyond the Sword for the full experience instead.

It's a Civilization® game! You should know what to expect from this game but for those who do not know what Civilization is, here it is.

Civilization lets you take control of the first settlers who founded a nation on earth. Of course, not every nation is represented but the most important ones are. As you take control, you start in roughly 4000 BC. From there, you must expand your civilization by colonising new lands or capturing enemy cities. As you progress through time, you can research new technologies that benefit your empire. You empire is more than the sum of all of your cities and you also have technology, diplomatic relations, influence over land, terrain improvements and governement policies. You are the master of your civilization and how you play will dictate history itself.

In this version of Cilization, you have a 3D world for the first time. The graphics look nice and are obviously improved from Civ III. I haven't found any bugs in the game and the music is fantastic. They've used classical music mostly and it sounds great. There is no unit customization but the game has faction-specific units.

Со временем религия устаривает и на замену приходят корпорации где также можно распостронять как и религию(в BtS вроде даже интелект подправили).

Ну а что сама цива? Это пожалуй самая замороченая цива, в ней столько деталей которых так не хватает в пятой. Например:
Если ставить города очень далеко от столици то в гроде начнеться корупция и содержание на город вырастет, поэтому захватывать города не так выгодно. Так же в игре есть пункт как здоровье, оно будет ухудшатся/улучшатся за счет разных факторов, например если на карте будут много рудников или в гроде много заводов то из за промышлености все будут болеть, но так же можно и улучшать наше здоровья за счет конкретных ресурсов, например риса или бананов. Еще в игре можно забирать чужие города за счет культурвы(это нововидение впервые появилось в циве 3), на ши граници могут расширятся за ее счет но и также територию соседа, если мы захватим все територии вокрух соседа то со временем можно забрать его город. Если мы поставим грод на реке то мы получим автоматом доп-торговы путь, еще кстати можно обмениватся технологиями. Так же при выборе какой то державы мы еще можем взять одного из лидеров, например играя за Россию у нас на выбор либо Петр I либо кролева Екатерина(в BtS добавили Сталина).
Вот что мне не понравилось так это война, воювать в игре не интересно, все сводится к тому, что мы накапливаем армию, все в один стэк и пошли как куча-мала, о тактике можем забыть.

I played it back in 2009 for hundreds of hours (before I had Steam of course). It was one of the two games to get me to switch from console to PC gaming.

Nostalgia aside, this is definitely tied for the title of ""Best Civilization Game"" with Civilization 5. There's a lot to like and there's some stuff to dislike about it. First, the positives.

The game looks like a game that came out in 2005 but it's not a bad looking game by any means. What you see in the screenshots on the Steam page is what it looks like in game. I also think that the game has a much higher learning curve compared to the newer iterations of the Civilization franchise, or at the very least compared to 5, BE, and 6. There's a lot more micromanaging in this game than the newer games. 

Moving on to the negatives, the game does feel very dated, and that becomes appearent at some of the mechanics. The movement isn't as good, since in Civ 4 they were still using square tiles, which makes some combat and movement feel terrible at times. The newer games have hexagonical tiles instead, and they're vastly superior to the square tiles of earlier games. But more importantly, the UI isn't that great. It can be a bit confusing, especially to newer players. 

Finally, some of the mechanics are completely barebone. There's a lot of stuff here to have fun with, but some mechanics aren't fleshed out enough (like city health) and just means that you have one more thing to micromanage instead of it being a completely different thing to keep track of.

Overall though, I would still recommend it because while it is starting to show its age, it's good enough that you can overlook some of the minor flaws that the game has. Also, it has one of the best soundtracks in the history of games period. Definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of 4X turn-based strategy games.",1521758885,1530327970,True,27,0,0.734476208686828613,0,True,False,False,False,

A princípio eu queria só testar o game antes de 2h, pra pega reembolso caso eu não gostasse, baixei e fui jogando, quando vi já tinha passado mais que 2 horas pois é muito envolvente a ritmo lento por ser em turnos, gostei demais das mecânicas, das referências, as grandes construções que foram criadas ao decorrer da história, etc...

Quando tiver oportunidade vou comprar os outros jogos da série.

Dieses Spiel ist die bereits 2005 erschienende Basisvariante, dazu gehören noch zwei DLCs. Es ist das erste in 3D programmierte Civ. und in jeder Beziehung herausragend aus der Vielzahl der Civ. Spiele. Gemeint ist die 18 Zivilisationen Geschichtssymulation auf der Orginalkarte unserer Welt. Leider wurde hier der gleiche Mist gemacht wie schon in Teil 2. Die Grafik ist groß die Karte nicht. Somit besteht das Problem das du nur sehr, sehr eingeschrenkt dich entwickeln kannst, da zB. nur eine Stadt auf das italienische Festland passt. Dennoch ist diese Variante die spannenste aller bislang existierender Civ. Spiele. Besonders möchte ich auch hierbei hervorheben das Revolutionen und vieles mehr zu Abspaltungen oder Teilungen der Länder führt. Auch das Auftauchen von neuen Volksgruppen ist sehr gut umgesetzt worden.. Klare Spielspaß und Kaufempfehlung.

Sid Meier's Civilization IV
This game is the basic version that was released in 2005, and two DLCs are also included. It is the first Civ programmed in 3D. and outstanding in every respect from the multitude of Civ. Games. It means the 18 civilizations history simulation on the original map of our world. Unfortunately, the same crap was made here as in part 2. The graphics are big, the card is not. So there is the problem that you can only develop very, very limited, for example. only one city fits on the Italian mainland. Nevertheless, this variant is the most exciting of all existing civs. Games. I would particularly like to emphasize that revolutions and much more lead to secession or division of the countries. The emergence of new ethnic groups has also been implemented very well. Clear fun and buying recommendations.

Sid Meier's Civ 4 is a solid addition to the Civilization game series. Civilization IV is a turn based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and released Oct 25, 2005.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b]  ""What a minute Atratzu, why are you covering Civilization 4, when there have already been Civilization 5 and 6?"" Good question hypothetical question asker!
The answer is: I got a ton of Civilization games from a humble bundle a year or two ago, and I'm still working my way through all of those games, and after playing a game I try to cover it somehow.
(For those confused, it's a closure thing for me... plus a fun hobby!)

If you're unfamiliar with the Civilization franchise; it's a turn based strategy game where you select a nation and slowly rise as a military power, science giant, cultural/diplomatic leader.
Out of those options I've only really been any good at conquest and/or science.
I don't trust other computers, and I would trust them even LESS if they were human players. [i](And don't trust me, I get bored easily, right Ben? (younger brother mumbles angrily)[/i]

[b]Gameplay:[/b] I think it's safe to say Civilization is one of the easier strategy games you can get into and play casually... but many people can take it to deeper levels and play.

The basics are very simple, you can build cities, move units around a hex-based landscape, build city upgrades, and work on scientific advancements.
...Are you going to build a bunch of troops and conquer thy neighbors? Or are you going to focus on special buildings called ""wonders"" even though they only work for a certain amount of time... will you focus on science?
Or will you do what I do which is a bit of everything.

I try to get a foothold of whatever island I start on... clearly I'm not fond of fighting on large continents, I like playing on archipelago maps. [i](Hey, I never claimed to be good, I'm probably disgustingly casual in how I like to play civilization, but boy is it relaxing and wonderful to play.)[/i]

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194710391

[b]Conclusion:[/b] So with newer civilizations out, why would you want to play an older civilization game? PC hardware problems with new games... curiosity for what the older games played like... you preferred certain features in older civilization titles... cheaper price because it's an older game...
Regardless of your reason, Civ4 is a solid choice and worth or time, if you have the time to give. (that's a cryptic hint: ""You'll be playing a lot of civilization if you like it)

Even though the series is two iterations out, the Civilization series made a terrible misstep that it has yet to rectify: 1 Unit Per Tile (or 1UPT for short)

Civilization takes place on a large strategic map, representing the entire world,  that's divided into tiles that each have their own features and terrain. War is waged by moving military units across these tiles.

The problem with 1UPT is a matter of perspective, and the matter of strategic vs. tactical combat. ""Strategy"" refers to the grand overall execution of a war by a nation's military, while ""tactics"" refers to the actions that a military unit takes in a single battle. A game series that's well-known for featuring both the strategic and tactical view of armies is Total War, and it shifts between the perspectives very well.

The problem is that Civilization does not shift between these perspectives (not that I really want it to, as I think that goes against the spirit of the game), so Civilization V and Civilization VI have tactical combat taking place on a map meant for strategic combat. In Civilization IV and all prior Civ games, you move your military units and when they meet an opposing force, RNG simulates what happens on a tactical level. It makes sense and it fits the strategic perspective of the playing field.

Civ5 and Civ6 use the same perspective, but the 1UPT restriction makes it so that on 1 tile, which represents a few hundred square miles, you have only one military unit. That doesn't make sense!

And I understand why there's a number of people who prefer it. They hate so-called ""Stacks of Doom"". In every Civ game through Civ4, you can have a theoretically infinite number of military units on one tile. These can quickly decimate a defending city's military if the stack of attacking units is large enough.

But that's the point!

If the enemy is able to defeat you with a stack of doom, then it's on you for not making your own stack to defend. Civilization isn't just about combat. It's also what happens between combat. It can also be about avoiding combat, if that's what you're going for. You need to build up the production of your cities, and then you need to produce wisely. Civilization is about more than managing a military, it's about managing your economy and infrastructure.

Forcing tactical combat on Civ puts too much weight on the military aspect of the game, since you have the headache of figuring out which military unit goes on which tile. And because Civ has ways to win the game peacefully, it goes against the spirit of the game to put that much weight on management of the military.

So, until Civilization reverses the horribly-flawed design choice of 1UPT, Civilization IV is still the prototypical Civilization game. It is the pinnacle of everything that Civilization is meant to be, and I hope that in time, Firaxis will understand the error of their ways and leave the 1UPT nonsense to games that are actually meant to be tactical combat games.

Сыграя в обе эти игры, я решил строить свой обзор на их сравнении и подвести итог. Начнем!
[h1] Геймплей [/h1]
Тут в основном все также. Мы также строим свою цивилизацию, предварительно выбрав страну, за которую мы будем играть. Развиваем хозяйство, промышленность, дипломатию, культуру, армию. Здесь абсолютно ничего нового. Идем дальше.
[h1] Графика [/h1]
Ну что сказать, игра полностью перешла в 3D-пространство, поэтому сравнивать ее не имеет смысла: здесь большой шаг вперед.
[h1]  Нововедения[/h1]
В целом ничего нового. Из мелких можно выделить приближение камеры при сражении, теперь прямо в игре видны все постройки в городах (таким образом можно наблюдать за их развитием), появились новые главнокомандующие (по крайней мере на одной государство в некоторых странах на выбор стало несколько правителей), а также при постройке чуда света показывается весь процесс строительства в ускоренном режиме. Новых юнитов и зданий я не нашел.
[h1] Итог[/h1] 
Несмотря на некую ""стабильность"" в развитие геймплея я не могу не порекомендовать эту игру. Можно смело заявить, что Sid Meier's Civilization® IV - достойное продолжение культовой серии пошаговых стратегий. [u] 9 угроз, со стороны Китая из 10.

Speaking of which, I really like the idea that building new world is an opening animation from first game. This series build up whole turn-based strategy segment, this part is far better then Civilization III which was a big disappointment for me and it ties and when one takes DLCs it beats Call to Power branch series easily. What I liked in Civilization the most, was the possibility to conquer whole big world. There are still some limitations here, but one can do it finally again here. The basic concept stays the same, but graphic is very detailed with zooming in and out, as well as some more additional mechanics. Pillaging improvements has great value, the political system is also far more detailed, units with special abilities, experience, and additional possibilities for veteran units, leaders each with own bonuses, the random events, conquest through culture and the list goes on. Game also has build in editor and modding community is still large. All this results in one, one can play through whole life with this and still get the enjoyment. 
As side note, it looks Firaxis heard that many people learn history from this title (and this game is a nice knowledge well for it) and one can feel the game was designed with the thought of younger audience (especially leader's pictures), personally I would prefer history accurate ones, but that's just preference, also there is no Poland civilization here.  
If what some people are saying about Civilization V and VI is true then this title will stay with me for ages. Highly recommended.

Tiene bonitos paisajes y un mapa grande en donde poder construir tus ciudades,  reclutar gente y navegar por las diferentes epocas de la historia adquiriendo tecnología, mejorar tu economía, descubrir tesoros en diferentes pueblos distribuidos por todo el mundo, por ese lado es divertidisimo. Pero tiene un hipermegadefecto, pues no fue hasta que descubrí como funcionan las batallas el hecho de que lo empezara a odiar,  pues no tienen ninguna logica. Por ejemplo puedes atacar a un ejercito de arqueros con caballeros con armaduras y caballos blindados y aun así terminan ganando los arqueros. Puedes atacar una ciudad con catapultas para tirar los muros, y una vez dentro con tus diez ejercitos puedes perderlos  sin matar a la única tropa que defiende la ciudad. Puedes pelear con ballesteros contra arqueros enemigos y ganan los arqueros.  Una unidad de caballeria te puede masacrar un ejercito de lanceros. Se supone que en la vida real arqueros a caballo son mas debiles que los ballesteros, probé atacar a un ejercito de arqueros a caballo con mis ballesteros y mis ballesteros murieron, lo mismo pasó cuando mis ballesteros fueron atacados por un ejercito de arqueros a caballo. 

No hay tanto problema cuando te enfrentas a un ejercito a campo abierto aunque debo advertir que los resultados son impredecibles, lo se porque con una unidad de soldados con espadas largas ataque a un grupo de arqueros donde los arqueros terminaron ganando, cargé la partida y volvi a hacer la batalla en donde ahora si resulte ganando sin ninguna baja. 
El problema empieza a la hora de asediar las ciudades, de verdad puedes terminar borrando la ciudad del mapa del coraje, porque son muy dificiles de tomar, yo recomendaría asediar con 4 ejercitos de catapultas, muchisisisimos espadachines y mucha caballeria con lanceros y arqueros, o si tienes tecnología superior no confiarte y llevar muchos cañones y mosqueteros porque aún asi van a costar mucho trabajo de tomar. 
Algo gracioso que pasa con tus aliados NPC es que terminan robandote la ciudad cuando tu hiciste todo el trabajo, de hecho detalles como ese son divertidos de ver porque simplemente son graciosos.
Tengo experiencia en otros juegos como ""civilization revolution"" que son de lo mismo pero a diferencia de ellos este me cayó muy mal en cuanto a los asedios, todo es perfecto hasta que te das cuenta que la lógica no tiene cabida en los combates de este juego, al menos en los asedios, en los campos abiertos aunque influyan las colinas y los bosques y todo eso si que puede ser un combate interesante y divertido porque determinadas unidades son mas fuertes o en ciudades o en colinas, o donde tu las hayas programado, pero ya estando en los asedios el resultado es aleatorio no importando que tengas unidades anti infantería o anti arqueros terminan muriendo si o si. 
Yo invito a la gente a que le de una oportunidad y a que aprenda a no desesperarse porque a veces en vez de desesperación da risa, de verdad =). Y por lo de los asedios solo lleven muchisisisimos soldados y la ciudad será suya, garantizado.",1499484736,1499485300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Civilization IV é um jogo de simulação em que se constroi uma civilização a partir de limitados recursos.

É um dos jogos mais viciantes que já joguei, além de ser estratégico é um tanto educativo também, trazendo elementos da história. 

O objetivo é alcançar a vitória sobre as demais civilizações. É possível alcancar de várias maneiras: expansão territorial, diplomacia, corrida espacial (minha preferida!), entre outros...

É um jogo bastante desafiador, com vários níveis de dificuldade e momentos de muita surpresa e tensão: mesmo com um império rico e consolidado você pode ser desafiado a uma guerra cujo inimigo possui mais um aliado e ter seus recursos tomados, o que tornaria as coisas bem difíceis. Essa é uma das inúmeras possibilidades que Civilization IV oferece.

Você constrói uma civilização a sua escolha e escolhe como vai desenvolvê-la durante o tempo. O jogo possui uma ""árvore"" de tecnologia, permitindo que o jogador decida quais recursos ou invenções serão desenvolvidos primeiro, montando sua estratégia de acordo com o que o mapa oferece.

Minha única crítica é que as partidas as vezes são bem longas, mesmo limitando o número de turnos. Mas sempre haverá um desafio à sua altura.",1498852893,1625924355,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,

The extensive choice of rulers and perks that come with different civs is commendable. It provides the player with the feeling that they have much more control over the course of their civilization, and this gives a unique depth to the world. As is the standard with Sid Meier's video games, the player truly feels like they are discovering something never before seen when they trek the vast expanse of water in their Caravan for the first time. Multiplayer mechanic is a perfect platform for competitive players or cocky friends to challenge each other to a great, long run of civ and gives way to an incredible, unique experience that no other game can quite achieve. A truly unique game that spans across generations, and will surely be remembered for its incredible run as the go-to RTS game.

It's not a strategic game.
It's more like Monopoly against AI: there is a set pattern to go, exploitation and, in end, a pinch of luck required. 
Don't look to game hours since I've played it offline ('cause Big Picture is a wonderful mode and doesn't crash every 20 minutes with a controller attached, not at all) and it didn't record almost 20 hours. So I've clocked 30 hours into this and... it sucks.
Not like a very bad game, or literally, but compared to the other Civs... it just sucks. The AI wants to hinder you, the logic behind them is just pre-setted and poorly programmed: you invade in an early part of the game? They all swap to Slavery, basically fuck themselves and then, in a point of history or another, gang up and declare war on you - clearly ahead of them in every term possible - from a turn to another, sometimes even with a relationship of -2. You try to buy some allies, to fight them... and your allies usually end up going either to waste or with a peace treaty/peace in a matter of 10-20 days. 
Also, prepare to give away free techs if you don't want them to dogpile on you.
Also, prepare to slow down construction and research a lot, 'cause you're going to fortify your cities like hell. Even so, the AI can expand, build new cities, ramp up military and constructions without a trouble. It's not cheating, they just optimize the written path you all have to follow.

You know what, probably I was too used to how strategic Europa Universalis is.
Too bad.
Glad I got it in a bundle.

Its sequels have sought to build upon the basic model by adding greater levels of complexity and streamlining the interface. And though the sequels were definitely great games, they were still rooted in an interface and gameplay style that had changed very little since the original was released in 1991.

That's not the case with Civilization IV. It reenergizes the core concepts of the series, staying faithful to what fans expect while also creating a wholly original game. While the game hasn't lost any depth or detail, every aspect of the design has been streamlined to make it easier for new players to jump in and less monotonous for veterans. Die-hard fans will definitely find that the game offers up so much more variety this time around. The shape of each game is quite different, from the ways you build up your empire to the ways you tear down the empires of others. 

Sadly, even the most comprehensive reviews of Civilization IV can't discuss every aspect of the game.

The mod is set in a dark fantasy world, recently waken up from a long period of winter due to the god of winter reigned unopposed until a hero emerged and slew him. This new world has decimated the old civilizations and sent them into a tribal life, struggling to survive. And here you come in. In short order, the mod adds a bunch of new civilizations, very different from each others. Orcs sucks at science, but can produce 2 units at the same time. The Khazad (dwarfs) rely on their stockpile of gold for prosperity, the elven civs can build improvements on forest tiles, etc. Religions added. Civilization alignment from good to evil. An armageddon count which turns the world into fiery hell terrain as it climbs closer to doom. Lairs and dungeons to explore. A ton of story, more or less every unit and hero (did I mention heroes?) have a backstory. Magic. So much magic. It fixed a bunch of issues with the older Civ games, like when the computer civs just zergs down everything, in FfH2, you can combat that, you have mages that can aoe blast a pile, cast fear and break up the stack, use Blind and lock them up, and if you are the one attacking a strong base which contains those mages, you could use assassins which has the promotion that enables them to start attacking the weakest unit in the stack.

And if you get tired of this, there is modmods and modmodmods with a dedicated community who worked to keep enhancing and expanding the game.

相较于4代，后面这几代很明显是偏向于“进攻”的一方。单格单兵的设定，使得战争时谁先动手谁就有优势，挨打的一方生命受损会使战斗力受损，便愈发趋于不利。反观4代，虽然同格单位可以无限堆叠过于夸张，但“被攻击时会由最有利的单位来应战”这一设定可以明显保护“防御”的一方，更加大了对战争发动者的惩罚度（比如弓箭手和长枪兵处于同一格，被对方骑兵攻击时，长枪兵优先应战）。所以虽然6代以合成军团的方式使得多单位堆叠“变相回归”了，但是还是没有起到原有的作用，会被克制的兵种就算合成军团还是会被克制，还不如允许混编部队糅合兵种适应性，更加偏向于“防御”的一方才是有效减少“战狂”的一种手段。
《文明》系列之所以不叫“征服”系列，就是因为征服仅仅是诸多胜利手段中的一项而已，为了迎合竞技性，为了迎合快节奏而使得这种手段愈发轻松容易，只不过会毁掉整个游戏正常的架构和氛围罢了。就这一点来看，《文明4》才是这个系列的巅峰。",1480001167,1480001167,True,319,21,0.924885571002960205,0,True,False,False,False,

尽管在文明5和文明6里进游戏的旁白会着重表达“你可以让自己的文明经受住时间的考验吗？“这种的话语，不过我想真正能够经受住时间考验的是文明4这一代作品。

印象中早些年文明4曾经也被引进过，甚至我的朋友家里还有诸葛连弩的小人手办
不过基于各种原因，真正国区steam可以购买的时候文明5的dlc都出完了
但是为了联机的需要，我想真正的粉丝是不惜美区全价礼物购买的，我记得挺贵的，好像320+？一说就好些年了，我也不记得了……
稍微扯的有些远……

老实说看到文明5的时候就已经觉得文明系列在发生一些实质性的变化，应该说变得简单了，适合于大众来愉快的游戏，而不需要自己处理一堆数据或者做更庞大的考虑，文明从战略游戏变成了战术游戏，需要处理的东西变得更直观和细小。弓箭手和火炮的站位、与敌军相邻的格子不能通行、不太容易变更国境线所以铺城要讲究方法等等……而到了文明6之后，如果这个城我计划放特区或者放置奇迹，我可能在游戏开局就要小心翼翼的规划到工业时代以后……

并不是说文明5和文明6不是好游戏，都是好游戏，但是和4代还有以前的文明在呈现给人的风格和体验上不太一样……

“你体验过波兰面临数不清的苏联和德国单位围城的恐惧吗？”
“你体验过从BC3000开始就不断遭受到北狄和南蛮骚扰还要保持国内不因为稳定度而分裂的中国统治者的治国艰辛嘛？”
“你知道文明可以做成魔幻游戏来玩吗？”
“你知道在beyond earth之前，优秀的mod  Final Frontier  吗？”
这些是文明4以及强大的文明4粉丝自制mod可以带给我们的，但是Rhye在开发文明5的RFC的mod时候并没有那么顺利，而文明6发售到我写测评时已经过了一个月竟然还没有earth这种基本的地图类别选项

我们从每一代的文明可以看到新的进步，以及从玩家自制mod中获取灵感，不过也确实，每一代文明都想做成区别于前代的作品，尽管会保留一些设定。比如沿河地块+1金，早先版本的文明5还保留了，结果在陆续推出dlc之后也放弃了这个设定。
所以，即便是出了文明新作，虽然新作也很耗时间，不过还是会觉得4代是最经典的，无论是贸易点数的收支平衡、迷一般的城市商路链接判定、文化越境和跨国公司的设定，还有在全球视角下画上若干条战略部署线，有空的话，回来打一局文明4总是让人很满足的，至少征服胜利需要消耗的体力减少了许多。

所以，从5代或者6代才入文明坑的玩家朋友们，如果没有玩过文明4的话，我想那真是天大的损失。",1479989982,1480054237,True,90,6,0.837405145168304443,1,False,False,False,False,

Стоит отметить, что основная тема саундтрека удостоена множества наград. Да и весь саунд в игре хорош. Как по мне - 9/10
[Геймплей]
Основа геймплея осталось неизменной. добавлено множество функций и прочего. Именно функционал четвертой части является эталоном для меня, а потому геймплей - 10/10

And that, ma lads, is the tale of my first ever campaign in Sid Meier's Civilization IV
It took me 12 hours but I did it.
I destroyed two civilizations on the course of 6050 years, built 5 spaceships, researched every technology, founded United Nations, founded Christianity, Facism, Nuclear bombs, hookers and drugs.

Пересказывать сюжет и компанию не буду, так как это скучно и никто это не прочтет, а перейду сразу к основным чертам.Total war - зрелищно и недолго, Age of empire - интересно, но противников выносишь за 15 минут на сложности easy, Civilization IV - интересно, долго и даже в какой-то мере забавно. Именно от этой игры у меня пригорело, ведь неандертальцы с палками выносят стрелков(с кремниевыми пушками), сверхбронебойные катапульты одним залпом уничтажают танк, а страна, которая в 10 раз слабее тебя требует дань и грозится напасть(после опыта в битве танк VS катапульта и воин VS стрелки, уже как-то начинаешь боятся и платишь им 100 золотых). Иногда твой могущественный столичный город(с уровнем культуры 22) с гордым названием ""Нагибаторск"" останавливается на стадии ""Застой"" и превращается в чуть более чем полностью бесполезную свалку недовольных и вечно голодающих бомжей. Но это мелочи, ведь самое главное - ИИ. NPC фракции тут более чем благоразумны(в отличии от Total war у них не такой высокий пункт ЧСВ, и когда у них остается только столица, то они соглашаются завершить войну), но насилуют вам мозг уже на 10-13 ходах с просьбами открыть границы. Ах да! Забыл добавить, что самая дичь начинается в начале, когда всякие немытые варвары(или звери) всячески не дают вам основать еще несколько городов, но у npc фракций проблем с этим нет и они спокойно подминают под себя территорию. А вот мультиплеер не порадует нас открытыми серверами(все с друзьями рубятся, хотя оно и правильно). Несмотря, на всё что я жаловался, эта игра все равно не теряет своего особенного шарма. Блин, вот что-то в ней есть такое, что затягивает лучше всяких наркотиков.
Конечно моя оценка:10 разбитых танков катапультами из 10.

V roce 4000 př.n.l. máte jenom rodinku osadníků a 3 vojáky s klacky. Když jste šikovní, kolem roku 2000 máte už stamilionový národ. Během hry zkoumáte nové technologie (od vynálezu kola či zemědělství, přes střelný prach a letectví, po rakety, jádro a rádiové vlny). Když máte dobré spojence, dá se dost technologie vyměnit a urychlit tak postup svůj, i spojenců. Pak také určujete, kde postavíte další město, s kým budete jak obchodovat a diplomatická jednání zakončíte ve 20.století stavbou budovy OSN a můžete s ostatními hráči hlasovat, zda zakážete jaderné zbraně, nebo jestli bude všude na světě svoboda projevu.

Herní systém je trošku nezvyklý, hra vás upozorňuje na nedodělané věci (nenechá vás na nějakou jednotku úplně zapomenout) a na v tom tahu nepoužitou jednotku skáče obrazovka. Je to stupidní, ale o moc lépe to asi vymyslet nejde. Bitvy se podle mého opravdu nepovedly. Vždy bojují jednotky 1 vs.1. To by tak nevadilo, ale hrozně často se mi stane, že třeba mojí helikoptéru zničí soupeřův kopiník (to je asi trošku divný, ne?) a hru to kazí. Pravidelně se mi také stává, že bez jakéhokoli důvodu, či záminky, na mě zaútočí civilizace, se kterou mám celou hru dobré vztahy, je na druhém konci mapy a přitáhne s armádou, kterou jsem nevybudoval ani za celou hru (s kopiníkama a zničí mi moje helikoptéry).

Kromě již zmíněného řídíte i náboženství a život ve vašem impériu. Můžete být komunistický muslim američan, když budete chtít, záleží, co si vyzkoumáte a vyberete, popřípadě k čemu vás nutí silnější sousedé.

Celkově bych hru hodnotil snad i kladně, ale stupidní systém bitev to kazí tak moc, že kladné hodnocení dát nemůžu. 

Tímto recenze končí a pokud se hru i přes to rozhodnete koupit, nezbývá, než popřát úspěšnou kolonizaci.

Графика... Серьезно? Ожидать от игры 2000-х графона? 


Звук 

Тут о нём нечего сказать, есть пару саундтреков... Нет серьезно что мне тут написать? ""Есть 3Д звук, много саунд...""?


Геймплей

Ты бессмертный [Вставьте сюда президента/вождя/императора...] и вот тебе поселенцы, разведчики и собственно мир. Вперёд исследовать его! 

Есть режим своя игра (думаю тут все понятно)

Пару сценариев (по типу событий такой-то такой-то войны и пр.)

Про Одиночку и Многопользовательскую игру я не буду говорить и без меня понятно!

И естественно самый фановый аспект игры! Редактор карты!
(Редактор игры это:

-Когда ты в каменном веку, строишь воинов с дубиной в своем государстве, а у границ противника МБР и Танки

-Города противников обставлены горами (на горах нельзя ничего строить считаются не проходимой местностью)

-""Специальный репортаж: возле города [Например Питер] найдены нереально огромные запасы нефти золота и драгоценнный камней

-Город на океане

-Вся карта заставленна львами и прочим зверьем]

Его нет! (Кроме конечно же сценариев)

      [h1]本作中所涉及的诸多内涵,需要各位玩家自己在游戏中慢慢品味,故不予赘言.[/h1]

       值得一提的是外交系统和单位堆叠:

       四代的外交是我个人认为做的最成功的部分:,AI之间极其喜欢买宣和各种PY交易;经常是上一回合还跟你热情呵呵,下一回合直接翻脸抽风;一局下来,什么时候要合纵,什么时候该连横的意识,是必须要有的,玩6起来很有战国策的味道.

       此代的单位无限堆叠机制，是使其难度远高于五代的重要原因之一:有了无限堆叠，Al的寻路机制就变的相对简单,奇袭的效率成倍提高,往往能带给玩家们更大的挑战;所以切记,无论在任何时代,都保有相当数量的压制武器!

       个人推荐RFC Dawn of Civilization（文明的兴衰：曙光）和The Sword of Islam（伊斯兰之剑）两个模组,极具历史代入感和开放性,也是目前为止五代所不具备的.

Moscow started as a small farming city. With little to no army but an expansive amount of fields and pastures. But soon enough we were running out of space. We decided to found 3 more cities all in the continet we resided in. After exploring the continent the Russians met two other Empire who lived nearby first was Asoka of India, and secondly was Saladin of Arabia. Asoka and Flazam became good allies, Russia would send some of are livestock from are farms and in return he would give us money.  For 1000 years we remained a humble farming civilization. That was until the scholars in Moscow came to there great leader Flazam II with some reseach. Gun Powder, this new discovery allowed are civilization great new oppitunties, and so in 1245 AD Russias militisation began. Are Armies grew with the most advanced soilders in the planet. Grenidiers, Riflemen galore. We gained a reputation so great two nearby Arabian cities revolted to join are Empire. Quickly Russia became the greatest military might, but still we remained close Allies with are neibhour Asoka, a relationship that had stood the test of time. Saladin however attempt to convert my people to Taoism and was spreading vile rumours about are wise ally Asoka. After hearing this news Flazam II got his noble stead and rode to Mumbai to discuss the pesky Saladin. it seemed India too resented him, therefore Flazam II gave are knowledge of gun powder to Asoka, with this gift Flazam II made a proposition. The Russia-Indian alliance should combine on a common enemy of Saladin and to unify the continet  under are great alliance. Therefore in 1348 war on Saladin was declared by both are nations. We quickly mobilised are troops on the eastern front storm 3 of Saladins cities adding them to are now vast empire. The war on the west was more vicious India was suffering some large casulties, therefore Flazam II sent some of the best fighters in are Empire from St Petersburg to aid in that front. With the help we pushed both fronts right back to the circumference of Saladins capital. In only 25 years Saladin was on his knees. India accept a treaty with Saladin. Flazam II was furious. India had left when we were so close. However Flazam II peristed the battle around Saladins capital was a bloody one. Lasting 40 years and draining the great Russian empire, slaves in St Petersburg were on strike and the War was begining to drag on. Therefore Flazam persuaded India to join the war once more in a final battle on the capital, and the famous Battle of 1 Turn occured. Saladin was destroyed and The Russia-India Alliance were victorious, but Flazam II still rembered how Asoka has betrayed him and the Alliance was on thin ice, Flazam II spent the next 300 years picking up the pieces of his problems in the Russian cities. The people demanded democracy and in the summer of 1789 Flazam II abdicated and was replaced by the New Russian president. Moscow was well known for its scientfic discoveries, and in 1867 we discovered Urianium and began the Manhattan project. Meanwhile over the past 200 years Asoka had entered a golden age with an empire far superior to ares. This competion began a Cold War with Russia the alliance broke down and times were tough. By the dawn of 20th centuary we had completed the Manhattan project and in 1920's the Cold War became increasingly serious. India mobilised troops round are borders and began sending spies. After India blockaded are Urianium farms the Cold War esclated and in 1935 the Russian president declared War on India, the next year we launched 3 nucleur bombs on Indias cities. India suffered but however they invaded are Urianium fields and launched a vicious offense. Russia was overwhelmed with a war on 5 fronts. And in 1977 we were on are knees all are cities were on the brink of revolution and Asoka had captured 1 of are cities. Russia pleaded with India and India agreed and the war ended albeit with a harsh treaty. India empire flourished as we attempt to pick up ares. In 2014 the Greek Empire was getting worryingly large. It was on a separate continet sharing there land with Mao Zedong. I negotiate with Mao. I asked him to declare war on the Greeks. I pretended to ally with Mao but really I only wanted Mao to invade Greece because I knew the Greeks growth would slow, I secretly however knew Mao would lose albeit it would take at least a hundred years. In 2050 the game ended with India its victors

It was a great deal and has a lot going for it. I played civ 3 previuosly and most of my likes involve improvements from that and most of my dislikes involve frsutrations from switching to this one. 

Pros
more map and leader options
great graphics and details
very complex to maintain good relations with other leaders, but not impossible. 

cons
I don't fully understand how to set up a map/game as im used to the civ 3 method
the civelopedia seems incomplete as far as helping with playing the game and learning to adjust from the chages from 3-4
I cant find a way to prebuild a custom map
worldbuilder after game starts make cheating too easy and tempting

Overall I am very happy with it, and mostly my complaints are about adjusting from civ 3. I see no reason in buying the expansions unless you particularly want what they give you.

So, the main differences from Civ 3 I can see are these: it's got a lot more different types of resources; the tech tree has been tweaked and had a few more items added in; there are more Wonders and types of Wonder; there's the whole new ""religions"" stream of progress options (very Pokemon, in a way - collect them all!);  there's better animation of your units (and you can see your unit as a group, rather than a single individual); civic rules are a lot more customisable across a variety of dimensions (political, economic, social, religious); and you've lost the ability to tweak your palace or view your city close-up.  Oh, and the game can be customised to a much greater degree than before.

It still has a lot of the same basic assumptions (and thus a lot of the same basic pitfalls) as the earlier games in the series.  A victory via conquest or other aggressive means is always going to out-score a victory by cultural hegemony or other such peaceful means.  The view of ""progress"" is still very linear, and there's very much a perspective of ""the only way is up"" (now, admittedly, I haven't really got to the modern era all that often, so I don't know whether there's still the pollution and global warming hazards to be aware of - I really should read the manual to be sure).  The world leaders you're playing are very much biased toward European and Western cultures (there's China, Japan and India representing Asia; Mali and Egypt representing Africa; and the Incas representing South America; meanwhile there's the USA, England, Spain, France, Germany, Russia, Greece, Rome and Persia representing Europe and the global West), so the whole issue of over-emphasis on technologies found useful in the global ""West"" is a thing.  However, as I said, these are standard problems (of the ""this thing I like is somewhat problematic"" variety) with the entire series - it's very much a case of either they're deal-breakers for you  as a player, or you accept the game for what it is, and make a mental note of the problematic bits to think about later.

Gameplay-wise, it's much the same as all the other iterations of the series: you move any pieces you have available to move, and press enter to signal the end of your turn.  If you don't have any pieces to move, the game will sit there prompting you to press ""enter"" until the skies fall (my biggest gameplay annoyance, quite honestly), but then, this [i]is[/i] a turn-based game, and that's what you're in for as a result of playing it.  (Oh, and if you didn't already have every single turn-based game known to humanity sitting in your Steam preview queue before you started playing, you will shortly afterwards... or maybe that's just me).

I can't comment on the multi-player aspect of the game, because I don't play multi-player (I play games to relax, not to stress myself out by getting pounded into the dirt).  The music is very pleasant (and very repetitive) and you're able to turn it down or off as this suits you.  

Given I play this game to relax, and I'm not really into high scores or anything like that, I'm probably not the best person to review it.  But overall, I'm finding Civ 4 to be an interesting upgrade from Civ 3, and I'm really liking finding out how to handle all the new bits and pieces in the game.",1454051499,1454051499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Big fan of the Civ titles, some more than others. Played Civ III for the majority of my childhood on a regular basis, Great game, crazy learning curve

Then, picked up Civ V on a wim and was actually rather disapointed. not a BAD game, but not on par with the early'r instalments. To simple, by comparison. (Dumbed down for the casual gamer I guess?)

When i stumbled on civ IV on sale I desided to take a risk on it. Best choice of my adult life. Though I haven't had the time to really sink my teeth into it hours wise. the gameplay is so solid I knew I had been shorting my self for all these years. Has much of the complexity of the third title but slightly less intimedating, plus, losts of features that should have been in the games from the get go, such as a state religion. 

10/10 for turn based perfection

For those of you who have never played a Civ game before and enjoy turn based empire building strategy games, look no further. This is a superb entry into the genre for inexperienced people due to it's fairly simple playstyle, if you were looking for something a little more complex then you can go for that here too. For those who just want to build and play the long game for wars then this game is easy enough to keep on friendly terms with AI empires and easy enough to just click on what you want to build next in your cities. For those looking for a more complex game you can keep an eye on all aspects of your city, from what it is lacking to where your citizens are automating their production. Now, for those who haven't played this game but have played a Civ game I am just going to assume that it was Civ 5 you've played. Compared to 5 this game is a little more complicated but at the same time feels a little more basic compared to the newer installments. It's a refreshing play and feels much more rewarding for that win at the end. For those tiny few that have played 1-3 and expansions but have yet to touch on this then you should seek help for somehow missing this fantastic gem of a game that will leave you saying 'One more turn' like every other Sid Meier's game.

This review will be done through [b]the eyes of a player coming from Civ V and will be a comparison of the two.[/b]

TL;DR - I love it. Probably not as good as Civ V, but familiar and different enough that I think it makes an easy buy for any Civ V fan. 

Pros:
+ The espionage is much, [i]much[/i] more entertaining and active, I love it. The capabilities of a spy include bombing building, poisoning the water supply (food reduction), sabotaging production, stealing technology, influencing religion and civics, and a couple more. You can also alter your production of espionage points to lean towards or away from certain civs (for example you can produce more points towards your biggest rival, and less points from distant civs). It is a great system.

+ Combat is very different, and in my opinion better. Units unique abilities are given more weight; archers and longbowmen can be incredibly powerful on city defense, catapults and trebuchets are almost absolutely necessary for taking a city, etc. There is more incentive to not just build 20 of whatever unit has the most combat strength and charge in. Combat gets a little smarter.

+ Given the 5 year gap between IV and V, you'd think that Civ IV would look much poorer...and you would kinda be right. Things don't look as great, a couple of the leaders are ugly as sin, but it more than makes up for this in building a [b]stronger atmosphere.[/b] It does this by actually having a few different models for units, and I don't mean unique units for civs. It things like this; everyone can build a swordsman, and they will have have the same stats, but if you play as Arabia, they will have scimitars, if you play and England, they will have broadswords, workers will look different, etc. It is a great touch. There is also unique music for each time period, like when you first start a game it will play tribal music. If you are playing as Spain and click a unit, they will speak in Spanish. These kinds of things make up for the 5 year gap in graphical capabilities. 

+ Random events. Now I know this might sound bad, but they are reasonable and I think spice things up quite well. They are not completely random and tied various things like the time period. Examples would be a nearby mountain being an erupting volcano and destroying nearby improvements, if you have the slavery civic you might have a slave revolt and lose production for awhile. You'll also get choices most the the time. Like a Russian government official wants to defect to your country, do you accept him and gain espionage points against Russia? Or arrest him and hand him back over, gaining a relationship boost for Russia? It's fun.

Cons:
- What I feel is the biggest con: there is a loss of uniqueness for civs. There are no civ perks like they're were in Civ V (Venice can only build one city, Rome gets +25% for each building already in the capital, etc). These perks were one of my favorite things in V and I miss them. Each civ still gets a unique building and unit, but these often are (mechanically) much more boring than they were in Civ V. Nothing like the Zulu unit who has a first strike, or Portugal's ship that can also do a trade mission. Often in Civ IV, the unique units just start with a particular free promotion, that any other unit could get if it gets enough experience. These changes allow for more freedom but also take away some of the reason you pick a particular civilization: to play a particular playstyle. I pick India because I want to play small but powerful, Rome because I want to spread my empire far and wide, Germany because I want to have large standing armies, etc. Instead most civs have multiple leaders to choose from. While this is cool to see different faces, all the leaders have two traits that many other civs also have. Yeah Genghis Khan has the aggressive trait (certain unit types get free promotion and double production speed of barracks) but so does Stalin, and probably 5 or 6 other leaders.

- Half of the victory conditions have issues. [b]Science[/b] and [b]score[/b] are fine. [b]Culture[/b] victory is boring as hell. It involves nothing more than accumulating culture points from building and wonders and once 3 cities reach 50,000 bam, you win. Even pre-dlc Civ V cultural victory had you build the Utopian Project. [b]Diplomatic[/b] victory is nigh impossible. There are no city states in Civ IV, so you are force to kiss everyone's ass and bend to their wills if you want that victory. Even then if you have different religions they will basically never vote for you. [b]Conquest[/b] Involves you taking ALL other cities. Yes even that one out in that distant snow-covered island that has a population of 2. This is kinda-sorta ""fixed"" by the [b]Domination[/b] victory type, which involves getting x% of the total land and y% of the total population in the world. Except the numbers are so high that you basically only get it when you could have easily won through science/military/score.

Minor stuff:
- Unit can stack on one tile. Except the markers for how many units are there max out at 8. So I can't tell if a nearby city has 8 units (hey this is a border city and I am just defending it) or 24 units (hey I am about to fucking wreck you in two turns).
+ You can see numeric breakdown of relationships for other civs. -4 for different religion, +2 for fair trades, -9 for huge recent war. Quickly brings you up to speed on how heavy certain actions are.
+ You can trade technologies!
+ A couple more interesting technologies.
- The religion system has no perks to choose from like in Civ V.
+ In the very beginning of the game you have to watch out for wild animals like bears and wolfs.

The terrain looks completely different (which is just ok) and the cities are set up in a different grid format that i'm really not a fan of, The city display screen has a better way of controlling what the city focuses on such as production, food, or commerce but the way you control what is being built is terrible compared to the old simple list format. Units are controlled with the right click of the mouse severely limiting your access to the civilipedia on certain objects. Units also don't have an attack and defense rating but just a strength level. Although I like how certain units are useful against other certain types there are way too many types of units.

Also, ignore my playtime; I put 100s of hours into Civ IV BTS off a disk.   I got the Steam version for convenience sake.)

This is arguably the best 4x game ever made; I don't think I am alone in this opinion.   What make it so is a combination of things, not just individual features.   The variety of strategies, the diplomacy, the range of units possible, the difference in the character of the Civs, I don't know I could go on and on and I think there are people who can say it better.

There are two points I do want to make in passing, however.   First, Civ IV was an evolution of Civ 1, 2, and 3.   Some people criticize it because it is an evolution, not a revolutionary new take on 4x.    Personally, I think taking all the good stuff and making it better and adding little stuff that made the whole pie a beautiful thing to experience is a very, very good thing.    Second, Civ IV Vanilla was a very good game, but not a world beater.   The addition of Warlords and especially Beyond the Sword is what made it great.    Of course there are a  lot of mods out there if you want, but the fact is that the only mod I think you might want to get a great gaming experience is the Bug Mod, which doesn't change the game play at all but adds a lot of helpful tools.

This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My husband and I are enjoying a hotseat match in which I am sure will end in a bloodbath. In Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword I am preparing to conquer the world with my mighty Celtic army. Civilization IV is an awesome strategy game in which almost anything is possible. There are so many different leaders to choose, and many different ways to beat the game. Sure, you could do a military victory, but you can also win diplomatically, artistically, and financially. There is also the Space Race...
For those of you kind of wary of strategy titles, let me assure you this is a very newbie friendly game. There are a variety of difficulties, and very detailed tutorials to help out. Also, being turn based has a huge advantage in being able to think out what you want to do. Having played Paradox Interactive titles like Victoria II, this is a far cry from the level of complexity found in those games. Nor is it very concerned with historical authenticity. When I first played as Boudicca, a warrior queen of the Celts, I expected to run into one of the Caesars, but instead I ran into General Bismark! My husband demonstrated some interesting divergents from history by having his Germans found Judaism 8), Christianity, and Islam. By what should have been mid-early Dark Ages, his musketmen were busy conquering the Russian Civilization. By the Industrial Revolution, his assorted tanks were conquering the world.

I've been unable to send reinforcements because Caeser is moving his troops around my territory, destroying farms, mines and villages. I can't spread too thin in fear of my other cities being attacked.
So 5 handfuls of Heavy machine Gunners have been defending the city from catapult bombardments and grenadier attacks.
And now, he seems to have set his sights upon the neighbouring city of Memphis.

Diary Entry 2 - I've reached out to the Malinese and Isabella of Spain, and both have declared war on Ceaser. They are on the opposite side of him to me. So while they cannot directly help my cities, they will put pressure on the Western side. So hopefully I can repel the siege and push to his cities. I have a troop of tanks coming in from the Northeast, and a regiment of Marines coming in from the southeast. 

Diary Entry 3 - The marine regiment was ambushed on both sides upon coming around a mountain. Despite the enemy taking heavy losses, we lost the regiment.
Luckily a reinforcement squad was detailed to memphis, so now it's a case of bunkering down for the incoming attack, and planning the counter offensive.
The tanks have made significant progress, taking the city of Ardea from the grasp of the Romans. They will continue their progress north, towards Rome itself.

Diary Entry 4 - A reserve regiment of Marines have rendezvoused with the tanks. The dispatch will push on to Rome, flanking from the south, whilst Memphis defends and draws the brunt of the Roman Empire.

Diary Entry 5 - We took two cities to the south. And i decided it was now the time to counter attack. Making losses along the way, we broke through the memphis siege, and took the city of Ostia. It was short lived however, as the enemy retaliated while we were at our weakest and reclaimed the city. Luckily, the reserve squad was just 1 click behind, so now we can retake the city again, and await reinforcements.
I see very little action on the Western side, I am beginning to believe my allies have hidden motives. Their troops linger on the enemies borders. Perhaps waiting until I am weak enough that they may strike both me and Julius Ceaser. I must prepare for this eventuality.

Diary Entry 6 - I was wrong to doubt Isabella. How could I let the seeds of battle cloud my mind. She commenced her march across the border today, and in one fell swoop, she liberated a city from the enemy. Her troops have now joined mine, and we march together to the heartland of Mother Rome-ia

Diary Entry 7 -  Isabella and I, sat down today and signed the Permanent Alliance of our two peoples. We will forever be comrades in arms, and for this, I graciously gave her 3 cities as gifts. Not without proper thought mind you. They are in 3 strategic places to mine enemy and mine future enemies. This will allow us to adaquately aid each other in times of war, and even further each others growth.
To our future! -clinks glass-

Diary Entry 8 - Rome has fallen to Spain! I made a good choice in allies, Isabella is ruthless, a worthy opponent to any who may cross her.
The Chinese also declared war on Germany, Frederick reached to me.. unfortunately, as well as the war on the Romans is going, I cannot extend myself at this time. He seemed disappointed.

Diary Entry 9 - An achievement I am unsure of. We have created...The Atom Bomb. I don't know what to think about this. A weapon with destruction beyond any imagination. One that would win countless wars, but with such heavy costs. I must make sure this never falls into the hands of our enemies..

Diary Entry 10 - We were pushing the city of Cumae today, they had heavily fortified the city, and it seemed an arduous task. The combined might of myself and Spain, and yet we struggled.. A shadow appeared on the horizon. They came bearing the flag of Rome, and begun a charge on our flank. We were outnumbered, the rest of our forces had lagged behind to clear up the enemy remnants. We hastily mustered a defence as best we could. The doors to Cumae opened, the cities huge force came out to greet us. We were preparing for defeat..
But then there they came. The Malinese army! They routed the enemy on our flank. Taking advantage of this turn of tide, we charged the enemy city, gates wide open and with morale turned, we claimed it for our own.

Diary Entry 11 - It's been a long war, spanning many years. Due to the efforts of our 3 way alliance, we have chipped the Romans down to a fraction of the strength they once possesed. Brundisium is their final city, their last stain on a world so tainted by greed. I have the honour of being the one to remove that stain. I now make my march, our footsteps of doom bellowing down upon the city walls. We are coming..

Diary Entry 12 - As we approached the gates of the Palace, Ceaser panicked. He offered a Peace Treaty, along with all his coffers. ""Why barter for what I can simply take?"" I said, leaving a lifeless corpse on the floor. My troops rejoiced, sharing drinks with the Spanish, and food with the Malinese. What was I doing? I was looking across the border to the North... towards the prosperous Chinese Empire.

[b][h1]TL;DR[/h1][/b]Honestly, you have to be a fan of these types of 4x games, to enjoy them. A lot of people find them boring because there's a decent amount of waiting around while you wait for buildings to finish, units to be trained, research to be finished etc. Saying that, I find Civ games to be faster paced than games such as Crusader Kings/Europa Unversalis. The learning curves are a lot smaller too!

You'll never find great graphics in these types of games, but you'll always find amazing gameplay, and that's what matters right? Great gameplay is what keeps you playing, not great graphics. 
I'm not a fan of the newer games, Civilization: Beyond Earth especially. I think they completely ruined that game. However, if you enjoyed the previous games (1, 2, 3) or you want to get into the series without spending a lot of money. I whole heartedly recommend this game.",1414629828,1471574449,True,476,238,0.866052567958831787,16,False,False,False,False,

Whether you want to play it like an economic or diplomatic power, or play it like a 4x war-style game (like most people do), it's got something for everyone.  Lots of customization, expansions, and mods to keep it fresh. Everything from fantasy RPG style scenarios, to space ship battles, to my personal favorite - next war; featuring giant tanks and mechs.

Civ 4 has a great deal of game play depth, offering multiple ways to achieve victory (culture, domination, conquest, space race, diplomatic) whilst also being accessible to the casual gamer who wants to play a no-stress peaceful game, to the best of strategists who play on the hardest difficulty, defending their lands from relentless barbarians and aggressive AI whilst trying to maintain stable relations and expand to dominate the world.

You can be a peaceful nation, focussing on culture or speeding through research. You can also focus on expansion, setting up as many cities as possible to own as much landmass and resources. You can be a nation of great military prowess, devoting production and research to improving your armies, which you can then use to defend your cities or dominate your enemies. You can decide to care about diplomacy, forging friends with the AI, and eventually, winning the diplomatic victory at the U.N.

World wonders are a fun feature. I always build the Stonehenge, and from then on build as many as possible. The culture and great person points they give are powerful. The game is also fairly educational on wonders of the world that actually exist or existed.

         The food and disease levels on here also ruin it for me, no real way to fight the disease and trying to combat the hunger just slows the game down, at the end it can take up to a dozen or more turns just to research a new technology but at that point the computer is already 5 or six levels ahead of you, I played Rise of Nations and thought it would be something very similar but this is a very slow punch to the face, I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you like taking all night just to build a couple towns and research some technology, the rts part of this game only makes up a certain 8-10%.",1402564337,1402564395,False,4,0,0.266497522592544556,0,True,False,False,False,

It is also a good game to play if you want to end up ruling the world and are unsure of how to do it - um, did you just read that?

So anyway, first of all there's a bunch of empires all with their own technologies, pros, cons and so on. And for each empire you get at least one leader. Each empire comes with a unique unit which can alter gameplay, such as the English redcoat, the French musketeer or the German Panzer Tank.

That brings me to the next great part - the units in the game. You start off with one city, and from there you can choose to make/train anything you have the technologies and resources to make/train. For example, you can train a warrior to fight, a scout to explore the map, a settler to find a new city, and later in the game (literally almost at the end), if you have the right stuff, you can make nukes!

The real icing on the cake is the fact that it is all so - well, real. You make contact with a new country, you make peace with them, you trade with them, you give them stuff - and then they can turn on you. Honestly Germany, why did you? You beat me, and I had grenadiers, war elephants and artillery; all you had were a few archers and a single catapult!

And last but not least, there's the winning. You can win by lots of ways: getting the most points by 2050, getting to Alpha Centauri first (space victory), controlling at least half the world, killing all other civilizations etc. All this great stuff turns the game into a real life simulation that is addictive and super fun. 10/10",1402519013,1409166977,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False,False,

The variety of ways the game can be won, and the option to have a new map every time, ensures each game is different to the last.

Civilization IV is a really fun game, based on a formula of expansion, growth, and conquest. However, it does have some flaws.

Graphics- The graphics on this game are, by all standards, nothing special, but a vast improvement over previous Civ titles. Besides, graphics in a strategy game aren't really the main focus.

Sound- The game has some great music tracks, which are era specific and usually appropriate. While the music does get a bit repetitive, I still haven't gotten tired of the opening title. The sound effects are pretty funny, which help contribute to the feeling that Civ4 is ""just a game"". A good thing, in my opinion. Also, Leonard Nimoy speaks to you every time you research a technology.

Gameplay- This is where Civ4 really shines. The game is really infinitely replayable, with infinite possibilities and completely ludicrous historical combinations to try! The city building and expanding mechanic is very solid, however combat needs A LOT of work. Battles are simplistic and very unbalanced at best, relying almost completely on numbers and tech level rather than strategy or practicality. I for one, feel that stone age spearmen should never be able to defeat attack helicopters. In addition to this, some of the civics and the entire religion mechanic are completely pointless, which is a shame, considering they could have been put to very good use. Ultimately though, the game is still very good, and very addictive. I give it an 8.",1388517815,1548189310,True,32,1,0.699809610843658447,1,True,False,False,False,
