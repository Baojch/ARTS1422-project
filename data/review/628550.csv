本作品は「悪魔城ドラキュラ」の影響を大きく受けた、古典的横スクロールアクションをリスペクトした作品である。
近接武器の鞭と遠距離武器の銃を切り替えながら敵をシバき倒して進むオーソドックスなアクションゲームだ。

このゲームの評価の分かれ目は、以下のポイント。
[h2]昔ながらのアクションゲームの要素を良しとするか悪しとするか[/h2]
である。
[b]
・初見殺し、穴落としは結構ある
・落下判定が厳しい、進行方向と逆にスクロールしない
・武器切り替えにクールダウンがあるなど多少の不便さはある
・通常攻撃も予備動作（振りかぶり）が長い
[/b]

この「古典的横スクACT」にありがちな要素を受け入れるか嫌うかで評価が大きく分かれるだろう。
しかし現在ではそうした「理不尽さ」や「操作性の悪さ」とも言える要素も踏襲しつつである。
[b]
・移動は軽快で素早く動ける
・ジャンプ中も空中制動が効き自由に動ける＋ジャンプの高さ調節も可能
・鞭攻撃も判定広め＋持続長い＋振りかぶりも大きい上方向判定あり
・初見殺しはあるものの、それだけでなくキッチリ「アクション」を要求するデザイン
・初見殺しは多いものの１ＵＰアイテムが多く出る
・素晴らしいドット、グラフィック
[/b]

などなどの要素があり。
[h2]とても３００円で買えるゲームとは思えないゲームの出来だ。[/h2]
正直「１０００円超えでこれよりよっぽど出来の悪いゲーム」など山程あると言った印象。

私のゲームの腕前は悪魔城ドラキュラ１周目ならNormalノーコン安定程度の腕前だが、クリアまで１時間弱ちょっとで常に楽しく遊べた。
難易度選択もある様子なのでより上の難易度に挑むのも良いし、カジュアルに遊んでも良いし何ならノーミスチャレンジなども面白そうだなと思う。


このゲームは古典的横スクACTの…
[h2]覚えていけば攻略が加速する、その上でアクションするのがより楽しくなる[/h2]
という、「自分を常に褒めてくれる」つまり課題を超えていく楽しさという体験をちゃんと与えてくれるので、アクションゲーマーとしてはこれは楽しいゲームだったと感じた。

昔ACTに見られる初見殺しや穴落とし等の要素や多少の操作性の悪さは「あえて用意したのもの」であり、その他の要素はしっかりと現代風に直されている部分が大きいので、これらは「そこを踏まえて攻略を考えてくれよ」という思想に見受けられた。

これは評価が大きく分かれる所ではあるが、そうした古典的横スクＡＣＴが好きな人間からすれば。
[h2]古典的横スクＡＣＴが好きなら間違いなく気に入るとオススメできる[/h2]
作品だ。


欠点は、間違いなく「昔ACT」なのでどうしても「敷居が高い」ところだろうか。
ゲームの勘が働くのであれば「あ～はいはいこういうヤツね」とすぐ攻略を見いだせるだろうが、そうでなければかなり沼らされるので体験が悪くなるかもしれない。

そういう意味で「ゲームの腕前に自信の無い方」にはより勧めにくい作品かもしれない事も書き留めておく。


そんな所で、購入の参考になれば幸いである。

So Crypt Stalker is a retro NES inspired game, that fairly authentically captures the old game feel and aesthetic and not feel like it's more of an after thought, some real effort went into this game.

The game is divvied up into two separate versions, a console mode which is the more complete version with 9 whole levels, and a short handheld mode with it's own 4 distinctive levels. Gladys our main character is sort of a female Belmont and Indiana Jones hybrid since she wields a unique whip that can be upgraded into a flame whip, and can actually swing on specific objects, and has a gun that you can find actual different weapon types for, and actually collect ammo in the form of bullets and large shells.

Graphically the console mode is the best looking as it captures a classic retro NES look where as I feel most other ""retro themed"" games kind of fail, since there's a real effort here, the player sprites, enemies and backgrounds are clear and distinctive with a unique set of enemies. Not to mention the bosses. While handheld mode is very much old game boy styled, complete with a Game Boy-ish border that's akin to certain old Game Boy emulators.

Gameplay wise it's very speedy and responsive, although sometimes it feels a little extra slick in spots but you can get used to it. And Gladys is in basically a full on sprint, and only goes into a more typical Belmont strut in handheld mode. And some mechanics and even certain boss encounters are going to make you think of other games besides just Castlevania, there's a twinge of Snake's Revenge in one level mixed with Sonic, another sorta Sonic-ish mechanic, even a Sonic-ish boss, as well as a boss that's very much Mega Man in nature. The different bullet types you can get are a standard bullet, a lazer, a gas bullet, and a high explosive round, which is essentially the best ammo type, dishes out two points of damage to most health bars.

Sound design is pretty solid, no grating sound effects and a lot of them sound appropriate and console correct. For more astute NES gamers, there are some actual familiar sound effects but they play very rarely. And the music is phenomenal. Loads of great tracks, sounding fittingly retro while using some of the better NES sound card music from the NES library compared to some others which I'm glad it didn't go for.

The difficulty is fairly well done. It starts out somewhat easy but does kind of drastically spike part way through the game but it never feels utterly unfair, even the challenges weren't hair pullingly frustrating which I was real thankful for, they were tough but not impossible, some were surprisingly easier than others. It can be beaten entirely within around 3 or so hours depending on how well you do. Not a bad length for a game of this type and price. So I do highly recommend for classic gaming fans or those wanting a not so insanely difficult retro themed game since that's another problem I've noted with some retro games, taking the old difficulty to an insane level. This is tough but fair with only one boss you're bound to die on a good few times, both in main game and in the boss rush.

- Why do we have to switch between the weapons manually vs just using the switch weapon button for the ONLY OTHER WEAPON IN GAME?

Theres traps active when you cant even see i keep hitting just for moving forward with the ridiculous high speed sprint of the character.

- Why do you have things that seem to purposefully hit you?  again with the cheap traps, I dont know the whip chain mechanics, i know they work, so i use them and then im flung into a trap and idk what to do, do i jump?  can i control the swing?  there was never a place to practice any fancy maneuvering with this mechanic.

- Why is it hard to tell what way the gears are turning for those platforms without staring directly at them?  along with the high speed, your character can end up FLYING forward towards pits, traps, enemies and more.

Dos visuais até a trilha sonora, passando até pela própria ""narrativa"" do jogo que se limita a te dar um contexto pra história, tudo nesse jogo tenta transpirar aos anos 80/90 da história dos plataforma. Mas se tem algo daquela época que o jogo faz a escolha acertada de não recriar são os controles e animações travadas cheios de input lag e a dificuldade que por vezes te fazia querer testar a resistência da manete no chão.

Não demandam muita habilidade para se derrotar, mas te mantém sempre engajado na luta. Se há uma critica a fazer é que o jogo se mantém muito na sua zona de conforto, uma repetição de level design que vai ficando cada vez mais aparente e uns bugs aqui e acolá. Porém considerando a sua proposta de recriar o ""feel"" daqueles tempos, é perdoável!

Enfim, Crypt Stalker é um jogo de plataforma competente que resgata o sentimento de épocas mais simples e irá agradar jogadores que buscam uma experiência nostálgica sem muito compromisso.

Assim como no jogo Alien Splatter Redux, Crypt Stalker parece ser mesmo um jogo da época (gráficos, trilha e efeitos sonoros, dificuldade absurda) e não me espantaria se fosse lançado em cartucho compatível com o videogame. O jogo lembra demais o Castlevania, o que pode ser considerado como uma grande homenagem ou uma gigantesca cópia (cabe cada um decidir), mas no meu caso achei positivo e voltei aos anos 80 jogando no meu velho Dynavision.

O único porém são alguns bugs que atrapalham bastante. Na segunda fase, você pode ficar preso em alguns locais que não dão para sair (só morrendo ou resetando), alguns inimigos caem em buracos e deixam de oferecer perigo ou as caveiras que deixam de ""cuspir"" e facilitam a sua jornada. Contudo, o que achei mais estranho, foi numa das últimas vezes que joguei: passei por várias fases e fui acumulando uma quantidade absurda de vidas, o que me permitiu ir até o penúltimo estágio do game.

The ideas behind the game are solid, however, the execution largely fails.

Pros:

Your character’s attacks are implemented well. I really like the combination of the upgradable whip and gun sub-weapon with various ammo types. 

Apart from the primary game, there are a variety of distinct modes and challenges. 

Cons:

Level design is built around trial and error. While this might appeal to some, I find it to be antiquated and truly unenjoyable as it forces the player to continually repeat purposefully frustrating sections of the game. 

The movement is horrendous. On foot, the character moves too fast for the environment. Conversely, for some odd reason, your jump attack slows you down midair and shortens your jump distance. The contrast during gameplay is maddening. Additionally, inputs can be lost. For example, if you're moving forward and want to attack in the opposite direction, you'll need to stop, turn and then attack. Otherwise, the input will be lost.  

The visual design is largely unappealing. The backgrounds are largely uninteresting and muddy while the characters are garish. Again, it’s an odd contrast.

Separo en partes para dejar bien el analisis

-Jugabilidad excelente: Incluso donde hay saltos traicioneros el juego es justo, si te caes es por tu propia culpa o por alguna forrada del nivel, pero no por el control.
Además que los niveles son entretenidos de jugar, cada uno tiene alguna mecánica distinta

-Música: Muy disfrutable, tiene temas que me gustaron mucho, no pasa desapercibida.

-Pelea contra los jefes: está medio balanceado, hay jefes que son muy fáciles de ganar, otros que están bien y algunos que te ponen muy tenso porque un error te puede llevar a la muerte.
Supongo que el jefe final me dejo entre medio decepcionado y no (Spoiler hasta que termine el parentesis, la 1ra fase es extremadamente fácil de ganar, la 2da te da una batalla digna, la 3ra es una boludez, salvo que no tengas balas, pero antes de la batalla reponés munición)

-Historia: Está en ingles y mucho no entendí... pero es tan sencilla que te das una idea fácilmente y... supongo que termina siendo una trama demasiado simplona

Después pasando a errores, bugs o cosas que no me gustaron tanto

-La variedad de enemigos es un tanto excasa, se repiten bastante en los niveles

-El sistema de vidas por un momento no entedía donde se sumaban porque moría al principio y no veía que me descontara algo, de hecho se me terminó buguendo y en un momento empezó a darme vidas cada vez que pasaba de una sección a otra, incluso si moría me daba otra vida, después dejó de hacerlo, pero se ve que se acumularon tantas vidas que el contador nunca bajaba.... así que, un bug a corregir ahí
-El diseño de los niveles: principalmente los primeros son bastante enquilombados, se mezclan mucho el piso por el que caminás con los detalles del fondo, aunque increíblemente no te dificulta tanto, pero estaría bueno darle un mejor contraste porque llega a ser confuso.
En los niveles finales ya se notaba un mejor balance

Así que, creo que es todo lo que tengo para decir, pese a esos detalles en contra que tiene al juego lo recomiendo mucho, por ese precio lo val. Se pasa en una hora y hora y media dependiendo tu habilidad, pero tenés un plus de niveles extra y un boss rush.

You take the role of an Indiana Jones-esque Crypt Stalker, at first finding yourself fighting temple guards and scarabs.  As you venture deeper, the experience turns more demonic and the enemies more otherworldly.  Armed with a taser whip and sidearm you traverse nine levels of water, lava, space, and other environments as you struggle to end the curse and save the world. 

Some clever level mechanics make their appearance, such as shifting floors controlled by standing on ""up"" and ""down"" arrow blocks, but most of the platforming experience you'll find in Crypt Stalker stays true to the traditional formula.  You can expect spikes, pitfalls, conveyor belts, and other familiar challenges as you make your way to battle demons.   

The game is ripe with classic Castlevania inspiration.  Your whip is upgradeable.  The bosses drop orbs when slain.  You gain ammunition, money, and other items by breaking objects suspended overhead.  The level select system, which provides a permanent save when you finish a level, offers some relief of the harsh punishment of old Castlevania games, but doesn't detract from the experience. 

There is definite love for the 8-bit era here.  Everything is as you would expect after blowing off an NES cartridge, sticking it in your deck, and pushing the power button on.  Strange has taken into account every detail of the NES experience, from momentarily disappearing sprites to hue changes as the level backgrounds appear from the right side of the screen in a side scrolling level, it's all there.  Add to this the ability to play a handheld gameboy version of the game (which offers all new levels and challenges) and you'll find yourself knee deep in 90's gaming nostalgia.

Overall, I was greatly pleased with the game.  The amount of content here is generous for the low price tag.  The combat can be frustrating with the classic ""knockback"" into a pit, but it's not beyond expectation.  The only detraction is a frustrating bug that keeps you stuck in the floor when using one of the rising floors.  Other than that, the experience inside of Crypt Stalker is a flawless 8-bit experience which brings back all the joys and tension of NES gaming.  

8/10, 9/10 if the bug gets fixed.

The level design is unbelievably creative and clever. Each level has a distinct theme and pushes its limits, eventually having you play through a hell gauntlet of every level in a single grueling stage. The bosses are awesome. Extremely creative and challenging.

Crypt Stalker scales automatically to my CRT which is a beautiful feature (A Whole New World does too). 

Another thing Crypt Stalker offers is the GameBoy mode which I love. If you look at GameBoy ports of NES games tons of them are somewhat enhanced, offering more features and or different level designs (Kung Fu Master springs to mind). Crypt Stalker's GameBoy mode feels like one of those GameBoy ports, offering different level design and mechanics while keeping the same general gameplay and premise. This mode is something I absolutely love after my years of emulating and exploring different console ports and games on my XP machine as a kid. Scratches a super niche itch.

I've managed to 100% it in the span of 3 hours, including the challenges and the boss rush, but less seasoned players might take quite a bit more time, given the increase in difficulty of the latter levels.
My only real gripes have to do with some bugs, such as getting stuck in the arrow-guided elevator in both of the levels it showed up in and jumping over the screen ceiling in another level (I think it was a section in level 6).
Also the No Whip and Pacifist achievement were swapped, as in I unlocked one of them by doing the other one and vice versa, so you might want to look into this too.

It's high quality retro, pick up and play fun. At the price of 3 bucks, I am probably going to buy this for all my friends. I gladly support the devs.
You guys are great, you made it so we start where we left off, thank you so much. This makes the game so much more pick up and play.",1604127812,1604266127,True,4,0,0.471913605928421021,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Sólo quiero destacar que soy un amante de los juegos de la vieja escuela, el juego promete mucho, al nivel (clara inspiración) de los castlevania de nes; es juego es muy bueno en muchos sentidos, la música, el arte, nada más que tiene un detalle, al llegar al segundo jefe el juego se bugea, el personaje camina sólo hacia adelante entrando al escenario aún cuando no se oprimen botones, y los controles de

The controls and animations feel off, certain enemies have an absurd amount of health, and it just doesn't quite replicate that deliberate, tactical feel that made Castlevania great (you move way too fast and can control your mid-air momentum, yet your main attack is painfully slow and there's still knockback. It's got some of the ingredients, but not all of them). Also, it claims to have a save system, but it appears to either be broken or not explained properly (I couldn't figure out how to resume from the second stage after beating the first one, none of the buttons let me pick a stage).

Solid 5/10 (as in ""average"" not ""F-""). Not bad (especially for a solo dev), but definitely not great. Giving it a thumbs up because the world needs more classic Castlevania (and there are two campaigns, one of which is a throwback to the Gameboy CVs, which is cool).",1604109423,1604109738,True,5,0,0.464290916919708252,0,True,False,False,False,,,
