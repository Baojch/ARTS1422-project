I might see good time to rewrite this review as I play it & get updated farther.




It's very like hotline miami with space(except story and survival), nice concept and good gameplay.If you are a sci-fi fan and interested in trailer, that won't go wrong.

However you'll be confused at starting, there's not much clear guidance of where to go.
 (Here I make quick tips. Yellow circle will take you to evac ship.later you can interact wreckage or planet to land and explre.Don't forget saving inside ship with ""I"" and you need to hold right click to shoot your gun.) 

ALSO I just saw some BUGS that can't be left unseen.(Error at loading save,shot gun with no damage,stucking enemy)

So I recommend this game but you'd hold your money atm, just some update and this game will be great.
If you going to try it on sale and expect refund, please don't do that, it's on very early stage at this point.

The npc's sometimes shot me and sometimes didn't, the ships I found I could not customise or learn to make.
Basically I just felt like the whole game was a repetative loop of ""Now go here, now do this, no go there, now do that"" steps.

I found it fun for the first few deaths, but I got bored once I started to see the game sections repeat themselves.

Built on a roguelike-style framework that features procedural generation, character progression and permadeath, [b]Derelict[/b] is a game that clearly prides itself on throwing the player in at the deep end - a fact that shows very well on the first level, where you're required to escape a self-destructing spaceship without a tutorial or even so much as a map. Randomly-spawning, godawfully-ugly explosions take significant chunks from your health as you stumble through the corridors, and though you catch glimpses of what could be enemies or friendly NPCs, they tend to get gibbed by the RNG pretty fast. It's only when you bump into an escape pod and launch yourself free of the doomed ship that the game 'opens up'. for want of a less promising term.

In reality, although you're now free to visit space stations, abandoned planets, wormholes to newly-generated map sectors and discarded chunks of former space liners, the promise of freedom rapidly withers when you find out that there's absolutely nothing to actually [i]do[/i] out there. All of the destinations you can visit, though different in appearance, play out identically - you land your ship, shoot the mindless zombie-like enemies rushing towards you in single file, pick up poorly-sprited items and weapons that the game never really tells you the purpose of, then take off and try to find a use for all the indistinct junk you accrued. I'd like to be able to write a paragraph for each different type of destination you can land at, but unfortunately, they're so similar in how they play out that there's just nothing unique to be said.

Though the game does boast an impressive array of different collectible weapons to find in your travels, the anaemic levels of enemy variety make the point moot - an automatic pistol carves through a brainless line of whatever those sprites are meant to be just as well as a plasma rifle, so what's the point? The only time I actually managed to die to these foes was when a huge mob of them sprung onto me out of what must've been a spawn point as I approached. My other deaths - getting shot in the back repeatedly by a companion who I never asked to join me, getting hit by an asteroid that I had no way of predicting, and failing to luck my way to the exit during the starting level - were similarly unenthusing. There's also different spaceships to grab off space stations and derelicts to replace your initial ship, but there's even less point to it than getting a new weapon - besides their admittedly-decent sprites, all the ships are totally identical.

In all, between a music playlist that varies between 'generic' and 'actively unpleasant', a near-total lack of any artwork that could be called 'good', and mechanics so bare-bones that they almost don't need that tutorial that the game fails to provide anyway, [b]Derelict[/b] feels far more like a tech demo than a bona-fide game. The 'open world' the game puts you in is laughably bare, the exploration aspect falls flat once you realise you're not doing anything new after the first couple of landings, and frankly, I don't even think the area maps that you land on are procedural. Just spend the $10 on a cheap movie or a takeout or something, since both would keep you entertained for longer.",1469382132,1469382132,False,32,2,0.694791495800018311,4,True,False,False,False,,,

anyway, like SPAZ (NUMBER 1, NOT 2, ugh 2 is ... not my bag, Really weird SPAZ 2 that is.) it offers frree space exploration, and choice to do what you would like in a free roam environment.

Pros:
1. GTA 2 like gameplay in the dark future
2. Space exploration
3. free roam narrative (although lacking)

Cons: 
1. barely any story
2. price....9.99? for this? cmon. (that seems to be a bad trend among indie developers, but I'm sure Valve recommended the price.. surely)
3. not enough tutorial, not enough guidance, and there really needs to be a better sector map in these kinds of games. 


10/10 because we dont have enough games like it, wish SPAZ 1 would have more games.

An interesting if not extremely early and low-budget game. I like what I have seen so far but it took effort to keep going at the start. You begin the game on a starship that has been adrift in space for an extremely long time and wake-up to the sounds of explosions. You then have to quickly grab some starting weapons that are lying on the floor and attempt to escape the ship. 

The 'the ship is disintegrating' effects are poorly executed and the whole first mission is seriously annoying. There are little balls of fire burning everywhere and you have to escape while avoiding them...but you have no idea what the exit looks like. Not only that, but the mission is time sensitive and the instructions are written in tiny distorted pixel letters on the left side of the screen. Anyway, once you realise that the exit is a circular lens-like protuberance (because, of course it is), you flee the stricken ship in a tiny fighter and begin roaming the galaxy.

This is what happened to me: 

I cruised around in space for a bit in my new fighter. The game’s space-stage is a ‘top-down Newtonian drift shooter’ ala ‘asteroids’, so it was fairly easy to master. I quickly stumbled onto a planet. I landed, exited my ship, and began exploring. Crab aliens attacked me in droves but I gunned them all down easily enough with my shotgun, which seemed to miss randomly. I explored an old abandoned school and a factory, realising only after five minutes that the point of landing was to pick up these small circular fuel and O2...pods; themselves hidden amongst useless boxes and explodable barrels. Many of the crab-aliens were clipped into the wall and were stuck there, making the clearing task that much easier - also, the aliens never attacked unless they had direct line of sight, which made evasion quite easy. 

After I had cleared and stripped the area, I reboarded my ship and took to the stars again. I boosted relative north, firing my cannons at space-junk. Just before my O2 ran out (at least, I think the little white bar was my O2) I came across a derelict ship floating in space. I boarded the ship and found that this was a little different than being planet-side - I was floating in an airless environment. So I floated down the corridors, encountered a whole heap of crab aliens again, shot them in zero gravity. I saw a hole in the bulkhead which was full of eyes, decided to avoid it and took refuge in a room. This is when I tackled the inventory system. I still do not know how to use it because, much to my surprise, being in your inventory does not pause the game. I was eaten by crab aliens. 

This game has charm and, as they all do, potential. I like the concept and I like what they have done so far. The inventory system needs to be explained, the introductory mission needs to be overhauled, the AI needs epic work and the starting splash-screen needs to be more conventionally laid out. On that last point, it took me a while to even realised there was an options menu and that is not good when you are an indie game trying to make a good first impression. The last thing you want is for everyone to believe that it's such a shell of a game that it has no graphics or audio options. 

It's a good early-access game and its first 20 minutes can grab you if you give it a chance beyond the unconventional splash-screen and the horrible introduction. In 20 minutes, I had fun and felt that there was more to come. Hope this review helps!",1469365858,1469366150,True,11,1,0.603217244148254395,0,True,False,False,False,,,
