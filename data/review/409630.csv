TLDR: Limited content. Lackluster featureset. Limited audiovisual assets. Repetitive gameplay. Outcompeted in the genre. 

Sort of a rock paper scissor VS game. The autoaim works automatically but trying to adjust aiming just breaks it and makes it near impossible to land a shot. Mostly based on timing your attack and playing cat and mouse. 

We found it would be difficult to predict if a dash would save you or still get you skewered and killed. The limited amount of arenas, the flat texturing without microdetails and the limited roster of combattants make the game very short lived. After a few duels we were done.

This game is nothing, it's honestly purely a concept, no variety, no change, just a solid experience that doesn't change ever.

I enjoyed it while I played it, and I will play more but you got to be kidding, I can't belive this is a ""full"" release.
This seemes like the *very* early stages of the game.
It's like when you make something and it's not yet finished, but you still show your friends even though it isn't all done.

I can't complain since I picked it up for a dollar, if you wanna have like 2-3 hours of gmae party, yeah pick it up. (ON SALE)

Positives:

- Cool concept (yeah, just that.)
- Nice funny slow-mo events when someone dies.

Negatives:

- Shitty controlls, many have stated this already, but you just can't understand how a big of a deal it is until you play.
   If you play the co-op game mode, you will need to survive against waves of wolves, but they come from all sides and
   corners, you can only shoot what you are walking torwards. THIS GETS YOU INSTANTLY KILLED.

- It runs horribly, got all the requirement (recommended) and I can only play it while turning all the options to off. 
  (Only 2 options, so yeah... you'll game will have to look horrbile.

- THIS GAME IS NOTHING, it has nothing to offer except for the 2 minutes of what you saw in the trailer.
   No spicing it up, no veriaty of weapons, areans (which are half-assed anyway.) no option of combat style differences, 
   no game tweaking options (which are needed if the game is doing such a shit job with spicing thing up.

It's underdeveloped, and a bit boring. Few maps, not much to do, gameplay is not some skill so it does not give satisfaction and quickly tires.

The production lacks something, maybe an idea for itself, for something more, and it's a pity, because the general idea is not bad and it could be a nice game to play with friends, but it's just a bummer.

They made me feel bad for giving them such a hard time more or less. 

However, Since this is a review, I will still note the things that need to change for the game to be playable.

-Multiplayer - The game is currently local play only.

-Controls - The controls need to be revamped dramatically.

-Starting Menu - I wouldn't say it's insanely difficult to get into a game, but it is extremely confusing to get the game started, even if you are going to play by yourself.

-----------------

Devs I regret the way I said the things that I did, however, when the game improves, the Vulgar Game Trailer Review will not be for the faint of heart. 

Most of my attitude changed when I realized you are the same guys that I backed for Cornerstone.",1444904752,1444955320,False,8,1,0.316558033227920532,9,True,False,False,False,,1444923353.0,"Do you want help getting the to work for you, or do you just want to bash it ?"
