They have made some terrible changes, mostly with the AI. In skirmish mode it is so stripped down that it just runs around aimlessly and dying, and in conquest mode it is so overpowered as to be impossible on some missions in extreme difficulty. The AI basically cheats, it builds a relic and has a massive army within the first year, all without mining any iron or not possibly having the resources to build it all.

In the conquest mission ""surrounded"" it's 3 vs 1 against you, and within a few minutes of starting the enemy is right beside your starting tile and already attacking your territory before you have a single soldier. It's just lame honestly, there's no sense of a challenge, it's just straight up cheating AI. One set of mechanics for it, another for you, and they are not even remotely equal.

There are other conquest missions equally unbalanced in extreme mode especially, and these are the ones where you have a couple of years win it. In the ""Gates of Helheim"" mission you have to capture and hold 3 gates that endlessly spawn fallen valkyrie enemies, which kill your warriors in two hits. It's impossible to build up enough troops within two years to have a chance of holding one of these gates. So many other flaws I'm not even going to bother with, but these are the main ones. Another mission with the dwarves where you're swarmed by like 20 of them over and over again, in extreme mode it's impossible. 5 years to win? What a joke. I have tried countless times and even with a hero and 20 troops it can't be done. Even shield bearers are dead in 3 seconds. Again, lame.

If you like feeling like playing a game where the AI is cheating the entire time and having no immersion because of it, this is definitely the game for you! I find my time on this game frustrated and angry, and if a game does that it's not worth playing because the devs have completely missed the point of a game. The campaign is fun and definitely the only good part of this game.",1712491882,1712491882,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It takes a bit from Age of Empires and a bit from Warcraft 3, blending them together in a Viking-themed hodgepodge with a modern coat of paint.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t take long for the cracks in the gameplay to show. Despite the few unique innovations, you can’t escape the feeling that you’re just playing a slower Warcraft 3 with a far more boring story. “Avenge your father and save the world” has to be the most tired trope imaginable for a game campaign. You really have to do more than just rip off the golden oldies if you want to impress.

It would be bad enough if the mechanics were simply derivative, but they’re often poorly executed. Your lords are very boring, with no additional abilities beyond more health and damage. The AI is absolutely braindead and can only pose a threat through artificial advantages. Each map plays out more or less identically, and at a pace that is more soporific than entertaining.

Also, are they actually joking with this pricing? It’s worth ten dollars less, and the amount of mid content that the devs have locked up behind overpriced DLC is staggering. It’s the kind of naked greed that will immediately put me off a company - I will remember the name Shiro Games, but not positively.

My advice would be to skip Northgard. It’s a cynical and shallow attempt at maximizing capital, with little brain and even less heart.",1712422625,1712422625,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I intended to spend my spring break being productive and played this for 60 hours instead.

Campaign: Pretty fun, only done half so far, but I like the challenges and harder difficulties.

Multiplayer: Tons of fun. I play with my friends every night, multiple win conditions and tons of clan options really makes things fun. I will say that the Competitive mode queue times are really long bc of the low player base, so I haven't actually played it, but on YT I've seen there's a meta that is quite unlike how me and my friends play.

Cosmetics: Free in-game cosmetics for completing missions is nice, not super insane, but kinda neat.

Conquest Mode: Haven't played it yet, but most of my friends play it when they're alone and say it's really fun

DLC: 5 dollars for a clan is a lot imo, but I put in 83 hours in 3 weeks andd got the game on sale so I figured I liked it enough to justify buying some of it. I would say overall the game and DLC are worth buying on sale, but I wouldn't advise anyone who isn't SUPER into the game to get DLC full price. 

Other thoughts:

I played a LOT of Civ and SCII and this is like a viking hybrid of the two. I know there are many other games in this genre, but I haven't played them to compare. I think if you want to get really good at one clan that can be fun, but I enjoy trying all the clans a few times in a rotation. 

Literally my biggest complaint about the game is that the playerbase is so small that there are only like 5 YouTubers I can find that still post content and a lot of older content isn't as helpful bc of patches that come out, so learning advanced mechanics not taught in the tutorials is a challenge.

I highly recommend this game, but I also acknowledge it may have superior competitors I simply have not played. The fact that they're doing more DLC and big free updates come with each DLC (even if you don't buy it) after 6 years is a good sign to me of the games health albeit with a small playerbase.

Northgard ist ein faszinierendes Echtzeit-Strategiespiel, das auf Steam eine treue Fangemeinde gefunden hat. Nachdem ich über 150 Stunden in die Welt von Northgard eingetaucht bin, kann ich mit Sicherheit sagen, dass dieses Spiel eine beeindruckende Erfahrung bietet, vor allem im Koop-Modus mit einem Freund.

Als jemand, der jeden Clan gemeistert und alle Eroberungen errungen hat, finde ich mich nun in der Warteschleife, auf ein neues Addon und neue Clans zu hoffen. Doch selbst nach all den Stunden bleibt Northgard eine Quelle der Unterhaltung und Herausforderung.

Die wahre Schönheit von Northgard offenbart sich im Koop-Modus, wo du und ein Freund gemeinsam eure Kräfte vereinen, um das Land zu erobern und gegen verschiedene Herausforderungen anzutreten. Die strategische Tiefe des Spiels wird noch verstärkt, wenn man mit einem Partner zusammenarbeitet, um Ressourcen zu verwalten, Gebiete zu erobern und feindliche Angriffe abzuwehren.

Obwohl ich bisher noch keine Erfahrung mit dem Online-PvP-Modus gemacht habe, bin ich sicher, dass er genauso fesselnd ist wie der Koop-Modus. Die Vielfalt der Clans und die unterschiedlichen Spielstile bieten eine endlose Wiederspielbarkeit, und ich kann es kaum erwarten, diese Vielfalt auch im PvP zu erleben.

Die Entwickler haben einen großartigen Job gemacht, das Spiel kontinuierlich zu verbessern und zu erweitern, und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass Northgard noch lange Zeit ein fesselndes RTS-Erlebnis bieten wird. Für Fans des Genres und vor allem für diejenigen, die gerne im Koop spielen, ist Northgard definitiv eine Empfehlung wert.

Купил, начал играть. Не очень было весело, потому что играл на волке, который вечно страдал, но ЗАТО У НЕГО МОЩНАЯ АРМИЯ, думал я.

Сыграв в пвп, где меня вынесли за 10 минут несколько раз, решил, что пока не для меня...

Но вот в 2024 вернулся после других нервных шутеров и игр, и поймал кайф...хочешь - играй неспешно, хочешь - попробуй зарашить. Хочешь - саппорть, сидя дома, хочешь - построй легион и иди в атаку.

В общем, игра по кайфу. 

Из плюсов:
- разнообразный геймплей на каждом клане
- приятная музыка, графика и дизайн
- куча режимов игры
- можно и нужно играть с кем-то, так в 2 раза веселее
- после покупки доступны сильные кланы (Олень, Ворона, Конь), т.е. сразу не надо накупать всяких львов и сов, сначала надо разобраться на стандартных одно-двухзвездочных кланах

Минусы:
- у каждого клана только один успешный путь развития, пойдете в другой - проиграете
- ОЛЕНИ В БАШНИ ЗА8БАЛИ В ДУЭЛЯХ, эта игра либо про противостояние одинаковых кланов, либо про оленя и его славу, вообще баланс 1 на 1 никакой, нужно оставить победу только господством, иначе люди так и будут по 6 игровых лет сидеть на своей территории, а ты хрен туда зайдешь
- нынче дорогие паки без акции, покупать игру, а потом еще каждый клан...такое себе. на турецком акке только по акции купил себе кланы, которых не хватало, и то вышло как ААА игра
- игра ТОЛЬКО для командного пвп, где только 2 стороны. Режимы типа ФФА (8 каждый за себя) дуэль и 2х2х2, например, вообще ни о чем. Только 2на2, 3на3, 4на4, остальное упирается в ""о, го ему в спину зайдем, пока он дерется""
- одному скучновато. нет внутриигрового чата, где можно найти напов. тыкаться в каждое лобби, откуда тебя кикнут с плашкой ""голд"", потому что ты ""про""...ну хз. отсюда вытекает...
- смурфы. всякие кибератлеты делают 500 аккаунтов и типа с 0 рейтинга идут во фришке тебя раскатывать. да да, 3к часов, топ10 в 3на3 прям так и пишет, когда игра началась. совет: ливайте сразу, штрафов нет, но сэкономите время и нервы, всё рано шанс на победу около -1%

В ЦЕЛОМ: если у вас есть сын/девушка/дедушка или любитель под пиво посидеть за компом и не потеть - смело берите.
всякие турниры бывают, но редко, если хотите киберспорт, то, наверное, это не про эту игру. попотеть можно в командном 3на3, но тогда ищите 2х друзей, делайте команду и тренируйтесь)) тоже как вариант для тех, кому надо побеждать, чтобы член стоял.


На этом всё, всем, кому игра зашла желаю засыпать под звук поселялина, садящегося в корабль (ооохэй)",1710597760,1710597760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Une petite pépite dans l'univers des jeux de stratégie. Lore sympathique et coloré, qui plaira à ceux qui aiment la mythologie viking. La bande-son est envoûtante et bien immersive. Mention spéciale pour la direction artistique et les graphismes mignons des personnages qui offre un côté assez décalé à un jeu qui reste assez exigeant dans sa conception. C'est qu'en matière de ressources, il faudra non seulement accumuler bois, nourriture et or pour prospérer, mais en plus de gérer les ennemis, survivre à l'hiver, le froid et la famine pouvant décimer votre clan de façon aussi dévastatrice que les guerriers d'un clan hostile. Néanmoins, la prise en main est intuitive et on comprend assez vite comment gérer les manques (bien mémoriser les atouts du clan choisi en début de partie vous aidera.

En ce qui concerne la baston ; le gameplay est efficace, vous créez assez vite des bâtiments militaires, mais il faut bien penser aux améliorations pour avoir plus de troupes si vous jouez de façon agressive. Mais je mets un point noir concernant la mini map, qui est parfois pénible à lire quand on veut localiser ses territoires les plus éloignés, car à force de coloniser, on finit par en avoir beaucoup et il devient plus compliqué de suivre tout ce qui se passe dessus quand on est attaqué ou qu'un incendie se déclenche.

J'ai parlé de la victoire militaire, étant donné que j'ai choisi un clan belliqueux, mais pour les pacifistes, vous pouvez aussi gagner par le commerce, le savoir ou la renommée. C'est le choix du clan et les bonus qui vont avec qui décideront de votre stratégie. Notez que des petites bulles de tutoriel vous explique régulièrement les différentes mécaniques de jeu, ce qui fait que vous comprendrez assez vite, surtout si vous avez déjà l'habitude des rts. Si vous êtes débutant dans un jeu de ce genre, je pense qu'il est du coup également idéal pour découvrir le genre. 

Tout cela pour dire : je recommande.

+ Good gameplay with interesting mechanics or twist on established ones
+ Clans play very differently without drowning you in 'extra mechanics'. Permutations and/or small variations on well thought out core mechanics offer great replayability.
+ Lots of content, fairly priced DLCs, good update-cycle
+ Good looks and sounds. In general a high amount of 'wow, there was love poured into this'-moments.
+ Coop-Conquest Mode is the most fun I had in an RTS

+/- Less hectic than SC2 or AoE2. I really like it, but I can see APM-freaks being turned off by the limited micro.

- Sometimes lobbies bug out (didn't happen since the last update so maybe fixed?)
- Please send help for some clans extreme-AI. It has some sort of brain-damage, carbon mono-oxide poisoning or crippling depression. Either way, please help it.

Esse jogo tem pontos positivos primordiais: 
- Exige pouco hardware (perfeito pra quem tem notebook)
- Não precisa de conexão de internet para jogar a campanha ou modo Conquista (quando fiquei sem internet foi o jogo que me restou) 
- A campanha é um tutorial muito intuitivo

O jogo é um pouco repetitivo e cansativo devido o começo lento em cada partida, mas no decorrer é divertido na companhia de amigos. Vale a pena!",1710184562,1710184562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Poor explanation of mechanics, sometimes you can't do something and no explanation of why.  For example, new player I spent a while trying to attack an enemy but couldn't figure out why wasn't working.  One time the area wasn't scouted, other times the map was really weirdly shaped and there was another territory I needed to go thru first.  Finally I figured it out but to a WHILE, why is there no simple tooltip like ""this area hasn't been scouted yet"" NOPE just won't let you click...

Not letting you do something but not telling why is VERY annoying.  This may seem petty but other examples are the same.

It gets pretty boring pretty quick due to how easy it is (singleplayer).

The game needs serious balancing AND AI improvements for late game. It's just too easy at the moment.
I started playing on normal difficulty for my first ever game, and despite not knowing anything, annihilated all AI factions within a couple of hours.

Second game on hard, same story. Third game on ""extreme"" difficulty, even easier than before now that I roughly know what I'm doing.

You just steamroll the AI once you establish a reliable food source and build a couple of breweries, which isn't at all hard to do. And the only defence anyone has against an invading army is to have an equal or superior army to counter it. Yes, you can build defence towers, but it's limited to one per ""tile"" and they are virtually useless unless they come at you one guy at a time. Which they don't (not counting the singular wild enemies present in neighbouring ""tiles"" that come once in a blue moon).

Few things that would help are;

[b]1- Make the AI more proactive in defending but more importantly, attacking.[/b] I've had two games in hard and extreme difficulty, where their armies just hang around doing nothing.

[b]2- Make it impossible to capture the enemy's town hall without capturing every other territory they own.[/b] It's rather ridiculous to take out an entire faction, sprawling half the map, by only taking out its town hall.
This is not a solution to the main issue here mind you, but at least it makes it take longer to defeat an enemy.

[b]3- Random disasters should be more impactful.[/b]
They are merely a nuisance even at the game start. They have practically no impact in the mid-to-late game.
Except the rat infestation event. That can be a big issue during early stages.

[b]4- Have more varied and impactful defensive options.[/b] There's no way to field an effective defence in the game unless you build a superior army, and because it is so easy to take over a tile and get to the enemy's town hall, losing one battle effectively means you lose the game. That's just unfathomable. The game needs other ways to field a defence other than just a bigger army than the other guy. I don't want to play a military path every match lest I forfeit the game.

Haven't been successful in joining a multiplayer session yet. I imagine it'll be a lot more challenging playing against human players and where this game will be saved in my eyes. 
But speaking for singleplayer gameplay; it's fun for a few hours, but the AI and late-game buffs need to be rebalanced to make the game more challenging and have replayability. 
I've played 3 games since yesterday and I don't think I'll ever touch singleplayer again.

[b]Edit:[/b] Played a number of multiplayer games since the above review. The issues with late game efficiency imbalance and the inability to resist an attacking army without an equal or superior army of your own remains the same, forcing you to play a specific style every match if you don't want to be steamrolled. More often than not, losing a single battle means your game is doomed. If anything, this is more pronounced in multiplayer because other will take advantage of the situation very quickly.

So I'm going to have to revise the review as ""not recommended"".

But that being said the AI is abysmal, and the worst part is, it wasn't always this bad, I assuming they just haven't done the necessary updates and tweaking with the addition of new factions and balances. IF the AI even manages to attack you or not die from wildlife by the 3rd year, they will give up and essentially sit idle, even when they have resources to attack or acquire more land (I completely surrounded an AI with 30 pop and over 1000 gold and left my borders undefended and they did not attack for 7 years until I won). They're entirely docile and are not substitutes for players, if anything they should be seen as neutrals on the map for real players to interact with. And that being said, there's not a wealth of players, and because of that you mostly get new players or people with 3000 hours, so it's hard to find a balanced match, there's not enough people for ranked matchmaking to properly sort you. But that's a fault of a lot of older matchmaking in general. The biggest issue is people play to the meta or whatever guide they follow and at the first upset they quit. So all of the win conditions are void because if you survive the meta all in attack on year 3 the enemy will just auto forfeit because they've devastated their economy and can't defend themselves against a counter attack. Or if someone is playing for a win condition the first bad winter they quit because they're just entirely playing off of a guide or they just have no interest in attempting to adapt or anything. If you have a match of real players that are willing to fight tooth and nail for victory this game is probably an 8 or 9/10. But playing against AI feels like a tech demo, and if you can manage to wait for a lobby to fill up you're likely getting super high ranked and super low ranked, and even if the teams are balanced all you have to do is survive the meta 803AD attack and the enemy will forfeit.

Запомните это слово и не забывайте, так как ваш народ кроме этого почти ничего не знает)

Всем привет. Сегодня обзор на Northgard от 26.02.2024. 
Когда купил эту игру по скидке, думал очередная пародия на жанр РТС (стратегия в реал тайм), но как же я ошибался. Самый большой минус в этой игре, прям с старта, это донат. Тут слишком много кланов, которые ты покупаешь за реальную валюту. Даже поиграть тестово ты не можешь, чтобы просто посмотреть понравиться тебе клан или нет. 
НО!!
Зачем тебе покупать другой клан, если ты можешь играть на ванильном клане Оленя, который выносит всех вперёд ногами, достаточно посмотреть 1-2 гайда от опытных игроков. 

Игра очень хорошая для своего жанра, очень много зависит от логики и тактики игрока. Но тут есть сраный рандом. Ты можешь быть крутым стратегом, но НПС на волках так не думают и придут тебе через месяц втроём и заберут твою клетку. Драугры могут просто мигрировать, потому что захотели. А с гномами вообще не рекомендую селиться, такие твари, прям ФУ!

В игре присутствует сюжетная компания, которую я не проходил, но смотрел как этим занимался друг. Могу сказать, что кампания проходиться быстро, примерно за 20-30 часов. 
Так же есть возможность играть в рейтинг! Да, тут есть несколько режимов игры: можно играть в соло или в компании с друзьями, или вообще собрать своё лобби, где будет (например) 2 союзника и 4 врага.

Графика в игре хорошая, на средних компах выдаёт стабильные 150+ ФПС, на слабых около 40-60. И выглядит вполне хорошо. Музычка в этой игре даёт атмосферу прям хорошую) Без неё нельзя играть.

Всем любителям RTS рекомендую провести в этой игре хотя бы 30 часов, так как игра заслуживает этого.

Ставлю игре 7,5 / 10, так как игра немного избита донатом, а играть на стандартных кланах быстро надоедает!

Всем спасибо!

Pozitívumok:
+ Aki szerette annak idején a Settlers-sorozat 2-4. részét, az egyszerre fog nosztalgiát és újszerűséget tapasztalni.
+ Pont kellemesen közepesen összetett.
+ Rajzfilmszerű, de nem gyermeteg grafika.
+ Remek vikinges hangulat.
+ Az alapjáték 6 klánja remekül el lett találva. Kellően változatosak, de eddigi tapasztalataim alapján kiegyensúlyozottak.
+ A Rig's Saga kampány (az utolsó pár küldetésig) elég magával ragadó, kreatív kihívásokon keresztül tanítja meg a játék alapjait és az egyes klánok erősségeit.
+ Rengeteg DLC-klán, amik nem félnek extrém újításokat hozni a játékmenetbe.

Negatívumok:
- Az AI olyan buta, mint egy vödör darált bakancstalp, és ezen a nehézség állítása sem segít, mert az csak magának a térképnek a keménységét befolyásolja - amit a gépi ellenfél ugyanúgy elszenved és sokszor még annyira sem tud kezelni, mint egy középhaladó játékos.
- Az alap kampány utolsó három küldetése kiábrándítóan könnyű és ingerszegény a meglehetősen izzasztó korábbi küldetések után.
- A sztori - bár a maga módján hangulatos, de - rendkívül érdektelen.
- Design tekintetében nem annyira változatosak a különböző klánok, mint mechanikában, és ugyanannak a skandináv falunak a látványa minden egyes játékban egy idő után egyhangúvá válik.",1708874077,1708874077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Northgard - по моему мнению одна из лучших современных RTS. 
В первую очередь, я хочу выразить благодарность Shiro Games, которые продолжают из года в год поддерживать свой проект, при этом стараясь прислушаться к игрокам, и не забывая добавлять новый контент. 
Я отыграл практически на всех кланах, могу сказать, что у каждого клана есть свои особенности которые приятно изучать и в последствии взаимодействовать, находя новые синергии и тактики. Проблема заключается лишь в том, что по факту, все новые кланы которые вводятся в игру недостаточно хорошо балансируются на релизе, а многие из них нерфят в последствии настолько сильно, что при игре в PVP игроками не выбираются и вовсе из-за недостаточной способности конкурировать с другими кланами.
Поэтому, если выбирать между PVP и PVE я выбираю второе. Ибо в онлайн играют в основном сильные игроки, которые давно покоряют онлайн режим и в особенности на метовых тактиках и кланах. Достаточно посмотреть какие гайды есть в интернете, чтобы понять как работает местный PVP режим. Разработчики и сейчас дорабатывают его, чтобы дать ему новое дыхание, так как судя по отзывам игроков онлайн у PVP подрядился.
Своим фаворитом из всех режимов игры,  я считаю - ""Завоевание"" именно он вдохнул для меня жизнь в эту игру. При игре вдвоем, данный режим еще лучше раскрывается. Но и тут есть проблемы, потому что боты не могут проходить некоторые миссии, из-за этого пропадает мотивация играть, так как победа достается слишком легко и без челенджа. Я предполагаю это будет пофикшено ближайшими патчами, так же как и сломанные сложности ботов.
Если вы подтяните своих друзей, сможете насладиться вместе PVE или PVP режимами.
Но напомню вам, так как это RTS - выигрывать будет тот, кто знает как правильно играть, быстро принимать решения и хорошо заниматься микро контролем. 
Огорчил меня тот факт, что после череды обновлений у меня сбросился прогресс по победам за разные кланы. Так же очень странным решением мне показалось, добавлять дополнительную одиночную компанию как отдельное DLC, даже несмотря на то, что вместе с ним идет клан Льва. 
Отдельно стоит сказать, что в игре присутствует мастерская Steam, где игроки могут выкладывать свои наработки и поддерживать проект, плюс к этому всему у игры есть открытая консоль и map editor, где каждый может попробовать себя в карто-строении и тонко настроить различные параметры под себя.
Резюмируя хочу сказать, что лично я планирую время от времени возвращаться в этот проект, особенно с выходами новых кланов. Игра подойдет тем кто хочет расслабиться и провести время со своими друзьями, а так же тем кто собирается попробовать себя в противоборстве с другими игроками за звание ""Самые быстрые пальцы"". Ну, а для того чтобы комфортно войти в игровой процесс представлена одиночная компания, которая выступает как введение в простой сюжет и ознакомление с разными стартовыми кланами. Вероятнее всего играя в PVE вы не будете обращать свой взор на баланс, и правильно сделаете, потому что в игре достаточно контента чтобы увлечь вас не на один десяток часов.

ENG
Northgard is, in my opinion, one of the best modern RTS games.
First of all, I want to express my gratitude to Shiro Games, who continue to support their project year after year, while trying to listen to the players, and not forgetting to add new content.
I played on almost all clans, I can say that each clan has its own characteristics that are pleasant to study and subsequently interact, finding new synergies and tactics. The only problem is that, in fact, all the new clans that are introduced into the game are not balanced well enough at release, and many of them are subsequently nerfed so much that when playing PVP, players are not chosen at all due to their insufficient ability to compete with other clans.
Therefore, if I choose between PVP and PVE, I choose the second. Because online games are played mainly by strong players who have long conquered the online mode and especially in meta tactics and clans. It’s enough to look at what guides are on the Internet to understand how the local PVP mode works. The developers are still finalizing it to give it a new lease of life, since judging by the feedback from players online, PVP has signed up.
I consider “Conquest” to be my favorite of all the game modes; it was the one that breathed life into this game for me. When playing together, this mode reveals itself even better. But there are problems here too, because bots cannot complete some missions, because of this, the motivation to play disappears, since victory is achieved too easily and without a challenge. I assume this will be fixed in the coming patches, as well as the broken difficulties of bots.
If you bring your friends along, you can enjoy PVE or PVP modes together.
But let me remind you, since this is an RTS, the winner will be the one who knows how to play correctly, make quick decisions and do good microcontrol.
I was upset by the fact that after a series of updates my progress on victories for different clans was reset. It also seemed to me a very strange decision to add an additional single player company as a separate DLC, even though the Lion clan comes with it.
Separately, it is worth saying that the game has a Steam workshop, where players can post their work and support the project, plus to all this, the game has an open console and a map editor, where everyone can try their hand at map building and fine-tune various parameters for themselves .
To summarize, I want to say that I personally plan to return to this project from time to time, especially with the release of new clans. The game is suitable for those who want to relax and spend time with their friends, as well as for those who are going to try themselves in competition with other players for the title of “Fastest Fingers”. Well, in order to comfortably enter the gameplay, a single company is presented, which acts as an introduction to the simple plot and familiarization with the different starting clans. Most likely, when playing PVE you will not pay attention to the balance, and rightly so, because the game has enough content to captivate you for more than a dozen hours.",1708459945,1708459945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,
