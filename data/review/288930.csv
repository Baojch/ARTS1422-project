Доволен ли я был игрой? К сожалению, не особо.

[list]
[*]Сюжет тут скомканный, местами непонятный и, главное, незаконченный. Из всей истории приятно удивил только [spoiler]твист, раскрывающий связь Роба с Гэвином и Алекс[/spoiler], а всё остальное вызвало скуку, т.к. [spoiler]посыл в виде прощения и смирения со своими ошибками[/spoiler] - больно избитый приём. Ну и многие вопросы [spoiler](например: что за призрак в начале находится в квартире Алекс? Действительно ли Лэнг больше не проснётся, как Алекс? Почему того изуродованного существа назвали Кассилем, чьё имя ранее упоминалось как автор некой книги? Почему все удивились, когда Кассиль решил помочь Алекс, но не помог Лэнгу?)[/spoiler] остались без ответов, в том числе и концовка, т.к. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/288930/discussions/0/2575445991818158396/]продолжение игры заморожено по причине серьёзной болезни разработчика[/url].

[*]Озвучка персонажей тут очень слабая. Например, вот настаёт достаточно эмоциональный момент, где надо выложиться на все сто, а по итогу актриса, озвучивающая главную героиню Алекс, не проживает реплику, а сдержанно её читает. И вот думается, что хуже не будет, но потом появляется Лэнг, которого озвучили ещё хуже. И к сожалению, остальных персонажей озвучили средне.

[*]Квестовая составляющая очень средне сделана: загадки крайне лёгкие, а сложно может быть, только если затупили в тех моментах, где решение очевидно, но для решения загадки нужен триггер в виде разговора с персонажем или совершения лишнего движения. Ну и как окажется, многие предметы в инвентаре - мусор.

[*]Мистическая и таинственная атмосфера работает вроде бы и есть, но ощущается она лишь в паре моментов (особенно ближе к концовке). В большинстве случаев, будет ощущение, что вы играете в обычный квест.

Несмотря на свою малую продолжительность (3 часа), ""The Charnel House Trilogy"" - проходной и незаконченный квест, который вызывает смешанные эмоции.

The Charnel House Trilogy, несмотря на довольно громкое заявление о трилогии, это небольшой хоррор-квест на пару часов. Негативный отзыв ей не хочется ставить за правильную сюрреалистическую атмосферу, неплохие диалоги и озвучку, сносный пиксель-арт, и удачные попытки в метафоричность.

Но что касается самой игры, то она очень камерная, тесная, прямолинейная и крайне простая. Когда я увидел в титрах должность Дизайнер загадок, невольно подумалось, каких-таких загадок? Я вот не встретил пройдя на все достижения никаких загадок. Ясно, что имелись ввиду геймплейные задачи, но игра практически ведёт тебя за ручку, и с тем же успехом это могла быть визуальная новелла, а не Point&Click квест.

В сумме мне игра скорее понравилась, но она не чувствуется обособленной, полной. Она ощущается как какой-то пролог к другой игре, более крупной и масштабной, опять же, учитывая, что сюжет тут не заканчивается как таковой. У неё есть демоверсия, но она и сама как демоверсия. Не знаю, является ли следующая игра студии продолжением этой (видимо нет), но её сложно прям порекомендовать к прохождению, в то же время сама её сносность отрицательный отзыв оставить не позволяет.",1708581310,1708582807,True,4,0,0.574169397354125977,0,True,False,False,True,,,

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I had this in my backlog for some time and was admittedly apprehensive starting it, Metacritic being quite harsh on it and all. But I am glad I finally did, as I played the whole game in one sitting (less than 3 hours, but still).

The story was crazy and a bit all over the place, in the sense that I was never really quite sure what the fuck was going to happen next. I guess that was the point, really, as it mirrored the character's progression as well. The atmosphere was fantastic. Loved the train setting and the mystery aspects. Alex, the main character, was perfectly voiced. Really good job. I also liked Don, the doctor and ""Floyd"" (whose voice I seemed to recognize from a number of Wadjet Eye games, especially the great Technobabylon). Some side characters, especially Alex' friends, were rough, though. The audio quality was bad, as if they recorded this with subpar audio equipment. Luckily their involvement in the story was small, so ultimately it did not detract from the rest.

The revelations, at least some of them, were truly horrific and creepy. I wonder if there were some choices involved that would have affected the outcome and what became of some of the characters, so I might need to catch up a guide or a YT video. The game goes to some dark places with revelations about [spoiler]Lydia and Gavin[/spoiler], respectively and more than that.

In the end I am not philosophical or smart enough to truly understand all (or even most) of the metaphors in the game, but I will say that from beginning to end I was really hooked.

[h3]Pro:[/h3]
- Un comparto grafico dall'evidente impegno di base (sebbene resti dell'idea che ai protagonisti si sarebbe dovuto almeno ""appesantire"" gli outfits, per la scena in cui aspettano il treno...)
- La buona ricostruzione geografica
- Il comparto sonoro fa discretamente la sua parte
- Gameplay tutto sommato passabile
- La forte tensione comportata da svariati, EFFICACISSIMI passaggi (tutto il capitolo Sepulchre, in particolare... ragazzi, LA CLAUSTROFOBIA)
- L'antagonista principale risulta effettivamente inquietante...

[h3]Contro:[/h3]
-... almeno finchè non svela cos'abbia fatto al ragazzo di Alex (che francamente non è molto meno ridicolo di quanto So-yeong minacciasse di fare a quell'idiota di Young-cheol in... [url= https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198985448870/recommended/1544540?snr=1_5_9__402][i]Alone[/i][/url]...)
- Un ammasso di personaggi che è ben poco definire insipidi
- Atmosfera ben approfondita nella componente gotica, ma poco in quella più fumettistica
- I dialoghi risultano spesso tanto artificiosi in quanto a forma che, se non mi fossi documentato abbastanza da (credere di) sapere che sia un gioco ""made in UK"", mi verrebbe da sospettare che la prima lingua del team alla sua base tutto sia fuorché l'inglese
- Doppiaggio altalenante fra il passabile e il ridicolo, che certo non aiuta quanto di cui sopra
- Il secondo capitolo, per quanto efficace, sembra davvero ficcato a forza tra Inhale ed Exhale (e diciamo che sia stato illuminante, scoprire che fosse inizialmente stato pubblicato come gioco a sè stante...)
- Uno sviluppo narrativo letteralmente troncato, che risente dell'essere una merissima introduzione a qualcosa che ormai dubito che si farà mai (e che io, a ogni buon conto, ho già aspettato fin troppo a lungo), senza a cui il tutto lascia lo stesso sgradevole retrogusto con cui si termina un film come The Turning
- Il messaggio di fondo alla vicenda, a causa degli ultimi due punti, risulta così a dir poco incomprensibile
- Più che un allaccio all'improbabile seguito di cui sopra, la scenetta dopo i titoli di coda dà l'impressione di essere una scrausissima pubblicità

[h3]Extra (privo d'influenza sul giudizio complessivo):[/h3]

본편 내용은 유령 열차에서 벌어지는 미스터리한 이야기인데. 배경이 열차로 한정되어 있고. 이동 가능한 장소가 극히 제한되어 있으며, 상호 작용 가능한 오브젝트도 몇 개 없어서 자유도가 너무 떨어진다. 미스터리 풀이 요소도 부족하고 퍼즐 요소도 거의 없는 수준이라서 포인트 앤 클릭 어드벤처의 탈을 쓴 비주얼 노벨 같은 느낌이다.

게임 스토리도 완결은 고사하고, 사건의 진상이 제대로 밝혀지지 않은 채 끝나는데. 대놓고 후속작을 암시해서, 다음에 나올 속편이 메인이고. 본작은 프리퀄에 가까운데 그 속편의 개발 프로젝트가 공중분해된지 오래라서, 결국 하나의 온전한 게임이 되지 못하고 미완성된 게임으로 남는 작품이다.

[b]Geschichte[/b]

Wir spielen Alex Davenport, eine junge Frau, alleine, seit sie mit ihrem Freund Gavin Schluss gemacht hat. Sie begibt sich auf eine Zugfahrt, die sich immer mehr surreal, wie ein Traum, anfühlt.

Aber erst da, im dritten und längsten Teil hat mich die Geschichte gefesselt. Der gesamte zweite Teil über spielen wir einen Passagier, der mit Alex in den Zug gestiegen ist, was dem Spannungsbogen m.M.n. nicht gut tut.

In dieser Geschichte voller symbolträchtiger Ereignisse und Objekte ist nichts gewiss und lassen Raum für fundierte oder weniger fundierte Vermutungen was los ist. Ein Traum? Einbildung? Meine Vermutung (die ich nicht alleine habe) lasse ich mal weg.

Letztlich wird man wohl mit einer Ungewissheit übr die Geschehnisse und Zusammenhänge leben müssen. Ein bißchen zu vage, nach meinem Geschmack, aber vielleicht habe ich auch nicht alles genau genug mitbekommen. An sich aber gut gemacht, wenn man mit solcher vagen, düsteren, morbiden Stimmung klar kommt.

Also das darüber nachdenken, was eigentlich los ist, ist so der Hauptgrund für mich, das Spiel gut zu finden. Das erzeugt auch eine gewisse Spannung.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Es ist ein klassisches Point&Click mit kleinem Inventar und was halt so dazu gehört. Ein paar Dialoge ab und an, nichts kompliziertes, eher interessantes. Alles spielt sich auf kleinem Raum ab, meistens in dem Zug, und der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist gering.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891502244
[b]Technik[/b]

Ich weiss nicht, welche Technik hier zum Einsatz kommt aber es wirkt so, als wäre es aus den früheren 1990ern. Zumindest grafisch, bei einer Auflösung von 320x200 Pixel wie bei dem C64.

OK, es gibt viele Spiele dieser Sorte, die neu herauskommen, aber ich verstehe es einfach nicht, was daran toll sein soll. So ist es für mich ein Punkt, der einfach das Spielvergnügen senkt.

Der Sound dagegen ist sehr gut. Besonders fällt positiv die Vertonung aller Dialoge auf. In Englisch, teils mit wohl britischem Akzent und Slang, aber wunderbar gesprochen, so dass ich (der Text wird ja auch mit angezeigt) alles verstanden habe.

Die Steuerung ist zum Glück recht modern, also wirklich ein Point&Click, das mit der Maus bedienbar ist. Die Dialoge sind abkürzbar, was für einen zweiten Durchgang sehr gut ist.

[b]Sonstiges[/b]

Ich habe 2h für einen Durchgang benötigt.

Die Errungenschaften sind relativ einfach, wenn man sich alles gründlich anschaut. Es kann dennoch hilfreich sein, ab und an abzuspeichern, um nicht alles nochmal durchspielen zu müssen. Für die paar wenigen verpassten Errungenschaften habe ich so nur noch wenige Minuten dranhängen müssen.

[code][b]In Zahlen für mich persönlich ein Unterhaltungswert von 8/10.[/b][/code]

Ein kurzes surreales Point&Click-Adventure mit gut vertonten Dialogen. Nach meinem Geschmack aber miserable Grafik (Pixel-Art eben).

Und besonders, wenn es so eine höchst interessante Fahrt wird. Da gibts wirklich einiges geboten:
Nen alten Zug, richtig schön Orient Express artig aufgemacht mit einer Dampflok, die sich schnaufend und schwerfällig vorwärts pflügt durch die einsame schneebedeckte Landschaft... einfach wunderbar atmosphärisch ist das, die Flocken tanzen im Wind, kleben an den Scheiben und hauchen ihr federleichtes Leben aus, nur um als kleiner unscheinbarer Tropfen wiedergeboren zu werden. Schön, schön...
Das hat schon was und vor allem gibts auch im Innern des Zuges einiges zu sehen... natürlich abgesehen vom edlen und wunderschön altbackenen Interieur. 
Doch bevor wir aufbrechen, machen wir das, was jeder Reisende gern tut, vor allem, wenn die Zeit unbarmherzig im Nacken sitzt - einen kleinen Abstecher nämlich.

Also, los gehts: Und zwar im Apartment von Alex Davenport. Die junge Frau hat gerade ihren untreuen Freund abserviert und schlägt die Zeit tot, als eine traurige Pflicht sie nach Hause, auf die Insel Augur Peak, ruft.
Gesagt getan, bei der missgünstigen Gelegenheit kann man wenigstens noch eine alte Freundin besuchen, um den Schmerz der familiären Mühsal ein wenig zu lindern.

Und für die Reise besteigen wir eben jenen uralten, ehrwürdigen und höchst eleganten Zug.

Hier beginnt die Geschichte dann wirklich. Während wir auf den Bahnsteig noch Dr. Harold Lang kennen lernen, einen Archäologen mit gleichem Ziel wie unseres, geht die noch gar nicht wilde Fahrt auch schon los.
Und da herrscht erstmal Langeweile. In einem Anflug von Selbstlosigkeit haben wir Harold unser einziges Buch überlassen und so dreht Alex erstmal Däumchen und wir steuern von nun an den besagten Herrn Doktore...

Und jetzt hör ich auch sofort auf zu spoilern, denn so lang ist das Game nicht, ein paar wenige Stündchen hält das Vergnügen bloß an, da wäre es ja gemein, Dir alles schon vorweg zu nehmen.
Im dritten Kapitel lenken wir wieder Alex´ Geschicke, soviel sei verraten und vielleicht noch, dass die Rätselkost nicht hammerhart knobelig ist, sondern eher seicht im Hintergrund bleibt. Denn hier gehts um eine große Geschichte und die steht für sich.

Und was unsere beiden Reisenden auf ihrer beschaulichen Fahrt aufs entlegene Eiland erleben, grenzt an Wunder und Wahnsinn gleichermaßen.
Die Geschichte entspinnt sich sachte und zaghaft, baut mehr und mehr Steine aus Emotion, wirrer Psyche und Fantastik aufeinander bis hin zu einem leicht okkulten Crescendo aus krassen Twists und irren Überraschungen.
Und nein, es ist kein Jumpscare Festival und nochmal nein, es ist auch kein wirklich wahrer Horror. Jedenfalls keiner, der vordergründig ins Gesicht spring und laut: ""Buh!"", schreit. 

Hier regieren Psychologische Kniffe und die bravourös gespielte Klaviatur der emotionalen Aufs und Abs das Geschehen und damit packt die Story uns an den verletzlichsten Punkten. Familie, Freundschaft, Verrat, Verlust, Trauer und Wehmut wechseln sich minutiös getimed ab, bis am Ende Ratlosigkeit herrscht und Leere.

Drei Enden danach, denn das Game setzt immer nochmal einen drauf, klärt sich dann doch fast alles auf, aber ein beklemmendes Gefühl der Verunsicherung bleibt. 
Was war real?
Was nur ein Traum?
Was kann noch Wirklichkeit werden?
Und was bleibt frommer Wunsch und größte Furcht?

Tja und mit all diesen Fragen und noch vielen, vielen mehr lässt Dich das Spiel dann allein und so darfst Du endlich mal wieder noch ein bisschen im Dunkeln sitzen und über ein Spiel nachdenken im Nachgang. Hat man ja selten genug, sowas und deshalb ists einer besonderen Erwähnung wert.

Dass die Grafik selbst für Pixel Art altbacken wirkt, der Sound aber dezent und höchst stimmungsvoll daherkommt, trägt mehr zur Atmo bei, als das es schaden würde. 
Was hier wirklich zählt ist, neben der tollen Vertonung auf englisch, der Einsatz von Bild und Symbol-Sprache und der ist, vorsichtig ausgedrückt: GENIAL!

Hab ich sehr selten erlebt, dass ich so derart oft stutzen und kurz überlegen musste und vor allem auch wollte.
Für so ein kleines Spiel steckt hier wirklich eine Menge drin, ich würds Dir zu gerne alles aufdröseln, aber dann mach ich Dir den Zauber echt kaputt.

Also was bleibt Dir also übrig?
Richtig!
Für die monströse Summe von siebzig Cent (!!!!!) mi Sale kannst Du selbst abtauchen in diese eigenartige, aber faszinierende Welt und eine wundervoll entschleunigte Reise antreten.
Eine Reise mit einem alten Zug vordergründig , die hintergründig und auf endlosen Metaebenen für so so soooo viele andere Reisen steht, vielleicht sogar für die allerletzte und sogar noch eine danach... ;-)

Und auch wenn eine Zugfahrt immer lustig ist, wird diese vielleicht ein bisschen nachdenklicher.
Gut so, in diesem Fall ist das eine willkommene Abwechslung.
Und deshalb wünsch ich Dir beim Nachsinnen, beim Grübeln, beim Knobeln, beim leicht Gruseln und bei einer emotionalen Achterbahnfahrt im Zug wie immer...

... viel Spaß  ;-)

It's clear that the game has very few resources to work with: voice acting, environmental variety, animations and detailing are all scarce and basic. However, that doesn't mean that they are subpar. Instead, what makes the beauty of this game is how it uses its limited resources to their full potential. It's a quality that shows a great sense of craft and it works to make a story full of tension and concepts designed to make you uneasy.

Take the corridor. A lot of the game takes place walking up and down the same corridor, directed as you are by the game's prompts. It's something that should get old fast, and it almost does, but as the narrative really picks up you're always met with something new at the end of that corridor. Because of that, even though it's the same art asset and the same walking animation carrying you back and forth, the corridor becomes an area of anticipation. It's not just wasted space; it's where you think about what you just encountered, and also where you wonder what is to come. 

Nearly every aspect of this game is used like this, every asset maximised, no excess allowed. As such the story becomes very lean, with every thread being tied together and every occurance having a potential meaning. It's an elegant creation, overall, even with all of its flaws. Because it's still a fact that the voice acting sounds like it was recorded with a can and a string, that puzzles require more iteration than thought and that some dialogue is quite overdramatic, both in terms of writing and how it's acted out.

Серьезно. Не знаю.

Сперва про историю. Ближе к концу у меня было стойкое ощущение, что люди, создавшие The Charnel House Trilogy, имеют самые прямые родственные связи с разработчиками мало любимой мной Kathy Rain или ими являются. Тот же наркоманское сбивчивое повествование, в основе которого лежит саморефлексия, сложности с родителями и личной жизнью, и все это завуалировано бесконечными аллегориями и метафорами. Даже героиня чем-то внешне похожа, а в инвентаре у нее - сигареты и зажигалка, прямо как у Той Самой.

Начало и развитие сюжета смущают. Вообще складывается ощущение, что сценарист не знал, что делать с сюжетом, так и не понял, что хочет сказать, потому как происходящие события слабо коррелируют с основной идеей и очень поверхностно к ней прикручены. При этом повествование выстроено так, что все сюжетные повороты угадываются заранее, не знаю уж, намеренно или случайно.

В конце, вроде, проникаешься происходящим. И пусть почти все угадывается игроком, но развязка все равно небезуспешно прикидывается эффектной, начинает казаться, что вся история-то и неплохая. Отчасти так и есть, но все портит, повторюсь, слабая связь с основной идеей [spoiler]поезда смерти[/spoiler]. Стоит начать задаваться вопросом ""А как и зачем все это именно здесь?"" и произведение в целом (как повествовательная сущность) перестает выдерживать критику. [spoiler]Идея самопознания на последнем пути мне ясна. Только здесь его нет. Здесь детективные расследования и срывы покровов с оставшейся в прошлом реальности, что очень сильно выбивается из общей картины и вызывает слишком много вопросов. Или что, вообще все окружение главной героини умерло и теперь рассказывает как оно было на самом деле? Али героиня настолько умна задним числом, что в посмертии раскрыла конкретные детали похищения своего бывшего? Не просто пришла к мысли об этом, но поняла, что и как ему там отрезали? Можно, конечно, предположить, что это домыслы главной героини, которая правильно разгадала суть, а подробности придумала сама, или высшие силы ей помогают. Да вот только намеков в игре на это нет, это даже не предположения, а чистые догадки. А когда объяснение основано не на сюжетных подсказках, когда оно сложнее поставленного вопроса, то это называется сюжетная дыра.[/spoiler]

Тем не менее, если оставить это упущение за скобками, можно словить определенный кайф. Плюс я, например, довольно долго размышлял над игрой, пытаясь понять, понравилось мне это или нет, что сделано удачно, а где допущены ошибки. Одно это говорит в пользу игры. Лучше быть неоднозначной, чем серой.

Что касается квестовой составляющей, то тут все скудно. Загадок мало, даже при этом умудрились запилить одну дурацко-нелогичную (благо, в игре мало предметов и локаций, поэтому долго страдать не будете). Много ходьбы туда-сюда, спасает только то, что в игре больше трех экранов не встретите.

Пиксель-арт нормальный, к музыке претензий не возникло.

Сама игра очень короткая, сюжетно представляет единый продукт, поэтому слово ""Trilogy"" не должно Вас обманывать: это просто три главы одной истории, а не три разных приключения, как изначально думал, например, я. Учитывайте, что это, со слов разработчика, - расширенный пролог к другой игре, которая уже 5 лет назад как обещана к выходу.

Мы имеем дело с простой (по механике) повествовательной игрой с иногда проскальзывающими элементами point and click. Неплохие идея и история, слабо связанные между собой, приятные пискель-арт и музыка оставляют ощущение фильма, у которого не было режиссера. Сложно придраться к чему-то по отдельности. Но когда всю эту махину собирает вместе, ты понимаешь, что шурупы забиты молотком, доски склеены дешевым клеем, а вот те провода, заизолированные скотчем, лучше вообще не трогать.",1645786068,1645786068,True,2,0,0.499299794435501099,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра вышла в Steam в апреле 2015 года и на данный момент имеет чуть менее 600 отзывов, по совокупности дающих ""очень положительный"" рейтинг. Какие неожиданности ожидают нас на этот раз - разбираемся ниже.[/code]

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СЮЖЕТ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Перед нами - очередное творение Owl Cave, ранее уже успевших заиметь минуту славы благодаря своему творению ""Richard and Alice''. Собственно, The Charnel House Trilogy, вышедшая в Steam год спустя, в некотором роде продолжает традиции студии. 

По сюжету нам предстоит примерить на себя роль двух совершенно разных персонажей - студентки по имени Алекс Дэйвенпорт, а также умудренного опытом доктора (археологических наук) Харольда Лэнга. Судьба сводит незнакомцев в одном поезде, на котором обоим героям истории необходимо будет добраться до некоего места под названием Авгуров Пик. 

История не просто так называется Trilogy: сюжет здесь разбит на три условных главы. В первой, ""Вдох"", мы знакомимся с Алекс и узнаем некоторые подробности о её личной жизни, характере и причинах отправиться в дальнее путешествие. Затем фокус внимания переключается на доктора Лэнга. О нем нам расскажут не так уж и много, и большая часть истории от его лица породит куда больше вопросов, нежели ответов. И закончится все в главе ""Выдох"", где нас снова вернут к студентке Алекс, и безумие сюжета развернется в полную силу. 

К слову, как и в ""Richard and Alice"", здесь история происходит зимой. Персонажи мерзнут и порой даже обеспокоенно задаются вопросом ""закончится ли эта зима"", в связи с чем невольно приходит мысль, что действие обеих игр, пускай и в разный период времени, вполне может происходить в одном и том же игровом мире. Но это только мои домыслы. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

По части игрового процесса  The Charnel House Trilogy представляет собой интерактивую историю с элементами point and click. Большая частью игры проходит в различных диалогах, где персонажи ведут длинные беседы, из которых мы будем складывать полноценную картину произошедших событий. Дабы игроки совсем уж не заскучали, периодически нас будут тормошить, поручая выполнить какую-нибудь задачу, подразумевающую нахождение определенного предмета или выполнение каких-либо действий с содержимым инвентаря. 

Благодаря тому, что история подается нам от лица разных персонажей, игрок будет иметь возможность рассмотреть одну и ту же ситуацию с нескольких точек зрения. Линия доктора археологии, конечно, вносит куда больше сумятицы, чем ясности, но в некоторых местах при игре за Алекс ты уже будешь примерно понимать, что и как обстоит на деле. 

Графически игра выглядит достаточно простовато, однако именно в этом простом антураже и кроется основной шарм. Стоит отметить, что здесь весьма атмосферное звуковое сопровождение, а многочисленные монологи и беседы героев озвучены актерами на вполне достойном уровне. Сюжет выполнен в весьма драматично-глубоких тонах, по сути производя впечатление эдакого фильма ужасов без резких пугающих сцен. Основная изюминка здесь именно в постепенном нагнетании обстановки безысходности и абсурдности происходящего, и попытках все-таки найти какой-то выход. В наличии имеется набор достижений Steam, однако русский язык по-умолчанию не предусмотрен, и это один из тех случаев, когда без хорошего знания заморской мовы делать в игре нечего. Поэтому, если собираетесь ознакомиться, либо найдите русификатор, либо готовьтесь сидеть со словарем, ибо основной шарм The Charnel House Trilogy именно в понимании происходящего вокруг.

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Время полного прохождения - почти 4 часа игрового времени. По итогу, могу сказать, что The Charnel House Trilogy в первую очередь подойдет скорее даже не любителям квестов, а именно тем, кто больше по части визуальных новелл. В игре очень много диалогов, с которым интересно знакомиться, если Вам нравится нечто подобное. В то же время, сам по себе сюжет довольно безрадостный и трагичный, поэтому, если ищете что-то веселое и доброе - смело проходите мимо. Если же вы готовы окунуться в омут безнадеги и чувствуете в себе силы пройти его до конца - игра Вам наверняка понравится. Но решать уже Вам самим.

Не успел я пройти один пиксельный квест, как мне подогнали ещё один ([spoiler]спасибочки[/spoiler]).

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[b]+ Дизайн.[/b] Как по мне, эта игра не стремится прикидываться проектом из конца прошлого века, напротив этот нарочитый пиксельный стиль призван создать определённое настроение, которое поможет лучше погрузиться в историю.
[b]+ История.[/b] А она полна интриг и непоняток. В первых двух главах вообще мало что понятно, что происходит, но потом постепенно и весьма необычным способом нам раскрывают практически все тайны...
[b]+ Сюрреализм.[/b] ...но делают это весьма иносказательным и метафоричным способом. [spoiler]Был ли это сон героев или это банальное безумие, или действительно какое-то мистическое место?[/spoiler] Сложно, не понятно. Но, возможно, это и не так уж и плохо...

[h1]Нейтрально:[/h1]
[b]+/- Музыка и звук.[/b] Приятные, но в целом ничего особенного или запоминающегося. Хотя, справедливости ради, следует отметить, что два трека из титров весьма недурны. Но ради этого покупать саундтрек, который дороже самой игры, уж точно плохая затея.
[b]+/- Лишние предметы.[/b] Мне встретились предметы, которые можно складировать в инвентарь, но их так и не удалось их никуда применить. Не совсем понятно для чего они, запутать игрока?
[b]+/- Продолжительность.[/b] Игра проходится за 2-3 часа. Для игры на вечер - в самый раз, поэтому не нужно ожидать чего-то большего. Поэтому строго советую брать исключительно по скидке.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1] 
[b]- Напролом.[/b] Хоть игра и достаточно короткая (на главу уходит 30-50 мин.), но сохранения всё же не помешали бы.
[b]- Пафос.[/b] Местами складывается ощущение, что эта маленькая камерная история слишком много на себя берёт. Например, назвать целостную историю о трёх главах трилогией - не перебор?

[b] Eine Trilogie für einen Abend: [/b]      
“The Charnel House Trilogy” klingt nach einer Trilogie und somit erstmal gewaltig vom Umfang. Denkt man an Point and Click Adventure-Trilogien, bei denen jeder Teil mindestens 10 Stunden Spielzeit umfasst und somit locker auf 30 Stunden Spielspaß oder mehr kommt, ist das hier alles klein und beschaulich. Es handelt sich um ein Mini-Adventure mit drei kleinen Episoden. Nach 2 bis 3 Stunden ist das Spiel auch schon vorbei. 

[b] Geschichte und Atmosphäre: [/b]      
Wir spielen 3 kurze Episoden, mit folgenden Namen “inhale” (einatmen), “Sepulchre” (Grab) und “exhale” (ausatmen). 

In der Episode “inhale” spielen wir die junge Frau Alex Davenport. Diese Episode spielt sich in dem Apartment von Alex ab. Bei Episode 2 steuern wir den Charakter Doktor Harold Lang, dieser Teil spielt in einem Zug. In selbigen Zug spielt sich auch die letzte Episode ab, in der wir wieder die Geschicke von Alex übernehmen. 

Das Spiel insgesamt hat eine bedrückende und leicht gruselige Atmosphäre. Es ist kein echter Horror, sondern eine eher subtilere und beklemmende Schauergeschichte.  

[b] Interpretation: [/b]      
Die Geschichte bietet einigen Interpretationsspielraum. Was ist real, was Fiktion, Traum oder gar Wahnvorstellung? Mir ist es bis zum Schluss nicht klar geworden, ob es hier um eine paranoide Psychose, eine Vergangenheitsbewältigung, um eine wie auch immer geartete psychische wahnhafte Vorstellung oder vielleicht einen Alptraum handelt. Vermutlich soll der Spieler im Vagen verbleiben und sich eben darüber den Kopf zerbrechen. 

Viele Bilder, Symbole bzw. Metaphern deuten auf eine Enge und Beklemmung hin, wie lebendig begraben zu werden. In einem engen Raum eingepfercht zu sein, mit wenig Chancen auf eine Flucht oder Ausweichmöglichkeit. Das Gefühl einer Situation nicht entkommen zu können. Dazu dienen wohl auch die begrenzt großen Schauplätze. Eine Wohnung, ein Zug, diverse Koffer, von Erde erdrückt und umschlossen zu werden, nicht atmen können. 

Welche Botschaft das Spiel damit genau vermitteln möchte und ob es tatsächlich einen tieferen Sinn hat und sich auf einer Metaebene abspielt, oder nur pseudointellektuell daherkommt und mit einem Psycho-Wirrwarr den Spieler konfus machen will, das ist mir schleierhaft geblieben.  

[b] Grafik / Ton / Rätsel: [/b]     
Eine sehr ansprechende Pixel-Optik, die mich überzeugt hat. Bei einem Blick aus dem Fenster wurde mir klar, was diese Pixelgrafik im Stande ist darzustellen. Der Spielcharakter spiegelt sich halb transparent im Fensterglas, während man draußen die verregnete Szenerie beobachten kann. Vom Künstler ist das handwerklich einfach gut gemacht. 

Es gibt eine englische Sprachausgabe, die vermutlich auch nicht schlecht ist. Der Akzent des Zugschaffners war mir zu übertrieben und für mich als Deutscher überhaupt nicht einzuordnen. Zudem wurde mir persönlich in den Dialogen viel zu viel geflucht, was mit zunehmender Spielzeit auch immer schlimmer und inflationärer eingesetzt wird. Wenn in jedem zweiten Satz “f**k” fällt, finde ich das weder besonderes authentisch und lebensnah, sondern schlicht störend und übertrieben. Vielleicht leidet Alex aber auch einfach nur am Tourettesyndrom. 

Da es weder eine deutsche Sprachausgabe, noch deutsche Untertitel gibt, kann es natürlich auch sein, dass ich einfach manche Dinge und den tieferen Sinn nicht verstanden habe. Das Durchspielen ist aufgrund sprachlicher Barrieren allerdings nicht gefährdet, da es kaum klassische Point and Click Rätsel gibt und das Spiel somit einen sehr leichten Schwierigkeitsgrad hat. 

[b] Fazit: [/b]      
Ein Spiel mit Schaueratmosphäre für einen Abend, welches bewusst oder unbewusst den Spieler mit einigen Fragezeichen zurücklässt.

The game seems to think it's more mysterious than it is, ultimately I would more describe it as weirdness for weirdness' sake. The gameplay is shallow, which is fine as it's obviously not the focus, but instead of adding tension the puzzles and walking made the game feel tedious when I beat it in just over an hour. Walking back and forth comes second to dialogue as far as time invested goes. 

Most voice acting was fine, Rob sucked as most people could probably guess by seeing the voice credits, but the writing is a constant let down. This is at its worst (for me at least) during the comparatively lighthearted intro, with name drops and a general over aggrandization of video game culture, specifically video game review culture. Later on it improves when I don't have to listen to the protagonist calling someone a ""douchecanoe"" or Stirling saying anything. 

The game all but sits you down to explain the major plot points right at the end, there isn't a complete lack of progression up until that point, but that info is of a completely different ilk. Outside of some visuals and general eccentricity it's easy to forget that this is a horror game until the end as the atmosphere isn't supported by things being different when you walk into a different room. Maybe the plot was getting at a deep meaning, but it makes more sense that it follows in the pulp horror tradition that it references in an in-game book. Being weird and overly grotesque to garner attention. 

The art and music are nice, but with the second and third episodes sharing the exact same setting it gets old. If you're a fan of people listed in the credits or of schlocky horror and pixel art then you might enjoy your time, especially on sale.

It is not my preferred genre but this game did what I prefer which is have a strong narrative and not have convoluted puzzles. Not once did I feel like having to randomly combine items to progress. The story was creepy and full of lore and great characters. The voice acting was superb aside from the voices of Carli and Sofia whose voices felt like they were not recorded properly. Everyone else was fantastic. There were a few points that lacked a detailed explanation but I have my own theories and sometimes that is just as good. The first episode was fairly good and served to set things up. The second episode felt a bit weak but wasn’t bad. It had a lot of backtracking and the less interesting of the stories. It was still better than some point and click games I have played. The third episode was the best and really ended on a high note with some big reveals.

	I played The Charnel House Trilogy on Linux using Valve’s Proton. It crashed if I used version 5.13-6 but when I switched to the experimental branch it worked. I did have to choose “Setup” and then “save and run” even with the experimental branch though. If I just chose to run it without setup it would never launch. There are three settings to tinker with. Overall it is pixel graphics so don’t expect to be amazed. You can manually save whenever you want. Alt-Tab works.

	I got vibes of Event Horizon and Cthulhu from this game and I say that with a compliment. The story and voice acting make the game and the game play was an enjoyable experience that avoided common pitfalls of the genre. I paid $0.87 for this and Richard and Alice as a bundle so I guess you could say I paid $0.44 CAD for it. It is worth the full current price of $6.49 CAD in my eyes. I finished all three episodes in a total of two hours and forty minutes. It felt like a good length although a bit more time to add some detail in would have been nice as well.

Owl Cave were pretty well aware of point-and-click tropes, and the trilogy plays like a best-hits album of early-2000s Point'n'Click gameplay, getting in a couple of decent jabs and references at genre classics as they go. The writing is also pretty solid- The dialogue is pretty believable most of the time (and while we're at this, most of the voice performances are pretty solid, especially the two playable protagonists), and the plot is intriguing, but raises a lot more questions than it answers. Nonetheless, the mystery of Augur Peak is built up wonderfully, winding in on itself in layers, and it's pretty compelling if you can accept it for the incomplete work (or prelude to a work that was never made) that it is.

I can say ""Incomplete work"" pretty safely, too, because the third chapter ends with a teaser for another game in the Augur Peak series, one meant to pick up the plot threads established by Charnel House and, presumably, explore the forces responsible for these strange events. That game is teased with a release window of ""2016"", and as of late December 2020, that game doesn't seem to exist. At the end of the day, that's the biggest problem with Charnel House- it's an incomplete work. There's real potential in this writing, in the characters and scenario, but another Augur Peak game was never made, so that potential is just sitting here, untapped (or at least unrefined), on display for anyone willing to buy the Charnel House Trilogy.

So, as scripts go, that was very good (though with some caveats; see below). The dialogue is largely natural, and the story is a mixture between ""Silent Hill"" and a pulp thriller, with plenty of twists and turns. Atmosphere is top-notch, art is great, acting is good. But:

Caveat (1):
It's not much of an adventure game. In its last act, especially, it just tells you what to do. That's not good. Egregious is how the dialogue can fill up five or six lines on-screen at times, or go on for > 5, 6 exchanged lines without giving you options on how to respond. This is a cardinal adventure game sin; in something like ""Monkey Island,"" you can usually respond after a couple of lines of dialogue. 

Caveat (2):
Characters alone on screen take a very hamfisted approach to exposition, talking to themselves as part of cutscenes to dole out information. It almost put me off the game.

Caveat (3):
There's sequel bait at the end. It kinda ends, don't get me wrong, but one line and one scene go unexplained. As to where the sequel is? Goodness knows.

But it's a good game, overall. It feels weirdly like a Wadjet Eye game, and I can see the usual crew was on it (there are a few properties to Wadjet Eye games: certain art styles in the portraits, animations, Abe Goldfarb inevitably appearing; there's even a joke about Dave Gilbert).

Proof, yet again, that with a great story, great (and I mean GREAT) voice acting, great ambience music and a couple of good ol' pixels you can make it all. From the very first minutes of this game (it is called a Trilogy, but it is in fact a whole game divided into sort of three acts), if you're a veteran, you can tell the small hints (or at least it's how I saw it) to the classic adventure The Longest Journey: from Alex's striking physical similarity to April (even her outfit, hair and necklace), to her phone being a Crow, to her random comments on objects when you click over them (heck, even the inventory sound is almost identical to The Longest Journey's).

The voice acting is also really good didn’t feel wooden at all. The puzzles were nice, not too hard to figure out. The levels/background were nice to look at, pretty well detailed for a pixel graphics game. 

Now the two best things in the game were one the characters, they were very good and interesting even the minor characters were quite interesting. And number two the story is really good and it has a great build up and that is all I am saying on that.

Now the dislikes. And there are only four things to dislike, one is there is a bug in the game were the music lags/ repeats, like if you are saving the game or going into a new area, but it does fix itself in a few seconds.

Two, the game does end on a cliff hanger, but I have read that a sequel to the game is coming soon, so that's good. Three, the game is kind of short and can be beaten in about two hours. And lastly four the game’s price is a bit high for such a short game.

As far as Point and Click goes, it's fairly straightforward, though I seem to have missed a few achievements so there's a little more to it. But it is quite linear and not very difficult, which I enjoy. Not a fan of the ones that require you to find five items all over a huge map, and somehow figure out they all go together to open one storm drain. With CHT, your objectives are clearly laid out and the solutions aren't brain teasers.

As far as horror goes, I wouldn't really call it horror. More of a thriller with definitely creepy and somewhat gory (mostly in the text, some visually) elements. No jump scares or anything like that. Just a very moody and creepy tale about relationships, life and death, and reality.

I really recommend this, though I do have one gripe -- there's no sequel!

An interesting tale, more visual novel than point and click adventure, that took me around 90 minutes to complete.  There's almost no challenge to the puzzles given how small each area is, how much inventory you get, and how everything is telegraphed.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll probably be disappointed.

Overall, this feels more like a demo reel than a full game, an opportunity to show off what the team can do in the hopes of pulling in a larger deal. It's called a trilogy, but really it's one story in three parts, which gives you a taste of the weird world and ends.  I can't help but think there was a longer game planned than just kept getting cut shorter as the budget dwindled and deadline approached.

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen 3 Geschichten die aber eigentlich nur Eine ist bzw. zusammengefügt wird. Wir spielen 2 Charaktere ""Alex"" & ""Professor Harold Lang"". Beide haben anscheinend eine Düstere Vergangenheit, die sie auf eine gemeinsame Reise schickt

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Ein Klassisches Point & Click Adventure. Wir klicken auf verschiedene Orte & Gegenstände um mit diesen zu interagieren. Außerdem sammeln wir natürlich ein paar Gegenstände um diese dann später irgendwo zu benutzen. Das Spiel ist ziemlich Linear und man weiß eignetlich immer was man zu tun hat

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 18 Erfolge. Die meisten sind Story basierend und somit nicht verpassbar. Die verpassabren Erfolge sind aber auch recht Leicht zu bekommen, wenn man denn mit allen Gegenständen interagiert und alles ausprobiert (Es gibt aber auch einen sehr Hilfreichen Guide in der Community)

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Gute Story
+ Spannend
+ Gute Musik
+ Gut geschriebene Charaktere
+ Gutes Voice Acting
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein wirklich sehr Gut Gelungenes Point & Click Adventure. Das Spiel erzählt eine sehr Gute Geschichte, wo man auch noch nach dem durchspielen drüber Nachdenkt. Auf jeden Fall sehr zu Empfehlen

[i]Charnel House Trilogy[/i] opens to a title screen with a picture of three stacked books lit by soft lantern light while haunting classical-esque piano music plays. Any one of the three books can be clicked on to step into that part of the tale. Fans of recent years’ point-and-click releases can anticipate sinking into the comforting familiarity of the handiwork and voicework of genre names such as Abe Goldfarb, Ben Chandler, Ivan Ulyanov, and more.

[h1]The Titles - ""What’s in a name?""[/h1]
The game is broken into three ‘books’: [i]Inhale[/i], [i]Sepulchre[/i], and [i]Exhale[/i]. I’m assuming this is why the word ‘trilogy’ was included in the game’s title, although to me the short length makes calling it a trilogy a bit of a misnomer. Also, from a theming standpoint, it would have been more clever to give [i]Sepulchre[/i] a breathing-related title.

[h1]The Characters[/h1]
The main character for [i]Inhale[/i] and [i]Exhale[/i] is Alex Davenport. Since the player spends a lot more game time with Alex, it’s not surprising that you learn more about her. She’s a gamer and a reader going through a recent breakup. The main character for [i]Sepulchre[/i] is Harold Lang. He’s a professor of archaeology and a museum curator. It’s hard to get as much of a sense of his character since the player doesn’t spend as much time with him. Alex and Harold only have a brief interaction in game, although they are somehow mutually connected by Kat, Alex’s friend and Harold’s field assistant. Both of them are travelling to meet her. There’s also a cast of supporting characters such as Don (the train conductor), Rob (Alex’s neighbor), and Lydia (a little girl who is also on the train). Considering how quickly the game moves, it’s a testament to the game’s design that you learn as much about the characters as you do in such a short amount of time.

[h1]The Story - Build Up To Nothing[/h1]
[i]Charnel House Trilogy[/i] tries to explore lots of themes: archaeology, earth, death, worms. However, I don’t even think that you can call the game anticlimactic because it never builds up enough excitement to be a disappointing letdown. If it does build up anything, it’s loose ends. For example, what is the use of the green balloon? Was that meant to be used in the alternate endings that didn’t come to fruition? As it is, the single ending lacks closure and seems to imply that it isn’t the correct ending since multiple characters literally say it wasn’t supposed to happen this way.

The credits end with the statement, “Augur Peak will rise 2016.” Considering it’s now 2020, the developer website has many dead links, and I couldn’t find any whisper of news about the sequel, its imminent arrival does not seem promising. If it ever does get released, I will totally play it, but as it is, the fact that [i]Charnel House Trilogy[/i] spends so much time building up for a non-existent sequel weakens the game.

[h1]Art and Mechanics - Familiarity Breeds Contempt?[/h1]
The game has fairly standard retro pixel art and point-and-click mechanics for the genre. From what I saw, the game developers don’t seem to have tried anything innovative in terms of gameplay or anything interesting in terms of color theory, etc. The best that can be said for the puzzles is that they make sense in the story’s context. For example, the character had a good reason for needing to find something to trigger the memory of a forgotten password. The game even attempts to poke fun at the tendency of this genre to create overly elaborate solutions for puzzles. However, the joke falls short since there aren’t really any puzzles that you have to mentally wrestle to solve. Sometimes the next step is outright told to the player character, and even when it isn’t, there’s a miniscule set of options to try. Maybe to an inexperienced point-and-click player the puzzles would be more challenging.

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
It’s always a plus when there are missable achievements because it does add some replay value. In this case, however, even the achievements lack a certain verve.

[h1]Content to Price Ratio[/h1]
At $5.99 USD and 2 hours playtime, [i]Charnel House Trilogy[/i] technically meets my movie ticket rule of having enough content to be the length of a movie for a movie ticket price. That said, compared to other similarly priced games in the genre that offer more complete story arcs and more challenging puzzles to solve, it may be better to wait for a sale.

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]
Despite the delightful presence and involvement of point-and-click genre greats, [i]Charnel House Trilogy[/i] suffers from being overly familiar, lacking innovation, and being a set-up to, at the moment, nothing. That said, it’s a worthwhile game to scratch the point-and-click itch if picked up on sale. Happy gaming!",1580096525,1606278995,True,43,1,0.807644903659820557,11,True,False,False,False,,,

Ama %90 indirimle 1,5 tl gibi bir fiyata aldığınız zaman, ders arasında atıştırılan bir bisküvi/ kek gibi düşünerek oynarsanız pişman olmazsınız.

Ben de oyunu final haftam başlamadan önce biraz kafa dağıtmak için oynadım, kesinlikle de zaman ayırdığıma değdiğini düşünüyorum. Şimdi incelemeye geçelim...

The Charnel House Trilogy, 3 adet minik bölümden oluşan, pixel art kullanılarak yapılmış bir point & click adventure oyunu. Charnel House'ın anlamına bakarsanız zaten oyun hakkında genel bir fikir edinebilirsiniz. Menü ekranını açtığınızda gördüğünüz bölümlerin isimleri sırasıyla ""Inhale"", ""Sepulchre"" ve ""Exhale"". Yine buradan da nefes, kabir/ defnetmek vb. ""ölüm"" ile ilgili anlamlar çıkarmak mümkün. 

Başlangıçta dairesinde yalnız yaşayan, sıradan bir kızla ilgili bilgiler edinmemizi sağlayan oyunda, ilerledikçe bir yolculuğun, -creepy bir yolculuğun- bu kızın hayatındaki bilinmeyenleri açığa çıkarttığını görüyoruz. Ailesi, arkadaşları, eski sevgilisi, stalker'ı, trene binmeden önce lafladığı adam... gibi her gördüğümüz kişi bazı sırların çözülmesinde puzzle parçası görevi görüyor. Bol miktarda sembolizm var, fikir vermesi için sadece en göze çarpanını yazacağım [spoiler]after life yolculuğu diye tanımlayabileceğim bu tren yolculuğunda, insanların solucanlı toprakla dolu ""bavullara"" dönüşmesi bana wtf dedirtti[/spoiler]. Ayrıca kime güvenip kime güvenilmeyeceği konusunda, insan ilişkileri ve ""manipülasyon"" konusunda sorgulama yaptırmayı başarabiliyor. Boyutuna göre oldukça ağır konulara değindiği için takdirimi kazandığını söylemeliyim. Daha örnekler vererek yaptırdığı çağrışımları vb. anlatırdım da o zaman bu yazı inceleme olmaktan çıkardı ve ben spoiler vermek istemiyorum, hoşunuza giderse alıp kendiniz keşfedin daha iyi.

Ucu devam ettirilmeye müsait bir şekilde açık bırakıldığı için ve oynarken size anlattığı şeylerin yanında anlatmadığı şeyler de bulunduğu için, üzerinde düşünüp teoriler kurmaya müsait bir oyun. Bu yönünü sevdim, yani şöyle diyeyim, herkes iyi yapamıyor bunu. Bazı yapımcılar konuları olduğu gibi bir yere bağlamadan bırakıyorlar ve tatmin olmuyorsunuz. Ama bu oyunda öyle değildi. Tabii daha detaylandırılmasını istediğim noktalar yok değil, ama gene de genel olarak hikaye doyurucu ve keyif vericiydi.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1951455393
Oyunun barındırdığı korku ve gerilim öğeleri (hayalet ya da şimşeklerin çakması gibi), atmosfere uygun müziklerle birleştiğinde anlatılan hikayeye kapılmak oldukça kolaylaşıyor. Ben o korku ögelerine rağmen kendimi güzel bir kitabın içinde kaybolmuşum gibi huzurlu hissettim, oyunun akışı ve gidişatı sıkmadı hiç. 

Seslendirmelerin bazısı gayet iyi ama bazıları başarısız, neyse ki başarısız olanlar az ve fazla kopma yaşamadan devam edebiliyoruz. 

Soundtrack kısmı gerçekten başarılıydı, oyun sonunda Credits ekranında durdurup durdurup aradım ama bulamadım müzikleri. Sonra oyun ismi + ost diye aratmak aklıma geldi ve EVREKAAA öyle bir video varmış, çok mutluyum :D Sizinle de paylaşmak istiyorum bu güzel müzikleri:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kylQ94faXA

Bulmacaları kafa yorucu değil, genelde bulduğumuz şeyi nerede kullanacağımız gayet belirgin oluyor ya da doğrudan oyun bize hangi nesneyle ne yapacağımızı söylüyor. Daha zorlayıcı olabilirdi, ama hikayeden kopmamak adına ve sembolizm üzerine düşünebilelim diye böyle tercih edilmiş olabilir, o nedenle normal buluyorum.

Gerçekten eksi olarak yazabileceğim tek şey, oyun çok hoş ama o kadar kısa ki tadı damağınızda kalıyor. Birkaç bölüm daha uzun olsa veya bir devam oyunu olsa, daha iyi olurmuş.",1577631773,1673965095,True,16,0,0.701051890850067139,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[list]You do indeed point and click to do stuff, but that's about as far as it goes. Items and plot-devices are not especially hidden, ""puzzles"" are not at all challenging.

[*][b][u]CH3[/u][/b]: Apparently not. Despite the shared setting with Ch2,  this feels like a very different world, and what's creepy is mostly just a human creep, not anything fantastic.

_____________________

PROS

+  story elements.  The story is a bit cliche and you will know what is going on from the very start but the little parts that all fit together to make the story complete are great and it gives a satisfactory ending to to the game.

+   no pixel hunting.  This is not a traditional point and click in the sense that finding stuff that you need is very easy and there are only a couple of times you actually need mess around with your inventory to get the items you need.  

+ voices in my head.  The voice acting is fairly solid.  The writing isn't always great though.  I strangely sound very much like the conductor on the train which was a bit weird.  I have found my voice twin.

______________________

CONS

-  2 of the cheevos didn't trigger for me.  

-  closure.  I would have liked a bit more closure or at least a bit more of a solid idea on what the story was.

The Charnel House Trilogy is horror point & click adventure game with a decent run time and pretty good voice acting all around. You'll swap between a couple of characters as they've boarded the train to Augur Peak and pieces of the story are revealed to you. I don't want to say much about the story, this is best experienced going in blind. However, it does setup for a sequel that has yet to surface from the developers so that may or may never happen. I also wish there was more of an equal focus on both characters but I suspect it's saved for this possible sequel.

I would say The Charnel House Trilogy is worth playing despite some of the minor issues here, this does have some dark subject matter so know that going in. Considering the sequel is in limbo, maybe pick this up on sale.",1572592574,1654129252,True,3,0,0.501960813999176025,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Charnel House Trilogy is a gothic point & click game developed by Owl Cave. You play as Alex and Dr Harold Lang over the course of three chapters. Both of these characters are brought together on a train journey to the mysterious Augur Island, and over the course of the three chapters the sinister nature of Augur Island comes to light. 

[h1]Positives: [/h1]
[list][*]The visuals look fairly dated for a game that came out in 2015, but the art is well designed and when combined with the excellent ambient audio, it helps create the game’s creepy atmosphere.

[*]The voice acting for the three main characters (Alex, Lang & Don) are fairly good. The audio quality is a bit rough, but the performances themselves are convincing. I particularly liked Don, but it’s just because I’m a sucker for a Scottish accent. Floyd is also fairly well acted, he’s just not a main character. 

[*]Each chapter sort of has its own contained story, but their main purpose is to contribute to the overall story of the game. I won’t give details to avoid spoiling anything, but I will say that I thought the overall story was compelling. Each chapter doesn’t really work by itself but as long as you view it as one ‘larger’ story that doesn’t matter.

[*]The writing is good, the characters and the overall plot are believable within the game world. 

[*]The gothic elements of the game are well done, this definitely feels like gothic fiction once you get a bit further into it. 

[*]They kept things short, so the game doesn't overstay its welcome. It's just a shame that they never got around to making the sequel as the game ends with a set up for another story.

[*]It’s pretty easy to get all the achievements. [/list]

[h1]Neutral: [/h1]
[list][*]The puzzles are all fairly straightforward. Personally, I prefer simpler puzzles as I’m only interested in the story from point & click games, but I imagine more seasoned point & click players might be disappointed that it’s so easy. 

[*]Coming in at just two hours to complete, and all other things considered, $8 is pretty steep for it. It does get super cheap during sales though at which point it’s good value. [/list]

[h1]Negatives: [/h1]
[list][*]For reasons beyond my understanding, they got Jim Sterling to voice one of the characters. His voice ‘acting’ completely killed much of my enjoyment for the final episode, which is a shame because I thought the writing was good. Half the time he’s trying to put on a weird accent, the other half of the time he just sounds like himself and at absolutely no point is he doing anything close to acting. 

[*]As for the rest of the voice acting (excluding the characters I mentioned earlier) ranges from not great to abysmal. Some of this is due to poor audio quality (such as Carli) and some of it is down to bad acting (such as Isaiah). 

[*]You can’t pause during dialog, which is one of my pet peeves with most point & click games. 

[*]Alt-tabbing really messes the game up, so don’t bother with it. [/list]

[h1]Verdict: [/h1]

Jim Sterling’s voice acting is dreadful addition to the game, but all in all this is fairly enjoyable. The writing is believable, the main characters are well acted and it’s a healthy dose of gothic horror. It’s a tad expensive for what it is, but if you can grab it on sale then it’s worth the two hours it’ll take you to finish it.

+ Мне понравилась тема с поездом, потому что лично для меня путешествие на поезде всегда повод для некоторого переосмысления, игра хорошо легла на мой личный опыт.
+ Атмосфера жути не перебарщивала. Её было ровно столько, чтобы было не по себе, изящно. 
+/- Загадки были не невероятно сложными, но не такими простыми, чтобы просто накликать все предметы в комнате и сразу все решить. Чувство такого приятного легкого прохождения. Но, в целом могло бы быть и лучше, если бы игра была длиннее и масштабнее.  

В целом показалось, что создатели не совсем верно выдержали скорость игры, темп повествования стоило держать более медленным и угнетающим.

THe voice acting was okay. THe graphics are fine. The idea of the game is ....fine. Just soo many stupid things here, most of alll the plot itself.
And its sooo short. A Trilogy!?!?!??! a trilogy of demos is more like it.
First part is just 1 ROOOM, A SINGLE ROOM. Plus a 1/4 room. so its literally 1 1/4 rooms long.....SHORT.
Second part is just a train.....and its a bit longer...maybe twie as long as the first at most. and it made NO SENSE why that character even exists makes no sense to me....he's so pointless.
Third part IS THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AND LEVEL AS THE SECOND PARTTTT. Which honestly is fine....I'm all fine with retracing steps and stuff thats fine, but its like a little bi tlonger than the second part and its the same gameplay as the second part.\

And god is the gameplay annoyingin this....the puzzles are frustrating cause it doesnt give u clues and forces u to guess every possible combination. And it changes how u pickup items...i thought i had a knife in my inventory but had to go all the way back and see that u have to click through twooooo windows for some parts to get the item oh wowwww.

Bottom line: it's stupidly short; the idea of the story is FINE but the way its told here is just lackluster and boring; the doctor guy is a pointless character who has no point in being around.....u can skip chapter 2 and not miss anything of value the real story is of the girl. And seriously the ending plot line raises so many questions that the dialogue actually utters right to you making u question why they wouldnt fix the problems instead of admitting them.

It's short, yes (3 hours, maybe?), but after reading the other reviews I expected a lot less. Especially I expected a loose story. But for me, this was a round thing; at least, from an emotional side - and I don't like when stories end too open ended / when I'm left alone after an end! 
It started a bit with obscurely ordinary everyday's scenes, like Coen brothers movie, maybe; but fortunately (I don't like Coen brothers movies for their endings), it ended a lot more explaining. Almost everything from the beginning that you see is brought back later, explaining it, or at least re-instantiating it. This made the game a lot less ""random"" for me like many other adventure games are. It has horror elements in it, but no jump scares and alike. Unsettling through its obscurity. Though I never felt uncomfortable or in danger when playing the game. You can play slow pace. It's a slow game, actually.

The first chapter [b]Inhale[/b] played out well enough, it made sense and didn't have those Sierra style solutions. It was short but ended with a ""shocking"" point, one that only served the purpose of looking grotesque and shocking. I'm just gonna straight up tell you, the conductor talks to a raven and then snaps its neck. This is never explained or even important to the story other than shocking the player with how out of place it is. I can understand if it was to set the tone, but not 6 seconds later does another thing happen that sets the tone much better. The next two chapters are just flat out weird, I understood what everything meant there was no guessing what was going on; it did a decent enough job explaining what was going on. But it still wasn't that great, I would say that the level of writing is my level and I am not a good writer.

Пожалуй начну с небольшой истории знакомства с этой игрой. После прохождения Layers of Fear, я был озадачен, как эта игра стала популярной. Сюжет, единственно что представляло ценность, был не просто банален, он сразу рассказывал и свою концовку. Но там был неплохой дизайн уровней.
И тем выразительней получился контраст с The Charnel House Trilogy. Самая сильная сторона игры - сюжет. А сюжет силён персонажами. Они герои этой игры-пьесы. Ведь если нет на сцене героев, повествование не сдвинется дальше под действием событий мира или места, они субъективны. Неторопливо игра по кусочку создаёт грандиозный финал, который получит далеко не каждый ААА-продукт. 
История начиналась банальна. Я уже смирился с монологами героини о человеке, которого, как я думал, не увижу, встречами и диалогами с персонажами, которых, я думал, после этого не увижу - так как покидаем это место. Но сюжет удивил, в конце поразил дуплетом из чеховского ружья, что висело на стене. Видите ли какой дело, аннотация к обзору не  совсем банальна - в сюжете нет лишнего. Нет лишнего и в персонажах и в их диалогах. Игра хорошо скомпонована, она коротка и в этом её прелесть. 
По мимо сюжета у игры нет сильных сторон. Ни шатко ни валко сделана квестовая часть игры, но не она здесь во главе угла. Много про неё говорить не хочется, если охарактеризовать одним словом - не мешается (на удивление). Графика посредственна, если не сказать хуже. Своего собственного стиля игра не имеет. Музыка на уровне, чтобы соответствовать выбранной темы лора игры, не более. 

Вывод: сюжет набирает обороты медленно, но в этом его соль. Если вы дадите шанс, возможно он и вас сможет в конце затронуть. Цена не сильно кусается, на распродажах со скидкой иногда стоит копейки, можно взять на сдачу от крупных проектов (возможно которые покажут себя хуже неё).

The pixelated graphics aesthetic was a bold choice and a loving nod to classic point and click games of the 90's. This style will likely put some people off but is used in a really effective manner to create atmosphere and horror throughout the entire game.

I managed to speed through this game in 1.5 hours, but if you really wanted to soak up the story you would be looking at a play time of about 2-2.5 hours. There is minimal replay value, but sometimes it's good to be able to start and finish a game in a single day.

Один из них, Гарольд Лэнг, пытается о своём кошмаре забыть, но события, происходящие во время поездки, бередят старые раны. Другая, Алекс Дэвенпорт, до этого путешествия пребывала в беззаботном неведении, а теперь узнаёт нечто, переворачивающее всё её представление о привычной жизни.

The Charnel House Trilogy – это хоррор без скримеров. Он вызывает тревогу за счёт странных образов и добивает великолепной кульминацией, которая связывает все детали сюжета воедино и открывает ужасную тайну. Подобный подход к подаче страшной истории – большая редкость в этом игровом жанре.

Другие положительные стороны игры – приятный пиксель-арт и выразительные голоса, знакомые по AGS-квестам Wadjet Eye Games. По духу этот квест напоминает серию Blackwell.

Игра делится на три коротких эпизода, потому и называется трилогией (на самом деле по продолжительности она и на одну полноценную игру едва тянет). В первом и третьем эпизодах в качестве главной героини выступает Алекс, во втором – Гарольд. К сожалению, большая часть его истории осталась за кадром, можно только гадать, каковы были предпосылки к произошедшему и что означает весь этот символизм, который встретился ему в поезде. К счастью, историю Алекс рассказали полностью. Эта героиня слишком инфантильна, чтобы понравиться, но ей всё равно сопереживаешь.

Как квест эта игра чрезвычайно проста: ты заранее знаешь, что предстоит сделать, догадываешься о предметах, которые могут попасться на пути и пригодиться в определённой ситуации. Её можно пройти за пару часов, ни разу не заглянув в руководство, да что там – временами придётся осаживать себя, чтобы не проходить игру сломя голову и таким образом не развеять мистическую атмосферу.

Недостаток «Трилогии» в том, что она слишком короткая. И незавершённая. В конце игры пообещали продолжение, а на форумах есть старые сообщения о том, что работа над сиквелом ведётся. Ничего из этого, как мы понимаем, не гарантирует появления второй части.

Pros-
-----------------------------------------
-Great voice acting for a short production.  Most recordings sound professional save for one of Alex's friends
-Beautiful backround art for a game of this style
-Creepy narative will suck you in if only for 2hrs
-Atmospheric Music


Cons
--------------------------------------------
-Short.  This game sets itself up for a great story but is unable to flesh it out in just these 3 acts.  End of game insinuates there was going to be a sequel but a quick internet search finds that there has been no movement on this as of 2018 and last mention of it was 2016.
-Puzzles mostly serve to drive the story forward and are not especially challenging

Co jest HOT:
+ przede wszystkim twinpeaksowa atmosfera dziwności;
+ ma się ochotę na więcej.

Co jest NO WIESZ, CO ZALEŻY:
~ kontynuacja dziwnych przygód miała wyjść w 2016, ale na razie ani widu, ani słychu. Za to na forum gry jest fajna dyskusja omawiająca teorie;
~ zagadki w tej przygodówce są banalnie proste - mało przedmiotów, mało dostępnych lokacji. Ewidentnie gejmplej nie miał odciągać od historii.

A co NOT:
- dubbing jest mocno taki se;
- nie można zmusić postaci do szybszego chodzenia;
- momentami natchnione gadki psują nastrój (monolog okienny, wątek Judasza).

The main characters of each one do get mentioned in the other, but they don't really have any effect on the plot, such as it is. The two leads feature in stories that are tonally somewhat different as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but makes the game feel less cohesive as a single unit.

With that introductory comment, let me just say that it's a fairly basic couple of stories with what I found to be too overt symbolism. It's a point-and-click adventure, but one without much puzzle-solving--there's usually only one path to progression and it's pretty obvious what you need to do. There's no ""moon logic,"" which is good, but neither do the solutions feel like you've accomplished much. There are occasionally decorative things to click on, but when your character says ""That's nothing of interest"" that feels like a bit of a cop-out by the designers.

It is fully voiced, which is a nice touch, but I found myself reading through the lines and skipping ahead to the next ones pretty much all of the time.

- it's very short, the above 3.3 hours on record included full replay of 3rd chapter for some achievements. You can be done under 2 hours doing all the ""exploring"" at your own pace;

-it's not point-and-click adventure per se, meaning there isn' t much ""adventuring"".It has some elements of it (you get to use inventory several times throughout the game), but it's mostly very linear dialogue-heavy story where you do what you're told by the narrative;

-I wouldn't call it ""horror"" either. It's more of a psychological drama with some strange happenings, it has a dark, gloomy feel over it, but it's not terrifying, spooky or chilling...more so thought-provoking and just makes you ponder

Now with that being said, the story is intriguing, (if somewhat bizarre); there is a good quality voice-acting and the game turned out to be pretty atmospheric.

[h1]Handlung[/h1]
Die junge Frau Alex Davenport und der Archäologe Dr. Harold Lang begeben sich unabhängig voneinander auf eine Reise mit dem Zug nach Augur Peak Island, jeder mit seinen eigenen Motiven. Doch es stellt sich schnell heraus, dass der Zug nicht das ist, was er zu sein scheint. Seltsame, unerwartete Dinge geschehen auf dieser Reise, und auch den Reisenden wird schnell klar, dass hier etwas ganz und gar nicht stimmt.

Die Handlung bleibt die ganze Zeit über spannend. Dadurch, dass sie schnell vorangeht, und viele schaurige Enthüllungen bereithält, stellt sich nie ein Gefühl der Langeweile ein. Man bekommt nur noch Lust auf mehr. Allerdings bleiben auch viele Dinge ungeklärt, beziehungsweise man muss sie sich selbst zusammenreimen.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] spielt sich wie ein sehr simples Point-and-Click-Adventure. Per Mausklick bewegt man sich an den gewählten Ort. Ein Linksklick auf ein Objekt löst eine Interaktion mit diesem aus, während man bei einem Rechtsklick detailliertere Informationen zu diesem Objekt erhält.

Wer genretypische Rätsel erwartet, über die man sich lange den Kopf zerbrechen muss, bis man die Lösung hat, der liegt falsch. Bei [i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] steht eindeutig die Handlung im Vordergrund. Deshalb würde ich es weniger als ein Spiel sehen, sondern eher wie eine interaktive Gruselgeschichte.

[h1]Atmosphäre[/h1]
[i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] ist ein sehr atmosphärischer Titel.
Durch die teilweise schon surreale Handlung erweckt das Spiel eine unbequeme und vor allem unvorhersehbare Grundstimmung. Man merkt einfach, dass etwas nicht stimmt. Besonders gelungen finde ich, dass der Grusel eher subtiler Natur ist, anstatt sich wie andere Spiele auf Jumpscares zu verlassen.

Der Soundtrack ist schön anzuhören und wird meiner Meinung nach auch sehr gut eingesetzt, um zum Beispiel spannende Situationen entsprechend in Szene zu setzen, oder durch abruptes Verstummen wie ein Schlag in den Magen zu wirken, wenn einer der Charaktere eine entsetzliche Entdeckung macht.

Die Sprecher der Charaktere liefern eine ausgezeichnete Arbeit ab. Besonders der Charakter Alex wurde sehr glaubhaft und natürlich gesprochen. Doch auch die restlichen Stimmen sind überdurchschnittlich gut.

Mein Tipp: Für ein besonders intensives Spielerlebnis abends spielen, wenn alles still und dunkel ist, und man von nichts abgelenkt wird.

[h1]Schwächen[/h1]
Leider ist das Spiel sehr kurz, und nach ungefähr zwei Stunden ist man durch. An sich ist das erst mal nichts schlechtes. Es ist schön, ein Spiel zu haben, das man an einem Abend durchspielen kann. Aber bei einem Preis von 5,49 € erhofft man sich schon etwas mehr Spielzeit.
 
[h1][u]Fazit / TL;DR[/u][/h1]
Kein Spiel für die breite Masse, setzt [i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] eindeutig mehr auf das Erzählen einer Geschichte, statt auf forderndes Gameplay. Durch die schaurige Atmosphäre, die bei zunehmendem Vorankommen immer intensiver wird, was sicher auch an der recht kurzen Spieldauer liegt, bleibt das Spiel spannend bis zum Schluss.

The puzzles  (few that there are) are pretty easy to figure out, and the games main strength is the characters and story. 

It's not a game with  lots of action or danger, or a game that will make you jump out your seat scared.  Its more of a creepy and disturbing horror, than outright scary, and some of the things that the characters discover on their journey are seriously messed up. 

It would be nice if the game was longer, but then it tells the story it needs to without being rushed at its current length, and longer may have made it too drawn out. If  I have any complaints it's more that there's a little too much hand-holding from the game, you're practically guided to everything you need to do, and that the puzzles are too easy .

It's an okay adventure puzzler akin to the Gabriel Knight series, The ""The Last Door"" series, or Ben Croshaw's horror games. Except this is very short, and there isn't much to do except advance the story. The puzzles, what few there are, are bottom tier, and are merely ""use inventory item on thing in your way,"" and very simple and obvious.

The story is intriguing enough, and the atmosphere is suitably creepy. Much like The Last Door, the story is a little too obscure to be satisfying, and obviously, it never moves past the set-up. There's some cosmology here that you only get a taste of.

The voice acting is all over the place, from good, for instance the lead, Madeline Roux, and Abe Goldfarb of course, to...not very good. Looking at you here, Jim Sterling. Not a good casting choice, considering the character. The music is good but over-the-top bombastic. The graphics are great in that Dave Gilbert SCUMM engine way.

The story is the point of this game, not the puzzles, and I'm cool with that. The story is in 3 acts. The first act is very short, and doesn't really get interesting until the end of it, which is a decent prelude for the better 2nd act. The 2nd act is the strongest and has some moments that really got under my skin and creeped me out in good ways. The 3rd act was the most disappointing for me.

Unfortunately, the quality of the new content is mixed at best, and the additional exposition ends up dragging down Sepulchre's strengths as well.

I'm going to start off by stating that, throughout all three parts of the Trilogy, the gameplay is minimal at best. There do not appear to be any situations where you can lose the game, the next objective is always clearly pointed out, and puzzles are simply solved by using the obvious item when necessary. There are some achievements that are technically missable, but I personally got them all on my first playthrough just by examining everything and paying attention. I don't mind this kind of linearity all that much, but the act of going through the environments isn't particularly engaging because the bulk of the game is set in rather drab interiors that aren't affected by the game's proceedings at all — there are zero reasons to backtrack and see if anything has changed, because nothing does unless the plot demands it.

As for the story, if I were to judge by Sepulchre alone, I would say it's just alright. The characters aren't all that interesting, and you will definitely be left confused and unsatisfied by the ending, but taking it as a vignette, it at least has a nice atmosphere that keeps you wondering what will happen next.

On the other hand, Inhale and Exhale are pretty bad. Both of them star a different protagonist and she is only tolerable at best. Inhale is a prologue where you help her get ready for a trip out of her apartment, presumably designed to let players get acquainted with her personality, but frankly this entire portion of the game is incredibly obnoxious and it would have been better to just cut it out entirely. Get this: At one point, you're able to go to her computer, on which is Totally Not A Pixelated Image Of Destructoid, and she starts talking to herself about how the latest review or whatever was controversial. I have no idea if this moment is supposed to convey ""yeah I'm cool and enjoy video games like you"" or ""yeah my life is sad enough that I actively talk about how these things are amusing to nobody,"" but regardless it's just a really cringey shoutout. Speaking of Destructoid, a character voiced by Jim Sterling is also introduced in this chapter, though I somehow did not notice it was him at this point. Everything else about this chapter is forgettable.

Exhale starts immediately after the events of Sepulchre. Its narrative somewhat clears up the mysteries of the previous chapter, but unfortunately the explanations are uninspired as hell [spoiler](haha, pun)[/spoiler] and there's also an equally uninspiring villain thrown into the mix. Jim Sterling's character shows up again and this time I did notice it was him, right as his dialogue went off a fucking cliff. Seriously, the lines he had to read were so substandard that when he had to put emotion into it I could clearly notice it was him; I had to wonder if he took the role to take the piss out of everything, but judging by what he's said about his work on this game he seems to have sincerely thought it was good (it's not).

Perhaps most insultingly, the Trilogy — which again, is a re-release made, in theory, to fill the plot holes of Sepulchre — has the gall to end on another perplexing cliffhanger, one that promises something far more interesting than these developers could probably ever pull off. As of this writing, whatever sequel was planned has yet to be conceived, and until the unlikely event that it surfaces and miraculously causes the events of its predecessor to be satisfactory in retrospect, I highly recommend just avoiding The Charnel House Trilogy entirely.",1499883057,1499884041,False,2,0,0.541078269481658936,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This definitely leaves the story open and I would def continue playing it.

This is more of an introduction to a story in three small parts (third being longest). Some reviews said it was confusing. I think it set up a decent story with easy to understand tones and elements. It does not give anything away, hence why it may seem confusing, but it is not meant to be totally understood, just some basic ground elements for the rest of the story.

_____
Thus, to elaborate a lil':

  Brilliant! That I can say for sure. I saw many people commenting on the shortness of the game, how it gets worse the further it goes and turns from intriguing to meh, something about not so good, even cringy voice acting - and POOP is what I exclaim dramatically in response to this! POOP!
 
 The game is short, yes - there are three chapters, I went through them in less than three hours in one run. Comparing it to longer games of this sort, like Kathy Rain, however... Yes, there is something peculiar here. Kathy Rain, an ok game which just does not go into the directions I would expect it to and stuff, has way more locations, characters to interact with, things to do - and yet it felt SHORTER to me than The Charnel House did. Charnel House first but softly licked, then just sucked me in with its atmosphere, how it greeew as I played! I was sceptical at the beginning, at the end I was in AWE and desiring to see a continuation. It is short, but well put together; tells compelling story, builds its characters, is ambiguos in a delightful sort of way. 

 Puzzles? Meh. Not challenging - you just fly through them to flow further with the story. It may resemble some Visual Novels in this way - clicky click the thingie to get to the next scene, and truly, the clicky part is not there to slap you with a glove, it is a flashing arrow, the ""next"" button, to clumsily generalize, just more interactive, more compelling.

 So, NO tricky, challenging puzzles here. I dare to think a lot of complaining people got the game expecting them and they got hit by the dissapointment beam pretty hard.

 I find voice acting raging from ok to quite good, getting better as you proceed. And the writing, it made me feel so immersed! At the end, I really was CAPTIVATED and wanted MORE. But I did not feel emptish or like something could be done way better, I did not feel dissapointed - the game surely must have some flaws, though I did not notice them much, focused on them. I went through a story that just grabbed my squishy heart. 
 What I can tell you is that maybe sooome sprites look kind of rectangly (mr Lang), and that while you can either interact with or examine an object, using these two options sometimes leads to the very same results.

 A good, solid tale of suspense; vague, maybe even surreal, yes, dream like at times. It felt GOOD to finish it, see? I felt I completed something; and I was satisfied, and felt this thing special, enriching.

 Want a PECULIAR, SUSPENSEFUL and MYSTERIOUS tale? Yup, grab it! 

 Want a CHALLENGING ADVENTURE with tons of PUZZLE-SOLVING, FINDING SOLUTIONS, ANSWER GETTING..? Nope, this is not it, dearie. See, check Kathy Rain I mentioned before. Maybe, check Fran Bow, too. Both filled with guessing, getting somewhere, combining stuff and problem-solving, longer games... Look at them, really, and realize The Charnel House is simply NOT IT. 

 It is sweet, unsettling, lovely and mmm, so ambiguous, dream-like treat! And it is neat to hear Jimmie boy there, too.  My, Sterling has a beautiful voice.

Charnel House is a one and a half hour-long game with well-drawn AGS graphics but bland writing, generally poor voice acting, a sequel-bait plot that doesn't resolve itself in any satisfactory manner, an overly linear structure and simplistic inventory puzzles that offer no challenge whatsoever. Alex is a relatable enough character, but the rest of the cast comes off as grating, in no small measure due to the ""amateur hour"" voice work.

The ""not recommended"" rating refers to the asking price: there are far better (and longer) adventures than this one that are free.

В вагонах меркнет свет,
Это пoезд играет со мной.
Он вроде есть, а вроде и нет,
Везя меня под землёй.

Бежать отсюда срочно нужно,
Но со своими заперт я грехами.
Я задыхаюсь, как же душно!
А за окном земля с червями.

Проводнику усатому не верь,
Он совсем не тот, кем кажется.
И не ходи в приоткрытую дверь,
Ведь прошлое тут же покажется.

От прошлого не скрыться никуда.
В один конец купил себе билет.
Похоже, что здесь я навсегда,
Ведь из пoезда выхода нет.

Я сделал выдох, после - вдох,
Но боль в висок мне била.
Не дышит тот, давно кто сдох,
А пoезд тот - моя могила!

Mechanically its a standard point and click adventure. My only issue with the game design is that the without a quest tracker or something like that some times I felt [i]slighly[/i] lost on what to do. The puzzles are minimal to the point that they borderline on nonexistent.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story wise it is super compelling. At first the game feels slow [strike]almost boring[/strike] till the information being given sinks in and you realize how intense things really are. This game is creepy at some points and weird at others but it never feels out of place or cheap. It adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. The game is rather short though; Its about a hour and a half long game.

[u][h1]Overall:[/h1][/u]
Its a good weird game and with its price point shouldnt be passed up.

[i]Edit:
 I do have a [i]small[/i] admission though. I accidentally started with the third Chapter then did the first Chapter and finished with the second Chapter after realizing my mistake. Honsetly after doing all three I like the that format better then doing the Chapters in order.[/i]",1491793282,1496823111,True,3,0,0.534296870231628418,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Prima di tutto non è una avventura, ma un racconto interattivo mascherato da avventura, e poi non ci sono 3 episodi, ma 3 parti dello stesso racconto, che non ha nemmeno un finale definitivo (in effetti doveva uscirne un seguito nel 2016, ma chissà se mai arriverà).

Trovo questo modo di dividere giochi già brevi in più parti per far credere di acquistare un pacchetto di valore una tattica di vendita sleale, un po come accade con The Last Door, dove almeno le parti sono divise in maniera più netta e ben fatta, ma anche di non avvertire che la storia non termina ma prosegue, forse, in un futuro episodio promesso da uno sviluppatore indie sconosciuto e che quindi non si sa se e quando avverrà.

A dirla tutta, c'è poi la fregatura dell'aspetto del gioco, che fa credere che la produzione sia di un certo livello: la grafica è bella (se vi piace lo stile a bassa risoluzione), la musica è molto bella ed il doppiaggio è di buona fattura (ma non eccelso, ma più probabilmente per i testi che questi poveretti hanno dovuto leggere) ...ma poi arriva la storia, e tutto scade in un film horror di serie b.

La storia scialba ed insensata ed il fatto che una vera e propria avventura grafica non ci sia, sono i problemi che mi hanno fatto odiare questo gioco a tal punto da non vedere l'ora che finisse, e per un gioco che dura solo 2 ore è tutto dire...

Se vi piacciono i film horror tutti uguali che si vedono oggi (bé, negli ultimi 10/15 anni circa) magari potrebbe piacervi, ma per uno come me a cui piacciono i libri di autori classici, questa è solo spazzatura già vista, ed è proprio questo il problema, secondo me.
L'autore punta TUTTO sulla storia, tanto che nel forum del gioco ha creato una discussione che incita i giocatori a teorizzare su quale sia la verità che si cela dietro alla trama, ed i segreti che verranno svelati nel (nei?) prossimo episodio, promuovendo anche dei suoi racconti che ha pubblicato da qualche parte (non ho cliccato).
Mi fanno un po pena (nah) quei tizi che ci provano, e l'autore che con occhiolini, faccine e parole qua è là, tenta di buttare benzina sul fuoco della loro curiosità, quando in realtà non c'è niente da capire visto che è una storia inventata con regole che solo lo scrittore conosce, e ci si affida alla sua buona (o pessima, come in questo caso) scrittura per fare in modo che il suo racconto non abbia paradossi o inesattezze, che potrà comunque risolvere in futuro visto che un mondo fantastico creato da un qualsiasi autore non ha le regole del nostro, e può mutare al suo comando.
E' proprio per questo motivo che quando si leggono libri fantasy o comunque di fantasia (come gli horror), non ha senso cercare di capire, ma bisogna semplicemente seguire il filo e vedere come va a finire.

A me piacciono i racconti di fantasia, ma quando hanno un senso e quando terminano, ma soprattutto quando sono scritti bene. Bé, questo ha tutti i difetti che può avere un racconto del genere: banalità di ogni tipo, ""jumpscares"" (ma funzionano ancora?), fantasmi che appaiono e scompaiono all'improvviso, la luce che se ne va e guarda un pò, quando si riaccende la stanza è diversa, una bambina, una protagonista goth che dice le parolacce (ma almeno si lava), l'uomo deforme, l'alcolizzato perchè chissà quale oscuro segreto porta con sé...ok ce ne sono altri ma sono stufo di scrivere.

Insomma non è un gioco e la storia è brutta, ma dura solo 2 ore quindi...bé è proprio come guardare uno di quei brutti horror moderni.

The chapters are also somehwat disjointed, which isn't exactly a problem, but with already feeling too short, I feel it just doesn't work out.
My biggest disappointment however was with the ending, I won't go into details but it seemed way too over the top. I greatly appreciated the subtley of the creep factor this game had, in fact it was one of my faorite parts of it, so the ending not only seemed overdramatic to the point of ridiculousness (I was actually laughing during it), it seems wholly out of place and really drags the rest of the game down with it for me.

- The second part is only very loosly connected to the rest of the game and more or less an atmospheric advertisement for a game yet to come (and to by), not more. I feel a bit scammed here.
- The final confrontaton was a bit over the top for my taste.

A decent attempt at creating a classic gothic horror tale mixed with a dash of strong-willed and unusual characters that populate it, make The Charnel House Trilogy a fun, thoughtful and chilling ride.

I'll avoid the plot of the game entirely since the player's enjoyment comes from knowing little to none on what awaits her/him. The Charnel House trilogy is made up of three short episodes, and you can look at around two hours to finish them all. Story and the motives the game deals with are interesting and unnerving as they should be, and have left a lasting impression on me. Some of the morbid history subject Charnel House deals with have made me pause the game once in a while to check on the net if it really was the case (and to my morbid curiosity and excitement, they were :).Since the game was made with AGS engine, it is bound to low resolution but detailed 2D art coupled with great music and sound effects make up for it. Voice acting on the other hand is a mixed bag with some performances being very good to other sounding amateurish, and can on a few occasions pull you out of the game's atmosphere and experience. Also the first two episodes are way too short, leaving the atmosphere of the horror not nearly enough time to bloom and leave a terrifying mark on me, but the third somewhat lengthier and meatier episode successfully produces the sense of trepidation, uneasiness and wonderment, and makes up for the short and trimmed first two episodes. Just be warned that the ride ends with a cliffhanger, and the sequel the developers have announced is already behind the schedule. -.-

So if you are looking for something spooky, in a vein of Gabriel Knight or Phantasmagoria, made on an indie budget and that lasts a fraction of above-mentioned adventure classics, I moderately recommend you try out this little gem.

I went into it not knowing what to expect, and Part I felt very ""Blackwell Epiphany"", especially as it has the same artist, and features exploration of the bookish female protagonist's apartment.

But in Part II, the vibe is much more ""The Last Door"". There's deep supernatural mystery, and increasingly offputting occurances soon take you into ""what the fuck"" territory. I thought the music, writing and pace made for great atmopshere here.

I felt Part III lost the wind out of its sails to an extent, as it was much longer than the other parts, the plot becomes unnecessarily convoluted, and the mystery falls away too early to become more of a traditional horror, in which the protogonist behaves nonchalantly towards the supernatural nature of her situation, focusing only on the interpersonal drama.

Постараюсь объяснить почему. Мне не очень просто было написать обзор в моём обычном стиле, аля плюсы-минусы. Очень уж трудно в данном случае это сделать. 
      Графика - на любителя. Я фанат графики, так что мне потребовалось немного времени, чтобы привыкнуть. Как только привыкаешь к графике, второе, это как правило то, что приходит на слух. И тут есть два момента. 
      Музыка - классная, мне понравилась. Озвучка персонажей, вот, не совсем. Где-то не до конца вжились в роль, а где-то слышится некачественный микрофон и хоть это не раздражает, но немного мешает погружению.
      Сюжет - интересный. Затягивает. Заставляет задуматься. Довольно открытый, и почитав комменты разработчика, я понял, что каждый может понимать игру по-своему. Но я реально засел на 2 часа и погрузился по полной. 
      Атмосфера - вышка. Если интересен стиль, я бы сказал, что это больше триллер, чем хоррор. Страшно тут не из-за зомби и не из-за привидений, игра давит психологически. Есть какое-то чувство тревоги и периодически в голову лезут втфэшки :D
      В целом, игра мне понравилась и приятно было услышать, что игру ждёт сиквел под названием Augur Peak.

Za prvé, název. The Charnel House Trilogy. Očekával jsem plnohodnotnou trilogii her, která mi vystačí na mnoho hodin. Dostal jsem tři kratičké kapitoly, které se bez problému dají dohrát za dvě hodiny. Herních obrazovek je sotva deset a i tak se některé jen opakují s pár obměnami.
Za druhé, žánr. Vypadá to jako klasická adventura, čemuž hodně napomáhá i herní engine používaný jinými adventurami (Gemini Rue, Technobabylon, pentalogie Blackwell a další). Je to ale pravda jen z části. Interakce i používání předmětů je velmi limitované a hádanky triviální. Děj je zcela lineární a posunuje se kupředu skoro samovolně, bez většího hráčova přičinění. Obvykle stačí splnit očekávanou akci a hra sama aktivuje jinou událost a naznačí, co dál. Spíš jde o interaktivní příběh než o tradiční adventuru.
Za třetí, příběh. Hra už podle názvu působí jako uzavřené dílo, ale opak je pravdou. Z hromady nastolených záhad a podivností se nevysvětlí prakticky nic, konec už otevřenější být nemůže. Jde tak spíš o počátek nějaké delší série než o samostané dílo.

Zatím jen kritizuji, ale přesto hodnotím pozitivně. Pokud totiž přijmete výše zmíněné vlastnosti, dostanete slušnou hru se snovou až lovecraftovskou atmosférou. Děj, byť neuzavřený, má svoje momenty a minimálně jedno odhalení je poměrně šokující. Na vysoké úrovni je i dabing většiny postav, především hlavní představitelky. A zcela úchvatná je pixelartová grafika a plynulé ruční animace. Tak kvalitní, detailně zpracovaný pixelart jsem dlouho neviděl.

I've finished it in ~3.3 hours, but the game still took time to establish characters enough that I felt connected to them on good enough level to really care.

The atmosphere is awesome, soundtrack is really nice too and the voice acting is done very tastefully and with care.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Okay, to start with: This is short. Expect to complete the entire ""trilogy"" within 1.5 to 3 hours. (It's better to think of the three ""games"" as simply being chapters of the same story, of which only the third one has any firm length.)
This is a basic puzzle-adventure PnC: Pick up items, combine items, interact with things. That said, all the puzzles are simple [Tip: Your items are accessible via a tab up top, and at one point in the game you do need to click the scroll button on that tab to get the item you need to progress], so veterans shouldn't expect to find any surprises or hint of a challenge. If you're new to adventure games, this may be a good entry point- the narrative pushes you pretty clearly into the approach you need to take with each puzzle.

Interface has a few minor clunky elements, but the game is for the most part smoothly handled and intuitive. The animation is very well detailed, and matches the charm of the art style quite well.

Most everything is examinable and interactable, often to the very amusing musings of your protagonist. While the game may lack in puzzle depth, it makes up for it with the detail of its interactive fiction and charm of its humor. 

4.25/5

[b]Audio[/b]
While generally speaking the voice acting is above par, there's spotty bits [including one side character in one single scene that sounds like she's speaking from 5 feet away from a microphone], mainly in the voice actors simply not speaking as fluidly as you'd expect. However, none of it is particularly grating, the game has full voice acting, and you can skip forward in dialogue any time you like. So there's no harm if you do find a character particularly annoying or dull to listen to.
Generalities aside, the lead voice actress doesn't suffer any of the flaws I mentioned- she's a delight to listen to, and both the writing and vocalization of her dialogues is quite enjoyable.

The music is similarly delightful, and this is one of the rare games I'll be making sure to get hold of the OST for. It's all ambient mood-setting music that you tune out as you play- but then, that's what it's supposed to be. If you take a moment to listen to it, it's quite richly developed, and ought be appealing to fans of ambient music styles. Typically, I'm the 'mute the background music' type, but I'm glad this game didn't have an option for that.
Flip side, if you do happen to dislike the background music, the single volume slider means you'll have to take voice acting out along with the music.

4.75/5

[b]Plot & Writing[/b]
While the supernatural elements dominant this game, at heart it's a psychological thriller, and those are the parts that'll stick out. The content is all adult, as is the writing, so while the gameplay is entry-level difficulty, it may be a bit too morbid and curse-heavy for younger players.
The plot is solid, between the first and third chapter, telling a twisted short story and using supernatural elements as the catalyst for revealing the pasts of the characters involved. The second chapter, on the other hand, is just a bizzare acid trip that hopefully'll have more import in tying in the game's sequel [Augur Peak] than it did in tying into this game. Still, it's a bit of an interesting experience, and it does set a good platform for the last chapter, so it's not a negative inclusion into the game. Rather, it feels less like filler, and more like an experience that ends up being a bit jarring in comparison to the more coherent style of the other two chapters.

Writing is a bit inconsistant or forced in places, but not to any degree that'll jar you out of the story flow. For the most part, it's quite appealing, and with a modern, straightforward sensibility. The game doesn't hold to tension for long, switching between bizzareness and straightforward exposition quite readily- but that also means the reveals never feel forced, stretched out for so long as to lose their meaning [in other words, it's not like romances in drama TV series].

There's no real conclusion to the game, as the game seems to be intended as a prologue to the sequel, but it does wrap up the specific story it has to tell quite well. In that sense, it's quite a good example of a prologue, mixing telling a self-contained short story with setting things up for something larger.

4.5/5


[b][i]Summary[/i][/b]
A good, bite-sized adventure game for mature gamers, suitable for a quick Point 'n Click fix or an entry-point into PnCs.
Excellent attention to detail, a compelling protagonist, fully voiced dialogue, and strong music carry the game, while weak puzzles, short game length, a disjointed second chapter, and an interface and writing just a touch short on polish limit the game's impact.

I can definitely recommend this game, and am highly looking forward to its sequel. :)

The Charnel House Trilogy is more like a visual novel than a traditional point&click puzzle game, because the puzzles are very easy and the game characters are pretty specific about what the protagonist ought to do next. The story had its moments, the pixel art is quite pretty and there's a nice dark atmosphere. I'd say that the horror elements are not there to scare you, but to make you feel creepy and lonely.

What irks me is that the game gives itself too much credit. It only takes an hour or so to complete and there are many references to some bigger story that's apparently out there. At the end there's a blatant sequel hook which made the Charnel House Trilogy seem like a prologue instead of a self-standing game.",1478009697,1478009736,False,6,1,0.592550516128540039,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was certainly very surprised, I did not expect to be so absorbed in the story. During the two hours of gameplay, many questions gnaw at us, small pieces of the ""puzzle"" appear here and there before finally discovering the more or less surprising outcome depending on what we’ve already understood of the story.

The Charnel House Trilogy can be called horror game by its oppressive atmosphere and well-crafted script.

The Charnel House Trilogy est un petit point & click constitué de 3 chapitres :  Inhale, Sepulchre et Exhale.
Nous suivons tour à tour Alex et le docteur Lang dans une histoire quelque peu atypique, pleine de mystères, de rebondissements et de noirceur. Je n’en dirai pas plus, au risque de spoiler.

J’ai été sans aucun doute très surprise, je ne m’attendais pas à être autant absorbée par l’histoire. Durant les deux heures que dure ce jeu, de nombreuses questions ne cessent de nous tarauder, des petits morceaux du « puzzle » apparaissent par ci par là pour finalement arriver au dénouement plus ou moins surprenant suivant ce qu’on avait déjà compris.

But it's mostly my fault for not doing enough research/reading, as I later found out that this is technically what the developer called an ""extended intro"" for their next game coming out soon. Calling it a trilogy is a bit deceptive as it's all-in-all about five hours of gameplay, and is not a complete story, but rather the prologue, which is something one should have in mind when thinking about purchasing it. 

I would reccommend it though because everything about it is really good. The interface is perfectly easy to use, the art is all very beautiful, and it was very easy to get into with lots of things going on that you can spend time wondering the significance of. It's far from boring, and it's obvious that a lot of effort went into the look and feel. Wait for an inevitable package with the whole game if you want, but if you're a big fan of quality adventure games, your money could certainly be used support worse projects. Not gonna lie, the dissappointment makes it hard to give a lavish review, but it is a good start.

I got this game on sale - it's a quick one, so the $6 tag might make some flinch, but I found myself having a lot of fun with it. There's a few points worth making, though. 

Calling this ""3 adventure games in one"" is a bit of a stretch for what you get. The game has three chapters which all depend on one another for any sort of coherence, and should be played chronologically ideally. The games are straight adventure, with not a lot of real puzzles persay aside from the typical adventure game ""rub all inventory items on all things"". It's pretty clearly more a story using the game format as a mode of delivery, but I think it works well overall. 

Charnel House Trilogy feels more like a really good prologue than a whole story in and of itself. Everything is very trippy, symbolic, and abstract. Some people, like myself, love that sort of thing. Others don't. A free demo of the second chapter, Sepulchre, is available on Owl Cave's website (and on here) and if you're having doubts, I suggest giving it a go - it will definitely give you enough of the overall tone for you to make a call on. 

You can gather most of what's going on generally speaking by reading between the lines of the game, but even then there's several narrative questions that need answering. The good news is, the devs say the sequel is coming of within 2016 (ideally), so honestly I may wait until that comes out to really give this a go. 

Technically, the game is sound. Owl Cave and Wadjet Eye share several brains, so if you're a fan of Blackwell or any of the others, you'll definitely be getting vibes of that in the art and music. Voice acting is also relatively clear and of pretty good quality - lots of good actors here. Maybe don't fullscreen it, though. It makes otherwise nice sprite art look like lint on your screen. 

Overall, I'd say play the demo and see if you're more enthralled or infuriated. If you like it, purchase it - but maybe wait until the sequel comes out if more solid answers are important to you in a story.",1469679827,1469679827,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was delightfully surprised with the story and concept of the game overall.  A standard adventure game, The Charnel House Trilogy, provides moderately easy puzzles, but the story far outshines anything else it has to offer.  During two chapters you play as the young woman, Alex and one chapter you play as Howard Lang aboard the mystery train, Gloria.  Unraveling the mystery of the train is the basis of the story and it's stories like these which are the most enjoyable because the meaning isn't laid out, it's somewhat open to interpretation.

I do hope there is a sequel as I'm dying to dig further into the mystery of Augur Peak.

Gameplay was almost three hours for me, but I'm a pixel clicker.  Normal players would probably be two hours or less so if you're okay with spending six bucks for two hours then knock yourself out or just wait for a sale, but buy this game regardless.  It's worth it.

Right up until the last five minutes or so, I thought I was following the plot pretty well. Then the Big Reveal finally came, the nature of the game's paranormal threat was explained, and... I still don't get what was ""really"" supposed to be going on.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed the ride. The story is paced well, with creepy elements being added in just the right amounts and increments to keep the narrative momentum going (and the player feeling increasingly uneasy). The voice acting is also quite good for what appears to be a fairly low-budget game (video game critic Jim Sterling plays a supporting character).

A warning though: this is not a game for puzzle fans. Most of the game unfolds through simple fetch quests (""Hey friend, would you go to the bar and get me a shot of whiskey?"") and the resulting dialogue upon completion of said fetching (""Thanks for the whiskey. Hey, did I ever tell you about....""). A few puzzles are interspersed here and there, but the answers are so heavily hinted that I was never stuck for more than thirty seconds or so -- and this is coming from a guy who almost always resorts to a walkthrough at least a few times before finishing most other adventure games. In other words, play [i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] for its story and atmosphere rather than for an intellectual challenge.

What you get here is a fun, interesting little mystery, split into three 'chapters' that vary in length. The first two are pretty brief, and the third is the longest, with most of the plot twists and developments happening there. There's a horror element to the game, but also a bit of humour and some nods and winks to the gaming community.

The voice acting is decent, particularly from the two lead characters - Alex and Harry. Jim Sterling voices a character here too, and he's suitably over-the-top and impassioned. He's clearly having a lot of fun with the role. The weakness in the voice acting is mainly that they were all clearly recorded separately, possibly over Skype, so there's a difference in quality that I found a bit distracting. It's the nature of the game and how it was made, however, and I found it easy to forgive those issues. You work with what you've got to hand.

I think what some people who have left negative reviews are struggling with is the fact that this is more of a narrative experience. Sure, you're pointing and clicking, but the game very much pushes you in the right direction throughout. There are a couple of puzzles, but they're very, very easy and only really serve to push the plot along. It's a pretty captivating plot too, although I felt like most of my questions went unanswered by the time I reached the end. There will almost certainly be a sequel that fleshes out some of what we see here, but I wasn't disappointed by what I saw. There's some real promise here in terms of where the story could go.

Adventure game by definition is about progressing the story by solving problems and puzzles. 
Charnel house has none, you are basically herded into one train cabin, where you pickup single item and a herded towards next cabin where you use the very same item you've picked up earlier. 
Charnel house plays like an interactive novel where you know exactly how it ends by the time you finish chapter and 2 and just just click away for the next 30-40 minutes to see the very ending you've been expecting all along. 
Game title suggests trilogy, where in fact it's a 3 chapters, each lasting about 20-30 minutes.

It isn't a terrible experience, and I really liked the beginning of the game, but there are some points which seem misleading from the get go.  The store page advertizes this as ""Three thrilling, horrifying adventure games in one"" and that is just not true.  Not only is this not three adventures, it doesn't even feel like ONE whole and complete adventure.

This title contains three short scenes, which are loosely related and leave an open-ended interpretation of what actually has occured during the course of the story presented.  The first scene is excellently narrated, introduces the main character and piques the player's interest and, although very short, draws the player into the world.  The second scene is a bit surreal, does not exactly correlate to the first scene, but does still allude to it, and brings a bit of a psychological teasing to the narrative.  The third and longest scene is best described as ""meh"" and kind of diffuses the interest that was piqued in the first and second scenes with a haphazardly thrown out, cliched type of story.  And the very end of the game is an allusion to that fact that another game may come in the future which will bring the player back to learn more of what may or may not have happened in the course of this game.

And ""game"" is used in the loosest sense of the word here.  There is hardly any game at all.  This is more of a psychological experience where the story is narrated (with some excellent voice acting for the most part) and the player is allowed to click on a few icons for added description while the story unfolds itself.

I actually enjoyed most of this title, but as this is being billed as multiple point&click adventures rolled into one, I think that many people who are going to purchase this title are going to end up with something that they feel disappointed with when they have finished.  Also the rushed and unfinished story that the third scene leaves the player with just doesn't lead to a satisfied feeling upon completion.  I am 100% for a psychologically baffling story that people can have long dialogues about long after they are over, but more of the picture should have been presented at the ending rather than forcing people to purchase a different game at a different time to get the satisfaction that completing a game should give.  And for these reasons, I would not recommend this title to fans of the point & click genre.

A mercifully brief, on-rails (pun) point-'n-click with uneven execution. Since I purchased the game at under $2 USD, I can't really complain much. For the retail price of $6 USD, I'd save your money for a longer, more interesting game. I had really hoped for more game and less grinding narrative. 

Too few real puzzles and a mediocre reveal make this one a don't-buy at full price.

Nevertheless, the score is quite good because it instills deadful foreboding. I think it's easily the best element in the entire game, and if (as the climax hints) they intend on making more in this series, they should continue with their current composition. 

The art, despite being extremely limited in scope, is on par with modern p-n-c's. My estimate of the actual places you can visit includes: one apartment, a train station, and a train interior with between 6-8 largely identical compartments that alter in presentation as you progress. So, in total, there are maybe 2 dozen individually constructed environments. One additonal room pops up for narrative purposes, but it isn't interactive. Plenty of good stories have taken place in a small arena, but this is one tale that would benefit from more depth of milieu. The cramped quarters of Charnel House don't derail the game (pun), but they don't give us much variety, either. The game ends up feeling claustrophobic, though not in a good way.

The voice acting (by a handful of game professionals, no less) is technically proficient, though not particularly impressive. Sterling's addition seems like a mis-cast, perhaps. His voice is off-putting, no doubt, but it doesn't quite fit. A couple characters sound like they are talking through tin cans. Some moments that require ""Oh, God, no!"" sound more like ""oh, gawd, noes..."" These potentially exciting crescendos could have been intense and gripping, but they lose their weight when offered up in unenthusiastic, uneven presentation.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by the far above-average voice direction in Wadjet Eye games, but I believe those gems are the industry standard. 

A great deal of the horror lies in tropetastic reveals-- for instance, sometimes the lights go out, something spooky is shown, and  the lights come back on. Some of the scary is more than mild, but it's lost in a slew of teen-horror shlock padded by the ramblings of an incoherent raconteur. 

Charnel House would be so much more compelling if it were simply more interactive.You will be shuttled from one room to the next, sometimes solving extremely easy puzzles, sometimes just using the right item on the right environmental object. You will find yourself with no options to explore, and you are shackled with unsubtle directions to a paint-by-numbers game. 

Example:
Walk into train cabin.
Creepy but not exactly scary thing is going on.
Collect an item.
Leave cabin.
Use collected item to solve a ""puzzle.""
Hear a noise in the next train car.
""Oh, maybe I should go there,"" narrates the viewpoint character.
Go there.
Lights go out.
Creepy thing happens.
Repeat.

I'm not sure why the game is divided into chapters, since it is neither long enough nor diverse enough to require compartments (pun). I understand that the viewpoint character changes, but there are better, stronger methods of offering cliffhangers than sending the player back to the main menu every 30 minutes.

In the first and third chapters, you play the same character, a snarky lady with a penchant for cigarettes and bad relationships. In the second chapter you play an archaeology professor with a drinking problem who constanly loses his train of thought (pun). Each chapter will last you about 30-45 minutes, and since I only paid $2 for ~2 hours of mildly interesting, slightly spooky game, I'm not unhappy. But, I'm not really satisfied.

I wanted to jump on the train and love this game, but I think I'd rather throw myself on the tracks.

This is a rather short point-n-click title. The visuals are excellent for what it is; however, the voice acting is mediocre at best. Some of the characters sound like they are attempting accents rather poorly while others take a while to get up to speed. Many of you might recognize the voice of Jim Sterling from the popular 'Jimquisition' and he gives a delightful performance in the last chapter of the game. The role was one he seemed to have a lot of fun with and it comes out in his performance. 

As for if this is mystery or horror, I lean more towards mystery. The story is short and gives few details; yet there is something good here conceptually they have constructed which could flourish if nurtered properly.

Classic point and click adventure game with an old school mystery/horror story that was at times funny and at times creepy. 

Features Jim Sterling voice acting as one of the creepy characters, but I actually thought Madeleine Roux stole the show (although she did play the main character, so that would be appropriate). I think the first book wasn't as well acted as the other two, but you can tell she really hit her stride for the third book of the trilogy. The other voice actors did a good job as well.

The actual story was quite well written, and worked perfectly with the minimalist setting the game offered. The graphics were simple and yet evocative and worked perfectly as well. The gameplay was simple as point and clicks generally are, and functioned with no issues at all. There is also a manual save system, which I always appreciate.

The game did a great job of tying its story together while still managing to end on a cliffhanger, which is expected to release later this year I believe, although I haven't yet looked into that to confirm. I will be interested to play the next installment.

All told, I give this a solid 8 creepy train passengers out of 10 possible. Would ride creepy train to mysterious island again.

E para minha grata surpresa, descobri rapidamente que se tratava de um jogo de terror e mistério. Jogo? Bem, seria melhor descrevê-lo como uma narrativa interativa, pois os quebra-cabeças são muito fáceis e não exigem nenhum raciocínio além do básico. O que encantou foram a história bem escrita e intrigante, a trilha sonora memorável e os acontecimentos bizarros e criativos que de certa forma me deixaram impressionado, mesmo não sendo assustadores.

O final pode ter deixado algumas pontas soltas, porém fiquei feliz em saber que uma continuação está em desenvolvimento, com previsão de lançamento para 2016.

Graphiquement sobre mais agréable, le jeu brille surtout par son écriture réussie, (l'ambiance peut légèrement rappeler Edgar Poe ou Lovecraft), et par ses doublages assez bons. (Attention, PAS de version française à l'heure où j'écris cette éval -  Mais l'anglais est d'un niveau assez abordable).
Le scénario se laisse suivre agréablement, mais comme pour pas mal de jeux d'ambiance, mieux vaut y jouer dans de bonnes conditions : au calme, avec lumière tamisée ou même carrément dans le noir. Autrement, je crois qu'on peut facilement passer complètement à côté du trip.

Ne vous attendez pas à un jeu d'horreur à jumpscares ou plein d'effusions de sang : Ici l'épouvante se distille savamment au fil de l'histoire. Et sans atteindre des sommets, cela fonctionne quand même relativement bien!

Malgré son gameplay typique de point'n'click classique, le jeu n'oppose quasiment aucune difficulté.

Dodam, że w grze znajdziemy kilka bardzo ciekawych smaczków i nawiązań do znanych horrorów (m.in.scena niemalże żywcem wyjęta z ""Lśnienia"").

The Charnel House Trilogy is a collection of three games: Inhale, Sepulchre and Exhale. In Inhale we play as Alex Davenport and we try to find our ticket for a train heading to Auger Peak.  In Sepulchre we play as Doctor Lang, a man also heading to the same island and with him we explore the train and then in Exhale we again play as Alex who also has to explore the mysterious train.

The Charnel House is a weird title and I will try to explain it the best I can. The game is more or less story driven, so don't expect that many puzzles and when you do get a puzzle now and then, they are so simple to solve you shouldn't even break a sweat.  I wish the puzzles were a  bit more complex are had some layer of difficulty, but I found myself breezing through the entire game without even having to stop and think on what I'm supposed to do.

The graphics are great and shows that if you want to make a great pixel adventure game, the adventure game engine is the way to do it.

The soundtrack is also really good, It helps build mood and tension and also brings out atmosphere in some of the darker moments in the game.

The voice acting is also really good. Everyone does a great job including Jim fucking sterling son who portrays his character in a very creepy manor. If Jim is reading this (which of course he isn't) he should do more voice work in the future.

The game however has a few negatives.

The story has a very rough start. The first chapter is so slow I thought to myself that this game will bore me to death and I've heard so much good stuff about it. But once the shit starts hitting the fan it get's really good, not to mention the final bit is really disturbing in it's own way.

The puzzles as mentioned previously are way too easy and I wish they could have come up with a better way to do them, but even then some of the puzzles are very fun to do.

The game is not filled with jumpscares, so if you're wondering about that you don't have to worry, you are safe from jumpscares, but you're not safe from disturbing voice acting by Jim Sterling and disturbing material.

Overall I can safely say The Charnel House Trilogy is a great game and definitely worth your time. The game is spooky good time and if you like adventure games or horror in general I highly recommend picking this gem up.

Final Rating:
8.5/10 - Great

[olist]
    [*][u]Nostalgic art style[/u] - Reminiscent of games like [i]King's Quest[/i] and [i]Monkey Island[/i], except with nice anti-aliasing so it doesn't appear too sharply pixellated even at large resolutions.
    [*][u]Fully voiced[/u] - Even comments your character makes about objects are voiced. And the female protagonist is very good. Can't really say the same about some of the other characters though. 
    [*][u]Interesting story[/u] - Makes you want to find out more. Many questions are raised, and the narrative unfolds in intriguing ways as the game progresses.
    [*][u]Intriguing characters[/u] - In addition to the 2 protagonists (both of which you get to control at some point), the other characters in the game are pretty engaging, and sometimes in ways you don't expect!
    [*][u]Horror genre but with no cheap jumpscares[/u] - Doesn't rely on [b][i]""Boo! I scared you!""[/i][/b] moments to achieve its sense of creepiness and unease.
    [*][u]Good atmosphere[/u] - The artwork and a bit of subtle background sound/music largely contributed to this. Despite its short length, the game manages to get quite immersive. There's one scene with a music box playing that was particularly effective.
[/olist]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

[olist]
    [*][u]Too short[/u] - At most 1 hour of gameplay for me. 
    [*][u]No ending[/u] - We [i]do[/i] get some answers to a few of the questions asked in the story, but the game ends abruptly. A sequel is to follow, so I heard.
    [*][u]Far too easy[/u] - No thinking at all needed. Inventory and scene options are very limited [i](e.g. there are many instances in the game where you can only stay within one screen)[/i], so you almost always know what you must do next. Very often, your character even tells you specifically what to do next after a cutscene ends! 
    [*][u]Extremely linear[/u] - Very little free roaming or exploration involved, since very often you are limited to 1 or 2 screens max. The game makes it such that you [i]must[/i] do things in a certain order.
    [*][u]Plays more like a visual novel than an adventure game[/u] - That's what happens when there are no puzzles to solve and zero options available.

The Charnel House Trilogy пытается заигрывать и с Кингом, и с Хичкоком. Где-то получается, где-то нет. 

Сюжет игры состоит из трех глав, где мы играем то за девушку Алекс, то за мужчину Гарольда Лэнга. Оба они не знакомы друг с другом, но попадают на очень странный, окутанный тайнами поезд, идущий от одной конечной станции к другой, без остановок.

Квестом это не назовешь (не смотря на то, что это 2D point-and-click), слишком уж мало тут объектов взаимодействия, инвентаря да и почти все диалоги протекают режиме одной строки, без возможности выбора вариантов ответа.

Длится история эта очень не долго, от силы два часа. Зато повествование идет в очень хорошем темпе, а в конце, и вовсе, все ниточки событий сплетаются воедино, отдавая игроку хорошую, не лишенную твистов открытую концовку (что само по себе достаточно нестандартно для жанра мистики).

Конечно, тут есть и свои минусы. Кому-то не понравится ""кухонная"" озвучка, или чрезмерно короткий хронометраж, но на то оно и инди-хуинди.

This review is difficult. There are some very postive elements to the game, but in the end I can't really recommend it. If there was a ""maybe"" option, I'd probably pick that, but since it's ""yes"" or ""no"", I am unfortunately leaning towards ""no"".

POSITIVE
+ Interesting protagonist. She makes you want to know more about her and her story.
+ Atmospheric visuals and music.
+ The story has elements of creepiness/weirdness that is appealing to a horror/pulp fan like me

NEGATIVE
- The game is too short. I like short games, but this one was completed in two hours. It's a trilogy and yes, the two hours includes all three chapters. Even for a short game it felt more like a prologue than an acutal game.
- There is a bad balance between unexplained/mysterious story elements and overt exposition. In the beginning everything seems almost normal, but some weird things are introduced. That's interesting. Then in chapter two some very weird things are introduced that makes you go ""is this story just a dream?"". And in chapter three it continues, but then all of a sudden an antagonist is revealed and he pretty much just tells you what has happened in the past, in the real world. But in the game you are stuck in a world that's obviously not real, and there's no explanation for that.
- The voice acting is very mixed. The protagonist (who does most of the talking) is really good. But some of the others are bad because of three things: Some of the voices has bad audio quality, some are badly acted/read and some voices simply don't fit the character. I read somewhere that some of the voices are done by guests from the gaming community. That would explain the mixed quality.
- Too linear gameplay. I understand that a story like this one cannot be totally multidirectional. But in this game you literally leave one train compartment to find that all other compartments are locked except one where the door is visually half open. Then you enter that compartment. When you are finished and leave the compartment another compartment is now open. Then you go there. It's simply too linear.

All in all, I would recommend the game if it was perhaps two times bigger, less linear in the exploration and if there was a better balance between story elements that are suggested versus overt exposition.
If they continue development of the game (they should - it definitely has potential) they ought to aim for a balance where there are more things the player can explore on his own to make a theory about what's going on and less things that are told in linear dialogue. Right now the player is trapped: As players we are told exactly what we are told - no more, no less. And for a player like me, I really wanted to explore some things further, while in other cases I actually wanted less verbal exposition. But all players get exactly the same in exactly the same linear order. So you are trapped in a story where some things are too explicit while other things are so unexplained and impossible that you end up going ""fine, then it's just a dream, that's all"".",1456146318,1456146318,False,5,0,0.595087766647338867,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The only real downside is the game's ending which feels rushed and unsatisfactory. A lot of details remain unresolved and thus left only for the player's imagination. Even though the voice acting is above average, i found the writing lacking at some points, especially in the final chapter (the word ""f*ck"" being thrown around in every other sentence really doesnt help to escalate tension).

You have an inventory from which you'll need to use or combine some things you collect. It's very easy at all times, since your objectives are rather clear.
Should you play it?
Well, that depends.
If you're expecting a satisfying point'nclick adventure game with many good puzzles, lots of locations and a huge, maybe even funny story, then: no. The Charnel house trilogy is very basic and the gameplay elements serve mostly to present the 3 connected short stories.

BUT.
If you're in for the creepy atmosphere (victorianesque-creepy, like ""The Masque of the Red Death"" from Poe) and want an experience that's quickly completed, but does stay due to its sheer atmosphere: then YES, you should play it.

The Charnel House Trilogy is an excellent little game. I say little not to be detrimental, but because the game is extremely short. In that short period, though, you’ll be treated to an excellent story with some nice twists, complimented by some good voice acting.

You being as Alex, a girl who just broke up with her boyfriend, in her apartment. You’re taking a train ride to a place, Auger Island, to meet a friend and hang out. Your first order of business is to check on the delivery status of your train tickets, which requires a password, which requires you to find out what said password is.

At its core, the game is a point and click adventure title. There are only three major environments, and there are a few unimportant items in each location for you to click and get some information on. Items you need to progress aren’t highlighted, nor do they twinkle, but they’re easy to find.

Graphically, it gets the job done. It has a purposely retro look, with jaggy characters. Backgrounds have some basic details, as do your items, and everything combines to do a decent job. It’s far from a good looking game, but I don’t think it was intended to be anyway.

Sound and music work well together for the most part. A few sound effects seem off, and in the later chapter, music tends to turn on and off as you enter different rooms, which is a little bit jarring. The voice acting, for the most part, is great, and gives the characters actual depth. There are a few instances where the acting is a bit blah, but there are not a lot of those.

The gameplay in Charnel House Trilogy is pretty typical for its genre. You click on items to either get something from it, or to hear a quick note on it. Combining objects is done through your inventory, like dragging your lighter over your cigarette pack to light one. Item combinations are pretty straightforward to guess, and the inventory flashes momentarily whenever you pick something up that can be used.

Where the game lacks, however, is in its difficulty and length. It’s a very easy game. You will be unlikely to need a guide, as rooms are locked until you need them, and when you do, it’s obvious: for example, a previously locked door will be cracked open next time you go by, indicating it’s time to go in there. It’s also a very short game, easily finished in under two hours. It has no replay value, unless you’ve missed out on some achievements, but there’s only a few of them that are missable; most are tied to the story. Even so, you can save and load as you please, allowing you to go back and collect them if you so choose.

The Charnel House Trilogy is an excellent horror title to add to your collection, especially if you like point and click adventures. It breaks no new ground, but does what it does well, and is worth your two hours. At full price, it’s a great game, and at a discount, it’s a must.

It starts out nice enough but slowly makes that downhill descent into the macabre. It slowly gets under your skin and stays under. It allows you to piece together things but then slowly breaks them apart until you really do not understand whats happening. The game can at times be disjointed, but in a way that's what the game is trying to do. It is trying to get you to keep guessing at what will happen next. As for the story, its all very eerie and I can recall certain times in which I got the cold shivers from what had been going on. The voice over work is done very well, there is absolutely no ""Moon Logic"" in this fun little point and click adventure. Its a brisk journey through a portion of the horror genre and I really enjoyable one at that. I picked this up while it was on sale and I am really happy with my purchase.

A short point-and-click psychological horror adventure game. The story revolves around creepy incidents that occur on a train. I only recommend only buying this if it's on sale and you like point-and-click adventure games.

+ Decent graphics for an Adventure Game Studio (AGS) game.
+ Atmospheric background music that really sets the mood for each scene.

The chapters are surprisingly short. I restarted the first chapter from a save because I thought the game had crashed to menu, but no, it just ends akwardly. The game's puzzles are so simple that they just end up wasting time, and the story reads like bad Silent Hill fanfiction.

Following a fateful encounter, a man and a young woman separated by fewer degrees than they realize board a train for a rather peculiar and rather disturbing journey.

Despite being dubbed a trilogy, the game on the whole is rather short. This is not a disadvantage, however, as it keeps the plot tight and keeps things moving along at a pretty good clip, so long as you don't get stuck on any of the puzzles. In the first segment, we learn about Alex, still infuriated by a relatively recent breakup and not having the best evening in her apartment before an impending train trip. This is mostly establishment, though we are introduced to the other playable character, Dr. Harold Lang, and the train central to the plot, at the end.

In the second segment, Dr. Lang is highlighted, left alone to interact with the train's mysterious but friendly conductor, who sends him roaming among every cabin -but- Alex's for some reason to chat (or try to chat) with some other peculiar passengers. Strangeness accelerates rapidly, eventually leading to some grim discoveries regarding Dr. Lang's fate and, possibly, his present as well.

Alex returns in the third chapter, similarly left to roam the train and avoid Alex despite wondering what he's up to. Alex meets a greater number of passengers than Lang did, and eventually starts inexplicably stumbling her way through her past. Reliving several events from her more recent months, she discovers the truth behind what drove her to take this trip in the first place, and some things about people she thought she knew better.

Despite the short length and the low price, The Charnel House Trilogy is a beautiful game. The sprite work is great, the animation fluid, and the voice work is fantastic. I did have some mild beef with Alex's monologue toward the end of the first chapter sounding rather flat in its delivery, but this was not an issue that repeated itself later on. It was also great to hear Abe Goldfarb again, as he's quite a familiar earful from his regular appearances in other point-and-clicks. Jim Sterling also delivers what is arguably his creepiest performance to date, which is saying quite a bit if you're familiar with his Podtoid, Fistshark, Dismal Jesters, or Podquisition history.

I was hoping to get lost inside an in-depth narrative for hours, and have my mental limits tested. But no. I have been playing adenture games for a very long time, and there is nothing new here.

The Charnel House Trilogy ist ein Point and Click Adventure im klassischen 2D retro Design. Die mystisch, gruselige Atmosphäre und die perfekte Synchro untermauern hierbei sehr gut die Story, welche allein gestellt teilweise jedoch undurchsichtig ist.
Wir spielen hierbei zwei Protagonisten in zwei parallel verlaufenden Geschichten. 
Während ich die Geschichte von Alex bis zum Schluss spannend fand, und ich schließlich eine Chance hatte ihre Story zu verstehen, so tappe ich auch nach dem zweiten Spielverlauf mit Harold im Dunkeln. Interessant fande ich es trotzdem. Verbunden sind beide übrigens mit dem fiktionalen Schriftsteller Louis Cassell und deren gemeinsames Ziel: Augur Peak.
Die Welt im Spiel hat eine gewisse tiefe, welche für einige Stunden um verweilen einlädt. Es sind nicht nur EasterEggs zur Entwicklung, sondern auch Hinweise zu den Hintergründen und Verbindungen der Protagonisten versteckt. So lädt dass Spiel jeden dazu ein, sofern man sich darauf einlässt, seine eigenen Theorien zum Hintergrund zu finden.
Die Spieldauer beträgt etwa 2,5 - 3 Stunden.

Lovecraft was a master at fully fleshing out characters through thought and behaviour, and weaving a mysterious world in which those characters exist and interact.

However, once I got sucked into it, a whole new aspect opened up to me.

Remember that time when you were little, and your parents left you alone in the house for the first time? You felt oddly excited, even a little courageous... until you heard a bump in the next room. At first you were sure it was nothing, but then your little childish brain began to run wild, and told you that there was something wrong. You couldn't put your finger on it, but there was something about it that all of a sudden made you want to rush to your parents, but they weren't there. You were alone, and your only recourse was to curl up in a corner and wait out the storm.

Charnel House is the video game equivalent of that memory. Although it doesn't assault you with blood and guts, there's something about it that's just... off. As you work to unravel the mystery, the entire story begins a subtle, but noticable descent into madness. It gets to the point that you'd rather a monster did jump out and try to tear off your face, because then you'd have a definite answer to the question of what's out there.

It's short, but every gosh-darn second is packed with atmosphere and tension. Slowly but surely, an overwhelming sense of hopelessness seeps over you, and the plan becomes not to survive, but to figure out what's going on before you die.

It's definitely one of the better games to come out this year so far. Sure, it doesn't have guns and explosions, but who needs that when you're slowly urinating down your own leg?",1446980872,1446980926,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Video Transcript:

Hello viewers!  Welcome to another episode of A Bird's Eye View.  My name is Endeavor, and today we are reviewing The Charnel House Trilogy.  Developed by Owl Cave and published by Mastertronic,  this game was released on April 16, 2015.

The Charnel House Trilogy is a point-and-click adventure with a horror twist.  The story is told over three parts and revolves around two protagonists taking a train to Augur Peak.  Alex Davenport is the first character we follow.  She’s a seemingly average woman in her twenties that has just experienced a bad breakup.  She meets Doctor Harold Lang, our second main character, as they depart the station.

In the beginning, the ambiance and feel of the game gives the impression of a slice-of-life story, albeit with a few darker notes.  As the story progresses, the game reminds us of its true genre.  While the first two parts introduce us to the elements at play, it is the final chapter when everything comes together.

The storytelling in The Charnel House Trilogy is superb.  The themes, writing, and plot are more than strong enough to earn a recommendation on their own.  This is not a horror game that relies on jump scares and gore to shock the player.  Instead, expect to be slowly unnerved by the atmosphere as the game presents seemingly innocuous things-- things revealed over time to be far more sinister than it at first appeared.

The game leaves you with many unanswered questions.  How much of what Alex and Harold see on the train is real?  Are we to take what happens metaphorically, or is the train granting the protagonists an insight into their lives?  These questions lingered in my mind long after I finished playing.

As for the gameplay, it is similar to other point-and-click adventures.  The player has an inventory to store found items.  We walk around, talk to people, and interact with the environment with mouse clicks.  The puzzles in the game are not very complicated, and most can be thought through logically (unlike other point-and-click adventures which can require an almost compulsory level of trial-and-error).  I found the simplicity of the puzzles to be in the game's favor, as the central focus was on the story.

Each episode of the game averages about forty minutes long, so the whole thing can easily be completed in two hours.  This is mostly due to the limited scenes and the ease with which the puzzles can be solved.  While the game left me wanting more, I feel that my time playing it was well spent, so the shortness of the story is only a minor criticism.

The voice acting was great for the most part.  The actors sold their roles well, and the audio was good for the major characters.  There were only a few spots where things could have been better (which had more to do with sound quality than actor performance).

The game's retail price is $5.99.  For a short but well put together horror story, I give The Charnel House Trilogy a strong recommendation.  It's currently available on Steam for Windows computers.

And with that, my review draws to a close.  Thank you for watching, and don't forget to hit the “like” button if you enjoyed my video.  For updates on our upcoming content, follow us on Twitter at Rookery Gamers.",1445025227,1445025227,True,3,0,0.467491507530212402,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Now honestly? I think this is a marvelous piece of point-and-click style art. There are a few moments when some of the voice acting sounds a bit cheeky, but that's probably due to me just being used to Jim's voice on his YT channel.

Art direction is pixel-art and is done right! Very well put together for a nice atmosphere.

To say that this is a ""horror"" title... I don't know, I'd say that it's more a thriller of sorts. It starts off slow but interesting, then the second chapter leaves you questioning what exactly is happening, when it is all gathered up nicely in the third chapter. Excellent writing for a short story! Also, a nice little sequence in the end leaves some room for future titles which I, for one, will be getting for sure.

The only ""downside"" of the game, if you can even call it that, is that it's relatively short. Would suggest picking this one up if you're looking for a great story for the evening - or if you also like the Blackwell series, the two are very similar in some ways.

Anyways, a big greasy thumbs up for this title from me for sure!",1444160670,1444160670,True,2,0,0.521857380867004395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It even has John Padget (from Blackwell Trilogy fame) as a voice.

Pros:
+Good story.  Lots of twists and turns
+Lots of weirdness.  Very unsettling
+Good voice-acting.  Jim Sterling is actually pretty good.  John Padget is great as always.  The conductor was the best IMO.
+Beautifully drawn.  Great environments and portraits

Cons:
-Just over 2 hours for $6.  Get it on sale
-Not much variety.  2 screens in the first ""episode"", and a handful in the others.
-Mostly a teaser for a longer game.  (I'll probably still buy it though)
-Not much in the way of puzzles.  More of a walk to the left, get a prompt to do the next thing, walk to the right, get a new prompt, rinse and repeat.
-Bad ending.  Ending just a lengthy exposition.  Tells rather than showing.

The Charnel House Trilogy is a psychological horror point and click adventure surrounding a female lead character. This game has terrific music that really makes you feel as if you are there. The game is short, a few hours of gameplay, but the adventure element and the story are tied together very well. 

     The adventuring aspect of the game is nothing overly complicated; the puzzles and choices are not that complex, which can be appealing to those new to the genre, or looking for a not to heavy experience. What is especially well done with this game, however, is 
how well the story ties into the mechanics of the game.

     The story is astonishingly good; well done, and backed up by well by the music and  atmosphere. You play as a young female traveling on a train to see a friend, and sort out your life. The story takes more of a dark turn however, and becomes an adventure of oneself through the darkest parts of what they may fear to face. To come out on top and try to realize who they are if they are able to. You never feel like you are lost; if by some chance you get confused in the story, you are easily able to get back on track. The story and adventure draw you into the experience, and by the end of the game, I was ready to do whatever was necessary to fight in my own way to help the heroine. I felt connected, I wanted her to succeed. 

     Whether you are a hard core adventurer genre player, or crave a more casual experience, this game does an excellent job of bridging the gap between both. The story is great, the simplicity of the graphics and the music weave together seamlessly to create an amazing game.

If you'd rather read a Lovecraft story than watch Paranormal Activity, The Charnel House Trilogy may be for you.

The gameplay is simple point-and-click, optionally using arrow keys to move your character.  The plot is laid out in a very linear fashion, with very simple puzzles to advance the story.  It's a slow-burn, dialogue-driven horror experience without cheap jump scares.  There are rare moments where something disturbing may flash onscreen, but there's nothing designed to launch you out of your seat.  The gore is rare and mild, even more so with the low-fi graphics.

The voice acting is done well (including Jim f'ing Sterling, son), and the music usually is effective at setting the mood.  In the later acts it tends to switch from room to room which can be a bit jarring, especially if one area is meant to be creepy and the next one not.

My only real gripe with the game is the way it leaves things unresolved - the credits promise a sequel next year, which will hopefully complete the story.  Throughout the game there's a strong sense that you never know what is going on.  This makes sense as it mirrors your character's confusion, but without answers at the finish, the game's ending feels a bit rushed and unsatisfying.

К сожалению, не выходит. Атмосфера - вещь неуловимая и формулам не подчиняющаяся, но зато можно сказать сразу, когда она есть, а когда ее нет. Звуков грозы и зловещих темных пикселей в данном случае оказалось мало.
   Может, авторам не стоило прибегать к сомнительному мемчиковому юмору и не примешивать в экзистенциальный хоррор проблемы отношений полов? И не заставлять игрока из конца в конец ходить по этому чертовому поезду? Бэктрекинг, каким вы его еще не видели.
 
   Квест разделен на три главы - Inhale, Sepulchre, Exhale - которые можно в принципе проходить независимо друг от друга. Однако их связывает сквозной сюжет, разворачивающийся с перспективы двух людей: катастрофически инфантильной девушки Алекс 27 лет и чудовищно скучного профессора Харольда Лэнга. То, что начинается с бытовых ситуаций (подготовка к путешествию, исследование поезда) скоро перерастает в хоррор-трип.
   В качестве положительного момента - несколько мини-историй и сюжетных линий, которые под конец сводятся воедино. Наблюдать за тем, как одно за другим выстреливают развешенные ружья, чертовски приятно. Но тут же сразу и минус: каждый намек разжевывается, каждая логическая связь препарируется прямо перед игроком, не давая ему почувствовать интеллектуальное удовлетворение. 
   А жаль. Было бы хорошо, если бы в конце игры оставался хоть какой-то простор для додумывания, а собираемые из описаний предметов и отдельных диалогов подсказки выстраивались в какую-то иную систему. Если честно, весь этот сюжет с [spoiler]искуплением в Чистилище[/spoiler] и без того штампованный, чтобы его еще подавать открытым текстом.

   Графическое исполнение не вызывает однозначно негативных эмоций - здешние пиксели не так плохи. Пикселизированные фотографии смотрятся лениво, но... терпимо. Правда же. Зато совершенно неожиданным минусом выступает озвучка - неестественная, монотонная, да еще и плохо сжатая. И если Алекс еще старается играть голосом, то в случае с уважаемым профессором это просто конкурс самодеятельности.
   Механика для квеста обычная. Пару раз заставляют комбинировать мужество с чернильницей, фигурально выражаясь, но в остальном все паззлы вполне логичны. Удлинняет время игры только упомянутый бэктрекинг и парочка скриптов, срабатывающих только после того, как герой отойдет подальше от двери.
   Вторая глава, Sepulchre, объективно самая удачная часть. Любопытно, что она же и была создана изначально, а потом уже ""вокруг"" нее достроили пролог и эпилог.

[b] Pros	[/b]
+ Story moves you along well - at no point are you stuck, wandering around wondering what to do, endlessly talking to the same people again and clicking on things randomly in case you missed something. This is something that seems to happen in a lot of point and click games, but not here.
+ Decent pixel art graphics (if you like that sort of thing)
+ Great story which has chilling moments - it's a subtle terror, though
+ Liberal dose of swearing (I realise some may see this as a con, but this isn't a game for kids, and it fitted the situation and situation)
+ Voice acting is OK (not brilliant though).

[b]Cons [/b]
- Very short. Calling it a 'trilogy' really does give the impression you're getting three games here, which isn't the case at all. There's 3 short chapters in an overarching story and is one of the shortest games I've played for a while. (It probably goes without saying that there's no real replayability here either) 
- A few minor irritants - for example, in chapter two, for most of the hotspots you can interact with, the dialogue is the same whether you select 'examine' or 'interact/use'. In the context of gameplay the responses you get therefore don't always make sense. This isn't the case in the other chapters, so although it's a small thing it just seems like a weird thing to cut corners on
- Gameplay is very easy/basic - although I play a lot of point and clicks, I'm pretty rubbish at them and usually have to refer to a walkthrough at least point during a game. Definitely not the case here - the game actually drops heavy handed hints even when you don't need them, basically telling you what to do in places. I know other games tend to give you hints after you've been pootling around for a while and are clearly stuck - I'm not sure why this game tells you pretty much what you should be doing before you even have a chance to try anything (example scene - 'I could kill for a cigarette right now')
- Story is a little more ambiguous than I would like in places.

[b] Overall [/b]
The pros outweigh the cons - this is is a great little game that's worth a look if you like point and clicks or horror themed games.

My, my! Wasn't this an astonishing experience? When I decided to give this one a go, I wasn't expecting neither that much spiritual depth, nor such qualitative narrative. [i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] - one game with separate acts, actually - is an incredibly well arranged psychological horror adventure. 

I'd try to give you the baseline for the story, but the events, the characters that they are surrounding and their in-depth meanings are completely dependent on a perspective, and it is near impossible to define any character that we encounter within the game without pure speculation. Charnel House is what you get from Charnel House. Thus, I'll only present you some facts.

You begin the game as playing Alex Davenport, a young woman who is trying to recover from a bad break up. For some reason, she decides to go on a long train journey, in hopes of reaching the Island of Augur Peak at the end. During this odd journey, she encounters an odd British gentleman, Dr. Harold Lang, who is the curator of a museum and visiting the same island for an archeological expedition. The only seeming bond between them, is their lonely destination, and a series of uncanny encounters they shall endure during their journey.

[i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] consists of three separate acts, as if taken from carefully planned scenes from a theatrical performance: Inhale, Sepulchre and Exhale. Inhale is tied to reality, with a bitter taste of past experience. It feels old, dysfunctional and hurt. Sepulchre is the sublime passage between the real and that shadow on the corner of your eye, descending into the very Heart of Darkness, the horror itself. Exhale is the triumphant delusion, breaking the barrier between the reality that we coddle ourselves with and the cruel fact that logic doesn't work anymore. It is weaved with pure manifestation of raw emotions, raising more questions than it answers.

Three acts come together to compose an elaborate setting of carefully chosen subliminal details. The story is full of literary references, thrilling anecdotes, grave yet elegant symbolisms and interrelated details that will give a shiver down your spine when you realize their relevance. Don't expect your common jump horror. The art of absurd is the game's primary weapon against your psyche. This is a great psychological thriller.

The gameplay is no different than your casual adventure. There are some very minor puzzles, but nothing that would hinder your progress. As long as you keep exploring, the story reveals itself. Graphics are nothing extraordinary, nearly same as Blackwell series themselves, familiar and simple. Encountering something this eerie in this basic environment is probably down right uncanny compared to facing a grotesque enemy in full HD. When you finish the game, you cannot keep yourself from repeating exchanged dialogues in your head, trying to decipher hidden meanings.

If you've come to like the game, I'll suggest reading Ashton Raze's - the writer of [i]The Charnel House Trilogy[/i] - [i]Bright Lights and Glass Houses[/i], which is a novel that reveals some more information about the game's characters. I also recommend playing the game twice for the patient, just to watch events unfold in day light. I'll be anticipating the sequel until it comes in 2016!

Wahrscheinlich geht das aber nicht allen so. The Charnel House Trilogy ist auf keinen Fall massenkompartibel, würde ich sagen. Der Schwerpunkt wurde hier auf die Story gelegt, so dass das Spiel weniger Spiel als vielmehr ein interaktiver Film ist. Action und Rätselspielchen gibts nicht.

Die Story ist durchweg relativ kryptisch angelegt, da es sich bei den Hauptfiguren um Menschen handelt, die ihre Geister der Vergangenheit verdrängt haben und nun nach und nach mit ihnen konfrontiert werden. (Was das für Geister sind, muss sich der Spieler selbst zusammen reimen. Ihm wird es nicht zu einfach gemacht. Ich möchte dazu auch nichts sagen. Es ist gewollt, dass man am Anfang nur Bahnhof versteht.)
Die Geschichte dahinter entspinnt sich demnach nur mühsam. Wer es offensichtlicher mag und gern von Anfang an weiß worum es geht, könnte sich langweilen. Ich war allerdings sehr schnell Feuer und Flamme und konnte es vor Spannung kaum auf dem Stuhl aushalten. Das mag daran gelegen haben, dass ich mich mit der Hauptfigur des ersten und dritten Aktes, Alex, äußerst gut identifizieren konnte.

Wichtig zu wissen: 
- Das Spiel ist relativ kurz und lässt sich an einem Abend gut durchzocken. Das ist keineswegs ein Nachteil, da man so von Anfang bis Ende in einem Rutsch dran bleiben kann.

- Die Vertonung ist richtig gut, aber nur auf englisch vorhanden. Wer kaum Englisch kann, wird dem Spiel nicht folgen können. Wie gesagt, ist die Story das wichtigste Element!

- Das Spiel ist von der Thematik und Lebenswelt der Protagonisten relativ erwachsen.

Don't let the name fool you, I really couldn't say that this is a trillogy.  More of a game with three acts/chapters to it.

The game is short, inhale (the first chapter) will only take about 10 minutes to figure out but the story MORE than makes up for it's length.  However once you have completed it, I'm sure you will agree that the length is satisfactory.  Although I would have liked to see more puzzles within the game, especially more ways to combine items.

It has the right blend of awkward humour you would expect in a point n click together with atmospheric horror that Lovecraft would be proud to have written.  The voice acting was suprisingly good and Jim Sterling (son) did a great job, hopefully we will see more of him in future games.  The audio quality could have been better though.

The premise is real solid, with a weird Lovecraftian adherence to the weird and unexplained, but sadly that's where the enjoyment for me ended.

The first biggest problem for me is the dialogue. It feels like every character was written to sound slightly tired and distant, to showcase a dreariness to the world, yet unfortunately no-one seems to be able to sound like anything more than entirely bored and disconnected to the project. I made me skip ALL of the dialogue in act 3 because I couldn't bear to listen to a cast of people who seemed like they didn't want to be there.

This game is also criminally short, which doesn't give the premise of the story time to breathe. So before you so much as get into the groove of things. It's over with a tiny little bow on top, though it leaves a little more to use in a possible sequel. In simpler terms, this game is at dire risk of being played through and then refunded, since it can be beaten in 1.5 hours if you're quick. Yikes.

The puzzles in this game are also not the most interesting. They can all be just considered fetch quests with a liberal amount of backtracking which comes across like backtracking, the fact that act 2 & 3 essentially use the same art assets cements this bad taste.

I like some really key things about this game, but for $6.50 I would rather have gotten myself a burger.

Thankfully the first and the last chapters provide a conclusive mystery story concerning Alex and Robert, on a sad yet disturbing note.

It has come to my attention there will be sequel to possibley fill in holes left in this finished trillogy; which doesn't make it a trillogy if there's more than three, if I am not mistaken.

[b]SOME WEIRD EFFING SHIT[/b]

Seriously, this game is so freaking weird and unsettling. Don't play it when you've had a drink, whatever you do. You will completely lose your shit.

Serious review now...

[b]Graphics[/b]: The graphics are old school. As in original Tales of Monkey Island old school. But they fit in with the games vibe somehow and after the first few minutes, you barely notice it.

[b]Game play[/b]: Standard old school point and click game. Left click on things to use or pick them up, right click to get a description. Things which you pick up are stored in your inventory, which is accessable by moving your cursor to the top of the screen. 

[b]Story[/b]: (May contain spoilers) The Charnel House Trilogy is one game with 3 chapters. It is not 3 games in one. In the first and last chapters you play as Alex Davenport, a young woman who is about to embark on a journey to Augur Peak Island to see her childhood friend. The first chapter is set in Alex's apartment and the train station where we meet the second playable character, Doctor Harold Lang, who you control in the second chapter. The second and third chapters are set on the train. 

The story is really weird and doesn't make much sense until the third chapter - and even then you'll find yourself saying ""What the hell?!"" more than once. That's part of the allure to this game though. It's meant to be weird, freaky, and disconcerting.

I called the game a little horror gem and I did so due to its truly interesting story where you soon find yourself deep down into what I'd properly describe as a nightmare you can't wake up from where the characters' worst fears and guilts come to life to haunt them. It feels like one of those weird episodes of The Twilight Zone or a novel by Poe and it's truly surreal at times not to mention quite unsettling. On the other hand the gameplay sadly is only functional to the story and not much else, the puzzles are easy and even novices of the genre will probably never find them challenging or get stuck.

Last but not least do know that the overall story is never fully explained but only hinted at: this spawned a lively debate in the game forums with some interesting theories on what happened and why. There'll be another game coming out in 2016 and it'd clear things up a bit.

To sum things up I really enjoyed The Charnel House Trilogy and I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience a true and deep horror story, you can easily find it for 2,5$ if you peek around and at that price it's a steal.",1437577880,1437579301,True,2,0,0.53619682788848877,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Если не владеть английским на приемлемом уровне, то с пониманием сюжета будут серьёзные проблемы.

Графическая составляющая игры представлена в пиксельном стиле, что с одной стороны придаёт некий шарм и старину, но по большей части раздражает. Играя с высоким разрешением, на экране наблюдаешь вакханалию огромных пикселей размером с кирпич, что не только мешает понять происходящее на экране, но и очень сильно утомляет глаза. Окно игры удалось уменьшить только после тщательных поисков в настройках, но, не смотря на это, играть в окне размером в три раза меньше экрана компьютера — удовольствие крайне сомнительное.

По сюжету игра разделена на три главы: Inhale (вдох), Sepulchre (могила), Exhale (выдох). Неспешное прохождение в общем занимает около 3 часов. Повествование сюжета скорее напоминает книгу нежели игру.

В Inhale вы играете за Alex Davenport (davenport можно перевести как диван-кровать, что достаточно точно описывает героиню), которая недавно рассталась с парнем. Алекс уже взрослая девушка 27 лет, но при этом она всё ещё ведёт себя как ребёнок (да и выглядит как тинейджер). Именно этим она начинает утомлять за те короткие 15 минут, которые длится Inhale. Алекс пытаются представить как лентяйку и любительницу видео игр, но получается это не очень удачно. Наблюдать за действиями девушки и её переживаниями не приносит никакого удовольствия. Повествование постоянно скачет, невпопад поднимая разные темы. Особенно убивает когда сюжет резко переключается с хоррора на тему разрыва отношений. Апофеоз бреда выражен в сценке перед окном, когда Алекс начинает свои ""глубокомысленные"" размышления, смотря на улицу под дождём. Появляется непреодолимое желание в это окно выпрыгнуть.

В Sepulchre мы играем за второго возможного персонажа в игре Dr. Harold Lang. Диалоги (и монологи) доктора слушать просто невозможно (но это скорее моё не очень объективное мнение). Sepulchre получилась наиболее интересной и интригующей. У неё получается создать атмосферу мистики и загадочности, которая великолепно сочетается с жанром point-n-click. Единственная глава стоящая какого-то внимания.

Когда действия игры доходят до Exhale, нам снова возвращают под управление Алекс. После Sepulchre появляется надежда на ещё один удачный эпизод, всё для этого располагает, но нет. Повествование опять возвращается к сопливым проблемам Алекс. А сюжет снова мечется между темами: расставания, подросткового возраста и ужасов.

В целом TCH оставил после себя двоякие впечатления и в большинстве своём негативные. Единственное, что было сделано достаточно неплохо — вторая глава. От игры всё-таки можно получить удовольствие, но тех денег, что за неё просят, она определенно не стоит.",1435747092,1437802950,False,11,0,0.529872536659240723,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Also included is the story of a man who's got more skeletons in his closet than he wants to admit. If I had to equate it with anything, It feels a lot like Kubrick's The Shining.

The entire trilogy can be beat in one sitting, and because the game is so short, what could be interesting puzzles just end up being solved because there's little else to do. There is no old-adventure-game-puzzle-solving satisfaction for solving them due to this, but it's pleasing to continue the story without too much of a break.

The game is divided in 3 chapters (not three different stories Steam description, get your facts straight). The first one, 'Inhale' introduces the character of Alex with some witty and funny lines but also with a nonsensical and idiotic monologue : this chapter is mostly basic exposition and feels pointless.

The second one, 'Sepulchre', puts you in the shoes of Harold Lang on a train. This part sets up a genuine unsettling ambiance and does a great job at raising the tension up. This is an unpersonal horror story and the setting is the monster of this chapter.

The third one, 'Exhale', stars again Alex in the same setting as 'Sepulchure' but, this time, the horror comes from Alex's life : if you don't have empathy for the character, you most certainly won't like this part. Fortunately, I began to appreciate Alex but I'd understand why 'Inhale' could set some people off. This chapter was in my opinion pretty good, with a few moments that made me go ""Welp, this is a bit stupid"". Still, unnerving and scary with good characters.

Aesthetically wise, it masters pixel art to perfection and the music, while following the prewritten path of every psychological horror movie, works fantastically. The voice actors do their part accordingly (except for Madeleine Roux when her character is supposed to be angry and Jim Sterling, whose voice can be distracting if you thank God for him.). Unfortunately, the game's pretty short and kinda felt like a teaser for the upcoming game (it outright annonced it at the end!)

It's short though. I clocked in at 80 minutes for all three episodes complete, which is probably due to a lack of puzzles(and what few puzzles are in the game are simple ones). However, I enjoyed the story and the atmosphere quite a bit, so the short length leads to good, tense pacing.

There were a few small annoyances for me. The main character, Alex, comes across as kind of emo and annoying in the first episode(thankfully, she's a lot more relatable once she's on the train) . The other annoyance was the fact that Jim Sterling-son voice acting is intially distracting. It's not that he does a bad job(far from it) but knowing his voice from other places made it hard for me to see him as a character and not Jim Sterling's voice coming out of someone elses mouth.

I guess a sentimental part of me, coupled with my nostalgia enticed me to purchase this title, given the slew of positive reviews.  In short - I am giving this a very hesitant thumbs up.  While the story is engaging and mysterious enough, the game inevitably falls short with menial objectives, totally bizarre item placement void of logic, and overall a very short playthrough (I probably blitzed through the first chapter in 30 minutes or less).  So why the thumbs up?  To put simply - I want the devs to continue without being disheartened, and I always have a soft spot in my heart for indie point and clicks.

To keep things short, here are my points. 

+ Story is compelling enough to follow through to the end (Somewhat)
+ Dedicated chapters keep things in bite sized pieces
+ Voice acting, for the most part, is average
+ Graphics fall in line with the typical point and click genre from devs such as Wadjet Eye

- Character development is paper thin
- Overall length of the game is extremely short
- Absolutely no puzzles or challenge is required to progress

An interesting enough story that falls short in its execution with uninteresting characters and dialogue, and bizarre progression that seems to escape logic (even for point and click standards).  I would recommend it only to hardcore collectors of the point and click genre.

Now one might ask, why then is this marked as a positive review? Well, because of the last part of the game mostly.

First of all I want to say that I like many games that have been produced with AGS (Adventure Game Studio) and I have always have been a huge fan of adventure games like Monkey Island and other franchises. So I am speaking here as someone who appreciates games even if they do not come with   top notch 3D graphics (actually I prefer humbler graphics with good game-play and story!)

In any case, let me first get it over with the NEGATIVE aspects of the game:

1- It's quite short. 3 hours tops. Ok one might say “what do you expect for a $6,-- dollars game”. 
Well... more. There are other games adventure games made with AGS on Steam... for FREE and that gave me over 30 hrs of gameplay. Now I am not here to publicize another game, and even if such games are an exception, for 6 bucks one might expect a bit more than 3 hrs of game-play.
This is however the least negative thing, since I can forgive the shortness since it's from an independent studio.

2- No real game-play or puzzles. There is really no thinking process involved, except for following the story. We ARE expecting a GAME here... not just a visual novel. Maybe only a time or two I wasn't immediately sure what to do, but it was always very easy to figure out.
Ironically the credits also names a “puzzle designer”... well he did not bother too much. Sure I am not expecting (nor wishing) hardcore irrational puzzles like “King's Quest”, but at least some kind of challenge.
Heck I have seen good puzzles in free Flash games (like escape the room games)... so it's not an excuse. As I said one does not have to put necessarily very challenging puzzles like in games such as “The 7th Guest”, but the game should not be just a a movie you click through.
Also there is no possibility of losing. Not that a game needs one necessarily (you could not lose in Monkey Island games... except for very rare occasions perhaps)... still... challenge... it lacks challenge.


3- Some parts of the story... I will elaborate later, since the story is what mainly makes me give this game a thumbs up.

---

POSITIVE aspects:

1- Graphics: The game looks great. Character models, backgrounds, objects all look great and creat a great atmosphere. Of course if you are some 3d-graphics freak you might dislike retro-looking games... but I think personally this is a game that looked quite beautiful (also the retro look enhances the charm in my opinion!)

2- Music: the game shines here as well. I love the music and sound. They strongly contribute to the atmosphere of the game! 

3- Voice acting: it's quite good, most of the time... there are some moments where the voices sound a bit off... but mostly it was well acted, even better than some big studios games of the past!

4- The characters were quite interesting within the story and did not feel useless (as some do in many games these days).

--- 

Now the important beef! THE STORY!!!

I will not put any spoilers in.

The story, in a few words, was good, very interesting although somewhat lacking at times. I think it needed polishing here and there. It also leave you hanging for more... which I hope will come in the near future.

Originally there was only “Sepulchre” (ie chapter 2 of this game) which came out some time ago... and then, recently, they added “Inhale” and “Exhale”. 
This development unfortunately is clearly seen in the game as well and not in a postive way. Sepulchre feels out of place and in principle you could play “inhale” and “exhale” back to back without even noticing a part of the game is missing. This does not mean “Sepulcre” is bad or irrelevant though.

The first chapter, “Inhale” basically serves as an introduction for the rest of the game, especially the last part “Exhale”. This part of the game is short and almost pointless if it were not for introducing one of the main characters Alex (short for Alexandra I suspect, she is a girl and the playable character in ch.1 and 3) and her neighbor (who becomes relevant in “Exhale”).
There are a few pop culture references (like Bioshock) and some very good music... but for the rest the first chapter does not do much. It tries also to set the game up as some sort of supernatural horror... but there is no real pay off to it.
In the end chapter 1 seemed done hastily... as if it was actually the last part of production and slapped there to provide a back-story to the last chapter...

“Sepulcre” is the second chapter and follow Dr. Harold Lang (the other main character). This part of the game is very oniric, with Dr. Lang seeing the environment and atmosphere change around him. In this part of the game he never meets Alex, she is only mentioned in passing. This part of the game is quite weird, in a good way. Clearly Dr. Lang is on a personal voyage to confront himself with his dark past... which is however never fully explained or revealed. I think they should have dome some polishing on this chapter as well, but all in all it was good!

“Exhale” is the last part... the longest (I think) and no doubt my favorite. Basically the game turned into a very psychological story where Alex confronts her (recent) past and some very interesting revelations are made.
I will not spoil it... but to me this was the best part. I recommend the game just for it!

Unfortunately it ends in a sort of cliffhanger, which makes us thirst for more.

I sincerely hope that the “Trilogy” will not end here, but that there will be future installments.

–

CONCLUSION:

Not a great game... but LOTS of potential! I think there is also a huge potential for a sequel (which the story neatly sets up) and I think the team that made the game have talent. If they polish some aspects of  the game (eg puzzles and more refined story) the sequel could become a real gem!

In the end, although short, I did enjoy it a lot, especially the last part... so give it a try!",1432080239,1432080239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Charnel House Trilogy est, comme le nom l’indique, une trilogie. Ce sont trois jeux d’aventures de type point & click. Les deux premiers épisodes sont rapides, le troisième est beaucoup plus long.

A la fin du jeu, on se dit qu’il va peut être même y avoir d’autres épisodes qui vont suivre cette trilogie.

Ce que je regrette, c’est le fait que le jeu 1/ ne soit pas aussi en français (je suis sûr que j’ai du rater des trucs avec mon niveau moyen en anglais) et que le jeu 2/ ne soit pas disponible sous Linux et MacOS X (je suis très classique, les jeux indépendants doivent être sur toutes les plateformes d’ordinateurs).

Globalement, j’ai beaucoup aimé ce jeu. A la fin, on se pose tout de même des questions, qui, pourquoi, comment. Tout l’étrange que l’on peut trouver dans The Charnel House Trilogy, c’est ce qui me fait penser et rapprocher le jeu des écrits de Lovecraft.

Haven't had a good story with a good twist presented to me in a long time. 

Very impressed. 

Unlike Richard & Alice, the gameplay did not get in the way of the story. There is some backtracking, but it's between three railcars, instead of large expanses of frozen wasteland. 

The Trilogy: Inhale, Sepulchre, Exhale.

Inhale: Sets the scene with rather [i]broad[/i] strokes. Ends with a hook. 
Sepulchre: (Seems)(Almost) Completely unrelated to Inhale. A mental crisis. 
Exhale: Though not a FULL picture (at least to me, from the first playthrough), I don't hesitate to say the story was masterfully executed. 

As for the game: Incredibly simple puzzles. Voice-work that lives up to the prestige of the actresses/actors. 

I recommend this game; I think it could be argued just how horrifying the game is. It's psychological, to be sure, but I think that would be a more appropriate genre to define TCHT as (as with, for example, the movie High Tension). It's an awesome story... really, that's about all I can say, and that does it no justice.

At first I'll say I wasn't sure of what I was coming into or even what I was going to do in this game. The story ( which is the best part believe me) is very much mysterious. We start off with the main character Alex recovering from an emotional break up with her Ex-boyfriend. So Alex plans a trip to keep her mind off of things. The first episode starts slow and at times has screen tearing issues, which you shouldn’t see in a game as pixelated as this.The gameplay is point, click and read, nothing special. But the game delivers towards the end as you're waiting for your train to go to Augur Peak that's where you meet Harold Lang, a secondary character for what seems so far to be an ominous trip. So all in all the game starts out very slow paced and with a few bugs is definitely sub par, but the story left me intrigued enough to make it to Chapter 2, Sepulcher. I give Inhale a “Skip” If you could purchase it separately.Although the story is intriguing the screen tearing and rough slow start make it almost unbearable to trudge through

Chapter 2, Sepulcher of The Charnel House trilogy Starts off much faster paced and exciting story wise than the first chapter. you play as Harold Lang, a Doctor of Archeology you met in the first game making his trip to Augur Peak to review some ancient findings. During this chapter the game because far more “twilight Zone” based, some creepy scenes left me very much excited to see where the story would take me. After about 20 minutes of walking around on the train you departed in during the first chapter you find you’re way to a very creepy ending. This installment of the series doesn’t really need the first, but overall it was a creepier more satisfying experience. The main character was much more interesting than Alex was and it felt as though you finished playing a very well crafted creepy pasta game. With a great story and very well done dialogue to play off of I give Sepulcher a “buy” if you could purchase it separately. Even though it is quite short, it delivers on what the first chapter missed, bring on the creepy. 

Exhale the third chapter in The Charnel House Trilogy is quite amazing, the story that builds off the first chapter is intricate and exciting. From the get go you play Alex the first Chapters protagonist. continuing her journey right where we left off, on a creepy train… of the dead. Alex confronts her past relationship in a darker take on “A christmas carol”. She finds out the cause of her relationships mishap as well as what is actually happening on the ghost train she seems to have accidentally stumbled onto. This chapter was so brilliantly well written and put together, i felt like i had just finished a Stephen King novel. This chapter makes it or breaks it, with a superbly done storyline this chapter brings a whole new take on horror. If this were sold separately I’d give it a Absolute “buy now”.

The Charnel House Trilogy Comes together quite nicely, though some performance hiccups and slow to start, this indie smash horror hits home run in that’ll leave you curious for the next game to come in the series, and with a very creepy ending… you can bet there will be more. I give this game a “Buy Now”

Jde o krátkou freeware point-and-click adventuru Sepulchre, kterou vývojáři z Owl Cave uveřejnili na svém webu už před nějakou dobou, ""obalenou"" z obou stran dvěma dalšími kapitolami s názvy ""Inhale"" a ""Exhale"". Navíc celá ""trilogie"" končí cliffhangerem, odkazujícím k další postavě a dalšímu příběhu, takže se zřejmě můžeme těšit na další přírustek do série.
Jde o inteligentní a atmosférickou horrorovku, která těží ze současného comebacku příběhových point-and-click adventur v grafickém hávu připomínajícím zlatá devadesátá. Příběh, v němž hlavní roli hrají dva skvěle napsaní hrdinové a tajuplný vlak, který je unáší pryč od jejich zpackaných životů, obsahuje řadu odkazů na horrorové povídky E. A. Poea. Což je příjemná změna, když vezmeme v potaz, kolik lidí se poslední dobou snaží ""podojit"" dílo H. P. Lovecrafta a dalších autorů mýtu Cthulhu. Autorem příběhu, z nějž opravdu nechci spoilerovat vůbec nic, je scénarista Ashton Raze, jenž stojí za příjemnou indie miniaturou Richard & Alice, a který už má na kontě vlastní román Bright Lights & Glass Houses. Navíc se na příběhu hry podílela i autorka horrorových bestsellerů Madealine Roux!
Technické zpracování hry je bohužel poněkud nerovnoměrné. Pozor, neříkám špatné! Naopak, po většinu hry všechno funguje, jak má. Občas se ale vyskytnou protivné mouchy, jako například výrazně nižší kvalita hlasových stop u ""prostřední"" kapitoly Sepulchre. Navzdory tomu, jak super je, že si nezávislé studio dalu tu práci a nahrálo dabing ke všem dialogům ve hře (!), člověka prostě naštve když v jedné třetině hry hlasy zní, jak kdyby vycházely ze tři roky starého mobilu. Obzvlášť když herecké výkony jsou na úrovni áčkových titulů. Celé tři kapitoly jsem měl dohrané za dvě hodiny, avšak i přesto dokázala hra za tuto dobu jednou spadnout na plochu bez zjevného důvodu. Ale to se stane...
Kolem a kolem, The Charnel House Trilogy je krátký, ale atmosferický horror, který vám dá pár námětů k přemýšlení a místy způsobí tísnivou nevolnost (podobnou, jakou vyvolávalo Richard & Alice). Nejedná se bohužel o takovou jízdu, jakou je např. The Cat Lady nebo Amnesia: The Machine for Pigs, ale místy jsem si u hry příjemně liboval, jako když jsem hrál před lety prvního Gabriela Knighta. A to je co říct. Jednotlivé kapitoly bych hodnotil 80/60/75. Celkové hodnocení tedy vychází na 72% s tím, že vřele doporučuju hru koupit.
Už jen proto, abychom časem dorazili na Augur Peak a prohlédli si ho v plnohodnotné, alespoň čtyřhodinové hře :).

For how cheap it is, especially as it is on sale at the time of this review, it may be worth a pick up if you enjoy this particular genre of point and click.]

The Charnel House Trilogy, is a point and click project developed by Owl Cave, and recently released on Steam. It tells the tale of two characters on a train journey to the mysterious Auger Peak, and this is split across three sections - Inhale, Sepulchre, and Exhale - which form the ‘trilogy.’  
 
Having previously played the second act of this game, which was released as a standalone piece several years back as ‘Sepulchre,’ I was looking forward to seeing what The Charnel House Trilogy exactly was. Sepulchre had a very intriguing mix of Lovecraftian psychological creepiness, and grim morbidity - I expected a similarly enjoyable interactive story.  
 
That is just what The Charnel House Trilogy actually is - an interactive story. There is no real failure state; just a series of simple puzzles which are easily solved by paying basic attention and using basic logic. Therefore, the game rests entirely upon its narrative; because of this, I will try to keep to generalities, as to avoid spoilers. I would also like to quickly mention that the options menu/etc is completely fine - limited, but appropriate for the game.  
 
The first arc of the the game, titled ‘Inhale,’ is a seemingly self aware 15 minute introduction to Alex Davenport (voiced by author Madeleine Roux) - one of the two main characters of this game. While the player clicks around her apartment, Alex comments on objects in typical point and click fashion, in a condescending way which seems to be a form of satire on the genre itself; likewise, the chapter offers a lot of ‘in-jokes’ about the games industry/PC gaming/games journalism, which are obviously meant to appeal to the player. But they simply do not. Instead of being presented with a wry wit, they are just quite annoying, falling suspect to the things that they seem to be mocking. When you add in the cameos from people in games media, such as Jim Sterling and Cara Ellison, the first part of the game really just seems littered with references which do not offer any real grounding to the narrative. They do not sow the seeds of a committed pastiche (as The Bard’s Tale was to RPGs), nor do they offer any real comedic value.  
 
When the game reaches the second arc, however, the game does become more enjoyable. ‘Sepulchre’ switches to a more curious setting, with a better written, and more likeable character - Dr. Harold Lang. I was rather fond of this section when it was in the standalone form, but when it is played straight after the underwhelming ‘Inhale,’ a lot of the immersiveness and atmosphere is heavily mired. Whereas ‘Sepulchre’ is a committed confident ghost story, on a train with a layout which lends itself perfectly to the point and click genre, the questions it made me previously ask myself several years ago, are unnecessarily drowned by lingering memories of ‘Inhale,’ and confused expectations of ‘Exhale.’  
 
‘Exhale’ brings back the character of Alex, but it does not bring back the shortcomings of her previous arc. I actually found the character herself to be a bit more likeable, and the setting of ‘Sepulchre’ is recycled in an interesting way which lends itself to the gameplay. These points are far outweighed, however, by a complete change of everything which made the narrative in arc two enjoyable; the sly, creepy horror, which could have been a lost chapter of The King In Yellow, is now replaced with a frightfully naff stalker/ex-boyfriend… thing. It still takes place on the supernatural train, but this works negatively, because answers you expect are left vague, and the writing seems to adopt a method of not explaining anything, which just creates a covering of pretentiousness, rather than the gradual clever unveiling one would expect. 
 
When you wander from the narrative aspects of the game, there is actually a lot of praise to be given. The art style is beautiful, and definitely one of the more recent examples of pixel art done right. Likewise, the music, which is ever-present, but never intruding, provides a really gorgeous tone, which compliments the developments well. The voice acting is incredibly hit-and-miss, with poor writing magnifying a lot of otherwise passable lines (e.g. Jim Sterling delivers the one believable use of the word ‘fucking’ in the entire game). I found myself more inclined to just read the text myself, and skip through, more and more as the game progressed. 
 
To conclude, I would like to showcase one particular scene which explains everything I felt about the game at once: at the end of ‘Inhale,’ Alex gazes out of her window at the street across from her New York apartment - the soundtrack is very fitting to the fantastically drawn rainy scene. This is intruded, by a very badly written monologue from Alex - it reminded me of a GCSE creative writing task in style, with an uninteresting set of descriptions slowly ruining an otherwise pleasant visual experience. This echoes the game itself, which has one genuinely decent chapter (Sepulchre), overpowered by two completely unfitting ones.  
 
The game seems to hint towards a future installment in the Charnel House series of games, and it could be quite good, if it fills in the gaps that we are left with at the end of the Trilogy. The issue resides in the fact that these gaps are in a ground comprised of already ill fitting narratives, badly written characters, and aspects which will be tough to explain enjoyably.",1429757348,1429757348,False,32,1,0.69912797212600708,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The Charnel house Trilogy is a creepy 3 part point and click adventure. In terms of atmosphere, it's right up there with the best of them, and the writing is really well done too. It is psychologically harrowing but presented in such a way that nothing feels cheaply done. All the characters are fully voiced (Jim Sterling is in it!), and the art is really cool.

It should be mentioned that it's a very short game and the puzzles are simple to solve, so the onus is really on enjoying the story and getting caught up in the atmosphere. If you like interactive novels or Wadjet Eye's point and click games, this is definitely worth a look.

Story/Gameplay:  
A well written and executed suspense/thriller adventure game. No gameplay surprises here, this is traditional 90's point and click style. The puzzles are logical and not too difficult to figure out. The length of the game is dissapointingly short, I feel that the story could have been stretched out into a longer game with more locations.

Sound/Music: 
The music selection and sound effects are good and suits the atmosphere of the game. The performance of the voice acting is great, however you can notice that one of the voices has notably worse recording quality.

Graphics:
320x200 resolution pixelated 2D graphics, with some modern effects. The Charnel House Trilogy basically looks like a high-profile Lucas Arts adventure game from the early 90's. This style has a nostalgic charm to it, but the low resolution is rather harsh on the eyes on modern large monitors.

Conclusion:
A good but short game, the pricing is fair considering that. Hopefully the developer makes a longer game next time.",1429647085,1429648851,True,2,0,0.504240930080413818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I found this game rather refreshing. I tend to burn out on point and click adventure games some where around the half way point. When puzzles don't lend themselves easily to rationally explained or logical solutions; and you must resort to combining every item with every other item or try every item on every interactable object there tends to be an extreme amount of fatigue that grows exponentially. 

This game does not do that. Almost at every point. The inner dialogue of the player character or NPC's tell you, essentially, when and where to go. There is almost no puzzle solving. Or in some cases there just aren't any useless items to distract you from what may actually work in the situation. 

There are 3 chapters. The first, “Inhale”, being surprising and extremely short. Remains very well paced. [spoiler] and has a very strange reference to Ayn Rand and BioShock[/spoiler]The next 2 chapters “Sepulcher” and “Exhale” Both increase in length from the predecessor. However the whole thing is roughly 2 hours long.

I really like this look of this game. It seems sort of... childish. Which makes the things that are not childish that much more effective. 

The voice acting isn't the best. But that's mostly because the characters say things to explain things to the player. Things no one would ever say that seem extremely out of place. 

My only complaint is the ending doesn't truly wrap everything up. Its left sort of ambiguous. And some aspects are a bit predictable. Though I personally think the way its told make up for that.

All in all, nice little adventure game that doesn't overstay it's welcome., yet tells a decent story.

Though it’s split into three acts, each piece of The Charnel House is neither its own self-contained experience, nor a strictly sequential collection of three distinct stories. Each act may feature the same characters to tie them together, but it’s the subtle thematic elements that ultimately connect them meaningfully, requiring each part exist on its own so as to allow a better appreciation of the whole.

Everything begins with “Inhale”, the first and weakest episode but the one which serves to divert your expectations of what The Charnel House is before moving on to the main course. It’s the shortest episode and the one most grounded in reality. Alex Davenport is preparing to leave her apartment after a nasty breakup has left her life in a rather unpleasant place, too connected to her current residence to allow her to stay there any longer.

“Inhale” feels important because its tone is so drastically different from the acts which follow. There’s a lot of references to video games and gaming culture, at times being a little too self indulgent and making it hard to buy into Alex’s character when she’s constantly cracking jokes that tend to fall flat. This isn’t what The Charnel House is though, and why I feel it doesn’t largely detract from what follows. We’re introduced to the lead characters in a way that’s a little eerily unnatural. It gives the impression something is off about all of this without ever actually showing it, which left me unprepared for the horrific turn the next two acts would take.

“Sepulchre”, which was actually originally released on its own years ago, takes us away from Alex for some time to introduce us to Doctor Harold Lang and possibly the most important character in the game: the train our characters find themselves mutually travelling on. It’s an inexplicably empty locomotive for what is ostensibly a regularly used passenger train, and those who are present seem all too calm and deflective when asked where exactly the other passengers are.

“Sepulchre” is horror that is constantly trying to reassure you and tell you it’s not. Character interactions become odder and odder, hinting at histories neither you nor your character fully understands, as they continue to try to believe it’s all a bizarre dream. The act got under my skin the more time I spent trying to make sense of it all. Very little is ever shown, but it’s what’s included, and how increasingly distressing that becomes which truly terrifies. It’s probably the only episode which could effectively be taken on its own, but in the greater context of The Charnel House it acts better as a foreshadowing of what’s to come.

The final act, “Exhale”, is when the pieces are aligned and The Charnel House stops playing with supernatural horrors in exchange for the far more alarming terrors of reality. We meet Alex again, now on the same train as Lang, but in a wholly different environment of her own making. “Exhale” is more terrifying than either previous episode, and it’s do to its horror being a product of the world we live in.

The monsters here aren’t demonic abominations, but twisted, disturbing people whose delusions are unsettlingly real. The Charnel House never presumes to be more clever than it is, but that only makes the plain evil and panic expressed by its characters that much more affecting. It struck a nerve with me the way no paranormal entity could, each line feeling like a raw plea for help when nobody is listening.

Indeed it’s how relaxed everyone but Alex stays that hit home the most, mirroring the dismissive ignorance so often shown by people when someone tries to tell them something horrible is happening. Empty condolences are made, blind eyes are turned, and it’s not until Alex’s life is threatened that anyone seems to understand exactly the extent of what is happening. It’s a kind of intensely grounded psychological horror that I find most chilling, because it’s something you don’t want to believe is real even though you know it could be.

I didn’t know what The Charnel House Trilogy was going to be when I started it up. I assumed it would be narrative focused, perhaps in a traditional adventure game format, with a cast of familiar (and surprisingly competent) voice actors. What I got was a somewhat uneven, but ultimately remarkable horror story that seems to be only starting. Part of me is saddened by the current lack of resolution to many of the arcs began here, but more than that I’m excited with where this could go from here, having surprised me as much as it did.

That mix of the unexplainable within the eveyday mundane. 

It's magical, preposterous and at times hilariously willing to have fun along with the player instead of using the player as a prop for cheap jump scares or gross out horror, trusting enough that the player knows the beats as well as the author does and willing to have fun with that without making it impenetrable or offputting.

I think this is the closest a horror game has got to my tastes, it made me wriggle in my seat in parts, left me curious as to where it was going to turn next, smirking at the turns it did take and on more than one occasion, left me laughing like a drain at some of its more absurd moments.

The story is strong, engaging, and satisfyingly creepy. I quickly became sucked in to the gloomy world depicted and remained transfixed until I completed the game. I think what impresses me most about the narrative is what great job they did with the balancing and pacing of mystery. In a story like this, if too much is left unknown for too long things tend to become overly abstract and tedious, but if the story explains too much the 'magic' of not knowing is gone and things start to feel artificial. This game hits the mark perfectly, by the end of the game you will have some idea of what is going on, but enough unanswered question to leave you wanting more (and trying to construct you own theories in the meantime.)

Beyond excellent storytelling, this game sports a solid cast of voice actors in all its lead rolls. A few of the minor characters are a little underwhelming, but altogether everything is passable and doesn't take you out of the story. 

The graphics take the form of the classic adventure 2D style and are beautiful and well-crafted for the purposes of this game. Likewise the music is atmospheric, haunting, and fits the created world perfectly.

In terms of adventure game gameplay, things are fairly simple and straight forward. Not much in the way of puzzles beyond the usual ""What do I do with this object?""

So take my main criticism with a further grain of salt until I investigate it and update my review accordingly.

I haven't been this conflicted about a game in a while. Let's see, what it does well? The presentation, the music, the atmosphere are all excellent. This is a horror-ish game and the mood, pacing, suspense are superb. There are some banal elements here and there but oh boy, do I genuinely wish all horror developers learned from this game. The game is more focused on being unsettling than trying to be outright scary and that works out amazingly. The unique mood the game immerses you in is hard to forget.

The writing is solid, and the game tells some interesting stories, both explicit and vague. The characters are vibrant, distinct and interesting. The personal stories presented here are a very decent and satisfying part of this work. A certain theme is prominently present in the game, and while it can be considered technically kinda thrilling, it can also just as well be considered mundane. The metaphors and symbolisms surrounding the theme are probably some of the best I've seen, which is both impressive and slightly disappointing as a waste of potential. But wait, there is some intriguing underlying lore that can possibly redeem this if it's interesting enough. The whole Charnel House thing, yeah? If only the game actually told you, well, anything substantial about this story branch.

Which also happens to be titular. Oops. And that's the major shortcoming of the game as far as I'm concerned. It merely teases you with its titular story branch, only giving some bare hints at what it might be about. And look, I'm all for mystery but here the game leaves me in the dark about even whether I really like it or not since for me a significant portion of judgement depends on how interesting the underlying context is. But I can't evaluate it because the game doesn't expand on it that much. It does somewhat openly promise a sequel, and while I don't see anything wrong with that per se, it depends on the sequel a bit too much for my liking, remaining a very unfinished work on its own. Which also isn't inherently wrong, but it becomes hard to judge for me because of it. And well, there simply are better, more satisfying ways to present a mysterious unfinished narrative. There got to be. Also it's worth pointing out that I found Alex definitely sympathetic and I absolutely enjoyed learning about her life, but also I honestly can't say I like her enough to prefer that to some cool intriguing supernatural storyline. And since the game isn't called ""Alex's Life"" I dare to suggest this imbalance of story branch reveals favoring hers is a bit of an actual flaw.


So yeah, if you can tolerate vagueness, unfinishedness and merciless cliffhangers then by all means go for it. There is a lot to enjoy here and it does horror differently from how everybody else does horror. As you can see, I definitely enjoyed it enough for this to remain a cautious but positive recommendation. But if not, then I suppose you should wait for the sequel first. Because if the sequel provides a satisfying explanation, or a more satisfying mystery at least, then this was all very good apparently.",1429257819,1429295625,True,6,0,0.587967872619628906,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Even though the game is a tad short, the story more than makes up for it. It’ll make your skin crawl and you’ll come out of it with more questions than answers. Definitely worth it for fans of good stories.

Because that's basically what it was. It was, well, just kind of okay. 

The Charnel House Trilogy (which btw, ""trilogy"" is a huge misnomer) consists of three short (and I do mean SHORT) ""episodes"" or ""scenarios"" or whatever you wanna call em. 

The game itself is standard point and click adventure. There's really not much in the way of puzzles, but that's fine. The voice acting is... mostly good. There's a few that stick out as being terrible, but most of the voice acting was good.

The actual meat of the game, the story, is kind of what I have the most issues with. Without getting too spoilery, I'll just say that it leaves a little to be desired. I enjoyed it thematically, but there was really no resolution or conclusion. There's all kinds of really interesting story bits and hooks... but none of them really LEAD anywhere. They're just kinda sprinkled in there, for you to look at, I guess. 

Like a modern abstract painting, you get the feeling like it means SOMETHING to someone, but it's really just kind of lost on you. It feels like if I were watching a movie and it just ended halfway through. It honestly kind of feels like this game is just a preview for the sequel coming in 2016, which was hinted/teased at in the ending. Which, at this point, I'd be a little hesitant about buying it. 

Again, it's hard to recommend simply because the story really doesn't GO anywhere. But it only cost me 4 bucks, and it was interesting enough to hold my attention.

Game-play style is point and click, so you can expect heavy story focus with some logic puzzles mixed in. The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, so this should be accessible to those new to playing this genre, or anyone looking to for more of a story than a challenge. 

 There are 3 chapters, I ended up playing them out of order. I started with chapter two by accident and just went with it, and I found that it gave it a different layer of reveals that would not have been experienced otherwise. So if you're interested trying playing in that order

I really enjoyed the story, it was dark and it had some really good reveals.

Not a bad game but it is very short and more like a visual novel than a game. Point-and-click part is very easy and, with story being linear, it is basically 'use that on that in an obvious way'. Disturbing mood is nice and some situations are sincerely unnerving (but I'm scared easily). VA is ok, some voices are more ok than others, some are less; maybe people need more practice. Visuals are acceptable. Music is good for each situation: no blazing trumpets on suspence scenes.

The word 'trilogy' in a name of the game may give an impression that there are three games, but in fact there are just three scenes/episodes, first of which is very short. 

But I can't say I didn't enjoy the game. Could really go without video-games references in 'Inhale', though.  And with less cliffhanger at the end. While Alex story kind of ended up soundly, Kat's story and Lang's story (and writer's story and maybe Gloria's story) are all unresolved.

In the first chapter, Inhale, we meet Alex, a 20-something woman who seems to be working to overcome some hardships – a recent break-up that’s still in the forefront of her mind, a sick father.  Alex will be going on a journey. This first act functions mainly as a set-up for the rest of the game, and introduces us to the characters and themes that will be explored more deeply later on. Act 2, Sepulchre, was actually available as a standalone game for a while and is made stronger by the bookending chapters. Sepulchre focuses on Harold, who boarded a train with Alex, and has to deal with strange events that are happening. While Harold seems to be in an almost fugue-like state, Alex is plagued by her memories, which weigh heavily on her. Act 3, Exhale, goes back to Alex and does an amazing job at tying everything together.

It’s hard to say a lot about the story without giving things away, but the titles (Charnel House, Sepulchre) should certainly give you an idea of the direction it takes. While it is a horror game, it’s not scary in the traditional sense, but provides a gradually increasing sense of unease that worms its way in and turns into dread. The writing by Ashton Raze is on point. Dialogue goes from sounding completely natural to Lynchian levels of bizarre. The best praise I can give is that from Act 2 on, no line is wasted. Everything has a purpose, and is building towards something. It’s a very well constructed story with a self-aware script, and it gets better as it goes.

For a game that maxes out at a 320 x 200 resolution, not a pixel is out of place. The style is very reminiscent of the Blackwell series (Ben Chandler did work on both this and The Blackwell Epiphany). The character portraits that pop up during conversations are lovely and the backgrounds, few that they are, are attractive.

The soundtrack often blends seamlessly into the background, but when it becomes more prominent, it’s really quite great. I highly recommend playing this with headphones, I put them on halfway through and was immediately impressed by how great it sounded. The voice acting is competent. Madeleine Roux’s Alex started off a little flat, but got better as the game went on. I have no complaints about the rest of the main players. Jim Sterling did well in his turn as a too-friendly neighbour, and the smaller parts were also generally well done. Though to be honest, I can’t hear Abe Goldfarb without thinking of Joey Malone.

The game is light on puzzles, but since the story is the star, that works out. There’s no mindless combining of inventory items or pixel-hunting for objects. Gameplay is quite straightforward, and I think more challenging puzzles would have been a distraction.

I only have one real complaint about the game. Inhale is peppered with in-jokes and nods to the voice actors. In-jokes are okay, but the first 10 or so minutes of the game consisted of little else, so that it was a bit of a turn-off.  Once the game got that out of its system, the story started steaming ahead and I was more than happy to go along for the ride.",1429222209,1429222209,True,6,2,0.553466558456420898,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I wont elaborate on this because it will spoil the chilling and absorbing events that follow, but it will leave you deeeply engrossed throughout. 

The game mechanics are fairly basic which makes this a title that you can pick up and play straight away. Each chapter is fairly short though and solving the occasional 'puzzle' or what to do next to progress isn't all that challenging. These aren't criticisms though - the way the narrative champions itself outweighs any depth or difficulty concerns. 

The only real disappointment surrounding the game is the length - it will take you about two and a half to 3 hours to complete and the first two chapters are fairly limited although everything you accomplish has some bearing as the game flows nicely.

My recommendation: buy it, and play it at three in the morning with the lights off and a light rain pattering on the roof, like I did. Proper creepy.

I wont talk about the story much to avoid spoilers, so I'll just briefly mention on how it plays and feels.

It's a standard point and click with good looking 16 ( or 32? ) bit graphics which gives the  game a nice creepy feeling to it.
The music also does it job in creating the mood need it be relaxing or foreboding.

The puzzle's aren't always straightforward andrequire some weird thinking at times, but aren't completely nerve wrackingly impossible. 
Good for those who are thick like me.

The story has caught my attention at least and I can't wait to play the rest of it.

If you want to see some gameplay of it, I welcome to take a look of my video of the game.

Far from it.

The story of the game is your journey to Augur Peak, going there in the middle of the night ridding in a train that would change, explain, confuse and reveal everything to the main character that you play as, Alex, a young charming woman with a troubling life.

Along your fateful journey you meet all sorts of interesting characters from who knows when or where, and each of those characters have their own story to tell but all of them come back connecting to the main character, and to the destination Augur Peak.

The gameplay is like any other point and click of recent years, click on anything that is of interest, one that you can interact with, and the character you play as would then give her / his thoughts on the interacted object or person. Collect items whenever you think you can or need so that it can be used to solve a problem / issue later on, which aren’t that difficult and mainly goes with the flow of the game.

The game is rightfully creepy, the story is mysterious and grabs your interest and attention in the first five minutes of playing it. The story progresses as I’m in a fateful train, keeping me intrigued as more characters appear and nicely written dialogue backing it up. After entering the train I found myself playing as a different character, one with a.. somewhat confusing but still understandable and nice end.

As I walk through the hallway of the shadow of death in the train Playing as the first main character again, exploring and progressing through the game in the train and meeting yet new and old unexpected characters, revealing twists and turns throughout the end of the game. Speaking of the ending, it’s a great one as it left me hanging and excited to see and play the sequel, and it did it in a common sense and satisfying way.

The Charnel House Trilogy is a fine piece of point and click adventure game, one that looks great, plays good, and sounds wonderful, a game that I’d rank up high along side games like Blackwell Epiphany, but what I really loved about the game, aside from the soundtrack, is how dark and twisted it is, and how it has the balls to be dark and give dialogue that we barely see in other games, if there is any with such dialogue. It is a short game but a damn interesting and entertaining one, and gave me an experience that I I’ll never forget any time soon. After playing this game, I can’t wait to see what comes up next in 2016.",1429201075,1429201075,True,9,2,0.505827665328979492,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There is no conflict of interests making this disclosure necessary, but please bear this in mind when judging the balance of objectivity to subjectivity in my assessment of this product. It is because of this and the inherent flaws in a numerical rating system that I give no score.

The Charnel House Trilogy may not be a game in the conventional sense, lacking a challenge to overcome, but the alternative genre and take on point and click do not at all detract from the interactive narrative. And this is what sets it apart from so many of its would be peers on the digital shelves. Owlcave didn't make this choice vainly, in a gratuitous or vacuous manner; the genre and narrative serve each other well.

Mechanically, the game is competentently executed but not without flaws. The voice work seems recited rather than acted at times, a flaw that Exhale seems to soundly move away from. Variable resolutions would be appreciated, but my main complaint lies in that there is no option to mute sound on focus loss — resulting in rare sound artifacts and looping glitches while tabbed out if you happen to alt+tab at an inoportune time. This appears to be purely an inescapable glitch with the engine rather than an overight.

Narratively, I'm quite frankly astonished. Whether it be the genre's saturation or my own expectations, I expected quality but not quite this much.

The trilogy was originally Sepulchre, an installation in which doctor Lang, an archaeologist on his way to conduct research on Augur Peak and experiences a series of increasingly surreal events of a symbolism he is clueless about. Inhale and Exhale later completed the trilogy, more fleshed out installations that give the original context and bring it into the build up to what is setting out to be an intriguing canon by adding a fresh perspective to an uncanny journey. A journey where time, memory and identity are warped beyond the boundaries of sanity; a burden each protagonist deals with differently. 

Alex Davenport, protagonist of Inhale and Exhale, is a well rounded character that significantly strays from horror and alternative storytelling conventions by retaining a degree of roots to the mundane but not deluding herself into denying that she is departed from it. What sets her apart in this regard is that Exhale features a very well written transition from being suitably shocked by to actively partaking in the disturbing ride that something more twisted than fate conspired to involve her in.

Neither losing itself in the esoteric for the sake of padding its dialogue nor playing it safe, The Charnel House Trilogy is a short but oh so sweet breath of fresh air for the genre.
