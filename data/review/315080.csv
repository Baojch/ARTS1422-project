Sorry for the late reply as we were away for a few days. Here're a few things that might help:

1) Mission 1 IS a skippable tutorial mission - designed for expert players to skip basic RTS lessons

2) Mission 2 is not a resource gathering mission. You're supposed to build up a certain number of gunships and defend your base. You'll then be directed to attack an enemy base with your forces.

3) There should be explanations as you progress. The game at this stage will constantly remind you of your goals. If for some reason that isn't the case, you can press 'V' (default) to view your current objectives.

May I ask how this scenario actually happened? Did you load from a saved game and if you've bought the game only recently or quite some time ago?

Looking forward to your reply. :)

Thanks,
Jeremy"

Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library

TLDR: Finnicky interface. Does not register clicks. Multimap battlefield is clunky and adds little to nothing in terms of gameplay or flavor.

This somehow feels like playing Warcraft1 or the old Dune RTS. You build one thing at a time. Click a ton of times on units to select them and send them places. Sending through wormholes has the units go through the art for it and warp on a different tile past it. On-screen HUD info seems to obey standard conventions but i found myself looking around quite a bit for things that I felt should had been displayed but was not. Detailed info on units damage. Even flavor elements are lacking. No animated portrait or little blueprint schematic of the unit (Starcraft style). The harvesting is simplified to an extreme with the act of plopping down a refinery and having a little harvester go on its own to a ball of light and somehow gatheting something there. 

Unit selection worked by double/triple clicking and intercepting an enemy that is on route to your buildings can be surprisingly tricky.

Voice acting for clicking units features foreign voices but otherwise was well recorded and sort of worked nicely for me. The models for the ships and buildings was alright despite the somewhat dated look.

Conclusion: Ultimately I do not like the ebb an flow of the game and find it is easily outcompeted by numerous superior RTS titles. I would play Planetary Annihilation or Ashes of the Singularity or any space MOO-clone before dealing with this strealined and casualized yet clunky and unwieldy title.

First of all, sorry for the super late response as I was dealing with some very personal issues over the past 2-3 yrs and we're also working on our next title.

I'm sorry that the game didn't work out for you as expected. It's afterall our first commercial game released but we have no excuses either. Afterall, it's an old title and we were working under highly a restrictive environment.

Nonetheless, I'm grateful for your review and I hope we can improve on our subsequent games or if possible, Foresight 2.

Also, while at it, I'd like to know if constructing multiple buildings is a thing even if the building isn't available at the point of building?

We've intentionally kept harvesting to be as simple as possible but having a supply line if you want at ur own risk. Each faction harvests differently and the clouds do sometimes come up with nasty surprises. I'm not sure if there's something else you're looking for in the resource department.

Finally, yeah the UI's clunky; I'd hav done it differently if I can. Also, if you hav any strong suggestions, please feel free to reply to this response.

Thanks again for the review! It has helped me learn more about my inexperience and mistakes made back then."

(Add me if you want to play because I'm always down for a game!)

Now that the warning (and the expression of needing friends for the game) is over with, let's move on to the actual review.

From what I played of the SP campaign (only a couple of missions) it's a really thought out game. Although it is a bit awkward since the main character and Jun talk about something in their past. It's very vague and confusing for me. (Maybe it's explained during the campaign, I just have to continue playing in order to find out!) The game feels like a dumbed down 4X game. 

EXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate are all there with some dumbed down just enough to allow you to get into the action as quickly as you can. EXpand was dumbed down to the bare essentials, with a handful of buildings. The Command Center, a Refinery, a Shipyard, Energy Generators, Missile Defense Pads (I may be wrong on the name) and maybe one or two other buildings.

That being said, I know the game is more a space-based RTS than a 4X game, it doesn't hurt to compare the similarities. As the dev said in their response to the review, they since played down the 4X description. Of which I either didn't pay attention to when I added this to my wishlist, or didn't even know existed as part of it's original description. The game isn't true to the 4X genre and has abandoned a good deal of what makes up some of the elements in said genre.

And it did it well too, because makeing it more of a space-based RTS helped it bring a good level of strategy within itself. Due to the fact that the game is litteraly about strategy and thinking things through, which would not have worked out as well as it could have if it was 4X. I hope no one will think (or continue to think) I have the wrong impression. Because the impression of it being a sb RTS was always there.

Thanks for your review! Actually, Foresight is more of a space-based RTS than a 4X game even though it was mentioned a long time ago. We've since played down the 4X description. Sorry if you've gotten the wrong impression.

I understand the starting can bit a little awkward. We're learning from feedback like what you've written and will do better next time. The story will get more intruiging as you progress.

Multiplayer has a long background behind it. There wasn't even a lobby when we first launched. Good news is, we're going to launch a new multiplayer mode - known as Survival Co-op and Siege Co-op. It's known as the V1.10 patch and will also include some new stuffs as well! P.S. We can hook up for a game after the new patch is out (because it's a whole lot more stable than now) ... but our geographic distance can cause issues since we're using steam relay servers at the moment.

Meanwhile, you may want to try out a single-player skirmish map or two and see if the skirmish AI can entertain you better or not. Campaign AI is modelled to act based on their storyline arc. However, in Skirmish, all bets are off and they can be extremely brutal.

Please, feel free to make suggestions, feedback or even rant about the game.

Meanwhile, have fun! Hope to hear from you soon!

Regards,
Jeremy"

The story is of the human race in distant future when we (assuming the readers are human) have taken to the space and begun to colonize the space.The story is of a young commander who helps us fight off pirates and the likes. But before you read on be advised because I dont want to spoil the fun I am only going to give a brief outline.

So Earth has survived a nuclear armageddon and has survived, your job as a young commander is to colonize space, recruit commanders and build war ships to defend the base and all the natural resources available in space to us. In this way it's just like any other base building game.You travel through worm hgoles in this game. The difference is depth of story. Even though the story is linear, it is never monotonous or rigid, but instead in one word fun.

The gameplay is similar to all the classic RTS strategy games of the by gone era RTS games. The graphics are of the 80's sort. The music is fun but not overwhelming.But honestly once you get down to the dynamics of the game who cares even if it has no music. Because the game is fun to play, yet easily masterable.

There are many pros to this littile gem and relatively no cons, but to mention a few:-

PROS

1. Great tutorials
2. Good ingame music
3. Interesting storyline
4. Good graphics (80's)
5. Great level design and mechanics

CONS

1. You cant master the game without in depth knowledge of the game mechanics
2. Story is linear (But monotonous)

All in all this is a must buy for a RTS/ space based games fans. I rate it 7/ 10. Definitely a worthy buy if on sale.

[b]Few words about the game[/b]
Foresight is a RTS where you can lead your fleets into an epic battles in space. You're playing as a commander with a mission to recruit other commanders, that will help you both, forces and advice in battles. It's totally up to you how you will manage your resources!

[b]Advantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - Pleasant background music and sounds
[*] - Nicely written dialogues
[*] - Awesome artwork in cutscenes, makes pretty good wallpapers
[*] - Storyline seems quite interesting
[*] - Retro graphics design is very likeable
[*] - After one and a half year after release of the game, devs are fully active and game is often improved with pathes and fixes
[*] - Thorough and clear tutorial to introduce RTS simpletons like myself into the game mechanics
[/list]

[b]Disadvantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - Voice acting needs an improvement in my opinion
[*] - Minimizing the game / restarting the mission leads to stutters and even crashes
[*] - A.I. can't really cope alone at all, it requires constant control to be somehow useful
[/list]

[b]Summary[/b]
Full disclosure - I am not a real-time strategy games player, I played only few strategy games in my whole life and it's not my type of a game, but I'm trying to be reliable and objective in here as I possibly can.

First of all, at the first sight you can easily tell that devs love what they're doing. This might not be some great AAA top title on steam, but they're obviously trying their best in here (Look at all those news, patches, upgrades and even their responses to reviews). Their love towards their game is a huge advantage for game itself!

Now finally about the game itself, yay! Graphics looks old, indeed. But here it's not about graphics but about gameplay, so I like to think about them not as ""bad"" but as ""retro"". Music is not wonderful either but it's nice listen. I didn't got far enough into the game to fully explore its possibilities, but I clearly see all the potential in it and I will surely play more of it in future. Missions and battles themselves are highly rewarding, building up your fleets, preparing to battle and standing over destroyed ships of your enemies is awesome!

I'd love to compare this game to some other RTS titles, but as I've said before, my experience with them is quite limited. But there's one thing I've noticed in here and what is not that common from what I know. I'm talking about how tactical this game is. It's not about how big and heavy your fleet will be, it's about how you will manage to lead it. For example, commander ships can only shoot forward and it takes time for them to turn around. Without those ships, bombers and fighters become useless and if you're using little and fast battleships to flank commander ship, you're gaining a huge advantage. I might be a bit too into this game...

Yes, there are some cons to this game, but it's understandable and game is fully playable and totally enjoyable despite them. One thing that bothers me is why this game is not in early access? It's constantly updated and fixed for better and better AND it would avoid some negative reviews from people who review ""fully out yet bugged"" game. But I guess there's developers reason behind it.

So yeah, long story short, an exemplary game from an indie studio. Recommended for everyone, obligatory for RTS lovers to see its potential.

I like the voice acting, the ship design (mostly) and the UI of the game, and I totally think you should play this is you even only kinda like RTS's. But there is one huge problem I have with this game, and its the camera controls. The control are made just so that you can never really look where you want to look fast enough, or see much of the map in your FoV. 

The key mapping is super weird and is out of the way, but I couldn't seem to find an option to rebind them at all. Idk if you like slower camera controls, but it makes it almost unplayable for me. I put 4 hours into it to see if I could get past the camera issue, and I just couldn't. But I'm a cinematographer so I guess camera angles are more important to me that others. I didn't actually buy this game, I won it from watching Who's Gaming Now?! on Twitch, but I would have had to get a refund, no matter how hard it would be to give it up. 

Pretty much if you like RTS's you'll like this. It doesn't really do anything new or innovative, but it's enjoyable nonetheless

Well you can compare this game to such classics like The Outforce or Conquest: Frontier Wars and Starwars Empire at War.

You do build in Space a Base , collect Resources like in C&C  and can jump to other systems like in  Conquest: Frontier Wars. So the map is separated in sectors like just 4 to. 20 or more.
in each sector you can build a base to collect resources and they all are connected with wormholes. 

You have 3 Factions here, 2 really on energy like in C&C, so no energy no turrets power and slowly production, the other is unique, they need blood banks. Not enough blood and you units start to lose Hit Points.

Units are like in Starwars Empire at War. So you can build from small scouts to huge Capital Battleships. 

The Unique idea is here you must place fighter and bombers in bigger ships to move them around, like the Protoss Carrier, but you build them in Shipyard, not on the capital ship. 
Lots of Corvettes, Gunship and other support ships are here too.

Well best part is the unit limit, to increase this you must get a ""Fleet Captain"" on a ship, that you can assign ships to him. So you have like limit for 10 units, Assign them to the captain and now you can buy another 8 units and so on. 

So if you loose a Fleet Captain you have like 18 Units and cant buy more units. Because you are with 8 units too high by the limit. Pretty interesting mechanic in my Opinion. 
In most RTS its just some kind of house that is placed somewhere randomly. Here its you fleet commander. Story is challenging and interesting, the AI is like in Tiberium Wars, the game itself feels like an Space C&C. 

You can by the way choose here the Tech Level like in Red Alert 1 or set the Amount of Start Resources. Like in Starwas Empire at War you can increase the game play speed, yes you have game speed controls here.  

For this game I can put my Hand in fire, an extreme good AAA Indie RTS game.",1444120710,1444120723,True,2,1,0.34777599573135376,0,True,False,False,False,,,

---------------------------------------------
As i finished the Game i was curious about the ending, the Ending Itself was made with a ingame Scene where a short more info about the Story is shown to the Player. Update the updates i also Rated from 8.2 to 9 for the goodie´s Released. The Game will be Continued for sure cuz it shows some things, but what will happen next? Dunno, i can´t wait for more of the awesome Foresight RTS series!!!
I was really unsure @ first cuz some Screenshot were so confusing about the Gameplay and other things. 
But you should really try it´s worth all the about 7x Hours i have played by now and it´s my #4 of most played games by now too!!!! (doesn´t that say much?)
The Gameplay itself feel compared to other games similar to Command&Conquer+Homeworld mixed in one game. This is also why i would Recommend it to any RTS player that like a good, Demanding diffculty sometimes and yet a chilled simple controlled game with Brain using.
The Races have Weapon´s,Skill´s and Tactics, Effects that you need to work out yourself 
(the NSAU was so demanding hard to me with turrets while SS/UNC were so easy to master for me)
Weapon Effects like Nuklear missle and Poison etc should be handled CAREFULLY!!!
They will Destroy sometimes not only one ship and can cause a fleet Destruction!!
The Man behind this Game (Jeremy) is awesome and hard working! When i discover Bugs he always want to see and help me (this makes him a very very good Developer since not many Dev´s are like this!!!)
I will Recommend this game every time you ask me!
Last thing to say, i hope this game will get more than just this one Title since i would love to see more than just Foresight (Foresight addon, Foresight 2? etc)
I hope i Read in some Year/s maybe more from the awesome Series.


Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:

Gameplay: 9/10 (because its simple to use with fleets, innovative and has varity´s!)

Graphics: 9/10 (Direct-X 9 engine, but it looks Just so Beautiful and can also be very Demanding on your System!)

Support: 10/10 (Never got better Support and fast updates when i Discovered Bugs!)

Price: 9/10 (highter than most think maybe worth, but its Price per Hour is very low with about 0,35 Cents per Hour played to Complete only the Main Story Plot!!!)

Story: 9/10 (I am a RPG Lover so a Great Story is a must have for Games i play, i say this RTS has such a good Story. It also doesn´t keep the Story away like most games do. It always gives a bit of Story even in Missions they Talk about the Story Plot so be careful not only to fight and Read carefully in fights!!!)

Sound: 8/10 (Music is very good, but can be Annoying if you want to play the game without Breaks. The Music feels to short in longer Missions)

Performance: 9/10 (is very good but can drop a lot in Maxed fights!)

FAZIT: 9/10 (well made game and worth the price if you don´t own! already)",1436289363,1436989225,True,5,0,0.465527594089508057,2,False,False,False,False,,,

The voice acting, I've been told this is to be improved though.

So I start a game, it takes almost a full minute for it to load all the assets for the mission, and then puts me in. While in the mission it will barely keep up with me - as if i'm running a windows 95 device.

As for what I don't like about it, the voice acting is horrid and the graphics aren't really reflective of modern day technology...the UI and camera controls (you can't rotate the camera and your zooming is limited) remind me a bit of Star Trek Armada from back in the day.  Base and turret building are present, but limited...there's just not a lot of building options here.  I do like the idea of building fleets and in doing so, your population cap will actually get smaller...at least that's how my experience went.  I essentially built ships until I hit my pop cap, hired a fleet commander and a fleet advisor and assigned them to the largest ship, then put them all into a fleet...then rinse and repeat.  There are three different factions and a skirmish mode, which I do like and appreciate.  I also like the wormhole/gate/sector system as it reminds me a bit of ""AI War"".

If the price were lower (say $5-$10), I'd give this a recommend.  As it stands, you can buy ""Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity"" for $20 which has (in my opinion) better graphics/camera controls and more depth (tech trees, more resources, etc).

Thanks for your review! We try our best to keep things as reasonably simple as possible while maintaining a reasonable amount of complexity in the game that might not be that straightforward or obvious.

Please allow me to explain:
- Assigning ships to a fleet reassigns the command point usage to the fleet instead of you. That explains y ur population usage dropped but your cap remains - it'll never drop.
- Positioning is one of the keys to victory. Ships are punished for exposing their rear or flanks.
- Having a slim tech tree allows you to focus on building for war than for tech. We have plans to expand more into the tech side in the future.
- Scouts can actually extend your ships' firing range. They're not just for reconnaisance only. (When ships are selected, holding Ctrl shows your ships' maximum range in red circles)

We sincerely hope that you'll take another look at Foresight if you can in the future.

Thanks again!"

Ever since then game has improved weekly, problems that are posted are getting fixed and improvements that make gameplay clearer are being added.

I have reported numerous  things about this game and I have noticed they all get fixed in matter of days.

Foresight team doesn't seem to be afraid to do major changes either to not just to make their game sell, but to make it really good.

More about the setting : http://foresightrts.com/introduction/


[u]Lets get this party started.[/u]

I have prepared three different secments : Interesting, meh and the "" ""why oh why"" section.



[b]First interesting stuff:[/b]

 [i]Fleet system with levelling commanders [/i]

 Commanders gain passive abilities when their skills improve and they have their own AI personalities, such as defensive,competent, intelligent.

 - You have  fleet bars with  information in them, allowing you to use all your number keys for buildings and scouts while focusing larger groups to fleet F-keys.

- Fleets ask for units and post suggestions: like "" requesting five fighters or want to go sector x"" , you can just double click to approve them.

- Killing fleet commanders hinders your control over them. You need either main hero or alive commander to control fleet.

- Ai controls fleets in combat automaticly hitting their strongest targets and based on commanders personality either flee like chickens or take it like a man.

- Commanders can die and will try to escape to other ships when they are losing.

[i]Unique take to scouting.[/i]

- Every  ship has  limited detection range and larger attack range... because this game has detection units.

- Scouting is vital. Scouts allow you to shoot farther and recon new areas and secure sectors as beacons.

- Dormant mode allows wide area fleets scans. You know what I mean when you try it.

[i] Weaponising resourses [/i]

- You can use stuff like gas clouds as minefields.

[i]Factions [/i]

- UNC  ( United Nations Confederation ) is an anti tecnology faction that uses "" safe"" tecnologies as railguns and missiles, being the "" standard""  faction. Asia based.

-SS ( Slavic Sirerians)""the aliens"" : Use chemicals and bio weapons ( yes  chemicals and bacteria in space.) Are mostly male and somewhat ....manly. Slavic based.

- NSAU ( North-South American Union)  : Is high tec faction that uses beam weapons, shields and .. this one was new to me check it out : Portable power generators AND mobile resource harvest buildings. America based.

[i]Zone based space travel[/i]

 Fleets use wormholes to travel  splitting all maps in to sectors enabling tactical attacks from multiple sides or really nasty choke points. 

You should REALLY read the story about why there are wormholes close to earth: http://foresightrts.com/wormhole-anomalies/

[b]Background story and progression[/b] 

[i]Background story itself  is good, but its presentation..[/i]

- You live on humanity's own mess up pile, they nuked their own planet, messed up space travel in worm hole experiments and fight against each other in the progress.

-  Read  background story before you play the game, more of the stuff makes sence then. Voice acting being one of them. 


[b]   MEH aspects.[/b]


[i]How the story is told. Is a huge potential meh [/i]

Some of the charecter commendaries are confusing and then there is voice acting. There are tons of negative comments about it and it can ""Sound"" atrocious.. least till you  bothered to read faction backstories from the web page.

- UCN is mostly asian based none of them have native english its just common language.
-Slavic Sirerians have intented slavic accent.
-NSAU , well they are english. If you want to hear english : check out NSAU

Voice acting actually was on most part design choise, also I heard from Jeremy that most of the voice actors were Volenteers, this is a small budget game after all.  (update : He changed pug's voice now ! )

[i] The Artificial intelligence [/i]

You really either hate or love this.

I got my ass kicked when I commanded everything myself. I had to learn to "" let go"" in mass fights and let the ai do its job.  It's not clever enough to start entire sector wide campaings with blizzard level of magnificience but its good enough be left to handle mass fights IF you do not order them too much.

I have seen ai do stuff like
- Cautious AI commander abandonts its fleet and runs. 
- Clever one focus fired enemy commanders down
- More ruthless one totally ignored defense positions and just blew generators to kingdom come.

Then again I also saw this : "" Requesting attack to sector x"" .. my OWN base was on that sector. 

[i]Music and sounds[/i]

 Mostly background style music on neutral level, not something you'd want to burn on your harddrive and listen as separate ( As example age of wonder's sound track),  don't expect that, and the music's and sounds are good.

[i]Graphical presentation[/i]

Apparently game was made by choise somewhat simplistic, to allow larger fleet fight. This means there is not much eye candy.

Nor eastern eggs, nor cards. Stuff like that is on works. 


[b]And now the ""why oh why""[/b]

[i] User interface[/i]

 I will first state that this is on rework apparently next patch.  Currently its complex.

- Makers made the keybindings based on their own localisation, this resulted some farts like: repair key being altgr + 8 for eu player .  

- Creating fleets and assigning advisors is clumsy.

- It's hard to remove units from fleets and to add them to other fleets.

-Fleet view at times doesn't view fleets but instead your main commanders face.

And small stuff like that.

[i] I want my skip button [/i]

While they already added options to skip things there is no way to skip in game cutschenes yet, and seeing them half dozen times on retries can be a pain.

You can't skip end and defeat score screen either.


[i] Steam ui hates this game [/i]

Standalone game works fine, but run it in steam you have issues like game crashing on alt tab.

[i] Multiplayer needs work [/i] 

 Multiplayer is somewhat complex and well, de syncing on large games.

[i] Simple design makes game bland[/i]

Not much to explore in this game, it focuses on execution and battles so the space is just full of small stars, not much debris asteroids or things like that.

[i] Polish in clarity needed [/i] 

Some things are hard to pick at, fleet locations, ally locations, you have to access minimap manually instead seeing it all the time but this is on works.

[i] Tutorial sucks[/i]

But can be skipped !



[b]Summary :[/b]


Foresight is a space game placed on era where humans have nuked earth and ruined space travel with wormhole experiements, telling story of Thomas Locke UNC commander who will see quite a bit duing the game.

Game is simple on the eye with decent sound score and good but optional backstory accessable from webside along with three fairly different factions and playstyles, that relies on semi ai controlled fleets  that can be used to fullest in zone based combat areas.


While having lot of potential, it currently suffers from few ui optimisation issues as well as background based voice acting.  

The game itself doesn't have fatal bugs.

As the game is now I'd give it 67/100 but it has potential to be  75-80 game and it will be, the dev's are very active, contact players and discuss their ideas openly.  Give it a chance, I did and I don't regret it.",1419237092,1439117894,True,58,2,0.855290710926055908,6,True,False,False,False,,,

One thing the developers did wrong though - they should have launched this as a work in progress. That would have avoided the tons of negative flak.

Those that caused the war have long since fled Earth for the distant galaxies. As planet Earth slowly died, the survivors eventually have to face up to the inevitable and go in search of a new habitable planet. At the same time an experiment with dark matter creates a spatial anomaly, causing multiple wormholes to open up across the galaxy. In an instant, distant worlds that were once light years away can now be reached within a matter of days or even hours. But as humanity ventures in to the unknown, dangers await and battles for survival will ensue. With those responsible for the nuclear war at large somewhere in the galaxy, will they be friend or foe, or have they become something even worse?  Do other dangers exit?

Foresite is a real time strategy game. In hindsight foresite is not  ""Redefining Strategy in RTS"". I was hopeful for foresite however at the start the game really did not shine the voice acting is bad and the tutorial is very slow paced and this immediately put me off the game. I stopped playing at that point however I decided to give it another try, I started a single battle and this was a much better experience to me. It plays like most rts games you have to develop your base, generate units, defend your base and attack the enemy base. The game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS games your units each have unique attributes such as you can build large, slow, tanky ships, fast scouts, units specialized for structure damage etc. 

Your structures are your base, power generators, ship manufactury, turrets etc. The number of structures you can have are limited by the amount of power you have and that is limited by the number of generators you can create.  The number of ships you can control is dependent on the number of captain points you have.

The soundtrack of the game is fairly catchy and some epic music is well placed in an epic fight. The game itself doesn't look ultra HD nor do I think it needs to.


The game play is fun but I do not see to much more in the way of strategic options than in any RTS game, once you get past the tutorial the game is fun though.

If you enjoy other RTS games then you will probably enjoy this one to, my first time playing I thought this game was not worth playing but after my return to it I believe it deserves a chance

I'm sorry that Foresight isn't up to your standards. I have seen you opinions and do look forward to hearing more from you in the future. In the opening scene before the 1st mission - the ""elevator music"" was supposed to be part of the environmental sounds. But I do agree - yeah there should be a more appropriate kind of music there.

We've made quite a few improvements on Foresight over the last few months based on feedback. Being marked released doesn't mean we aren't listening. To be very honest, having people to enjoy playing Foresight is more important than making money from it. 

Therefore, I'm kindly asking you to give Foresight another try.

Foresight isn't about micromanagement. It's made in a way so that you'll be able to focus more on tackling your enemies rather than to worry about production lines and build order.

Let me put it this way: 3 points:
1) Automation - Foresight reasonably automates typical RTS chores. We've further enhanced the game to make this automation even easier. The process of creating a fleet has been simplified further. Ships and fighters now take a safer route to your ships by default. All ships can enjoy being assigned to a flight path across the sector map.

2) Fleets - Fleets extend your command. The fleet commander assists you by requesting for ships and directions. A fleet advisor helps attain intelligence via unconventional means, allowing your fleet to see what lies ahead. They're not a typical unit group which awaits your orders. The fleet commander will also perform some micromanagement as well. Though I'm looking forward to improving this part of the fleet commander AI in the near future.

3) Strategic Relevance - it's in our game design beliefs that a good RTS should reward players for implementing the right strategy and battle plan. As such Foresight does reward you for performing flank attacks, rear attacks, ambushes, blitzkreig and blockade running (which checkmates your opponents). Many a times these battle plans have little relevance in typical RTSes - it's always one huge army vs another huge army. In Foresight, the largest navy doesn't always win. Spamming the largest ships may not always be the best solution.

In conclusion, I totally respect your opinions. They could be formed because our tutorials didn't do a good job or their voice acting was so bad that they make you cringe. My only hope is that you'll give Foresight another chance one day. Hopefully, you'll change your mind by then.

Thanks!
Jeremy

The game has 3 factions, each one has different units design and the factions way of playing/base building is different from one to another.
The narration is ok in my opinion I don't understand why the other people are complaining.
The graphics look old indeed but that's for you to judge if it's a bad thing, I personally like it. Old games are one of the best in the RTS genre. :)
The game doesn't necessarily bring so many new things to the RTS genre, it's however different but still alike with other Real Time Strategy games regarding the resource gathering, units battle, units production population  etc...
The multiplayer sadly is not as I expected, you need to request the IP of your friend in order to play and if you don't have a friend, multiplayer is not an option for you.

I recommend this game if you look forward for diversity in the RTS genre but if you are looking for a game that offers a good story that makes your tears drop (like SC2 did for me), a good competitive level gameplay and intense multiplayer, you should go search for other games.

I'm not sure if it's appropriate to share my thoughts but I'm sincerely grateful for their feedback and yours as well. I do hope that they could at least take another look. The game is evolved over the last few months - I won't say it's a totally different game but it's definitely more streamlined thanks to community feedback.

Please feel free to copy and paste the response below onto your youtube video. Thanks!!!

Dear all,

I'm the developer for Foresight RTS. I've seen your comments. Regardless of whether if you like Foresight or not, I thank you all for taking a look. Yes, there had been issues with the game due to our lack of experience in the field. But we're catching up, listening to feedback, improving the game and adjusting the price to the best we could. More improvements, bug fixes and contents will be coming in the near future.

Despite being marked as release, Foresight is still developed like an early access title. We're still listening to your feedback and will implement the necessary changes to improve the game further. We will do whatever we can to make it better for you guys to play.

Our main game website is here www.foresightrts.com - here the information on all the faction can be found.

Please allow me to summary what Foresight really is:
1) Automation - Enough of all those typical RTS chores. Let Foresight do it for you intelligently and reasonably. Leave build orders and production management behind; Foresight will automatically choose the lightest load for ship queues (unless you specify otherwise)
2) Fleets - Nope these aren't unit groups. Fleets are created with officers who will help craft the fleet's composition of ships and requests to move, attack, defend and so on. They talk to you. You make the decision and ultimately, the responsibility.
3) Strategic Relevance - I'm not saying that NO RTS games do that. But we've designed Foresight to reward players who think strategically. Think of flank attacks, rear attacks, ambushes, blitzkreig, defensive battles, counter-attacks ... You're rewarded by design when you execute these battle plans successfully.

No, there isn't any silver bullet units that will crush your opponents. Building the largest ships simply won't do. You need to have the right combination to counter various potential threats. Fighters are nimble, but bombers will really do the damage if you're not careful.

Have a closer look, I'd say. If it's still bad, we're all ears to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. :)

Regards,
Foresight Team

However, I'm wondering if Foresight had been rendered correctly on your machine or not? I'm asking because several of our customers did have a problem with Foresight and their graphic card settings (or profiles).

I'm not asking for a change in review. If the graphics appear correctly and it still poor in your opinion, I'll accept. :)

The operating menu has been improved. Though I'm thinking of having an instant pop up menu that allows you to change several options on the fly instead of having to go through the whole ESC -> Options -> etc etc.

As for the game - if you're referring to UNC ... their ships are meant to look old even when set in the future. This is due to the game's storyline where technology progress was held by the Council of Foresight.

Please have a look at the Sirerian and NSAU ships as well via the Single Battles. Of course, if they still look old to you, I'll accept. :)

Foresight has been improved thanks to community feedback. We take feedback as guidance - good, bad or angry ones. It's our hope that people will enjoy Foresight as a game of strategy with scale.

We'll continue to improve the game to bring in more free game modes.

I hope you'll take another look at Foresight again one day.

Thanks!

I am happy to see that the dev/publisher did not drop this game and made the improvements and fixes that where necessary.
___________________________

Today's RTS options are rather limited and i was hoping Foresight would change this.
Sadly it dose not...let's get into it.

I am going to let you know from the start that the game feels rushed and unfinished. It feels more like Early Access rather then release material.
It has forced vsync... which creates mouse lag... in a RTS game this is not acceptable.
You can work around this... for nVidia users you can create a profile for the game in the nVidia control panel, and force vsync off. This will resolve the lag issue and unlock the frames. 
There is NO controls menu.. so never-mind changing keys on a PC tittle... you can not even see what the controls are... and the tutorial dose not do the best job of pointing them out.
The voice acting in the game is nothing short of terrible... it would have been better with text only.
The graphics... are bearable for a tittle of this price but i seen better graphics on games that cost half as much.
The AI dose not prio attacking units from structures and it just mindlessly plunges ahead shooting the first red thing it comes across regardless of whatever else it has around. At least this is what i found from the first 3 missions which is all i could go through before being to frustrated to continue. This is mostly because of the awkward controls and the lack of information about the controls.
Because i did not play past the third mission i can not speak to the actual strategy in this game... what it prioritizes, what are its values or what approach it takes.
It's not all bad... there are some good ideas here.
The squadron / fleet concept is very interesting from my perspective and so is the sector mapping, the artwork presented in the cut-scenes is top notch! But all of these pale if the gameplay hinders the player.
I do not know why Strides rushed this tittle out...but i got a sneaking suspicion (the usual reason) 
I hope they will be allowed to continue the development of this project and that in time we will get a decent RTS out of it (at least...)
For now however i can find no justifiable reason for spending 23 euro on this version...maybe if you are really REALLY passionate about RTS games...maybe then.
What else can i say... another sad day for RTS fans...unfortunately we kinda got used to it by now.

For a clearer view on the game you can watch my first impressions video :

+ Its an RTS with ok graphics (Older Graphics)
+ It has a general feel of a futuristic world using the cut-scenes between levels to give you a little background etc.

the bad:
- Voice acting is still HORRIBLE
- For some reason Alt-Tab doesn't work properly , it might force you to close and re-open the game if you want to continue (Sometimes the mouse seems to not appear after you use Alt-Tab)
- This time i couldn't even pass level 2 it was when i found the controls didn't seem to work - i couldnt create a fleet even after finding out what controls to use
- Missing important information like how to create a fleet (it tells you to build 5 gunships in level 2 but doesn't give you enough resources - when you try to build , it says you have to create a fleet - but how ? , had to figure it out on my own)
- After playing the game for a few hours i noticed the ""i"" button on my keyboard stopped working - i did a system restore with the only change being forsight un-installed (i literally did nothing else)
and the ""i"" button started working again - i have no idea why , maybe the devs would want to take a look at this
- Its also missing things you would expect in a game like tool tips when you place the mouse above the unknown resource that looks like a star - command points (what is it , how do you get more of it etc)


Overall its an ok game , it has some nice ideas like officers controlling fleets etc
it does remind me a little of Conquest: Frontier Wars - an older game i used to play
it still has issues and i still cant say its a great game - needs more work , but the devs do seem interested in what fans have to say
in improving their game - that alone might convince you to give it a shot",1417224633,1445027880,False,13,2,0.460240870714187622,11,True,False,False,False,,1424763842.0,"Hi Shade,

Thanks for your review and opinions of the game. We've since made improvements as much as we can over the last 1-2 months or so.
