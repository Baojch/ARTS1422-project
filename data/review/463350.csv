My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706666842,1706666842,True,2,0,0.490566045045852661,0,True,False,False,True,,,

A história tem uma sinopse interessante e começa bem, mas acaba sendo muito apressada na parte final. Os personagens (com exceção da protagonista), são rasos e pouco desenvolvidos, porém há alguns side-quests no final onde o passado deles são mais explorado.

Gráficos são decentes (se levar em conta as limitações do RPG Maker VX e seu estilo ""quadradão"") e o jogo evita usar o RTP (gráficos e sons padrões da engine). Os personagens são num estilo parecido com os do RPG Maker XP ao invés de usarem o padrão chibi do RMVX. Uma coisa que não ficou muito boa foram as imagens de rostos dos personagens que aparecem nas caixas de dialogo (facesets), pois não combinam muito com o gráfico do boneco (charset) e aparentemente não faziam parte da primeira versão do jogo (dá pra notar pelas cartas colecionáveis).

No mais, Storm of Spears é um jogo de RPG Maker bem mediano, além de curto e fácil. Mas também é barato, possui conquistas fáceis e eu o considero melhor (ou menos pior) que outros jogos do mesmo desenvolvedor, como ""The Chosen"" (pelos gráficos e por ser um jogo completo) e ""Subterra"" (por ter sidequests). Fora que a história, mesmo com suas falhas, ainda é melhor do que algo genérico do tipo ""sou o escolhido e tenho que derrotar o demônio com uma espada lendária"".

In fact, I actually enjoyed it. It has some original assets, a decent story, and some optional content.
The weakest part is the combat. Each party member only has a limited selection of skills, so it’s not hard to figure out what works best. Also, it’s not balanced. For example, the wizard strongest attack is the default one, making his skills useless. The game is easy overall, with only the final boss throwing a few surprises at you. At least there’re no random encounters, you can pick your battles on the field.
But other than that, it’s not too bad. You have big dungeons to explore for treasure, although some locations, like the final town, are a bit too big to travel. The sprites don’t really match the character art, and I think its because this game was originally called Vengeance Road. If you check the Steam Trading Cards, they have that title, with matching art. Those anime girls’ portraits just make no sense. They’re just there for boobs. Also, “Vengeance Road” actually makes sense for the title. No character can even equip a spear, so “Storm of Spears” is just silly. Also, the girl in the cover is nowhere to be seen.
That aside, the game is cheap, even without a sale, so is it worth your time? Well, there sure are a lot of better RPGs available, even using the RPG Maker engine. However, there are also a lot of worse ones. This one sits in the middle.

Главное — хорошо промазать коржи кремом и оставить их пропитываться 6–8 часов. К созданию кулинарного шедевра могут присоединиться даже маленькие повара. Ведь им обычно достаются самые большие кусочки!

Ингредиенты для коржей: 	

Мука 	2 стакана
Сахар 	1 стакан
Яйца 	4 шт.
Сметана ТМ «Рудь», 21 % 	1 стакан
Сода 	2 ч. л.
Какао-порошок 	1,5 ст. л.

Ингредиенты для крема: 
	
Сметана ТМ «Рудь», 21 % 	2 стакана
Сахар 	1 стакан 

Итак, начнем ПРИГОТОВЛЕНИЕ:

Этап № 1

Для приготовления сметанника необходимо испечь два коржа — светлый и темный. Для начала готовим светлый корж. Берем 2 яйца, добавляем к ним 0,5 стакана сахара и тщательно взбиваем.

Этап № 2

В глубокую миску выливаем 0,5 стакана сметаны, высыпаем 1 ч. л. соды и хорошо перемешиваем до тех пор, пока сметана не увеличится в объеме вдвое. После этого выливаем сметану к яичной массе и перемешиваем. Добавляем муку и слегка взбиваем тесто.

Этап № 3

Выливаем тесто в форму и выпекаем в течение 30–35 минут в духовке при 180 градусах. Корж должен хорошо пропечься, проверяем его готовность с помощью деревянной шпажки или зубочистки.

Этап № 4

Готовим темный корж по такому же рецепту. Единственное отличие — добавляем в муку 1,5 ст. л. какао-порошка. Выпекаем до готовности.

Этап № 5

Оставляем коржи остывать, готовим сметанный крем. К 2 стаканам сметаны добавляем стакан сахара и тщательно взбиваем.

Этап № 6

Коржи разрезаем вдоль, чтобы их стало вдвое больше. Начинаем собирать торт: нижний корж смазываем кремом, выкладываем второй корж и так далее. Чтобы сметанник был нежнее, смазываем кремом боковые стороны. Оставляем торт на 6–8 часов или на ночь в холодильнике, чтобы крем застыл, а коржи хорошо пропитались.

游戏中的单位平衡存在问题，一些单位过于强大，而另一些单位则显得无用，导致战斗缺乏挑战性。这种情况让游戏失去了一些策略性，因为玩家可能会选择使用一两个强大的单位来赢得战斗，而忽略了其他单位。

AI敌人的行为模式重复，缺乏策略性，敌人的行动常常可以被轻易预测，降低了游戏的挑战性和趣味性。这对于一款策略游戏来说，是一个重大的打击，因为玩家期望能够与智能的敌人进行一场紧张刺激的战斗。

游戏的战役故事平淡无奇，角色形象不够鲜明，玩家难以产生共鸣。这种情况让玩家在游戏中感到迷失，因为他们无法与游戏中的角色建立情感上的联系。

总而言之游戏未能达到我对策略游戏的期望。游戏的画面、平衡性、AI和故事情节等方面存在明显的不足。我建议玩家在购买前，要考虑好自己的期望和口味，以免像我一样感到失望。对于那些喜欢策略游戏的人来说，我建议他们选择其他更加成熟和完善的游戏，以获得更好的游戏体验。",1642042859,1711528273,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Review : [h1]7.0 IT IS NICE GIM[/h1]

Alright, this game was fun. First of 1 minutes, it feel boring just like another RPG. You need to hunting first before going to the main story (not priority but it will make you easier to beat enemies in the main story). The story it self is pretty well, I feel like playing game with anime isekai plot. So, no doubt about the story. Which make me interest is map design. It's not to big or small, i'ts a normal map with a dungeon. Just to explore, it took much time because it feels huge than I thought. Also there is a side quests too make you help the citizen with their problem. This is why I enjoy to play this game. AFK for 2 hours, the rest is full of gameplay hours. I recommend this game who want to enjoy story in anime plot. Hunting is ez, doesn't need farming too, I farm 5k gold and its useless. Potion is a key to stay alive. A happy ending 1 party with 4 member living separatedly after all the things done. 

Cons, [strike]no nude[/strike] It's a simple battle RPG but they didn't give a health bar for enemies, [strike]too big boing[/strike] so it depends on your feelings. [strike]Sura is brocon[/strike] The character design is not look a like with the art.

Ummm, I tell you that the girl on the thumbnail art and main menu screen is gone (or never exist). Sura has a black hair and Vanesse is white, the girl on the thumbnail is blonde, so who is she? I don't know. CMIIW, You can tell me if ya know her. *smile",1628001923,1650529528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

这个游戏，从RPG角度来讲，应该只能得到一般的评价。因为开的是困难难度，一开始想着可能每一场战斗都十分艰难。然后就直接接了打领主的特殊任务，还直接开了火焰领主。然后……这个领主很好打嘛。另一个特殊任务，打golath（goliath?哥利亚巨人？）也很轻松。然后就发现，精英怪比野怪还要好打，收益还高。这就很尴尬了。战斗上，到了后期也很套路。每个人物只有几个技能，而有用的就那么几个。祭祀上个aerfae light全状态buff ，剑士用tiamat（提亚玛特，混沌母神）slash输出，白骑士的辅助技能倒是有用，尤其打最终BOSS时用“最后的仪式”（忘了原名，我自己是这么翻译的）复活队友必不可少。至于老法师……除了个imbecile愚笨者降低敌方法伤，其他法术伤害还没平A伤害高。
至于装备，打精英怪掉出来的各种特殊装备能装一箩筐，完成支线任务和特殊任务也有奖励。还有就是地图里的宝箱一般也能出好装备。纯属性装备最后一个城市ironhorn商店里的是最好的。怎么选择看个人喜好，反正钱有的是。
游戏的剧情上面，讲的就是女主为弟报仇带着自己的小队加入革命军，成为主力推翻了女王的统治，然后发现是传奇法师的阴谋最后拯救世界的故事。讲道理挺简单粗暴，但是情节曲折，还是比较对我的口味的。
然后最让我印象深刻的就是游戏地图。在没有小地图的情况下，这游戏地图已经大到了令人发指的地步。尤其是有个特殊任务是去地图里面找frozen tear。就代表你需要把每个地图都翻个底朝天。翻一个野外地图大概需要半个小时。所谓十小时的主线剧情我觉得有八个小时是在找眼泪上面。最后我只找到13个，但实在记不起来还有哪两个地方没翻过只好放弃。
游戏没有中文，所以算是加了一个门槛。而从质量上来看，虽然游戏性上只能得到个一般的评价，但考虑到这游戏本身只属于加一性质，还是可以考虑玩一玩。
最后，对人物加点的小小建议。ATK全给老法师加，SPI给白骑士加，AGI加给祭司妹子。这样子才不会浪费。",1621986627,1621986627,True,2,0,0.533333301544189453,0,True,False,False,False,,,

这个游戏，从RPG角度来讲，应该只能得到一般的评价。因为开的是困难难度，一开始想着可能每一场战斗都十分艰难。然后就直接接了打领主的特殊任务，还直接开了火焰领主。然后……这个领主很好打嘛。另一个特殊任务，打golath（goliath?哥利亚巨人？）也很轻松。然后就发现，精英怪比野怪还要好打，收益还高。这就很尴尬了。战斗上，到了后期也很套路。每个人物只有几个技能，而有用的就那么几个。祭祀上个aerfae light全状态buff ，剑士用tiamat（提亚玛特，混沌母神）slash输出，白骑士的辅助技能倒是有用，尤其打最终BOSS时用“最后的仪式”（忘了原名，我自己是这么翻译的）复活队友必不可少。至于老法师……除了个imbecile愚笨者降低敌方法伤，其他法术伤害还没平A伤害高。
至于装备，打精英怪掉出来的各种特殊装备能装一箩筐，完成支线任务和特殊任务也有奖励。还有就是地图里的宝箱一般也能出好装备。纯属性装备最后一个城市ironhorn商店里的是最好的。怎么选择看个人喜好，反正钱有的是。
游戏的剧情上面，讲的就是女主为弟报仇带着自己的小队加入革命军，成为主力推翻了女王的统治，然后发现是传奇法师的阴谋最后拯救世界的故事。讲道理挺简单粗暴，但是情节曲折，还是比较对我的口味的。
然后最让我印象深刻的就是游戏地图。在没有小地图的情况下，这游戏地图已经大到了令人发指的地步。尤其是有个特殊任务是去地图里面找frozen tear。就代表你需要把每个地图都翻个底朝天。翻一个野外地图大概需要半个小时。所谓十小时的主线剧情我觉得有八个小时是在找眼泪上面。最后我只找到13个，但实在记不起来还有哪两个地方没翻过只好放弃。
游戏没有中文，所以算是加了一个门槛。而从质量上来看，虽然游戏性上只能得到个一般的评价，但考虑到这游戏本身只属于加一性质，还是可以考虑玩一玩。
最后，对人物加点的小小建议。ATK全给老法师加，SPI给白骑士加，AGI加给祭司妹子。这样子才不会浪费。",1611686039,1611686039,True,2,0,0.524384737014770508,0,True,False,False,False,,,

*本游戏为 RPG Maker VX 制品。坦白说 2016 年 6 月了还有新游戏用 VX 做我是十分惊讶的……

*游戏的五项成就随着剧情推进在你保存退出游戏后会自己动解开。

*NSFW 只是一个令人遗憾的误会，这个误会可能来源于那张封面。
-然而这张封面和游戏实际截图中立绘的差距能够很直白而深切告诉你什么叫“封面欺诈”。
-只有主角四人组有立绘的待遇，但是也只有这一张。其余的主要剧情人物只有个头像，配角就连头像也没有了。这个减号主要是给立绘稀少且画风实在不令人满意……

*游戏的剧情简单来说就是担任一个四人雇佣兵小队队长的女主角在弟弟死亡（假死）后毅然踏上了和其它有志之士造反的道路。
+故事完整，前因后果比较清晰，并且也有动情的瞬间。
-但是剧情前后展开不足，包括角色的个人剧情以及主线剧情，只是为了推进而设定，却没有多少着墨在其中，对于我这种剧情派的玩家来说还不过瘾。
*因为弟弟在身边所以不愿多向前一步，又因为弟弟的死而愤然复仇什么的。哎呀……

+?因为是雇佣兵小队，所以主角团队从一开始就定下来了。不会有更换的机会。
+主角团队分工明确，攻击的、奶的、强化的、辅助攻击的。不同角色的技能槽的名字也有所不同。
-技能稀少。升级到后期也就四个。

+主支线剧情有分开的列表。
-完成支线剧情也不见得有什么好奖励。
*可能会影响到结局其它角色的言行，这一点没有验证。

+装备多样，可以各自组合。
-加成并不高，基本上随着剧情的不断深入不断地换上新装备就对了。不必要刷，也没有装备强化的系统。

在完成了叛乱把恶王赶下台、将国家交给适当的任选后。雇佣兵小队的其他成员都因为在支线剧情里所述的原因要继续展开探寻或探险的旅程。
最后只剩下女主角和弟弟站在故事开始的地方眺望着远处的风景。

现在就只剩下你和我了，我的弟弟……
Now it's just you and me, little brother..

听起来挺不错的。

This was an enjoyable, little RPG-maker game well worth the cheap price featuring a straight-forward, but interesting plot and cute characters.

Maps themselves are simple with mostly, optional encounters and familiar sprites and scenery. My only complaint here is some of them maps are large and difficult to navigate given lack of a mini-map.

The characters and world are only just barely fleshed out, but have enough substance to be intriguing if not fully satisfying.

Easy achievements

Dislikes:
Oh boy.... The battle system is straight sadness :( . Magic spells from the Warlock is pure garbage. literally, you will attack for more damage than using his spells. I also did not notice any resistant enemies anywhere in the game? Even though you find weapons that have fire/water and etcetra on it, you never see if an enemy is resistant to that elemental weapon. The games skills are very limited and you can take out anything just by buffing Sura up. The battles, even turning off the animation seems SSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLOW! Why cant your team just flash like the enemies when they attack in one place to make it quicker. instead, they have to run alllllllllllllllll the way to the enemy to attack, then walk allllllllllll the way back to there normal position.

Leveling is very bizarre. i have played games that involved visible monsters, but i have never beaten an JRPG at level 25... Even so, i never once feared i would die in the game cause it was just...basic. I was expecting to die the first time i fought one of the elemental lords like at level 4...only to kill it in a few hits? I just couldn't grasp what level i needed to be.

Dungeon design was long and tedious. Its the only reason why the game takes awhile to beat if it was not for that. The designs were okay with multiple directions to go.

The music was okay.....nothing i else i can say....it was okay.

Storyline...It was okay, it was mildly entertaining but that final battle...............................wow.........................

Overall, i would not recommend this game unless you want to get ideals in making your own rpg maker game or just want to waste a few hours of your life like i did. Easy achievements if you're into that kind of stuff and they all unlock with no issues.

If you're a fan of JRPG games and got a little time to spare, this is quite a nice experience, in particular considering the very modest price. There's also a little slew of side quests so you don't only have to get strung along on the main one.

+ Well written game, no typoes or such as far as I noticed.
+ Good plot and good plot twists.
+ Very nice artwork.
+ ""Current quest objective"" included that you can check at any time; always a good idea for people with crap memory like me.

± Game's way too easy, I didn't lose a single battle during my playthrough, even against the bosses. I faintly recall there's an option for difficulty though, so perhaps that one's on me. (I usually pick the ""regular"" difficulty, though...)
± Music is pretty generic. Nothing that affects the gameplay or experience though.

- Battle scenes can get tedious. There's an option to disable animations, but it can still get long-winded, especially when you're out grinding. Some sort of fast-forward button would be nice.
- Menu interface could use a tiny bit of work. My thoughts is particularly regarding when I wanted to attach a ""growth"" item on a character and had to select each character individually to check their stats; a ""scroll through characters"" option while you have the item selected would be preferable.

I believe that's it though. Solid story, got both achievements and trading cards, what more could you want from such a cheap game? Recommended for my casual JRPG enthusiasts.",1568024597,1568024597,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Another game that could really benefit from a neutral kind of rating. Storm of spears is a 6-7 hour long JRPG that like many games using this retro style was made in RPG maker. I've never seen using RPG maker as a cause to instantly bash a game or believe it not worth my time and so recently decided to play through this game which I picked up on sale a while back.

As many people in reviews on these sorts of games say it appears like the RPG maker games are almost a sub-genre of game of their own and thus have a cult/niche audience that really enjoys them, I consider myself to be a part of this niche. I own a fair few RPG maker based games and so far have had relatively good experiences with them. However this game does have some problems but before that I'll list what the game does well:

[b]Pros:[/b]

-A rather nice story that has some twists and turns and shows that the person who made it did their best to put some love into it

-Nice maps that reward exploration.

-The addition of side quests was very pleasant and helped extend the games play time and make it seem less like of a quick cash grab.

-Solid if albeit very basic turn based gameplay that did what it needed to do.

-No random encounters, I myself don't mind random encounters in JRPG's but given this games very basic combat system I appreciated not constantly being forced to fight weak enemies that were basically only popping up to slow my progression and extend game time.

Now for the cons.

[b]Cons:[/b]

-The gameplay/combat was very boring more so near the end, this is mostly due to how basic it is and thus combat ends up becoming stale and repetitive. The game itself is extremely easy which doesn't aid the gameplay at all as most abilities I never used and some were not used once as the challenge never was too great as to require them. Coming to the end of the game I was basically running past fights just to fight the bosses to see the sprite design and hope for a slightly more engaging battle.

-A lot of the side quests, especially the ones on the longer side had very disappointing endings, which is to say one in particular had you on the lookout all game throughout your travels to activate obelisks to fight elemental lords and get unique weapons/armour/accessories but once I had defeated them all nothing happened, no dialogue or anything just to give the quest which seemed important, closure. a similar style quest also suffered from no closure whatsoever so I was often left feeling slightly let down and like the whole ordeal has been fruitless and of no real importance.

-Finally a much smaller gripe but some of the sounds in the game where pretty bad, most notably a cheering sound effect that played during speeches that lasted about 1.5 seconds and would be replayed with each new text box of dialogue until the rallying speech had been finished. I found this to be incredibly annoying and felt rather than aiding the speech and it's impact it instead disrupted my immersion in the story and was more of a detriment. 

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]

Overall I had a decent time with the game, I played it start to finish and not out of a necessity but because I wanted to see it through to the end which would indicate the game must be doing some things right. However uninteresting combat that had the potential to be more engaging but fell short as it was way too easy and some corners cut on the side quests  ended up taking some of my enjoyment away from this game. I would recommend picking it up if it's on sale and if you've played other RPG maker games and have responded well to them.

[b]Verdict:[/b]

Recommended but only if it's on sale and if you respond well to the RPG maker sub-genre of JRPGs.",1560086673,1560087649,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Made with RPG Maker, you as the player gather your party, battle monsters, collect and upgrade armor and weapons, and complete tasks, working your way to the final boss.

The story's not bad, it's not great, it's OK. You play as Sura, a revolutionary who works to overthrow the new Queen who reigns as a dictator. Sura assembles her team and begins her quest to free the kingdom. Everything else is boilerplate and similar to any of this kind of game. The difference is that while you can complete this game in around 10 or so hours (it took me around 12.5 hours), it's not an easy 10 hours, you have to put in the effort to slog through it. Which is why only as I type this, only 6.2% of all player have actually finished it.

If you're looking for a challenge, give it a shot. At $1.99 it's worth a purchase.


Pros :

Decent story
Challenging play

Cons :

Repetitive monster battles
Supportive characters are meh

The Good:
+ Dungeons and areas are good mazes, but there aren't any hidden areas or surprises which would make it more exciting.
+ Decent and engaging story
+ No random encounters
+ Battles are quickly resolved
The Meh:
~ Plenty of equipment, but most of it you won't wind up using.
~ Store bought equipment can sometimes be just as powerful or more so than boss and unique monster equipment drops.
~ A decent RPG Maker game, but still pretty run-of-the-mill
The Bad:
- Repetitive and boring battles and lack of monster variety
- Short game (about seven hours to complete)
- Little or no replay value
- Felt a little bit like an unfinished beta version
- Unnecessary ""soft porn"" female character portraits

The story follows Sura a mercenary who is trying to protect her brother from a war that a ruthless queen is leading in plans of world domination.  After certain events occur Sura takes up arms and leads a rebel group against the empire ( a typical evil empire rebel story like star wars).  During this adventure Sura and her closes friends and companions (the playable characters) go through many different ordeals in attempt to gain a army and the resouces they need to stop the empire.  The stroy is not at all bad it is just the cliche rpg story.  The story does have more interesting moments than others and it has a few plot twist.

The characters are:
SURA the main character and a dual weilding swordsman.  She uses many sword skills to attack more than once during a turn or to add status effects to her attacks. She leads the rebels against the empire.

ENDRYN is a paladin class warrior. He uses a mace/shield and holy magic (healing heath or status effects and light offensive magic).  He fights along the rebels to avenge his home and family that was taken by the empire.

VALEESE is a two handed ax warrior.  She uses buffs to enpower the team and increase there stats during battle.  She is from a mysterious race that created powerful weapons and technolgy long ago, she believes she is the last of her race and travels along the rebels to stop the evil empire and hopes to find more info about her people.

GYORG is a mage.  He uses magic that damages many enemies at once and can cause neg. statuses to them as well.  He fights against the empire because they tricked his family and stole all his wealth and home from him.
The cast has interesting background stories and each has a side quest that gives more info on them.

The combat:
Its a basic turn based rpg, where the characters can attack use magic/skills or items during battle.  The game seems a little broken and easy when it came to the combat.  Sura was great at attacking while valeese who also had high attack stat did not do that much damage (so she was better buffing up Sura attack even higher).  Endryn was great for healing the teams HP and attacking when health was high. Gyorg was the most broken......he is a mage class yet high magic barely did any damage....when he would simply attack he could possibly do more damage that Endryn and sometimes Valeese. So i rarely used his magic.

The game had many cool side missions that could be completed for money and loot...but after a certain point the rewards gained from these quest seemed pointless.  The weapon/armor shops seemed pointless after the begining because you would find way better gear while going through the games quest and levels. The gear would drastically increase your stats so you would basically become overpowered.  

The game took me about 10 hours to complete (though i left it idle for a few hours so maybe about 7 hours).  The 5 achievements that you can earn are mostly story based so its almost impossible to miss them (though people have reported some of them being buggy).

For the Price of $1.99 you cant really go wrong picking up this title and adding it to you gaming library.  You get your moneys worth with this game for its story, combat, and side quest alone.
Though the dialogue was a bit meh and the game seemed a bit broken it is still worth a pick up.....i mean come on 2 bucks people lol.

I'm writing this review about 80 minutes into the game and I can say that it's grown on me pretty quick and I feel invested enough in the story to pick it up and continue playing again. The strong point in this RPG is, of course, the characters. Likeable, yet fresh-feeling characters with their own unique quirks and things to add to the story. Additionally, if you're used to just mashing through each dialogue box, you're going to miss out on some great writing!

Now let me talk about the character sprites... they're bad. Most of them don't even match the character portrait they're supposed to represent and would somebody [i]please[/i] do something about Edryan's portrait?

Welp finished the game at around 7 hours on the in game timer, pretty sure battles don't add to the timer which is why I'd got 6 hours more than that, there's a lot of battles.

Combat:
For me it was pretty great and intuitive, 4 members that can attack, guard, or use a skill/item, one party member has magic though which I never really found a use for, was better to just make him give the enemy a wack in my opinion but every other skill was useful in some way.
Special attacks, buffs and restorative skills, a late level buff works perfectly with another late level attack so that you can deal massive damage and effectively not lose the damage from the buff caster, not sure when the buff ends or even if it does besides via death but it generally lets you win the fight in a couple of turns when you use it.
Works on a basic mp system that I'm sure you've seen before, nothing new.
There's also items that provide debuffs to the enemy but I never used them except for once before reloading a save.

Story:
It was great, was what kept me going and made me finish in just a few days, can't say much though cause I don't want to spoil anything but it's worth playing just to see the story.
There was one bit that dragged on for a long time but was mainly from me being thorough but if you play and find yourself in a bit like that just push through.

Music:
Was enjoyable for awhile but certain tracks start to wear on you after a time, there's a what I assume is a glitch that turns the music off for a bit after you sleep and I quite enjoyed that at some points but there are some really good tracks.

RPG elements:
No customisation at all, can't even choose names but it's not so bad, they have decent ones.
Leveling is pretty standard, quick at first but takes longer the higher level you are, hadn't even reached 30 by the time I finished.
Not sure what a few of the stats did and not sure if a few of the stats even did anything, didn't find ways to improve certain ones, could have even been part of the background of the screen but yeah bigger numbers = better.
There's quite a large amount of armours, weapons and accessories though I found that some of my squad would get new equipment more often than the others, not sure if I missed anything but I searched everywhere I could for side quest related stuff so would have found stuff like that I think.

You can tell it was made in RPG maker, but at least it feels like the people who made it cared. 
Graphics - Standard sprites and anime-inspired character images. The characters look nice, though the sprites don't always seem to match their portrait or image to well. I don't know why nudity is listed in the tags because I didn't see any the entire time I played it, nor were there any sexual tones to the story. Two of the characters have big breasts and revealing armor, but that's about it. Boss images look nice too.
Story - Nothing really too special here. It's all pretty cliche and is pretty predictable. Still, does a good job at telling it.
Gameplay - Pretty good. Even though I played it on hard, it was never really hard. I really enjoyed all the side quests though and it will take you a while to get through the game. I beat it in about 9 but I'd say you can get through it in about 8 if you ignore some stuff and don't explore a lot.
All in all, I'd say this is worth a buy. It's only $2, and it usually goes down to a $1 during sales. Practically free at that point.

Enemies appear on the map, and can be avoided most of the time, but levelling up is necessary for the boss battles, although it doesn't take much to level up. Battles are very easy, making the large variety of items and skill upgrades mostly useless.

Side quests are not relevant to the story, and mostly come in the form of collecting all of a type of item, and defeating all of a type of monster, with an occasional NPC request to obtain an artifact from a remote location.

The story is the main draw for this game. Although the party members are not very developed as characters, the people you interact with are quite entertaining, and provide some unexpected twists in the plot.

Really hard to decide if I give thumbs up or thumbs down....

Im a big RPG Maker enthusasiast and enjoy games like this a lot, if they are well made...

Lets list up the pros and obviously why I give thumbs up in the end:

PRO:
- Characters are individuals and have their own story to tell.
- Conversations with your group of heroes and others do make sense 
   and never seem to be written to fill.
- BIG PLUS - Story is really awesome and makes fun to follow, you always want to know how it goes on. 

CON:
- Level Design is somethimes confusing, lots of dead end places and sometimes you can walk through walls or
  walk over water, walk over holes, no idea.. it feels a bit rushed sometimes. 
- Battle system is really as easy as possible, no depth. Just the casual basic rpg maker battle system. 
- Balance is my hardest CON for this game, there is no balance. Last Boss in this game does 1 dmg to my heroes with 
  his basic attack. 
  You have 4 heroes in your party, but 75% of the dmg will be made with your main character with exactly one spell. 
  The spells of your other heroes are completly useless, you can just autoattack with them, makes the most sense. 
  Your mage in the group is completly useless, he does 0 dmg. He causes 80 dmg with his most expensive magic spell.
  With an autoattack he causes 150 dmg :D 

- Biggest joke is the playtime which is written in the description of the game. 
  There it says: 10 hour playtime + 3 hours sidequests.
  I finished everything, collected everything, defeated every enemie and talked to every npc in this game.
  My gametime is 7,8 hours.... Sorry but didnt you play your game on your own when u finished it? 
  

I have seen 100 other RPG Maker games which are way better than this and those are for free, but for the small money
you can barely make anything wrong with this game.

I can recommend starting on the hardest difficulty, since normal was just as easy as hell, and this was difficulty 2 of 3...",1517588430,1517588455,True,7,1,0.584319233894348145,0,True,False,False,False,,,

RPG Maker is a nice tool, which of course as a total incompetent I could not even open, but can of course become a negative issue just like when in the late '90s we used to play on tons of Ultima Online servers made with Sphere, UOL and I don't remember what else..
So, with a tool like this, you can come up with a great game if you've got skills, ideas and passion or you can put on the market a short and pointless title, as we can see everywhere on Steam. For Storm of Spears, it's definitely the first option.
The plot, as I was saying, is also interesting and quite new, you'll see lots of personality development both in your protagonist, Sura (she's a girl, not the Arabic word for the Quran chapters), and in the good and evil inhabitants of this nice game.. and in order to make a good RPG we all know that you can't limit yourself to a NES-like story of 3 hours XD
Of course, I'm not saying that this is a masterpiece. There could have been much more improvement in some areas, for example for what concerns equipment selection (we're in a quite basic ""upgrade"" system as you progress in the game) or spells - every member of your party, of course, will anyways have its own personality and its own abilities.
The game doesn't manage to get ever difficult, really difficult; it's great in my opinion, although it isn't an approach we had in the '90s where RPGs used to be way more difficult even if in simple settings like an 8-Bit environment; in any case, it's great since even if you are able to make money fast and to measure up to the various enemies and bosses, the general feel is that the game evolves with you (like Pokémon? XD) for what concerns enemy strength, equipment, abilities and so on.
So, you'll get through many hours of the main story and the nice side-quests and you'll always be able to confront the enemies in a turn-based combat style, quite standard, and that's what we like :)
For what concerns the worldmap anyways, there are no random encounters but rather enemies walk through the map and it will never be necessary to grind - if you'd want to, you'd have to reset an area by going out and re-enter it, just like Ys and many other series by the way, not to mention Final Fantasy XIII. But you can progress without problems during the whole story, killing the enemies on your screen and not giving much time to swipe off the same map section over and over. Even because, as I was saying, the choice of items and equipment is quite limited and there isn't the need of grinding something from particular enemies.
I saw some reviews on the character personalities and well, as I said, in my opinion every character - being him in the main party or a secondary one - has his own depth and this is definitely one of the strongest points in this game, and for what concerns the plot I'd suggest you not to overuse the skip button, since it's worth it and it will never take you much time. The side-quests too are quite short and overall probably the game will take you around 15 hours, more or less, I think more than the 10 stated by the developers anyways :)
Ok, maybe in the easy setting - I forgot to mention that there are three difficulty modes, that actually don't change that much so you can go with standard - you can beat everything in 5 or 6 hours, but it's good in a normal or even a hard side. 
And well, another thing: the game is suitable for anyone. There's no sexual or explicit content, so I really don't get what the tags are there for.. apart for some visual novel-like (or manga-like as you please) sprites of the characters, there's definitely nothing ""suitable only for adults"". 
Of course I wouldn't suggest this title for JRPG or RPG newcomers, since there's full of awesome titles from the '80s onwards, but if you're into this retro style and if you like turn-based combat, a simple gameplay (the four main characters, Sura included of course, are pre-made and there's not that much customization) and a good story, with responsive controls, nice soundtrack and artwork and, overall, nothing ever difficult until the end, this is definitely one of the best RPG Maker games you'll find on Steam.

这个游戏，从RPG角度来讲，应该只能得到一般的评价。因为开的是困难难度，一开始想着可能每一场战斗都十分艰难。然后就直接接了打领主的特殊任务，还直接开了火焰领主。然后……这个领主很好打嘛。另一个特殊任务，打golath（goliath?哥利亚巨人？）也很轻松。然后就发现，精英怪比野怪还要好打，收益还高。这就很尴尬了。战斗上，到了后期也很套路。每个人物只有几个技能，而有用的就那么几个。祭祀上个aerfae light全状态buff ，剑士用tiamat（提亚玛特，混沌母神）slash输出，白骑士的辅助技能倒是有用，尤其打最终BOSS时用“最后的仪式”（忘了原名，我自己是这么翻译的）复活队友必不可少。至于老法师……除了个imbecile愚笨者降低敌方法伤，其他法术伤害还没平A伤害高。
至于装备，打精英怪掉出来的各种特殊装备能装一箩筐，完成支线任务和特殊任务也有奖励。还有就是地图里的宝箱一般也能出好装备。纯属性装备最后一个城市ironhorn商店里的是最好的。怎么选择看个人喜好，反正钱有的是。
游戏的剧情上面，讲的就是女主为弟报仇带着自己的小队加入革命军，成为主力推翻了女王的统治，然后发现是传奇法师的阴谋最后拯救世界的故事。讲道理挺简单粗暴，但是情节曲折，还是比较对我的口味的。
然后最让我印象深刻的就是游戏地图。在没有小地图的情况下，这游戏地图已经大到了令人发指的地步。尤其是有个特殊任务是去地图里面找frozen tear。就代表你需要把每个地图都翻个底朝天。翻一个野外地图大概需要半个小时。所谓十小时的主线剧情我觉得有八个小时是在找眼泪上面。最后我只找到13个，但实在记不起来还有哪两个地方没翻过只好放弃。
游戏没有中文，所以算是加了一个门槛。而从质量上来看，虽然游戏性上只能得到个一般的评价，但考虑到这游戏本身只属于加一性质，还是可以考虑玩一玩。

This is my first attempt at a review, so I figure I might as well use this game for practice.  I'll be focusing more on design aspects than typical reviews, so keep that in mind.  Also, note that my hours played aren't accurate.  I've finished the game and complete nearly all of the side quests, but was forced to launch the game outside steam to avoid a lag problem.  (Windows 10/defender freaks out and devours CPU resources when the game is launched via steam, but not when launched directly via game.exe)

First of all, the pros:

1. It's [b]not[/b] a hentai game, although this may be a con depending on why you're looking at this game.  I guess it's just normal fashion for the women in this kingdom to walk around with their boobs nearly hanging out.

2. Great storytelling.  The developers clearly put the bulk of their focus into trying to tell the story, complete with likeable non-mary-sue characters and a few plot twists.   As someone who grew up on SNES-era RPGs, I'm used to and pretty tolerant of mangled engrish, so my expectations with jRPGs are pretty low.  This game only had a few minor grammatical mishaps, but was otherwise quite well written.  It was quite the breath of fresh air.

3. Good quest flow.  Everything was tracked and nicely documented in the quest log.  In fact, I never had a moment of wandering around, wondering ""okay, where the hell do I go next?""

4. No level grinding required.  This was likely the result of an inverse difficulty curve though, so see ""cons"" for more info.

5. No random encounters.  The overworld is completely empty and in dungeons, enemies roam around and only fight if you run into them.  They're slow, stupid, and easily avoidable.  I want to 10/10 this game for this alone.

6. It's a fairly short, bite-sized RPG that only took me about 7 hours to complete, including nearly all sidequests.  This could also be a con I suppose, but to me, 100+ hour timehogging games get tiresome.

Now for the cons, and many of them have to do with combat:

1. Attack magic is literally never useful.  The ""warlock"" character does more damage with his basic attacks, which is asinine.  His only meaningful ability is a magic debuff (unless grinding his levels past 20 or so gets something I haven't seen yet) which is unfortunate.

2. The difficulty curve moves in the wrong direction.  The game starts out fairly average, but by the end, most attacks just bounce right off you, and as mentioned already, I spent no time grinding levels.  To give an idea, the last boss was only able to kill any of my characters through instant death attacks, but that was easy to counter with a revive spell or item since both of these attacks were single target and he only acts once per turn.

3. The main character is stupidly overpowered compared to the others.  By the time you get her 3-hit attack, most boss fights become trivial, 2-3 round endeavors.  To give an idea, strap-boobs has the highest natural attack power and deals about 200-250 damage with her attack.  Meanwhile, the main character's 3-hit ability does around 700-800 damage total.  Once you learn it, every boss fight is basically going to be the other 3 characters supporting the main character as she grinds the poor boss into pudding.

4. The maps are a mess.  The overworld looks like a hurricane swept through the countryside and many of the dungeons have the same problem.   The layout of the last town is especially atrocious and made me long for an exit spell.

5. The ending feels really rushed.  Despite having a nice, involving story, the end consists of flying to the final dungeon, walking inside, only to find out it's really just a tiny room.  You're immediately thrown into a short dialog, followed by the final boss fight, some dialog between the characters, and then...well that's it.  I guess I was expecting a bit more.

6. There's not really enough character development for the 3 other party members.  Each one had a personal side quest, but these side quests were really just ""go to a location, interact with a thing, and that's it.""  It would've been nice to see more depth and to learn more about each one.

7. There seems to be a bunch of different art styles going on here and it's kind of off-putting.  This is a common mistake in smaller-scale indie games though, so it's not too big of a deal to me.  Still, I thought it was worth mentioning.

8. The main character smells bad.  No really, she has time to sleep in the spare bed whenever you need to recovery HP/MP, but always complains about never having any time to take a bath?

9. Almost forgot:  There appears to be different damage types in the game (fire, lightning, etc) but I can't think of a single time when they actually felt relevant.

If you shake and spin a bottle long enough you become something like a mini maelstrom, but as much as the game has to do with a storm or with spears has this little comment.

The game collected a lot of bad reviews and negative recommendations, mostly because it's made with RPG-Maker and because some people chose to use the wrong tags on the game... this happens more often recently. It's been exclaimed that the game contains nudity, and is for adults... hogwash I say. There are games that contain more nudity and are even more like a Hentai-Revival mess than this little game.

The gaming time is around eight to twelve hours to solve and finish this game, even with all sidequests. The difficulty is more or less, casual - nothing special in this matter. Story is nice, but not decent, it's JRPG staple, but the devs were very mindful, not again to pull off the ""You are the Chosen One!"" - trick, thanks a lot for that.

Now to give it a review or a recommendation it's a bit difficult...

TLDR: Did not enjoy my time. Insanely generic. Limited freedcom. Epic arc feels overdone.

You get dumped right away in this cliche story. Ragtag team vs status quo kingdom/empire. Little drama here and there. Organize under some aristocrat character and get back at the man. Game tries to get all dramatic and personal at times but it was really hard for me to pretend like I cared. Assets looked pixelated when fullscreened. Game looked very stock still but with some tweaked assets perhaps, especially in the sprites. The sprites were mismatched with the VN style portraits and I found it jarring. Game keeps you stuck in instances for the greater part of the early game and when the overworld finally opens up you get no overworld encounters and get stuck going to hotspots for maps that mostly look like spiderwebs full of random spam of the same foes. It is common for enemies to have names such as Soldier A Soldier B Soldier C Soldier D. Most of the game is just figuring out which hotspot you gotta go to for the next cutscene of conversations. I got pretty far into the game just holding the attack button and ignoring all abilities but eventually that stopped working. Which incidentally is right about the time I stopped investing the effort to see how the title was turning out.",1507357759,1509672344,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

""You're busted Fera""	[/i]             Joke aside, I got it in a bundle.

The once peaceful world of Galager has become enslaved under the rule of the cruel and unjust Queen.
Sura, the main character, leads a band of mercenaries in order to save the world. 
An unoriginal story but good RPG-maker game.

[h1] Sura's Thumb Up	[/h1]
First you need to be convinced to rebel against the evil queen, then you need to gather an army, and then you need to win. - Seems unorginal, however the story has a few pleasant plot-twists. 

I enjoyed not having to grind a million enemies to level and gear up for once. 
The enemies run around like NPC's so you can avoid boring combat. 

Cheap price, even gets on sale. 
11 hours playtime for me, which is long for such a small RPG-maker game at this price. 

Lots of sidequests, if you want to spend more time.

[h1] Evil Queen's Thumb Down	[/h1]
The characters are flat. You get to know Sura a bit, especially through her relationship with the brother, however the other characters are forgetable and you never get to know them well - with little to no character development. 

I liked not grinding, however the battlesystem is wierd. 
Mages base attack does more damage than their spells, topping it up with little elemental advantage. Basicly you only heal and stun-lock enemies. 
Meaning the game can be beaten really easily.

I don't remember if there was a minimap or not; I think I got lost a few times.

The music is boring and monotone, but mute it and watch some anime in windowed mode, or porn if you went for the adult/nudity tag and got disappointed. 

[h1] Closing Comments	[/h1]
If you like RPG-maker games, this game features all the standard mechanics, a standard storyline and the mandatory sidekicks with opposite personality traits. 
However it lacks the depth in combat system, especially in the magic area. 
Also the equipment choices seemed pointless. 

I'd give this a just below middle grade - it all depends on how much you like RPG's; because this one is mostly standard. (we'll call it classic)",1503963071,1503963071,False,1,2,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False,False,,,

some small mistakes in graphics, but the kind that are funny to find, like a tree growing on someones house, or standing somewhere that you arent supposed to be.

there is no sexual content, unless you count the armour, however the girls aren't the only ones, one male character has his stomach and abs completely exposed

That aside, This game is pretty okay. The story is rather generic and the combat is old school, but there's nothing wrong with that. There's a few things to nitpick about, some levels have bridges you can't walk under, some of the portraits don't look much like the sprites, advancement is easy, you get flush with gold quickly and while there's a fair amount of equipment, there aren't a lot of difficult choices to make when outfitting your gear. More variety in that department, and in spell selection would've gone a long way.

Hope it helps to someone, also to the creators to fix some things into the game and be better on the next time.

Andava tutto bene finchè non ne ho parlato con la mia ragazza che mi disse: ''Non puoi campare facendo RPG e vendendoli a 2 euro. Tra qualche anno saremo invasi da giochi fatti con questo programma''. Mai cosa fu più vera, nel giro di poco tempo c'è stata un'invasione di RPG, alcuni validi e altri  decisamente meno.
Fortunatamente Storm of Spears è uno di quelli validi, un ottimo titolo che vi permetterà di passare qualche ora di divertimento. 
 
I lati positivi di questo bel gioco sono:
-Bellissima trama, migliore di quelle di tutti gli RPG a cui ho giocato.
-Personaggi principali ben realizzati, ognuno di loro ha uno spazio durante il gioco nel quale viene raccontata la loro storia e i loro fardelli.
-I personaggi secondari hanno un loro perchè, personalmente li ho amati tutti quanti poichè mi hanno rappresentato ben più di un ammasso di pixel.
-Difficoltà del gioco media, non si fa particolare fatica a finire la trama senza morire.
-Gran numero di oggetti e di equipaggiamenti.
-Mappe piene di casse segrete.

Gli unici due lati negativi sono la quasi totale inutilià delle quests secondarie e dei vari mercanti. Anche se non sono poche, queste missioni non danno praticamente nulla di importante per proseguire nel gioco siccome Storm of Spears non è particolarmente impegnativo e, sempre per lo stesso motivo, sono arrivato alla fine del gioco utilizzando meno della metà degli oggetti che ho trovato perciò non ne ho comprato nemmeno uno. 

In ogni caso, per chi ama gli RPG questo è da comprare assolutamente!

Honestly, this game is pretty fun for being about 7ish hours (that was my play time at getting everything to 100% with some small grinding invovled). The story is simple, but enjoyable. 

Gameplay wise, it had it's ups and downs. Overall the need to grind doesn't really exist. You can break bosses by using one spell over and over without taking any damage to the party. Random encoutners do not exist in this game as the mobs just wander around like npcs, so basically you clear an area and then reset and do it again if you want to grind. However, grinding isn't really needed since, agian, you can just break the boss with one spell. There isn't really any in terms of customization, but that was fine. Items aren't something you really need (mostly heal pots). This didn't really bother me as I could just keep going with the game and didn't have to worry about gear. 

Characters were a let down. Things start off like you're going to learn a lot about them, but then ends up flopping right on you. So that was kind of meh. The main character is fleshed out abit, but overall character development wasn't really there.

World. Meh. It's small, easily traveled. There isn't much to the world at all and that was lame. But for a short game that you can do in one sitting no issues, I guess it works. 

Story. Again simple. Nothing complex and there were a few turns that I didn't seem coming which was a nice relief due to all things mentioned above.

Overall the game was fun and I don't regret playing. I'd like to do a Let's Play on this game as it's short. A lot more could have been done with the game, but I don't know much about the developer to say why or why not it was done as it was. Hopefully at somepoint they can expand upon the world / characters more in a sequel or something. Again, no regrets and recommended if you're looking for something to pass the time (great for in between LoL ques or something of the like).",1496276299,1496276299,True,3,0,0.54741823673248291,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Storm of Spears is an RPGmaker game developed by Warfare Studios and released mid 2016.
At this time I've played around 4-5 RPG maker games, most were mediocre, and one was absolutely terrible. This one has a few things I liked, but it's definitely a play and forget.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] The story is the weakest aspect of Storm of Spears... Well, that's not really fair to say without elaboration. Clearly someone has tried their best to write up a story, but the story didn't engage me at all.
I cared so little that I skipped 90% of the text by spamming my Z/Enter key. Normally RPG maker games punish you for doing this because you don't know what to do next.
But Storm of Spears actually has a quest log! This is the first time I've ran into an RPG maker game which tracked quests and side quests for me. So let me sincerely say: ""THANK GOD"". It was my favorite feature, and let me complete the game much faster by skipping lackluster dialogue.

""But Atratzu, you haven't really explained what was so bland about the story yet"" Good observation projected thoughts of my review reader! Specifically my problems lie with the protagonist, ""Sura"". She is passed off as some charismatic leader of a group of mercenaries known as ""Knight Watch"" or ""night watch"", or ""edgy-impressive-sounding-nitey-night-knight-watch-wach-swatch"" or something.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=930414043

She has no interest in joining the rebellion, instead she wants to hide away with her younger brother. She is obsessed with protecting him, and won't risk doing anything which could put him in danger.
(and being a mercenary is a good way to keep him safe? The plot has more holes this swiss cheese being used for target practice at a shotgun rally, lets ignore that part, and smile and nod)

Well as you might imagine, she gets sucked into the conflict, and then there's a type of reconciliation because she was ""tricked"" to force her to lead the rebelion, and then she's like ""oh, that's okay. You helped me see the error of my ways, I'm totes... *skip skip skip skip*  ....Waffle Walrus... *skip skip skip* ...and I forgive you.

...uh huh... Cuz forgiving someone IMMEDIATELY after finding out they made a crazy lie and then living with that lie for... days? months? realistically it should have been months to rally everyone to get to that point.

I'd be pissed (seriously, pi-ssed is a filtered word?). and THAT would have made the protagonist more relatable! If she said ""oh yeah? So I've been fooled into this, well peace out. now we don't need to continue dancing this dance, time to go find a peaceful part of the land and live the rest of our lives out in peace""
And then it takes some other REAL crisis to break her out of her apathy, THAT would be more compelling and would make the protagonist more interesting for me. But nope, ""you've taken away my burdens"", oh, okay, sure, fine.

[b]story-summary: the story makes me mad. But at least they look like they/he/she/it tried.[/b]

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=930412515

[b]Gameplay:[/b] standard RPGmaker controls and mechanics. There are three difficulty settings, however my impression is that the different difficulties will just reduce damage given, gold and experienced gained after combat, annndddd minor other differences.

I doubt it makes too much of a difference, but at least the developer gave me a baby-easy-mode to blast through so I can move on to another game.

The store page says it has 10 hours of gameplay, and if you intend to do all the things, you probably could sink 10 hours into it. But if you want to run past enemy fights and play on the easiest difficulty you can easily beat Storm of Spears RPG in 3-4 hours.

Another praise I have for the game is the lack of random encounters. Oh thank you so much for not including them, I've been random encountered out from most RPGmaker games.
There are NPC battles, but you move much faster then them, and can easily bypass them quickly if you time it right.

(I don't know how much this would impact the level curve. At higher difficulties the gearing and exp might be more required... but on easy difficulty I was speedy gonzales.)

[b]Conclusion:[/b] reviewing my review (that's a funny sentence), I feel that I had more negative to say about Storm of Spears RPG, but that's probably because like I summarized at the start: ""The game is utterly forgettable"".

If you want to add an easy 100% achievements completed game to your library you can pick this up, if you're starved for RPGmaker games, this one isn't that bad... but it isn't that good either.

Until steam lets me give reviews a thumbs-side-ways, I'll just mark this one ""recommended"", but only because it didn't hold me hostage for 10 hours... 10 hours and I'd be a salty satly bastage.

Unscripted ""My thoughts"" video. Basically get this whole review again, but this time you don't need to do any reading... What a deal! Listen to my voice and look at gameplay! Woo!

Po pobraniu gry nastawiłem się głownie na te osiągnięcia, żeby szybko je zrobić i mieć ""spokój"" z tą grą. Grałem trochę na siłe, jednak po jakimś czasie o dziwo zaczęło się grać dość przyjemnie, podobał mi się ten spokojny soundtrack i prostota rozgrywki, niestety nie wkręciłem się w fabułę, bo praktycznie od początku do połowy gry pomijałem wszystkie kwestie i wypowiedzi bohaterów(są ich tu niezliczone ilości!:D). Pod koniec jednak trochę tego żałowałem.
No ale podsumowując :

To be more serious, it should not be surprising that only 4.7% of players even made it through the whole game.

In spite of the 9.8 hours my Steam shows, I managed to beat the whole game in 5 hours and 41 minutes. The game is obscenely easy, especially when you take into account the Stun attack and 3x Random attack the protagonist gets. Add the low damage/high armor issue enemies have to face, and I found myself never losing a single battle. When your final boss has to stoop to Almighty max damage and instant kill spells in order to harm you, there's something broken about your difficulty.

The story was average at best. You take control of a mercenary group that joins a rebellion to overthrow a tyrannical ruler. And that just about does it for the story, since everything else is a cliche and overused trope, with little effort to make things different. The things they do differently are retardedly out of nowhere, such as a particular scene involving a meeting I won't spoil.

The characters are okay. You've got bland heroine with storymode charisma, Batman healer who's aggressive and stupid because his family was killed, generic last survivor, and old guy who drinks and keeps complaining that he's old. If those don't sound like the perfect group to tag along with, then you're gonna have a boring time.

Though if you want me to get angry, I've got a few things to say about this company and their deceitful advertising. First thing's first, the blonde chick shown on the advertising image and intro screen? Doesn't appear even once in the game. Second, The genres chosen for this game are Sexual Content, Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Racing, RPG, Simulation, Sports, and Strategy. I can tell you now that this game is Casual, an RPG, and possibly Indie, but is none of these other genres. The game has no mature content, amd there are zero Nudity or Sexual scenes in this game. This reeks of deception for profit, and makes me unable to recommend this.

Honestly, I don't even remember why I bought this game. I only lost about 50 cents, but I kinda wish I had it back, considering the mediocre experience I got. It alright, but I will probably never play this game again.",1490933266,1490933266,False,89,8,0.841256439685821533,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For an introduction to the JRPG.  

Note: Recommended for an introduction.  Buy it on sale.  (Not recommended as a ""good game"".)

Positives:  
     1)  You knew your direction you were supposed to go (most of the time).
     2)  The characters are likeable.
     3)  Not expensive.
     4)  Side quests are available.

On the fence:
     1)  Easy game.  For a beginner or a 1st taste at an RPG, it is fine.  For veteran...  not so fine.
     2)  Story is fine...  I like it, but it might be considered ""cheesy"".

Negative:
     1)  Middle of the game...  what just happened?  and HOW!?
     2)  Here is a dragon... why?    because...  ...  It's cool?
     3)  Your mage might as well be a fighter.
     4)  You could probably beat the game with only the heroine and the healer.
     5)  The final boss...   where am I going?  (Go to an isle in the south west quandrant of the map.)

Overall:  If you want an introduction to the JRPG genre.  Buy this on sale (<$1.00).",1490559654,1536962110,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Level design is exceptional, preserving the exploration maze without luring the player to waste endless amounts of time checking every bit of scenery for hidden rare goodies. Run speed is also quick enough to not feel sluggish as well - a real asset.

Combat system is definitely skewed towards physical, as the one real spellcaster has incredibly weak spells - his physical output is more than double his magical output. There's one very prominent battle tactic - and once you learn it, you never really are in any danger of losing to any battle.

Random forced encounters are done away with, instead allowing you to dodge around them - or run head on to trigger an encounter. This is a welcome addition when attempting to explore an area for chests - or in some of the bigger levels.

Story was good, albeit brief. It draws you in, and definitely compels you to move forward at all stages - but the oldschool Final Fantasy lover in me says it felt too short, especially near the end. There's a sweet spot for longevity in this genre, and this one comes up well before the mark.

- Редкие опечатки в тексте, иногда текст не убирался в строку и обрезался.

I found it very nice and charming, even though I might not be too familiar with Indie games since I haven't played them in a very long time. For the price I have paid, I think it is well worth it, however just like any other game, it isn't perfect.

Pros:
You may choose to fight or evade ""small fights"" using strategy
You can beat the bosses with the level you gradually become (so no grinding is needed)
Plenty of dialogue and side characters (Though they seem to have given up near the end of the game XD)
Unlimited inventory

Cons: 
Some side quests are really hidden, I had to turn to a guide for two of them
The music can tear your ears apart, set your device's volume at 50% before opening the game
It might be too cliche of a plot for some
There is no ""Map"" you can look at, which sometimes makes it very complicated to ""geometry"" yourself around
Hard mode is not 'hard'
Need more slots for equipment
Areas that one is not expected to visit/revisit glitch out
Will lag if you have many background applications opened

There are many who have speedrun through the whole game in whithin 5 hours or so, and of course they are not satisfied, they didn't explore their characters enough. I played it slowly over a course of two weeks, doing serveral side quests, fighting most of the monsters I've come across. Yes, even though I was playing on Hard mode I found it very easy. But then again, it might be because of how I played the game, which would vary depending on the player.

Lastly, I would rate the game:
Overall enjoyment 8/10
Characters: 7/10
Plot: 6/10
Music: 6/10
Length: 7/10
Amount of sidequests: 9/10
Pleased with the items: 5/10

[i]Storm of Spears RPG[/i] is a beginner-level RPG with very little fan service (as seen from two characters (Sura and Valeese) you've seen in the trailer) and focuses more on story and labyrinthine areas without maps, so having some decent maze-treking skills helps out here.  The story is an average mercenary rebellion story that is similar to the vibe from [i]Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance[/i], but with a few typos and some unresolved story points.  The story also feels like it ends far too suddenly.

As a few reviewers have said, the title is misleading as there are no spears in this game, the girl in the banner (and title screen) does not appear in the game, and many of the items are pretty much useless inventory filler that you will never touch.

Now, I did enjoy the aesthetic the developer was going for and I enjoy the story that went with it, though the game did feel a bit too easy for my tastes.  This game can be easily compared to [i]The Chosen RPG[/i], which I would honestly prefer over [i]Storm of Spears RPG[/i], which has more fan service, a better battle system, and more likeable characters.

I'm a slow reader, so this took me about 7.5 hours to complete (all side-quests and reading all dialogue).  For the price that I paid (Sale price of $0.50), I can't complain much.  Though I wouldn't say this is worth asking price.  But this isn't a ""bad game"".  It's simply an [i]RPGMaker[/i] title in need of polish.

6/10  Not bad, but could be better.  At least it's another RPG that sells using fan-service.  (Your eyes won't be bored as you play)",1484717581,1484717581,True,6,0,0.539005637168884277,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I expected it to be a bit grindy - per RPG/JRPG rules, but none of that!  I actually grinded to see if there were any secret skills or spells and just to honor the spirit of it all.  The storyline was interesting and I enjoyed following the side quests.  The last town was huge! and there were pretty things to look at.  This was easier than other RPGs I tried, but unique in its own way.  I would like to see what happens to the characters afterwards - as in continuation.  Thank you for making this game. :)))
____________________________________________________________________________

Went back and played this game once more.  Of course more fun was had!  The text is well written and the story is enjoyable!  Characters are all unique and have their own stories, even if you find out some of them near the end.  I like the twist that was connected to a specific location.  Unexpected.  I also enjoyed being able to go through plants and bushes.

The game does have difficulty selection and if you explore every corner, you can get 10+ out of this game.  You may also find a few secrets here and there.  Thanks again for all the game fun!!! :D :> =)

The story starts with a band of mercenery's that is rebeling against the  bad empire...
And this is the concept of game

Although i really enjoy the script-scenario i must admit it was kinda ""poor"" , story could be better in many ways but as it seems developer-s were kinda lazy to do it....

So i will try to make it short with just pros and cons

Pros: 

1)intresting scenario
2)Huge maps
3)Dragon ride YAYYYY !
4) nice music
5) Very cheap (worth buying)

Cons

1) Huge maps that are practicaly labyrinths
2) Map would be a VERY VERY usefull tool (if only developers had enable it...)
3) Few enemys, poor AI (you can pass it with ease.... ok i get it we are mercenerys... paid assasins but come on the Enemy AI pass beside me like i am not exist?!?!?!? )
4) The scenario could be better
5) few items to equip your characters with
6) Title..... dosnt have anything to do with games.....Spears dont even exist as equipable item in game -.-
7) Side quest are give you nothing..... even the GOD gives you item with a small status buff -_-
8) ending seems ALMOST impossible if you dont go FARMING countless enemys untill your characters are strong enough to face the Last boss



And If you still wonder... OK great...but if they are so many cons why should i give away my money???!!!
For less than 1Euro this game will keep you bussy for at least 6-7 hours ..... For a strange reasson the scenario is both half way ended but also very nice...... 

I dont know why but i REALLY liked as a game.....
Sooooooo for its price i think that is worth to give a try
If you are RPG lover you will defenently like it

Чтобы приготовить бисквитный рулет, вам потребуются следующие ингредиенты:
*****************************************************************************************
2 ст. пшеничной муки
1 ст. сахара
400 г свежей или замороженной малины
8 яичных желтков
4 яичных белка
8 ст. л. сахарной пудры
1 ст. л. картофельного крахмала
500 мл 33%-ных сливок.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Как готовится бисквитный рулет «Сладкая малинка»:

1. Яичные желтки и половину сахара поместить в миску, вилкой растереть до появления белой пены. Белки взбить в миксере в пену, постепенно прибавить к ним вторую половину сахара, продолжая взбивать. В результате должна получиться устойчивая белая масса, которую следует аккуратно вылить в желтки, перемешивая ложкой сверху вниз. Муку смешать с крахмалом, просеять в яичную смесь, перемешивать тесто от краёв к центру, пока не разойдутся все комочки. Вылить тесто на противень, застеленный пергаментом и в течение 8-10 минут испечь корж при среднем жаре (170-180 градусов).

The game feels incomplete and is very buggy as could be seen when I streamed the game. As such, I won't give my normal style of review but instead a pro and con list type review.

Pros:

[list]
[*]Avoidable enemies. (This also means that you have to leave the area in order to respawn enemies). This does get annoying later when you eventually get sick of fighting trash mobs that have a 50% evade rate on top of your own miss rate. Unlike other games where you can have an item or ability to remove/move mobs, the enemies here will often pursue you or simply block your path.
[*]Plenty of sidequests
[*]Some NPCs change their generic convo text after big story events.
[*]Quest system makes it easy to know what quest to do. Unfortunately, the quests are not sorted so it can be rather cluttered by the end.
[/list]

Things to note that are both Pros and Cons:
[list]
[*]Main characters have semi-full (no feet) portraits. This is a pro in and of itself, but as most characters only have small square portraits, this looks odd.
[*]Sparkles let the player know where to interact. This also means that a lack of sparkles means there is no interaction (excluding NPCs and chests which do not sparkle). This is great in the sense that players don't have to check everything, but the sparkles are white... and there is a white snow map.
[*]The game can be completed 100% in about 6 hours on the hardest difficulty, not 13+. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but isn't necessarily a good thing. On the easiest difficulty, the game can be finished in about 4 hours or possibly less.
[*]Chandeliers. While a nice thought, they really look odd being attached to nothing.
[/list]

Cons: 

[list]
[*]Feels unfinished in a rushed to finish sort of way.
[*]Bartenders tell you to order stuff or to be wary of ordering certain things, but you can't buy anything from bartenders.
[*]Final town has MANY areas with doors that say nothing on interaction AND can't be entered.
[*]Final town has many NPCs with no convo text, including a bartender.
[*]Really odd layout for many maps, including most areas and the final town.
[*]Random shadows in a game that generally lacks shadows except for objects that have shadows as part of their image. Most of the game's terrain (even including towns) lack shadows. However, randomly, you will see shadows that are just there and often do not match the terrain they are coming from.
[*][b]VERY buggy and full of issues.[/b]
[*]If your main character gets confused and does a multihit on itself, it will freeze the game if it dies before the multihit is over. Not sure what happens in other situations as I was essentially forced to not allow it to be confused ever again.
[*]Many areas have bad pathing issues. Whether from invisible walls or from walls that can be ignored and walked through.
[*]Several enemies flicker as the game is confused on whether to render them or to disable them, forcing them to flicker on and off.
[*]At least one enemy object has issues where the game does not know what layer to draw the object on, causing overlapping objects to flicker as the game tries to map the background objects on top.
[*]Very noticeable lag in certain areas, especially large ones due to the rendering of large water sources without any optimization.
[*]One sidequest seems to be missable due to a bug changing how one of the events work.
[*]The game starts in fullscreen mode even with the ""fullscreen mode"" option unchecked. 
[*]The F1 options cannot be easily interacted with as the game hides the mouse, forcing the player to use the keyboard to control the menu.
[*]Mouse control does not exist except in very specific menu windows.
[*][b]Lacks full controller support[/b] [i]despite[/i] the store page stating it has full controller support. Overall, it lacks noticeable controller support. Tried to play the game with only a controller, did not work.
[*][b]Horrid balancing. [/b]
[*]The wizard's skills are essentially useless. The wizard does more damage with a normal attack.
[*]SPI in general is useless except on the healer, even then...
[*]The healer's skills are effectively unnecessary for most boss battles.
[*]The main character's paralyze lock is near necessary for boss battles, especially the end boss.
[*]The paralyze lock works on all bosses, making the healer skills and wizard's debuff skill effectively useless.
[*]The secondary dps/buffer's skills essentially make the healer's remove stat down skill useless.
[*]Most accessories are useless, especially early elemental boss drops as the rings make you resist the elemental boss you just beat...
[*]Most of the difficulty lies in the absurdly high dodge rate of the enemies. Even if you don't miss, they can still evade your attack and it seems like the enemies evade much more often than your characters to the point that the 1/20 miss chance and 1/20 evade chance seems more like 1/2 miss chance and 1/2 evade chance at times.
[*]And more...
[/list]

I am going to end it there. While I mostly enjoyed the game, there are just too many negative points for me to recommend the game. Also, why does the game have the name ""Storm of Spears"" when no character in the game uses spears? Even the title image shows a sword. Speaking of which, who is the title character? The main character dual wields swords and has brown hair and white clothing. The title character has blonde hair and one sword and bronze colored clothing.",1481547783,1481548456,False,23,1,0.636988639831542969,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Story was okay, but can be completed in 6 is hours not the 10 it claims.

Combat would have been fine except that even on casual difficulty your party whiffs (misses or enemy evades) at least 1/4 of the time which protracts battles that should otherwise be over in one round. Turn order is also very random between characters will similiar AGI stats, it makes any sort of tactics/planning useless. The mage's magic doesn't seem to scale up as he levels and is pathetically weak compared to just using his basic attack. Every enemy can be paralyzed and then wailed on with Tiamat Slash, you should do this for every boss.

Music was decent but might be stock RPGMaker

Graphics were mediocre, even the portraits weren't great and they only had one expression so the MC would be smiling wide during serious or sad scenes. Character art doesn't match the character sprites. Someone thought it a good idea to place white shining pick up item spots on white snow tiles.

Levels suffered from extreme sprawl, it was kind of like mazing except you'd walk 5 minutes in one direction (including fights) only to find that was the wrong way. Early on in the game there is a full map screen that is the wrong direction but they turned the entire thing into a mazing area so you'll spend about 1/2 hour there for optional quest things. It'll be hell for anyone with a bad sense of direction too as there aren't a lot of landmarks.

A game breaking bug may still exist in the game if you go to the wrong location before you get to a certain point in the main quest though I avoided it.

There are some optional quest objectives which can be missed solely because a location connects to the wrong map after a certain point.

The title doesn't make sense as no one uses a spear in the game at all, not that the sprite carry weapons anyways.

The trading cards refer to a different game and card art work doesn't match the game's art work.

If you're buying for Nudity; don't. The only Nudity in the game is the revealing clothing your two female party members wear which is 100% coverage of the naughty bits. In other words no Nudity, just revealing.

Some really good, others completely miserable. This one is neither, but it definitely isn't all that good. That as hardcore completionist I left the side-jobs just to rush the main plot should say enough. Sadly, it didn't really lead to a satisfactory conclusion regardless.

So let's sum up why this is one of the ""bad"" RPGMaker games:
* Absolutely the worst thing here is the attrocious level design. Narrow ugly unnatural looking mazes. I've never before seen a RPGMaker game with such horrid levels to navigate around and play with. Also the overland map was the most sloppy and amateurish I've seen so far.
* Bad combat. 70% of the game exists out of fighting 2 guys who die in 2 hits... with a part of 4. Then the end 20% there's 3 guys that die in 2 hits. Both extremely weak. The other 10% is bosses, which can be stunlocked with ease, making them rather easy hitdumps. Even the final boss. Who for some reason needed to have insta-kill attacks on each hit. So stun or die. Oh joy. Guy has a fairly insane hitpool too.
* Some really weird balancing. The wizard character does more damage with the standard attack than any of his spells. Infact, the higher leveled the spell and more mana it takes, the less damage it does. What?
* Bad plot and characters. You can see the ""twist"" from a galaxy away, there is no believability for characters (""I'll never join the rebellion!"" ""Please?"" ""Oh, I will join the rebellion, you're so convincing!"". Just way too many forced things ingame to make you scratch  your head. For example the final boss had a big speech about not caring for you and not wanting to fight you etc... and then after the long monologue it goes ""Oh, I'm going to kill you anyway""... HELLO? And that was more rule than exception.
* Some slacky polish which stands out like blue/red flags being important then seeing a whole enemy camp in your flag color immediately AFTER the whole color conversion (*sigh*), people standing on chairs, moonwalking mining, bartenders asking you for a drink and not selling anything. Overall, it felt sloppy.

But I guess it does have some good things going for it:
* Low price
* NO random enemies. Thank god. Running past most boring combat was very helpful too.
* Generally citizens updated their conversations based on your actions, aside from some exceptions which are probably due to the sloppy execution.",1480640194,1480643382,False,49,3,0.752006173133850098,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are no randomized fights, not even enemies on the world map. This makes travel a lot faster and I didn't get annoyed on my way. Since I had no problems in fightnig anything (including elite mobs and story bosses) I guess they aren't necessary anyway. 

Also I never had any problems with finding good items. There are a lot of chests and I always got something useable when fighting an elite or boss. 

The story wasn't that bad. Do this, do that, save those, get trapped. I won't spoiler anything but there are a few good ideas. There are also some side quests which makes the game seem bigger. 

Sadly all those big character pictures never change .. I wish they'd show different expressions or moves. 

Also I have to admit that I've seen better mapping before. I don't know why but sometimes it feels like there was a lack of imagination and creativity.

The delight the building stage has given attempting redirection makers the ability to make their own Last Dream style RPG with special stories, custom maps, and inventive characters. 

In any case, as perpetual guitar lessons have demonstrated to me, since I have the mechanical assemblies to make craftsmanship doesn't make me Jimi Hendrix. 

RPGMaker redirections regularly feel like a comparable way to deal with me, there's two or three great ones, swimming in a sea of unremarkableness. This is the reason I moved toward Storm of Spears with a touch of fear, as to RPGMaker redirections, I look for after the best yet expect the most exceedingly terrible. 

I was happy to find that, like a chocolate bar in a field of pooch butt chunks, Storm of Spears is shockingly charming and an especially well made beguilement. 

Since the advantages made open to designers are distinctively limited by what's fused into RPGMaker, the entertainments in light of the stage each one of the tend to have a comparable fundamental feel and look. A top down perspective for travel and a turn based battle system are the standard for RPGMaker entertainments, so it routinely makes the pleasure variable of the delight vivaciously reliant on the producer's ability to make a persuading story, which Whirlwind of Spears has a lot of. 

Without giving perpetually the preoccupation's craftiness turn, the basic story takes after a female warrior named Sura, pioneer of the famous enlisted trooper hoard ""The Nightswords."" The diversion opens with Sura and her band of contenders daring to the most distant corners of the planet of Gallagher in riddle on account of the lead of an extreme ruler who is starting now endeavoring to crush a resistance. Sura, who at first needs nothing to do with the crown or the instigators, is at last drawn into the fight against the ruler after her kin is butchered by the ruler's warriors. With her kin dead, and nothing left to live for, Sura promises to counter for her kin's passing and see the Sagacious Ruler's kingdom passed on to annihilate. 

I found the record of Storm of Spears, a strengthening transform on what has transformed into a standard story association of join the fomenters, conquer the area. Whirlwind of Spears reshapes this customary more interesting methods of expression through Sura's character motivation. 

All through the preoccupation, Sura is outstandingly open about not considering the insubordination, beside as a way to deal with right her reprisal on her kin's killers. 

It was animating to have an essential character that isn't only a paragon of goodness whose every line and action yells ""I am a tolerable individual, doing extraordinary things!"" Keeping her motivations individual and evidently extremist, makes her a significantly more useful and totally mapped out character. In any case, Sura isn't the principle complex character in the preoccupation, each person from her social occasion has their own specific shocking backstory, giving them their own particular clarifications behind expecting to join the defiance, this even extends to a significant parcel of the delight's criminals who feel that their deceptive deeds serve more vital's advantage. The eccentrics of the character's near and dear stories joined with the beguilement's insightful and unanticipated bend enhance Whirlwind of Spears' story plotted and paced than various AAA titles. 

The gameplay in Storm of Spears will be conspicuous to any aficionado of out-dated RPG's. The turn based fight structure is all around delineated, with each character having their own particular custom limits that are contrasted enough to make everyone supportive in the preoccupation's battle ranges. The fight is moreover all around balanced, never frustratingly troublesome, also not too basic that any experience can be upset. Storm of Spears furthermore boasts a generous measure of substance, with over 13 hours of gameplay between the essential adventure and side missions. I watched the side missions to be especially dazzling, many give facilitate learning into where there is Gallagher, making it feel like a totally recognized world with its own specific history that existed much sooner than the start of the entertainment. Regardless of the way that these side missions exist openly of the essential adventure, they enough tie into the redirection's guideline account, giving further aiming to the story. 

I found little to cry about in Storm of Spears, however if I expected to pick something to investigate, I would express that a part of the delight's missions were obscure on definitely where I ought to go. This, merged with the maze like nature of a segment of the preoccupation's extents inferred that I contributed a significant measure of vitality backtracking through particular locales with no idea where to go. In any case, I was never stuck in these domains for enough time to make me have to surrender the redirection, so this criticism is by no means whatsoever, a beguilement breaker. 

Storm of Spears is an epic, carefully made experience that any devotee of commendable RPG's would appreciate. The enamoring story will direct you into the universe of the beguilement while the overall balanced fight and broad redirection guide will keep you playing until the end. Regardless of the missions being from time to time hard to investigate, Storm of Swords is a beguilement that has something for everybody. Did I say that you ride around on a legendary serpent? No doubt, you get the chance to do that too.

Enemies and bosses were easy as well.  My characters dealt over 80-350 points of damage, while enemies, and bosses AND the final boss would do under that damage even sometimes not deal damage at all (defense was too high) and my characters were only level 20.  The only time I was KO'ed was from the final boss because he had a death spell, but I never had one game over.

No credit roll either.
It's also easy to get all the achivements, they're all story based so you can't miss them.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Storm Of Spears RPG is a RPG game (duh) made in RPG Maker. Although there is a warning about inappropriate content, the only inappropriate thing in this game is the characters' lack of clothing (which can be seen in the screenshots). The game itself tells the story about a group of mercenaries which are trying to do a rebellion against a kingdom.

[h1]Music[/h1]
I'm not sure whether the music is from the default RPG Maker asset, but i do know that some of them are. They are used appropriately, however.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Again, i'm not really sure whether they are using default RPG Maker asset, but i do believe that most of them are using the default asset. The character portrait doesn't seem like using a default asset, although that maybe the reason why the character portrait seems to be different from the sprite, especially their height.

The mapping looks lazily done; most of them are placed inappropriately, especially the no-wall section in some dungeons, which looks more like a ""pitfall"". Even if there is a wall, the wall is like a few tiles away from the floor. The mapping is also using two tiles for a chair (which is not passable) which makes you have to circle around to go to the place that you want.

The battle screen's background is also off; I mean, in most of the backgrounds, the character looks like standing in an obstacle. While i'm at it, there is this odd line where the ""xxx attacks"" message lefts out after each attack.

Aside from the mappings, the graphic fits perfectly for low screen resolution. The game can be changed to full screen to make the graphic looks blurred.

The UI looks like a default one, although i have to complaint about the quest menu which will close the menu when you are pressing X instead of going to the main menu.

Lastly, the text placement seems to be off; sometimes, the sentence ends in the middle of the dialogue box, sometimes, it fits the dialogue box, and sometimes, the sentence looks cropped (due to the dialogue box's length).

[h1]Story[/h1]
I think i'll just be blunt with this. I don't understand the prologue at all. You are catching someone out of nowhere which turns out to be a leader of a rebels because you are a group of mercenaries hired by someone. After that, it showed that you are in a troublesome kingdom with an unfit ruler which you plan to overthrow.

The MC doesn't look have much resolve at first, although i don't really see any character development on her. She just looks like following the turns of events and somehow made her place at the end. There is also this outstandingly smart little brother which looks like a child to me. The party's background story are explained, although not in detail, and there is also no character development for them except on one side quest.

However, the story keeps on focusing on its main mission without being distracted on some other places. The story concludes greatly and all the events are flowing smoothly.

[h1]The game[/h1]
The first thing that i want to address is how my cursor is always staying behind the game and how i can't exit the game by clicking X (close) button in the game window.

The game starts after you choose one out of three difficulties, with casual being the easiest, normal, and hard. After that, the game will start until you can control your character. For those who are not used with RPG Maker games, there is a short text tutorial about the controls after that.

Although the game has different difficulties, i think that those are scaled weirdly. I only play casual difficulty and while the enemies can be hard to kill (take around 2-3 hits to kill one of them, although there are 3-4 enemies in a battle), the bosses are no different from normal enemies except for a more hp and a more damaging attack (except for the last boss which has a one hit kill skill). I can kill them in a few turns except for two enemies (the last boss and an optional boss, namely the Dark Lord because i fight them in low level at that time).

You'll start with a four person party of an attacker, a healer, a buffer (and a strong attacker), and a magic user. However, i have to say that the classes are unbalanced. The MC, being an attacker in the game, is way too strong compared to the magic user. There is this OP skill which slash the enemies thrice which will have a tremendous damage if she got her attack boosted (which is a piece of cake with the buffer's skill). The mage hardly can use any useful magic and can even deal a higher damage by attacking rather than doing a magic skill. There are also skills which will be learned after they reach a particular level. Note that the damage dealing skills can only be learned by the attacker and the mage.

The game keeps track of its quest in a log which can be accessed from the main menu. The quest differentiates between side quest and main quest with an icon. However, some of the quest has a wrong icon, while there is one quest which has no icon at all. However, the quest is very simple and easy to follow with the quest log.

This game has a few dungeons which is designed perfectly. I do enjoy getting lost in dungeons and this game really helps me fulfill that desire. I'm getting lost several times in the dungeon because of the big map. However, having a big map also means more monster. Luckily, there is no random encounter in the game and the enemy won't respawn unless you leave the area. The only downside is the last town, Ironhorn, which is so big that i keep on getting lost in there.

There are some weapon and armor seller in some towns, although you'll get the equipment from somewhere else most of the times. The equipments are also cheap (less than 100g) which make the items look way more expensive.

When you are almost finished the game, you'll receive a dragon mount. However, you have to go one tile below the dragon to ride it.

Pros:
- 3 difficulties to select from
- Easy to follow quest log
- Greatly designed dungeon
- No random encounter

Cons:
- Unbalanced class
- Lazily done mappings

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This is a RPG Maker game about mercenaries which turns to be rebels. There are no inappropriate scenes in this game except the characters' lack of clothing.

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b]
[i]I bought this game as a part of JRPG Happiness Love Bundle which contains other games in a cheap price, but seeing that the bundle isn't here anymore, i can't really recommend the game because the game seems to be lazily done.
I mean, there are a lot of better free RPG Maker games out there although it's not in steam which obviously doesn't have achievements and trading cards.

However, if you just want to play an easy to finish RPG Maker game, you can buy this game. Without the bundle, it's actually pretty cheap when it's on a discount.[/i]",1477757143,1477758338,False,19,0,0.647956371307373047,4,True,False,False,False,,,

I felt all ascpects were well designed, or well, almost all. Becuase while lore, rewards, plot, pacing and pretty much everythig else was well made and well delived, there were three issues:

First one is just a minor but annoying thing; when you click the hotkey for closing the game. The game closes. No warning, no autosave, nothing. 

Second one is that the sprites did not match the detailed art very well, the most jarring exaple beeing a skinny blue eyed kid with the sprite of a brown eyed chubby man. This is probably even more minor for most people, but i found it mildly imersion breaking, and thus worse in my book than a mere interface issue like the first problem.

Third one would in many other cases have been dealbreaking. The combat and stat/equipment system was boring. Each new peice of main equipment was a linear upgrade to the previous one, the player party was internally inbalanced, the battles seemed impossible to not win without activly trying to lose, and some stats/items felt outright superfluous and impotent... With that said, I did enjoy the battles at times.




All in all a good game, and as long as you don't expect too much from the combat system, you'll have nice time, and might be pleasantly surpriced at times.

Zusammenfassung: 

Zuvor aber noch: Ich kann nicht verstehen warum Storm Of Spears RPG als Erotik-Produkt vermarktet wird!  (habe darauf aber selbst keinen großen Wert gelegt)
                 Ich habe es erworben, da es in einem Bundle mit dabei war (glaube für ca 0.20€ oder 0.50€).
                
                 Alles in allem hatte ich Spaß am Spiel und habe es auch gleich in einem rutsch durchgespielt.                 
                 Der Preis ist meiner Meinung nach in Ordnung (selbst bei 2€ noch), trotz kleiner Fehler
                 auf einigen Karten (zB. aufm Zaun laufen?) ist das Spiel zu empfehlen.

Erneut habe ich aus der Steam-Grabbelkiste ein eher mittelprächtiges RPG-Maker-Spielchen ausgegraben. Dieses mal erwischt es Storm of Spears, eines der zahlreichen Maker-Rollenspiele von Warfare Studios, einem brasilianischen Indie-Entwickler, der sich auf RPG-Maker-Spiele spezialisiert hat. Allein auf Steam hat Warfare schon 15 Spiele veröffentlicht, die laut den dortigen Nutzerreviews jedoch von stark schwankender Qualität sind. Storm of Spears ist das bis dato aktuellste Spiel des Entwicklers. Es gehört mit 1,99 € jedoch zu den günstigeren Titeln aus Warfares Portfolio. Was genau das Spiel nun zu bieten hat, und was nicht, will ich euch in folgenden Review aufzeigen.


[h1]Vier Söldner gegen ein korrumpiertes Königreich[/h1]
Die Kriegerin Sura ist Anführerin der Night Swords, einer vierköpfigen Söldnergruppe, welche hauptsächlich Nachts operiert und daher wohl auch ihren Namen bezieht. Dieser Umstand ist jedoch eher aus einer Not heraus entstanden, denn seitdem die bösartige Königin Lilliana den Thron des Königreichs Gallagar bestiegen hat, ist das Leben unglaublich hart und riskant geworden. Die Tyrannin hält ihr Reich im eisernen Griff und sieht in ihren Untertanen wenig mehr als Sklaven, die es auszubeuten gilt. Jede Rebellion gegen die fiese Königin und ihre Schergen ist bislang gescheitert. Infolgedessen ist Sura und ihr Team schon längst desillusioniert und arbeitet lediglich für das schnelle Gold, statt ihren Hals für irgendwelche illusorischen Ideale hinzuhalten. Und das obwohl ihr Bürgermeister, Gönner und Auftraggeber Bernard einer der führenden Köpfe der Rebellenbewegung in ihrer Heimatstadt Callum ist. Doch dann wendet sich das Blatt: Mit der astronomischen Summe von 10.000 Goldstücken, werden die Night Swords für die Dauer einer einzigen Mission in die Rebellion geködert. Callum soll von den Truppen der Königin befreit werden. Sura plant, sich mithilfe des Geldes in ein anderes Land abzusetzen, wo sie ihrem geliebten jüngeren Bruder Lucas endlich ein besseres Leben ermöglichen möchte. Freilich geht die Rebellion in die Hose und Lucas wird bei den Kampfhandlungen getötet. Nun kennt Sura nur noch ein Ziel: Die tyrannische Königin muss sterben! Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, schwingt sich Sura zur Anführerin der Rebellen auf. Und auch ihre drei Mitstreiter Edryan, Valeese und Gyorg haben noch ein Hühnchen mit dem korrumpierten Königreich zu rupfen.

Die Story ist gar nicht mal schlecht für so ein Online-Grabbelkisten-Spielchen. Der Kampf gegen das eigenen Königreich, welches von korrupten Machthabern tyrannisiert wird, weckt natürlich sofort Erinnerungen an die Suikoden-Serie. Die Handlung entwickelt sich dabei zwar nicht spannend, aber durchaus nachvollziehbar weiter, auch wenn es die obligatorische Wendung zum Schluss echt nicht gebraucht hätte.


[h1]Lieblos hingeschludertes Trash-Game[/h1]
Die Gameplay-Elemente von Storm of Spears unterscheiden sich nicht großartig von einem generischen JRPG. Man erkundet die Spielwelt aus der Vogelperspektive und erforscht abwechselnd Städte und Dungeons, die per begehbarer Weltkarte angesteuert werden können. Innerhalb der Dungeons gibt es freilich viele Gegner, die netterweise immer sichtbar sind und somit gezielt bekämpft oder umgangen werden können. Der Kampf läuft rundenbasiert ab und bietet nichts, was ihn von anderen RPG-Maker-Titeln unterscheidet. Erledigte Gegner hinterlassen Geld und Erfahrungspunkte. Geld benötigt man zum Erwerb neuer Ausrüstung und Heilgegenstände bei den Händlern innerhalb der Stadtgebiete. Erfahrungspunkte dienen hingegen zum Aufleveln der vier Hauptcharaktere, um deren Statistikwerte zu verbessern und diese somit stärker werden zu lassen. Ab gewisser Levelstufen bekommen die vier Söldner dann auch neue Skills freigeschaltet, welche einem zusätzliche Möglichkeiten im Kampf offenbaren. Der Einsatz einer Skill-Fähigkeit kostet freilich Magiepunkte. Es erklärt sich auch von selbst, dass jeder Charakter über individuelle Skills verfügt. Sura bekommt die nützlichen Kriegerfähigkeiten, Edryan ist der Heilmagier, Valeese beherrscht Unterstützungsmagie für Buffs und Gyorg ist der Kampfmagier.

So weit so gut, aber wo liegt denn nun eigentlich die Krux in Storm of Spears? Nun, die liegt im lächerlich niedrigen Schwierigkeitsgrad. Das Spiel bietet drei Schwierigkeitsgrade: Casual, Normal und Hard. Da das hier der erste Titel von Warfare Studios ist, den ich gespielt habe, wählte ich sicherheitshalber den normalen Schwierigkeitsgrad. Tatsächlich fühlte sich dieser jedoch so an, als hätte ich den Casual-Grad ausgewählt, so verdammt leicht war das Spiel. Der einzige Kampf, der mich auch nur ansatzweise fordern konnte, war der letzte Bossgegner. Aber auch nur, weil dieser Instant-Death-Skills spammte. Ich habe das Spiel dann auch noch mal kurz im höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad Probe gespielt, konnte in den ersten paar Kämpfen aber auch keine nennenswerte Herausforderung feststellen. Wer also eine halbwegs angemessene Herausforderung sucht, sollte besser die Finger von Storm of Spears lassen.

Dabei ist dieses Problem noch gar nicht mal mein Hauptkritikpunkt. Das was mich am meisten ankotzt, ist die völlig mangelhafte Qualitätsprüfung des Balancings. Nun haben wir ja bereits geklärt, dass das Spiel zu leicht ist, aber wirklich lächerlich ist der völlig unausbalancierte Kampfmagier Gyorg. Dessen Kampfzauber richten nämlich weniger Schaden an als seine regulären Angriffe! Selbst sein stärkster Zauber richtet wenig mehr als die Hälfte des Schadens seiner gewöhnlichen Standard-Attacke an … Einfach nur lächerlich! Und an diesem Punkt ist mir auch klar geworden, dass Storm of Spears wenig mehr als ein völlig lieblos hingeschludertes Geldmacherei-Produkt ist. Das ist schade, denn neben den bereits genannten Vorzügen, blinzeln ja auch immer wieder vereinzelte Lichtblicke hindurch. So sind einige Dungeon-Maps überraschend weitläufig und verwinkelt ausgefallen, und der Abschnitt im verlassenen alten Herrenhaus, war ein netter Versuch einen kleinen Grusel-Adventure-Abschnitt zu integrieren. Aber unterm Strich hilft das dann auch nicht, den unangenehmen Trash-Faktor zu negieren.


[h1]Grafik und Sound[/h1]
Grafik: Die Grafik ist ein zweischneidiges Schwert. Der Großteil des Inhalts entstammt wohl dem RPG-Maker-Baukasten. Jedoch hat Storm of Spears den Vorteil, dass ich viele der Grafiken nicht aus anderen Maker-RPGs wiedererkenne. Damit wirkt die Grafik für mich „frischer“ als sie wahrscheinlich ist. 

Der Soundtrack bietet nichts, was einem in Erinnerung verweilt. Mir ist jedenfalls kein einziger Track im Kopf hängengeblieben, über den ich jetzt schwärmen könnte. Aber immerhin gab es auch keinen Track, der gestört hätte oder so.


[h1]Mit entsprechenden Feinschliff wäre es sogar ganz gut geworden…[/h1]
Ehrlich gesagt hat mir Storm of Spears durchaus Spaß gemacht, zumindest bis zu dem Punkt, wo ich gemerkt habe, wie kaputt der Schwierigkeitsgrad und das Balancing des Spiels ausgefallen sind. Über solche groben Mängel kann ich nun einmal unmöglich hinwegsehen. Und dann ist da noch die schäbige Masche das Spiel als Erotik-Produkt zu vermarkten, obwohl es diese Kategorie eben nicht erfüllt. Trotz seiner starken Seiten, wie der bodenständigen Story und zahlreicher Nebenquests, welche zur Erkundung der Spielwelt einladen, wirkt Storm of Spears unterm Strich wie ein billiges Trash-Game aus der RPG-Maker Online-Grabbelkiste – schade.",1473061339,1634150298,False,2,0,0.549718558788299561,1,True,False,False,False,,,

1.每个地区，包括房间都有名字，如果想不迷路，最好是在进入一个地方的时候瞅一瞅左上角的名字，以免后面还要回来。

2.人物虽然画风超级差，但关键人物还是会有些差别，所以，他们的样子也要记住，以免你每个村民都对话一遍。（如果有任务是让你调查这个地区，那么其真正意义就是让你找到你的3个队友并且都对话一次，然后才能继续推动剧情）

3.MINE的出口在右上角，DEEP HOLLOW的出口在左下角，这两个地方是这个游戏比较蛋疼的地图，而且在MINE想出去还要找到在出口的左下角的LADDER。

4.打通MINE地区以后，会有一个回到BRUKE找FELICIA的任务，这个任务有点坑，我当时花了很多时间去找，FELICIA在进BRUKE地区的第一个房子中左上角的小房间里。

5.在MANOR也有调查任务，但是是调查书柜，最坑的就是这个大房子里有左右对称的4个门，但是由于构图不够仔细，左边有一个门是看不见的，需要通过想象力才能发现。四个房间来回跑，把所有需要调查的书柜调查完，就能触发剧情打BOSS了。

    总结：虽然这个游戏有很多令我不忍吐槽的点，但毕竟是一个本来打算+1的游戏却被我拿来玩，所以还是应该给予尊重，而且我只玩了简单模式，无法给出更多的评价，所以暂时保持中立态度，不推荐也不反对。",1470387639,1476066807,True,27,7,0.670938491821289063,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Good story, nice music, easy turn-based combat. Downside is that it is short, the end coming to quick, even when doing side-quests. A second minor point is the magic of the warlock character : you're better off with physical attacks then using magical spells since the physical attacks do way more damage toward enemies while the minor damage coming from spells is kinda of a joke.  
There is no nudity in this game at all, so even kids could play this game without having their parents to be worried. In phantasy games, ladies are always lovely dressed but this is miles away from what can be defined as 'nudity'. Certainly in this game. No vulgarities or things that could be classified as adult content.
The range of items (equipment, potions, weapons) are ok, considering this is a short RPG game. There are 3 difficulty modes to play 'Storm of Spears'. I played in 'normal' mode but it felt like playing in 'easy' mode so I guess one could even start this game in 'hard' mode without much troubles to finish the game.

As player, you cannot create your own characters in this game but receive 4 premade characters. Depending on your taste, this could be either a positive or negative point. I loved the characters because of the good story, their personality and background. An improvement would be if it was possible to give at least names to the characters yourself. The names are also premade.

Conclusion: the game is worth its cheap price. Decent in its totality but short, having its bonuses and its cons. But every game, even the very best have their bonuses and cons. No game is perfect in the same way no human is perfect :)

Dans un premier temps, un compte Steam inconnu au nom de 'EQ Free Games' m'ajoute : septique, je décide finalement d'accepter la requête et voyant qu'il n'y a pas de discussion engagée, je finis par oublier son existence.
Puis un beau jour, je reçois un message de compte qui me présente ce jeu, avec la clé CD à activer. Naturellement je sens le fake mais finalement la clé CD fonctionne et Storm of Spears apparaît dans ma bibliothèque.

Que dire à son sujet ? Graphiquement c'est dans un style old school, type Game Boy Advance, avec des textures certes datées mais qui m'ont donné la nostalgie de ma première console. L'histoire met en oeuvre un groupe de 4 mercenaires aux 'classes' classiques, à savoir  'Swordsinger', 'Warrior', 'Monk' ( le soigneur de l'équipe ) et le 'Warlock'. Si toutefois les origines des personnages restent dans un premier temps inconnues, des quêtes secondaires permettront d'en apprendre plus sur chacun et ainsi permettre à la fin du jeu de présager une suite.

Niveau scénario, c'est complet, on assiste à un dénouement final entremêlé d'éléments classiques du RPG japonais : le fameux royaume, les trahisons, la magie et des héros déchus. Effectuer la trame principale et quelques quêtes secondaires demande environ 5h, plus pour finir le jeu à 100%.

Qu'est-ce qui m'a plu ? L'ambiance héroic fantasy dans un style Game Boy ainsi que le système de combat à la Final Fantasy, avec du combat au tour par tour ; en fait le système & l'interface sont exactement identiques. La musique renforce également l'univers, autant dans les moments épiques que tragiques.

Bref, un bon jeu qui occupe pendant quelques heures, avec une histoire intéressante et complète. On notera les autres quêtes secondaires qui rallongent la durée de vie.

Points négatifs cependant : jeu uniquement disponible en anglais. En soit ce n'est pas dérangeant pour la plupart des gens, mais certains pourraient être découragés d'explorer ce jeu. Autre point noir du jeu, l'apparence des personnages : dans les quelques dialogues ou images du jeu fournis sur la page Steam, ce qui saute aux yeux ce sont bien les 2 héroïnes dans des tenues assez légères. Regrettable erreur de marketing, car l'essence du jeu est à des années lumière de ces images suggestives.

Je le recommande donc vu son faible prix, pour son histoire & son côté old school.",1469202101,1469202101,True,15,0,0.710830330848693848,0,False,True,False,False,,,

There are other aspects of this game that may be misleading to players.

To start, the game's performance is below standards to play. Regardless of your system, the game will most likely stay at below 30FPS.  The game also runs an outdated version of RPGMaker (VXAce) instead of its current sucessor (MV). From the looks of it, SoS went through little time in development, so a simple switch to a better game creator version would have seriously improved its asthetics, performance and even resolution.

The design and visuals is simply inconsistent. The main character, Sura, has 3 different depictions of her; bust image, ingame sprite and trading card artwork. All 3 are very unrecognizable from each other. Also, the false and unrealistic breast sizes. This game has a ""Nudity"" tag and after completing the whole game, I recieved not a nipple. Nothing more than a clickbait tag. The story is decent, but mostly textbook. Also, there are many plot twists, expected and unexpected. A common trend to keep the story somewhat interesting. The battle system is stock. You have your 4 by the book retro RPG character lineup (Attacker, Stat Changer, White Magic, Black Magic). The sidequests are meaningless and the achievements are so simple to get. Just ""play"" through the main game.

Overall, Storm of Spears NEEDS a huge overhaul. Program update, custom asthetics, consistent character portraits and sprites, better story telling, alternate battle system beyond the stock, sidequests with high risk; high reward, and a name change.

I started playing, and continued to do so until I realized I beat the game in around 5-6 hours, which of late is an impressive feat as my attention hasn't been that easy for a game to keep.  The story is decent, with some good plot points, but not much to the story as the total playtime would imply.  The art for the main characters is well drawn, although I did feel a little curious at the random blonde on the title screen that had nothing to do with the story whatsoever.  Fight mechanics are simple enough, with no random encounters, so any fighting done involves running into various mobs on the map.  I did find it disappointing that magical attacking never did the damage my mage could do with simple melee, which made the character feel kind of pointless.  I found the music to be somewhat forgettable, so I opted to listen to my own music as there was no need to hear the game.

For the most part, the game felt like a decent attempt at creating a short RPG with some quality from the SNES era, and did so well.

On one hand, the story is very well told.  You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into it.  On the other hand, even for a RPGMaker game, it is technically unimpressive;  Sprites, music and sounds are stock RPGMaker assets, which cheapens the production values considerably.  The hand-drawn art is gorgeous, but all-too-often, it doesn't match the character's sprite it's supposed to represent.  A pretty guy with white hair as a portrait becomes a mustachioed guy with a huge chin as a sprite, for example.  Also, the art for the main characters doesn't change to express emotion, leaving for inappropriate smiling during sad moments.  It's a pity the effort that went into story and art apparently didn't reach the rest of the game.

Also, unless this is like your first RPG ever, do NOT play it on normal difficulty.  The game was so easy that the gameplay became rather tedious to get through in order to get to the story.

no map system of any kind
enemies health is not displayed

small anime tiddies
no quest tracker 

I definitely recommend this game just because of its price tag of $1.99. It was a nice change of pace from other games I play. I put nearly 5 hours into this game doing as many side quests as I could. It was hard to locate certain quest starting points due to no map system. The easiest way to defeat bosses and Golaths is use Sura's viper bite, keep your party healed with the white robe guy (cant remember his name), use Valesee's strength buff or alfare light buff on Sura and herself, then just keep attacking with Sura's sword techniques and Valesee's normal attack. You will win every battle ever. 

Overall it is a nice way to waste time if you don't feel like committing a long time to a game, but it will get old and boring if you play too long. 

I give the game a 6/10.

Fully recommend it to anyone who wants something different for a change, a break from the AAA titles. I got right into it, sure the story telling is pretty cliche but they pulled it off quite well. There were very few bugs I ran into, to be expected that there'd be some. Nothing game breaking, most people won't even notice, all the ones I ran into were by accident. (like walking in areas you shouldn't be able to walk in). There was one zone that was really choppy for me (Bruske Mines, the Phantom area). I don't know why, but that was the only zone I had issues with.

As far as RPG Maker goes, this one has been the best I've tried so far. I got this as part of a bundle and it's certainly much better than some of the others that came with the bundle.

Idk if the developers read these reviews, if they do. I'd like to share some of my thoughts on this game and how it could have been even more enjoyable for me.

- I would have liked more playable characters, create your own party from the available hereos, or a job system allowing more styles of combat than just the default
- More monster variety, I don't mind a single race of monsters specific to an area (it makes sense that monsters would kill eachother off and only the strongest remain) but if area ""A"" is going to have only Ogres, for example, it could have many different types of Ogres, instead of just Ogre A, Ogre B, Ogre C every fight
- I thought the battle animations were a bit long, I didn't notice it at first but towards the end of the game my inner monologue was like ""damn, another fight, cmon already""
- I liked the quest tracker system, keep that up, I wouldn't even have minded if it contained less detail and the player had to find areas themselves without the ""head east"" hints
- I loved that the zones weren't straight lines, and if you bothered to explore an area you were rewarded with treasure or sidequest. It was always worth your time. Keep that up.
- I found the difficulty quite a bit on the easy side, even the optional content wasn't challenging, at the very least a ""JRPG"" game should always have one optional quest thats like ""wtf is with this difficulty!!""
- Offensive magic was not worth using, I would really suggest buffing that. My ""mage"" was doing roughly 3x more damage with his auto attacks than his strongest spell

Maybe it's just me, but I did not find 10+ hours of gameplay and then another 3+ hours of optional content as advertized. I talked to every NPC, did every side quest (except 1), killed every monster I saw, fully explored every zone in the game, read all the dialogue and as you can see, my total game time is just shy of 6 hours. Now I don't care that it's only 6 hours in total, it was a good 6 hours spent, don't get me wrong. I know I tend to do things quicker than others but I find it hard to believe that the average person would take twice as long to do everything the game has to offer.

All that aside, I had fun, and that's what it's about. Thank you for your time and effort into making this game. I will be following you and looking forward to your future games.",1467786550,1467786550,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

typical lots of skin showing female characters.

a male character with his 6-8 pack showing like a woman's exposed belly. couldn't tell he was a male for a while

some placements weren't proper.

I think this game has good intentions, but it falls short of true enjoyment due to an overall unfinished/unpolished feel to it. With a little more effort, Storm of Spears could be great, but for now I feel rather neutral about it. 

I'm usually not too picky when it comes to design, but it is more than a bit confounding when the sprites in the game barely resemble the character art. The characters themselves could use more expression, considering the dialogue in game isn't horribly written by any means. But the impact of most of dialogue is lost once you see the character it is coming from always has the same grin or blank expression on their face no matter what. You can tell the creators put thought and care into the story, so I truly wish more of that thought and care would be shown in the art and design within the game.

Traversing the world map in the game was a tid bit boring, considering there were no random events or battles cropping up. You simply move from one place to the next. I also found myself getting lost quite easily in various areas (such as Daggeridge) due to the fact that most of the backgrounds were repetitive, without any unique markers to help me find my way around. This made quests rather frustrating, and this is also why I ultimately had to give up playing before reaching the end. 


Now, on to what I enjoyed. At it's heart, Storm of Spears offers fun, straightforward gameplay. There are plenty of side quests to keep you busy, if you like. The story is fine, the dialogue is nicely written with at least some character development in there. The battles are quite easy, so you definitely can't get frustrated at the difficulty unless you want more of a challenge in your RPG's. I think Storm of Spears would be a good introduction into the genre for someone unfamiliar with them, or for anyone who wants to play a simple RPG without any overly complex elements to it.",1467588236,1467588236,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,False,True,False,False,,,

For an open-world RPG, this game is easy to finish, with an estimated playtime of 10 hours and doesn't require any grinding for experience levels or loot drops. The combat is very simple with every battle able to finish by using only normal attacks. Quest items, objects that can be interacted and entry locations are also highlighted clearly on the screen by appearing as glittering objects. All locations are small and easy to navigate, with no complex maze loops. All side-quests are short and easy to finish.

The main four characters have larger portraits that don't match the art style of the smaller portraits used for other characters and there is only one picture that is used for all dialogue.  This leads to jarring instances where the character is angry or sad but their profile picture is still grinning.  

I also found that the game was very loud.  Even setting my headphones as low as they would go I had to go into the settings and lower the audio levels, however this doesn't apply to the title screen.  So when you stop and restart you get blown away by the title screen.

30+ minutes into the game, I had to stop, because the graphics were killing me. The backgrounds (mainly ground tiles) are too jarring - as your character walks, they appear to ""vibrate"" (because of the pattern on them), and it hurts because they are too bright & loud. I was actually getting motion sickness because of the perceived vibration.

*本游戏为 RPG Maker VX 制品。坦白说 2016 年 6 月了还有新游戏用 VX 做我是十分惊讶的……

*游戏的五项成就随着剧情推进在你保存退出游戏后会自己动解开。

*NSFW 只是一个令人遗憾的误会，这个误会可能来源于那张封面。
-然而这张封面和游戏实际截图中立绘的差距能够很直白而深切告诉你什么叫[b]“封面欺诈”[/b]。
-只有主角四人组有立绘的待遇，但是也只有这一张。其余的主要剧情人物只有个头像，配角就连头像也没有了。这个减号主要是给立绘稀少且画风实在不令人满意……

*游戏的剧情简单来说就是担任一个四人雇佣兵小队队长的女主角在弟弟死亡[spoiler]假死[/spoiler]后毅然踏上了和其它有志之士造反的道路。
+故事完整，前因后果比较清晰，并且也有动情的瞬间。
-但是剧情前后展开不足，包括角色的个人剧情以及主线剧情，只是为了推进而设定，却没有多少着墨在其中，对于我这种剧情派的玩家来说还不过瘾。
*因为弟弟在身边所以不愿多向前一步，又因为弟弟的死而愤然复仇什么的。哎呀……

+?因为是雇佣兵小队，所以主角团队从一开始就定下来了。不会有更换的机会。
+主角团队分工明确，攻击的、奶的、强化的、辅助攻击的。不同角色的技能槽的名字也有所不同。
-技能稀少。升级到后期也就四个。

+主支线剧情有分开的列表。
-完成支线剧情也不见得有什么好奖励。
*可能会影响到结局其它角色的言行，这一点没有验证。

+装备多样，可以各自组合。
-加成并不高，基本上随着剧情的不断深入不断地换上新装备就对了。不必要刷，也没有装备强化的系统。

-地下城地图又大又难走。真的是大的惊人，在我有限的 RPG Maker 系游戏生涯里我应该还没见过这么大的地图……岔路一多起来根本记不住哪里走过哪里没走过。
*有一个部分需要你找绳子好攀上去推进剧情，光这条绳子就让我在地图里撞了半个多小时……

-游戏系统优化差，强制拉伸分辨率导致画质差。而且行走起来常有卡顿。而且系统占用也超出平均水平。

总评：一般，随便打打消磨时间也就算了。5软以下入包+1可以吃，全价买铁定不值。
秉持着不算太差就给推荐的原则，不给差评。

[spoiler]在完成了叛乱把恶王赶下台、将国家交给适当的任选后。雇佣兵小队的其他成员都因为在支线剧情里所述的原因要继续展开探寻或探险的旅程。[/spoiler]

IMO the characters are for once not stereotypes but at the same time they are introduced in about 30 seconds each in the way of akward throw away dialog, we later get some extra knowledge about the characters but the problem is we never get grow to like them, even the main character that is supposed to go through this change of heart in the first 20 minutes makes me wonder, why even bother with the brothers death (wich btw coudent be more obvious if you just stated outloud; btw this character is going to die, only to then reveal in what the dev team thinks is cleaver dialog that he actually lived), this could have been handled with just introducing the main character depressed and  alone in the wild and her firends looking for her because they are so worried, 

what im trying to sum up in this wall of text above is that we are thrown into a 4man group of characters so we already cant get to know them or care when they go through their arcs, not to mention that when sura does actually says: fuk this im going to get revenge. the problem is its presented as some sort of twist or change in her character, when its obvious that this is what its leading to, thing is that these kind of obvious stories can work if you just simply let it come naturally and dont force it while winking and telling us that ""this is tottaly not whats gonna happen guys trust me"".

As for another point i noticed really early is, the combat feels poorly balanced and just DULL, some of my nitpicks might be subjective but when all the characters seem to do the same damage on their basic ATTACK and not to mention that as of 7 hours in the classic blackmage still does more damage by hitting people with a staff than using thunder magic....

other small things i dislike about the combat is i feel the game should be able to come up with a more pleasing battle presentation, mostly im talking about the static movments and the fact that the battle backround is litterly just a blurred image of the current zone, and this sometimes is fine but at times it does not even cover the backof the screen.

another small last thing about the battles is the menus could have been done better by not much effort.

furthermore i dont feel like the characters stats matter, when i found a new sword for Sura i just said; oh i guess i gotta equip this. instead of; OMG YEEEEEE NEW SWORD MOFO's.

last but not least i dident need to explore for to long before i ended up in the wrong place (the bandit camp that you can acess on your way to the Daggeridge) and not only did i spend about 20-30 minutes in this camp trying to figure out where to go, but i wanted to shoot whoever made the layout, it felt like it was purpously made for you to get lost in, and once i cleared the enitre thing there was little to no reward for it, so all this frustrating back and forth in this camp was a huge waste of time, you can argue this is to make the game hard and id say, you dont need to make the maplayout seem like digdug made the pathing you should just make it difficult to actually clear the fucking floor, or like aveyond does block certain locations off with event triggers.

now you can say that me getting lost is just me being shit at the game, in wich case, how rude. but id say that adding this camp to add nothing but usless chests with consums that you end up burning through anyway, and a boss fight that is a sidequest, wich on its own is worthy of asking why would you make it feel like nothing threatens me by introducing such ""Threats"" according to the characters, but i can just beat the shit out of them without grinding at all and the rewards are again mediocore. but as i was saying to me this camp is missplaced and only added because the creater dident know how else to fill the game's runtime, and proceeds to link it to a road you need to take to get to a quest so that you can get sidetracked with 0 knowledge of whats going on, all this IMO just goes to prove that the world is poorly mapped out and the terrain feels like it is designed by nothing more than a novice.

I know ive been nagging on allot here but before i get flamed for honest opinions im going to say, i didnt exepct a masterpiece from a game at this price, but this is what this entire section of the page is for, to rely our opinions back to the creators and give them perspective on what was good and what was wrong so they can actually elevate their next game above this one, i really hope the makers reads what ive pointed out and if you disagree i invite you to debate me on what and why.

to sum up what i dislike and what i did like: i like that the story while being a typical ""Evil queen/Rebellion"" story, this one has more focus on a side i havent seen much of, a mercinary group that gets dragged into the ordeal and now has to lead abunch of retarded peasents to try and not get butcherd.

i did not like the level of skill that whent into several things like the characters pacing and the stilted nonflowing dialog, the whole brother storyline botherd me and the mentioned combat balancing and system is poorly optimised, and last but not least the fact that the map is made like someone hates me. and items overall felt like trash that i can throw around if i wanted. something minor is that the healers design felt like a joke, idc what you say that is a flatchested woman, no man dresses like this, and if they did it might have been smart to give a reason for it.

and btw using the arrowkeys and Z/X felt like i was playing a game from the 1990's...

I will recommend the game simply because we can all learn from mistakes wether they be our own or others, you just have to be able to see them as what they are.

For the money, it's pretty fun, but don't expect anything revolutionary; it's mostly stock RPG Maker sprites and tiles and a completely vanilla combat system.

The visual design is a bit all over the place; most areas seem to have been created by dragging the brush around to make a random shape, and then decorations are applied very liberally, creating rooms that are largely a jumble of different elements. The dungeon areas are quite large, perhaps a bit overly so, though the lack of random encounters prevents them from seeming agonizing -- all the encounters are visible on the map, and they don't respawn until the player exits to the world map, meaning that searching around the large, confusing dungons for secrets and treasures doesn't take positively hours.

The encounters are very easy; most mobs do nothing but attack, and even mobs with other abilities don't do anything threatening. Any given zone will contain only one or two different types of mobs, meaning that the player will have seen everything a zone has to offer in a very short amount of time.  There are many different bosses, but they're also quite easy, and, once Sura learns her ""Tiamat Slash"" attack, they're all dead in two turns anyhow. Except the final boss, that is. This guy has a very large pool of HP, and two different instant death attacks; the fight takes quite a while, and basically devolves into the closest thing to a ""graveyard zerg"" one can have in a game like this.

The characters could use a bit of work, and the Warlock Gyorg in particular; he gets a variety of attack spells, all of which are completely useless, since not only do they do less damage than Sura's attacks, they do less damage than [i]his own[/i] regular attack.

The storyline is absolutely standard JRPG ""fight the evil empire"" stuff, but the writing is mostly decent -- at least, right up until the end, when it develops a very bad case of ellipsisitis, and all the characters lose the ability to form coherent sentences. There also doesn't appear to be any nudity or any sex, contra the listing and the ""adult content"" warning; the two female party members wear revealing outfits, but that's about it. Each character also has only one facial expression -- a big, wide smile -- which seems [i]very[/i] odd when he's discussing tragic things. The logic of the world can be bizarre sometimes; it's extremely politically correct to the point of having females working in the mines,  but also tromps them about half-naked everywhere. There's also the odd moment where the party jumps off of a mountain peak, only to land, entirely unharmed, on a different continent altogether.

-You need no tactics to beat the monsters, even the bosses. They dont have any elemental resistances or weaknesses, so you just spam the Tiamat skill with Sura  and basic attack with the others. This works for all monsters. 100% challenging game.

-I never wiped a single combat, it is nearly impossible to lose, even in hard mode

-Final boss, just stupid. Instead of giving him some powerfull AoE or skill, they gave him an instadelete skill to one character. Awfull and pointless. You just need to have 1 character reviving each turn and made the other two dps the boss

-The side quest are too easy, they give powerfull items without any effort. I would make the ""elemental lords"" and the ""goliath"" more diffcult so the player can choose if it is worth the effort

Talking about economy i can say the gold have near 0 value. You obtain a lot and have no item to buy, they are too cheap. I would raise the price of every item in the game or reduce the gold given by the monsters.

It has some progress-blocking bugs, my recomendation is to ALWAYS do the things in the order they appear in the main quest. Not doing that can block your entire game and force you to start from zero

This game is a very generic oldschool rpg with no new school updates. The game has no hd resolutions, graphical options, or mouse control. Gameplay is also generic for the genre.

Graphics are nice and colorful though the low resolution hurts the overall quality. Character art is actually pretty nice, but there seems to only be one artwork per character. Gameplay is very standard. 

For the price this game is worth it, but unless you get into the story and characters(which is possible in this one) than you probably will not like it.

Some of the music, sounds, animations, attacks, all are from the default RTP. This is yet another example of someone who,although did put some time into the ""Faces"", but did design their own maps, characters, and music.

The game itself isn't too bad, I have seen a LOT worse than this game. At least with this game, some of the exits and teleports are clear. (Although it still needs a little more work) There's also a few areas where sometimes the NPC's walk around in a spot where you can't get around unless you wait for a good minute or so for them to randomly walk to a spot where you can leave. (Case in point, as you leave the building at the very beginning, a dog will block your way, sure I could go around the other way, but the way I want to go is faster.)

I do like the combat system that was used, so there is that. Basic ""Final Fantasy"" style combat where you actually see the action. Some of the monsters are a bit original so there is also that.

I only real advice I would like to give to the devs is that the game could use a bit more ""obvious"" exits as it can get a bit frustrating sometimes when you been through 10 locations, only to go back to the start and you suddenly forgot where the exit to the place was.

Please keep in mind I got this as a freebe from one of the Groups I joined, so although I can't complain about this game too much, I am not going to give all ""thumbs up"" just because it was given to me as a gift. Understand, not complaining about ""FREE"", but the game needs a bit more work.

Some other things to also keep in mind...

1.) It was obviously made with RPG Maker XP, not VX or MV
2.) Graphics could have been worked on a little more
3.) From what I was told, was suppose to have mouse support, but didn't seem to work while I was playing
4.) Really? Adult content? Is this really necessary?
5.) The game sometimes has issues between full screen and windowed mode
6.) Since this was made on RPG Maker XP, this game will work the best on a Windows XP

-Opens game sees boobs (Damn another Japanese game that will make me feel like a perv)
-Looks at options on title screen and sees shutdown as one of them and wonder if it will actually shut down laptop lol
-Gets into game and receives instant nostalgia boner for Pokemon and GameBoy's
-Get's into combat with Goblin having never played JRPG's before and just spams attack with everyone
-Wins and declares himself goblin king 
-Chases some poor guy to a cliff and spams a mix of poison spells and sword hits on him but he can still talk just fine in the ""cutscene"" afterwards

In Storm of Spears the player assumes the role of Sura, a female warrior with a strong leading personality. She is leader of an infamous mercenary group called ""Nightswords"". After a successful mission she let's herself being talked into joining up with local rebels fighting against the kingdom, led by an evil queen, by her younger brother. When things don't go as well as expected and fate strikes our heroine hard, she decides to become a leading figure in the rebellion out of her own free will this time.
As expected the story is told in a straight forward way. It is always clear where to go to and what to do next. However, wandering of the beaten path is an option and exploration will lead to rewards.
Battle System is classic turn based with the usual command choices. The actual battles themselves are pretty simple, at least from what I have seen so far. Enemies are visible on the map and there are no random encounters. Concerning leveling up, so far defeating all visible enemies on the map is the right way to keep you characters fit for what's coming up next.

Overall, Storm of Spears is a nice RPG so far. The story is told well and keeps the player wanting to see what's happening next. Gameplay and battles are standard RPG fair and work well too.

I can't exactly say it's special, it's what you'd expect of any typical JRPG of the sort. It starts a bit slow like almost all of them do, and starts building upon a story of characters who have existed prior to you knowing them. The fact it didn't introduce the characters too much and just kinda threw me in was much nicer than having to spend an hour or so learning about them and finding party members.

It looked quite nice, although I can't exactly say the sprites reflected the character art quite as I would think mostly due to the hair. The character art was nice, although a few variations here and there would have made if more fun.

With a nice story, that actually fits the title. In the world of Gallagher ( no watermelon smashing happens here though) a Queen named Lilliana and her wizard croney Ecyphes are all evil and bad and there happens to be this rebellion going on against them. Oh and they have some elite soldiers ( the bad guys) called the Silver Claw, led by a Carwin that likes to give you problems like a bad mother in law. People aren't happy. In typical party RPG style you control a group of characters. You play as Sura, a sword singer and her mercenary band the Night Swords.  Gyorg the warlock, Edryan a white monk and Valeese the warrior. With your mercenaries you aren't involved with the rebellion, but then...SURA's BROTHER GETS KILLED. Thus Sura steps forward and with VENGEANCE ( hence the title ''Vengeance road'' ) leads the rebellion with her Night Swords. It's almost as if someone knew that she would if something happened to her brother....I smell a conspiracy !!!  Fight turn based combat against baddies of orcs, goblins and bad soldiers of the Queen. You upgrade the Night Swords and upgrade their weapons and gear. Basic stuff really.  There is quests and side quests implemented in the game to help you lv up and find cool epic loot. The side quests are not required to beat the game. The graphics seem a step up and better polished then most RPG maker like games. The music is basic and their is A LOT of story here. The dialog is rather lengthy, but you get a rather nice story from it all.  The downside is the mouse portion of the game does not seem to work. To be fixed? I don't know. There is no steam achievements, witch I always find fun to accomplish. Also to be added? The artwork seems to switch styles a lot.

my main gripes with this game are as follows: where the hell is the mouse? there is mouse control but the mouse is not visible. This is a real big issue especially when trying to access options. The mouse isn't locked to the screen or to the window so if you need to click on something near the top of the screen (say the options) good luck. 

The game mentions a map but i can't see it and i tried all the usual buttons and nothing. No mention in the options either.

The art style is what youd expect, the screen shots don't lie. Over sexulised women (coulnd't there be atleast one normal gal?)


The main characters a women which is a nice change from the norm and the tutorial didn't seem to miss anything. Really clear on where to go without being in your face which is good. 

can't comment on the music as i played muted (like i do pretty much every game).

again got this for free, and don't like the genre so for all i know this could be gods gift to jrpgs and i wouldn't know, take someone elses review into consideration before making a decision but relise these technical issues are real.
