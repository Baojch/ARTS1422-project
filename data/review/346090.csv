While it may not be as epic or important as these three games (it is a small game after all), it is actually pretty good. The atmosphere is thick and the length/replayability is just enough to get tho most of that.

It may be a little confusing at first, since one may not know well what is needed to do, but that fades away fast enough.

The puzzles are actually really simple, but I feel that it would be distracting otherwise. Same goes with the fighting mechanic.

The controls are a little clumsy, but it is not a dealbreaker. If you have played some classic dungeon game, you will feel right at home.

And this was me coming at it with a complete disregard for permadeath in dungeon crawlers.  You can enable saves on start up and I can't see how this game can be played any other way.  As to me it's too samey and without much variety to sustain long and repetitive plays as a roguelite.  For example, as far as I can tell, there's only like 2 enemies that you can fight (one is a rat), and only about 3 weapons.  There are some nice side stories and bits of lore you can pick up from discarded adventurer diary pages, and murals on walls.

I had a solid 2 and a half hours of exciting dungeon delving and got the good escape ending (and the more secret traitor ending) without any fore-knowledge of the gameplay, and I thoroughly enjoyed it without getting bored.  But I don't think I could have played it for another hour, as what I experienced felt self-contained and complete.  And the game isn't as horror centred as you would expect.  The game is quite vague as to what your goal is but you'll figure it out with enough exploration and fiddling with things.

I died over 70 times in my playthrough (again, how is this doable as a roguelite?), and walked over 2k steps, but every death was only a small setback which kept me persevering.

Vi consiglio dì usare il gamepad per i controlli perchè sono molto + semplici rispetto alla classica combo mouse e tastiera infatti questi sono molto complicati dà memorizzare. 

Invece quelli per Gamepad Xbox 360 sono molto + semplici dà memorizzare.

Questo gioco è molto simile ai 2 episodi dì Legend Of Grimrock altro videogioco interamente in 3d erede dì Dungeon Master's .

Il gameplay è bello perchè è simile a Slender per via della torcia chè non è eterna. 

Infatti là batteria della torcia sì scarica molto lentamente rispetto a quella del 1° Slender .

P.S. I mostri anche se sono tutti in 2d come quelli dei 2 episodi dì Dungeon Master e compagni alcuni tì possono far prendee dei bei Jumpscare è altri tipo i fantasmi chè tì inseguono questi sono ottimi perchè è come giocare a Slender.

Io non dico chè questo gioco sia perfetto perchè molti giochi sì hanno i loro prò ed i loro contro ma è un'ottimo erede del classico Dungeon Master uscito sia su Super Nintendo è PC/MS-DOS.

_______________________________________________


Después de pasar un largo tiempo pensando sobre el título e intentando varias horas... Creo que tengo que decir, que merece la pena.

Este juego nos pondrá en una situación tensa al inicio muy del palo ""Quien soy, por qué cojones estoy aquí y que hostias tengo que hacer"". Se trata un juego con mecánica básica de movimiento por casillas pero con una grandísima ambientación y atmosfera.

Inicialmente caeremos en una mazmorra generada aleatoriamente, de la cual debemos salir, puesto que según vayamos avanzando será más y más perturbarte, pues no es una mazmorra normal... digamos que esta tiene algo especial... tiene vida propia. 

Cuenta con un apartado gráfico que, pese que algunos puedan tachar de cutre, no podría ser más apropiado para este título. Es gracias a él, que las luces, la oscuridad, los toques sangrientos y el encuentro con algunos enemigos un tanto fantasmales, se hacen más ""epicos"". Además tiene muchos detalles perturbadores, como los ojos de la pared, los esqueletos, las luces a la lejanía, las ""raíces"" rojas...
Si a esto le sumamos el sonido, que en ocasiones nos darán algun sustito tonto... Tenemos un juego que cumple perfectamente con su cometido de ""Acojonar al jugador, mantenerle atento y encima, querer explorar más""

Pero claro, ahora pasamos a que el juego tiene 2 formas de jugarlo, a lo hardcore hardcore: Sin mapa y sin guardar, y a lo pussy: Con mapa y pudiendo guardar... Cosa que es totalmente comprensible, puesto que NUNCA podrás pasártelo a primera sin saber de que va el tema eh, es acojonante, tenemos que gestionar muchísimo nuestras fuentes de luz, puesto que serán nuestras UNICAS aliadas en todo nuestro viaje por esta mazmorra. Y ojo, porque tiene secretos por todas las putas partes! :D

Así que en resumen, quizá es algo carillo para lo que realmente es, eso no lo discutiré, pero el juego en sí es bastante bueno y consigue lo que se propone. Nos mantendrá enganchados durante unas cuantas horas, seguramente más de las que piensas que echarás.

Os dejo como de costumbre con un breve gameplay, en este caso es de mi primer ""intento"" donde no tenía ni zorra de que iba el juego :D

This is a Survival Dungeon crawler game.


[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

There is a Tutorial.
There is a slide bar for Music/Sound/Gamma and Mouse sensitivity.
You can change the Graphics quality from low to high. But i am not sure if this has any affects.
You can play this fullscreen or window mode.
There are a couple of different languages.
You can change the controls.
You can play this game with the xbox controller. (Which i do not recommend).


[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You will fall into a tomb/dungeon once you have finally reach the ""building"". 
From there the horror begins. You will have to survive the traps/monsters and other craziness. You have to be careful where you step otherwise the floor will collapse and you will fall a level lower. The deeper you are, the more dangerous it will become. You will have to find the exit by finding the keys. Ofcourse the exit key isn't on a safe place. The deeper you go, the less light there will be and eventually you will encounter light problems. Light is a limit resource. You can find it around like other items.

The game offers you a Tutorial if you want attempt to bypass this.
Game is difficult.
You have to find the right key to open the door.
Combat music is like a ""Tribe"" Feelings, With drums.
You can allow maps and save your game. (Turn save game off if you prefer perma-deaths).
The graphics are ""okay"" a bit pixelated.
Soundtrack fits the theme.
It has the same walking style as ""Legend of grimrock"".  Walking speed isn't fast.
Animations are a bit weird.
You have a backpack/inventory, where you can collect stuff.  The bigger the item, the more space it will require to place.


[h1]Other things.[/h1]

If you do not trust a floor tile, Place a rock onto it and see if it falls down. However the rock will be dropped down a floor below.
The eye balls in the wall create some light whenever you are looking at it.
Look carefully where you walk, if a floor tile is darker then another you might fall a floor level lower.

The game is not scary, There are some ""horror"" Elements but they are not scary or anything. 

Putting the Gamma on the highest will remove MOST of the darkness out of the game. Unless you walk in the Darkness Fog barrier. This could make the game alot easier.

Game pace is slow because you walk slow.
Enemies will never walk on ""hidden trap floor tiles""
The game doesn't have a life bar, which is a shame.. Yea your screen get hits but it's not telling you how much HP you got

Due to the procedural level generation I can see situations arising when you feel like the game is unfair, though I just experienced the complete opposite. I kept finding hidden pits in the floor that dropped me further and further down, till I reached the end with nothing on me but the starting items. Still scared as hell while going through it though.

The goal of the game is to escape a 3D dungeon from a first person perspective by going down floor by floor, avoiding rats and sentient moss balls along the way. There is a third enemy, but I will get to him later.

When I first started the game, I made sure to dim my lights and play with a controller. Despite this, I just could not get immersed. The controls work similar to the first Elder Scrolls games or a first person classic Tomb Raider game; you can move foward one step, step backwards, turn sharp left, sharp right, or sidestep to the left and right. Essentially you're on a grid the entire time and can only make very specific movements. This does not help me feel like I'm in this dungeon, as I tend to end up walking backwards through the dungeon and just moving in very unconventional ways, practically fighting with the controls.

The inventory is just awful. You can equip two items, one item in each hand. This is done by picking the item up and placing it in your desired hand slot. This sounds fine on paper, but I found that the most successful way to get through the dungeon is to keep moving, which results in a lot of dropped items. One time I was on the final floor of the dungeon. I unequiped my flashlight to check how much battery it had left, but I accidently pressed my use button and ended up throwing the flashlight down the halls, rendering me blind. I can probably see how this system would work if there was some actual need for inventory management, but there are so few items that it just becomes a chore and pulls me out of the experience.

The nail in the coffin for this game for me was the enemies. The graphics were fine- they reminded me of a mixture of Thief and Lovecraftian horror- the sound design was gritty and worked in helping me get immersed before being pulled out again by the previously mentioned problems, but the enemies are just not scary at all. As mentioned at the start, the two main enemies are rats and small moss balls, but there is a third. The third enemy is a ghost who wanders through the maze, it doesn't attack you, nor does it do anything remotely threatening. The most I've seen it do is glance at me as it glides past. That's not scary to me at all, I have no reason to be scared of a ghost who does nothing but mind its' own business. 

Overall, this is a pretty but poorly designed horror game. If you're going to make a grid-based dungeon crawler, make one, but it does not work for a horror game where the whole point is to be immersed and scared as a result. Unless you're born with a disability where you can only turn at 90 degree angles, play something else.

Does this game deserve it's current (Feb 7, 2016) Metacritic score of 40? No.

To begin, let's break down a few things from the “About This Game” section.

1) “An Infinitely Replayable Living, Breathing Dungeon”
This one is mostly hyperbole. It's true that the setting is quite good, as is fitting for any horror story in which the location/environment is almost a character in and of itself. The game having “infinitely replayable” is by definition true, the same way that the ocean has infinite re-sailability. You've never see the same fish, wave, or storm in the same place twice, but after enough trips out it all sort of blends together and you get a good idea of what to expect. Nothing new shows up; it's just in different places (just like other rogue-like games).

2) “The Truth About The Darkness”
Yes! This game is surprisingly intricate. There's a ton of little details and hidden clues [i]on top[/i] of everything you'll find out just in a more “casual play through.” There's lots of backstory (both directly stated and halfway hinted at) that you can pull out of the game if you merely try hard enough and pay attention.

3) “A Guaranteed Uneasy Feeling in the Pit of Your Stomach”
A definite yes! I've played through dozens and dozens of runs in the game and have over 24 hours on record, and the game still gets me wigged out at times. As a self-professed horror junky, this game will definitely get you immersed. Not to mention the newest update tweaked out all the sound effects, and all for the better in my opinion. This game would be fantastic for a VR headset.

4) “The More You Explore, The More You Will Find”
Also definitely true. As mentioned above in point 2, there are so many little things in this game. There are a lot of good secrets and several good puzzles too. Not to mention that the dev claims I have “almost all the secrets,” but not actually all of them. I have no idea what I've missed, but apparently even I could still find more.

5) “Tweet Your Escape… Or Your Death”
Yes, you can. It doesn't do anything in-game, but it could be fun depending on your social preferences.

As for my more general comments, this is definitely a more retro style game. Very much like point-and-click adventurer games, very old-school in it's controls. The controls are probably the weakest aspect of the whole game when comparing this to other, more modern games, though I did find the controls to give [i]I Can't Escape: Darkness[/i] (ICE:D) a rather unique feel and character. The controls aren't hard to get used to, but you may likely find yourself fumbling when you get into your first few panics.

I can't comment much on some of the negative things that have been said about the game. Most of the negative things brought up in other reviews had no real impact on me while I was playing the game. The game definitely demands patience from you and a certain analytical mindset and a resilience to failure, all aspects I can easily see as being weak points for perhaps a majority percentage of gamers. I know I tend to get frustrated a little easily myself.
It's almost certainly unfair to have just insinuated that the failure to enjoy this game is on the players themselves, rather than the game itself. There are things about ICE:D that could have been tweaked or polished, but at the end of the day this game is going to demand a different style of play because it is a different style of game. Perhaps the true root of the problem is in the style itself; consider how this genre of game basically doesn't exist anymore. (Yes, yes, [i]Grimrock[/i] exists, but I don't think you could argue it made any big waves when it came out. ALSO! 8/7/16 Edit here: Having now played [i]Grimrock[/i], I think the comparisons between the two games are largely inaccurate. ICE:D and [i]Grimrock[/i] are VERY different games. A rough simplification is that ICE:D is puzzles and [i]Grimrock[/i] is combat.)

But I digress. Bottomline: I do recommend this game. If you like puzzles, if you like being in creepy places, if you like trying games that are different than the current market, if you like very challenging games, or if this strikes your interest at all really, I'd go ahead and get it. Trust your gut. It's not expensive and I think you'll at [i]least be[/i] interested by your time here.

Also, do note that the devs have continued to support this game and tweak things based on the feedback they've been getting from players. David Maletz has been continuously active on the Steam forums for the game, and Chase Bethea has continued doing some really cool work on the sound design. While these are component pieces and not a main focus for most players, I think it is only fair to acknowledge the work their team has been and is still doing.

Also check out firmwares' review. I agree with everything they said.

If you can handle repeatedly dying for experimentation and accept that the real fun is within exploring and the secrets inherent in the levels and not in the story, this is a damn good game that always has another facet to ponder.

Has a old-school vibe to it, both in the graphics and the approach (basically unguided, screw yourself if you want).

[h1][b]I Can't Escape: Darkness[/b][/h1] (Read on for the full review!)
[h1]======================================[/h1]

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
I Can't Escape: Darkness has much to offer, and very very little to dislike. Once you adjust or change the controls to your liking, you'll find yourself with a smooth experience of exploration and dread. There are no jumpscares, and a lot of care has been taken to incorporate many great elements of other games or genres together well. The art and theme is consistent, the font is legible, the UI is nice, and the whole experience is modern while retaining a lovely nostalgic feeling. It offers enough [i]content[/i] for the price, but depending on the way you play your games, or the style of games you like to play, it may offer less [i]longevity[/i] for you than others. Take your time to consider whether it is the type of game for before you decide to buy it at full price.

[h1]======================================[/h1]

[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]
+ Atmosphere: First and foremost, the atmosphere is the biggest pro of ICED. Foreboding.
+ Graphics: Serviceable, a bit nostalgic, not bad by any means, but keep in mind it isn't Crisis.
+ Audio: Crisp, fitting sound FX with contrasting whimsical BGM adds to the tensity.
+ Font: Special shoutout to any dev who uses legible fonts.
+ UI: Fans of Ultima or other select RPGs/MMOs will enjoy having a small bag with inventory management, and other nice touches.
+ Variable: The things I have seen, even already...
+ Procedural: But not from the very start (I think,) which is nice, because that [strike]could[/strike] would be horribly frustrating.
+ Jump Scares: What jump scares?
+ Tension: The limited light supply keeps you coiled, ready to spring.
+ Concept: There is added innovation to what Grimrock offers.
+ Saving: SAVE SLOTS! You should always have a lot of save slots if your game can be saved!
+ Realism: While it is a bit silly to die to a few bites from a rat, I like that you aren't a sponge.
+ Secrets: It's a secret!
+ Developer: I'm putting in an 'aside' in the comments if you are interested.

[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]
While few, these cons are related to systems integral to gameplay, and thus have a large impact.
- Movement: With no queuing, I wish moving to the next tile/turning was a bit more responsive.
- Controls: While very customizable, I couldn't find a way to map analog stick movements, because it would just move it to the alternate option. I also couldn't find a reset option.
- Inventory: I would really like to see inventory navigation relocated to D-Pad movement, while temporarily disabling whatever functions you have assigned to it.

[h1][b]Neutral:[/b][/h1]
+/- Not really much I feel neutral about.

[h1]======================================[/h1]

[h1][b]Introduction:[/b][/h1]
Welcome to I Can't Escape: Darkness, AKA ICED, a dungeon-crawling adventure where you have to go deeper and deeper in an attempt to fight for your freedom! ICED offers an awesome innovation on the Grimrock style: A first person aspect, ala Myst or Amnesia style interaction. Speaking of Amnesia, you get a flashlight with limited battery life and a lighter with limited fuel, and there are a lot of dark rooms, so have fun with that addition to this genre!

[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
The gameplay of ICED is fairly straightforward. You're a foolhardy adventurer who has stumbled into a dungeon and now you are trapped and the whole place wants you dead. Great. Forge your way through the darkness with your trusty flashlight, one tile at a time. Forward, back, left, right, 90 degree turn. You can pick up objects, and either keep them in your hand, say to throw them, or equip them to your hands to wield them. You also have a small inventory, an actual bag in the UI, where you can stash a select few things in a grid.

Initially, you start with [i]one[/i] of these useable objects: a measly stick. You're going to need it to kill your first few rats, but hopefully you can find something better, soon. Every object has a purpose, so you'll have to figure out what is best to keep and what you can skip, or find ways to utilize them before you need more space. Combat is a simple prospect of swinging your weapon in front of you aimed at one tile, while the enemy does the same. You can move around them, and they can move around you, while you can't swing mid-turn or move, you can hit or be hit in this process, so use it to your advantage! Unfortunately, it isn't quite as smooth to execute as it is in Grimrock.

Most of the gameplay of ICED involves the environment, though. It will fight you, it will try to trick and trap you. It will creep you out and make you make mistakes. You will fall to the next floor unprepared. You will be crushed. You will run out of light. You will have a constant sense of dread; of being hurried, but all the same, it's exciting to discover all the neat varieties and new things in your dungeon exploration. This is a game about facing challenges, traps, and hurdles, and the balancing act of escaping the dungeon quickly or taking your time to not make mistakes while escaping.

Personally, it is hard for me to play ICED. This is because it is EFFECTIVE. All of these elements- the limited light, the need to hurry to make use of it, the need to not hurry so you don't fall to traps, the combat encounters that can mess up both of these approaches for you, and the sheer variety of creepy sights in the environment-all combine to make this dungeon a god damn unsettling, creepy, foreboding location where you will feel tense and pressured. This is what makes your successes all the more rewarding, and the discoveries or items that are small hopes turn into beacons of light in your struggle to live.

[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]
Oldschool, modernized. It's not breathtaking, but it is consistent, and isn't bad. It is nostalgic, and picks selectively from colors, themes, light sources, and the varying densities of darkness. It is simple, and it works.

I can say, however, that it works better in action than in the screenshots, so take a quick look at a trailer or gameplay video to decide if you'll like it, love it, tolerate it, or hate it.

I should also mention that the models and animations are decent, and whimsical. Any deficiencies present just add to their charm and to the environment quite well. Shortcomings have been made into strengths. While there may be some aliasing, or textures that could use a slightly higher resolution or more detail, remember that the more detail you add, the easier it is to lose your consistency and thus realism. Extremely accurate, high detail models and textures with poor lighting would make a far worse impression.

[h1][b]Audio:[/b][/h1]
The music gives off a vibe of mystery and wonder, which makes the horror all the more horrifying when it hits. I like nearly all of the sound effects, and respect the crisp timing and sound quality of them. They, too, seem to have that subtle hint of roughness, that somehow makes them all the more effective when tied together with the rest of the elements of the game. Like the objects in the game, every sound has a purpose, and fills it well.

[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]
If you like dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes, or nostalgia-filled trips into the dark, or horror that isn't based on jump scares, then you will love I Can't Escape: Darkness. Whether for 10 minutes, or hours at a time, it will offer a rich and rewarding experience. I can safely recommend this game at full price, but a small sale never hurts.

I've enjoyed ICE:D. It's a slow-burning horror game that takes it time to build a feeling of despair. Having said that, I suppose I technically didn't enjoy it. But that was the point of the game, so I love it. I wish I could say something the store page doesn't, but I'd be spoiling the experience.

Having said that, I've read critics negative reviews and seen let's-players who disliked it. So I looked for more of those to understand why not. And I've reached two conclusions:

1) If you're expecting the wrong kind of game, you WILL be disappointed. Some got the first impression that ICE:D is like Legend of Grimrock, only to be let down by the simplistic combat and by puzzles less complex than LoG. Those elements aren't the focus of ICE:D. Also, don't except old-school survival horror akin to Resident Evil and Silent Hill. It's not that kind of horror game.

2) The psychological approach of this game is like coriander/cilantro. Either you enjoy it, or it just tastes like soap. The slow burn approach combined with trial-&-error and rogue-like gameplay can frustrate, bore, or otherwise turn-off some people. But an optional save feature does mitigate the later two elements' impact if it bothers you.

The easy way to gauge in advance whether you'll love or hate this game is to search for ""I Can't Escape"" on Newgrounds. (or wherever flash games get re-upped) It's a simpler ""proof-of-concept"", but it's free. If you enjoy it like I did, then I can't recommend ICE:D enough.

Survivor - Eye Of The Tiger
 
This is a pleasant little game. And by that I mean it’s been designed by Lucifer himself.
 
If you like Mazes, or old school first person dungeon crawlers minus the combat being turned base, dying a lot due to rats, poison, falling and cthulhu’s ball sack killing you then this is a game for you.
 
Do you like puzzles? searching for keys? Back tracking or losing your car in the mouth of hell? How about losing your way, or seeing the same wall 300 times? Or was it the same wall? Aw man, the walls move too.
 
Oh look a hole, oh, gravity works and suddenly you’re a floor down with what I imagine are broken legs.
 
If you don’t like rats, the plague or anything else listed above then this is probably not for you.
 
Fortunately, I’m a masochist in video games. I love it when they’re hard and designed that way. I swear a lot when I play them, but I’m in them for the long haul.
 
What I don’t like is video games that are poorly designed. Where I get stuck on walls, or even an enemy and then because someone smacks with me a trout until I eat all the cheese wheels in the kingdom, and still don't have enough health and die.
 
This game however, is not one of those.
  
It’s an awesome little throwback to old school games where you had to think, and remember things. The type of game that you would keep a notepad by your desk so you can remember a code (haven’t seen any code needing doors yet.) But yes, your memory will help you here. As will rock throwing.
 
Chuck that s**t, so hard.  
 
Really, you should get it, it’s fun. Time consuming, and yet again, another game that I can play for a few minutes at a time.
 
It’s immersive, beautiful in it’s own way, terrifying in others. It even tracks how poorly you do. I assume that’s for how well you did, but I’m a pessimist by nature.
 
I also really like the way the flashlight works in the game, Just the light moves around, not your whole head. Which I guess is an odd thing to like, but it’s my damn review, so hush.  
 
I’ve yet to complete it, because I keep finding new ways to kill myself. But I intend to complete this and find my way out. and for 11.99 you can get as much time as you’re willing to get out of it.
 
The overall point is to make it down to the final level, and then survive a trip back up.
 
So it’s a lot like Black Friday sales.
Only you don’t have to put on pants, or leave the house.
 
Unless you’re in Kentucky, then it’s exactly like Black Friday Sales.",1443559799,1443559799,True,5,9,0.536193311214447021,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Os ponemos en situación: Por un accidente, terminamos cayendo en una especie de mazmorra llena de enemigos, trampas y oscuridad.

I Can’t Escape: Darkness è adventure horror game, si tratta di un viaggio coinvolgente verso l'ignoto. Le probabilità di fuga sono pochissime, e quando si perde la vita, il dungeon cambia radicalmente, rendendo l'esperienza di gioco sempre più unica.
Bisogna difendersi dalla oscurità con qualsiasi fonte di luce, poiché l'oscurità ti porterà letteralmente alla pazzia, ed a una morte certa!

Сюжет: истории как таковой в игре очень мало. Некий человек (возможно археолог) добрался до древних строений (очень похожи на пирамиды Майя), в результате провалился под землю. Тогда с ним заговорил кто-то, кто обитает в подземелье...
Графика: игра сделана в необычном графическом стиле. Очень напоминает старые игры про подземелья с видом от 1го лица конца 90х-начала 2000-х. Плюсы от такого движка в малом весе игры (меньше 200 мб!) и низких системных требованиях.
Геймплей: управление необычное. Мы можем передвигаться либо вперед/назад (W/S), либо вправо/влево(D/A) + повороты на Q/E. В остальном есть ближний бой (на пробел либо на F), фонарь (на пробел или F), инвентарь (I), карта (M). Задача в игре сводится к 1 ""простой"" цели - выбраться из подземелья. Проблема в том, что голос хочет, чтобы мы спустились на самые нижние ярусы. Также задача осложняется крысами, ожившими лианами и другими врагами (пока не встречал). Кроме того в игре есть ловушки. 
Музыка: музыкальное сопровождение приятное, но иногда не соответствует атмосфере таинственного. 

В итоге мы получаем необычную и мистическую триллер-адвенчуру с необычным управлением с возможным дальнейшим перетеканием в хоррор. За такую малую цену игра хороша, мне понравилось.

The visual style really reminds me of legend of grimrock with some really nice pixel art graphics. So far, the only real combat is hitting the watching eyes and killing a few rats here and there. Overall a really atmospheric game and some really good puzzles that aren't overly difficult.",1442547854,1442547854,True,7,0,0.511369585990905762,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay has been polished up, a bit more depth added, and visually improved. The audio is also superior.

Pros: 
- Replayability is high due to Procedural Generation of mazes/dungeon.
- It's not a ""Jump Scare"" game, but rather a tension building game as your resources dwindle in increasingly difficult areas.
- Music and Atmosphere is very strong* (* - see caveat in cons)
- Distinct Style and polished feel make it superior to the previous iteration of the game

Cons:
- Some of the sound effects are a bit weak (the music at atmosphere noises are great though)
- Hard to notice when an enemy is attacking/approaching you, and the direction isn't clearly stated (a necessity in this type of game movement)

Notes:
- Won't give you an immediate adrenaline rush for any moment that I found, instead focuses on the slow burn approach (suspense)
- Is definitely an indie title, with a limited budget - the graphics are 'good', but won't blow you away.
- Fairly low system requirements make it easily accessible
- Game Session Length is pretty short, save function is optional though in case you don't have the time to commit. (I very rarely had sessions over 30 minutes).

If you'd like to see the game in action, I did make a video, but only loosely cover the pros/cons in it (felt an itemized list was better saved for the text review)
