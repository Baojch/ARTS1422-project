This game is pure satire, making fun of the Walking Simulator genre with their unnecessarily complex stories and convoluted and yet predictable plot twists. Oh and the unnecessary use of ""big words"" just to seem smart and deep.
 I enjoyed The Last Dogma for what it is and it had me chuckle from time to time.

Besonders wenig hilfreich ist da wohl der Untertitel: ""Southland Tales meets South Park"", denn mit beidem hat das Spielchen rein gar nichts zu tun. Eher will es ein bi√üchen was mit ""Stanley Parable"" zu tun haben. Es gibt auch einen Erz√§hler mit tief sarkastischer Stimme und eine Art Tutorial, das Mechaniken auszuhebeln gedenkt und dabei irgendwie witzig sein will. Leider scheitert das aber auf ganzer Linie. Denn witzig ist das Spielchen zu keinem Moment.

Irgendwie sind wir sowas wie ein Agent. Wir h√§tten aber auch ein Grottenolm sein k√∂nnen. Das w√§re genauso begr√ºndbar.

Was macht man denn nun? Tja. Es gibt ein paar Level, die allesamt verdammt klein ausgefallen sind, dazwischen werden  einem schlechtaufgel√∂ste Comicbildchen offeriert, die so tun als w√ºrden sie die Geschichte weitererz√§hlen. 

Die Level sind teils real, teils aber auch in diversen Paralleluniversen, h√∂llenartigen Gebilden oder gleich im Weltall. Warum wei√ü keiner. 

In den Leveln m√ºssen wir zum Beispiel einen sich nicht bewegenden Typen abschie√üen und zu einem Bus laufen. Level fertig. Oder auf einem Motorrad ein paar Hindernissen ausweichen. Level fertig. Dann sind wir wieder mit einem Katana unterwegs. Warum? Warum auch nicht.

Irgendwie erinnert man sich an den Klassiker ""Daikatana"", merkt aber schnell, da√ü dieses Machwerk selbst neben dem schwachen Uraltspiel nur peinlich ist. 

Ist das Ganze vielleicht surreal? Kreativ? Vielleicht gar dekonstruktivistisch im derridaschen Sinne? Nein. Es ist viel einfacher. Es ist einfach nur talentfrei.

Grafisch sind wir auf unterstem Unity-Niveau. Auch soundtechnisch fehlen einem, trotz ganz gutem Sprecher, eher die Worte.

Experimente in allen Ehren. Was dieser Beliebigkeitsrotz nicht  begreift ist, da√ü doch irgendeine Form von stringentem Konzept die notwendigen Strukturen erm√∂glicht, um Spielspa√ü zu erzeugen. Selbst die abgedrehtesten Spiele haben im Kern ein sauberes Konzept, auch wenn sie manchmal die Perspektive √§ndern. Das hier wei√ü nicht was es will, ist irgendwas irgendwie aneinandergereiht, meint witzig, absurd, √ºberraschend, erschreckend zu sein und ist dann doch nur ein gelangweiltes Gef√ºhl, das wir vom planlosen Durchzappen kennen.

If someone tried, he could actually make a very good game out of this. But all the forced sarcasm (which is funny if not unnecesarily self-destructive), lack of story consistency, trying to be alternative at all costs and all the bugs and unfinished features in the game make it trash, sadly.

The game wanted to be an alternative, independent satiric game made mostly by one person, who is clever enough to see many mistakes of the present world, focused on the apocalypticism that is not clear whether he criticize or is fascinated by. It is a satiric game targeting some cliche of game industry and lamenting about how humanity is screwed (it is, by the way, i just hope that people realizing this like the author of this game will not help to self-destroy it, unnecessarily - knowing the bad news and dangers does not mean one should jump into them and help the hell end it).

The most annoying were the time-consuming elements like bugs that make you start again, scenes you cannot click through although you have watched them several times already, not working entering shortcut into the first chapter or missing menu and controls in many scenes (you learn how to go to menu later but when repeating the previous scenes you find the controls are not working in them). Also I was forced to play the alternative ending twice, although the game knew that I already went through it - for your knowledge, there is no way to skip it or exit it - that is how amateurish the game is. I spent three times more time on the game than was necessary, just because of its trashy bugs and unfinished stuff.

Once I entered the game and wandered around, I started to fall out of map repeatedly and had to force quit the game from windows several times. Many things are not working how they should be, even in the tutorial scene. If you don't want to restart the game many times, better do not explore the edges too much.

I had fun in the alternative ending until I had to repeat it several times. I also liked the castle scene, pretty moody and artistic, nicely done. Unfortunately, probably from my mistake, I couldn't find the entrance to castle, climbed through buggy rocks to the other side of prohibited area and walked around the castle, taking nice screenshots, found a stairway that was not possible to climb and found myself stuck again by the same invisible wall, just from the other side of it.

Tried it again; I can see the developer has put a fair bit more work into it, and it's more clear that this is a post-modern sort of Stanley Parable game. I got past the first three levels, and am now stuck on one with a bunch of platforms suspended in mid-air. There's a tip on a wall that I can ""accelerate"" while in the air, but I can't figure out which control I would use to do this, and the controls panel (which had previously been summonable by pressing ESC) now does nothing; I had to ALT+F4 to leave after repeatedly falling into oblivion.

The game is still a bit too (unnecessarily, in my opinion) bloody and vulgar, and it still has many rough edges (not quite perfect English, voiceovers not matching the text and not deliberately so, plot not quite tied together even for a post-modernist concept, etc) but I think the Developer could create something good if he were paired with someone who could shape his more outlandish ideas into something consistent and coherent.

As a patch for this game, I think it needs to keep using the narrator from the first, tutorial level through the rest of the game, something to anchor the player to reality despite the surreality around him.

-----------------------------

First review:

Worked well in Windows 10 with nVidia GTX 1070 card.

SPOILER ALERT: In order to discuss this game in any way that makes sense, I have to reveal the content for the first 5-10 minutes of play.

The game in its current state is a mess:

 - It needs a complete re-do of the text by a native English speaker. The writing ranges from grammatically incorrect, to culturally inappropriate, to simply illogical. The voiceover narration doesn't always match what is displayed on-screen; you get the sense that the narrators corrected some of the poor English on the fly while they were reading their lines. Even the name of the game as pronounced by the narrator does not match the actual game name, or what is displayed on-screen. Something so easy to fix should not have been pushed into a live release.

 - It's thematically inconsistent. The one-room tutorial is ironic, like something out of the Stanley Parable. The intro makes the game sound like some sort of post Cold War political thriller. Then you enter the game itself, emerging from your burning car after a wreck in Kosovo. You walk to a nearby village, and meet...insane cannibals surrounded by gratuitous amounts of body parts and blood. How do you know they are cannibals? Because the game tells you when you try to speak with one. A better question is, WHY are there cannibals? This is a complete deviation from the tutorial and intro. Why not a Serbian rebel, or...a Kosovar? Has the world ended? If it did, why wasn't I told before the adventure started?

 - The game gives you absolutely no direction, and I could find nothing to do. I emerged from said burning car, walked to the village, had a couple of nonsensical interactions with so-called ""cannibals"", found no objects I could interact with, leaving a sense that the interface was broken, eventually found a trap door that said I needed the ""Butcher's Key"" to open. There was snoring coming from behind a nearby door, and nothing I could do to open it (E didn't work, nor did the other ""Use"" function, and the cursor indicating an interactive object didn't light up). It occurred to me as I was writing this that I MAY have been able to pick up the axe laying on the table next to the severed legs in the next room, then use it to chop down the door, but when I restarted the game I found I'd have to do the whole experience again, including the tutorial, to get to that point.

Conclusion: this game needs to decide what kind of game it is, and more polish, before it should ask people to pay for it.",1497836657,1559793003,False,11,1,0.641388952732086182,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Last Dogma is a first person exploration / action game from one-man-band indie developer, Sasha Darko.

In the Last Dogma you play Sebastian, a tough-guy ATF agent working in Serbia (or is it Russia? I'm not quite sure). The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though, so I'm happy to be told that I misunderstood.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The Last Dogma's graphics fall over a large range. From a creative, but minimalist, 'meta room' in the tutorial, complete with labelled objects and development texture maps, to the in-game forest of the first level, and the great, super-bright glowing of the second (or third?) level, I was really quite impressed with some of them. Smoke and other special effects are very good, too. Character models fall fairly solidly in the middle ground. And then some of the level geometry and textures are eye-bleedingly bad: I gave myself a headache from squinting at some of the glaring reddish textures inside some of the buildings; noticed quite a few examples of terrain not fitting together, leaving holes in the level geometry; and just found myself confused with some of the later levels.

Options are equally confusing, with three resolutions available: HD, HD-Ready, and FULL HD. Similarly, detail levels make no sense: True, Medium, and Pentium 486.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Sound effects are pretty good. Volumes seem to be properly normalised and nothing stands out as being out of place.

The game includes voices for the main characters, and these range in quality. The narrator voice sounds professional and is the best of the lot, while some of the others, including Sebastian, aren't that great. But all are much better than I had expected after reading some other reviews.

The title theme is an ambient sort-of slightly chilling score, which I found fit the game quite well. There are sections of the game with similarly minimalistic tunes and background noises that are also well done.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The Last Dogma is a first-person action/adventure game with some light combat. It's set in a weird alternate-history Eastern Europe, full of cults, cannibals, and weird demon-god-thingies. Sounds confusing? Yeah, it is.

The tutorial introduces you to the basics in a somewhat humorous way, with a dead-pan narrator and a single room set up like a development test. It's a nice start. The game then throws you straight into its weirdness, though, with a comic-style introduction and a nice forest scene. WASD and mouse control movement and combat, as you'd expect, and the handful of remaining keys are easy to remember.

Each level is moderate in size, but there's not that much to do. You walk around, talk to the few NPCs, sometimes biff a few baddies, and try to find the exit to the next level. There's no map, but the levels are fairly empty, so you shouldn't be stuck looking for the exit for too long. There aren't any puzzles, or that much to see. I guess some might stick it in the genre of 'walking simulator', and wouldn't be far wrong.

The story is a bit ridiculous and hard to understand. It's confusing enough, in fact, that the developer posted story spoilers on the game's web site, although that seemed to be down at the time that I tried to connect, leaving me still in the dark. It's creative in some ways, but feels quite immature, jumping all over the place in a way that feels very forced. To top it off, the writing itself is of fairly poor quality, and could definitely use another proofreading pass, or seven.

You can't skip the tutorial, and when only Chapter 1 has been unlocked the chapter select option doesn't work, forcing you to start again (and sit through the tutorial again, too). I also found the game crashed when minimising and restoring on a couple of occasions, so I've now seen the tutorial four times.

The game really suffers from lack of polish and attention to detail, too. From the tutorial that incorrectly names the game (""The Last Disbeliever"") in the opening lines, to the subtitles that don't match the spoken words, the poor grammar, and the terrain meshes that have holes in them and cause you to get stuck, The Last Dogma feels like it should still be in beta.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
Pros:
+ Graphics are well done on some levels
+ Music and sound are pretty good
+ Voiceovers
+ Steam Achievements and Trading Cards

Cons:
- Nonsensical story that may offend and is not written well
- Lack of general polish
- Achievements don't seem to work (I completed the game with the 'perfect' ending and didn't get the ""You've completed the main campaign."" achievement)

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
The Last Dogma is a bit of a confusing mess. Given the lack of that much to actually do, the bugs, the nonsensical story, and the general lack of polish, it's hard to recommend. But it's a shame; it's definitely creative, and some of the graphics and sound are really rather good.

I'm really on the the fence with this one. I think it's a thumbs down, but only just. Still, if it seems like your sort of thing, and you don't mind your games a bit 'raw', by all means pick it up when it's next on sale.

There are some details to clarify and (indeed) misunderstood things to explain. And something to confirm, too.


[b]About story[/b]
The game can look pure nonsense on the surface until you start looking deeper. It's not like everything will be clear, it's just won't look entirely absurd. I'm not trying to say there's something ‚Äúsuper smart‚Äù underneath, I just wanted to write a completely unique story in a most unconventional way, no tired tropes and cliches, so the sacrifices were made and many traditional elements were thrown out. 
Some things are never explained for the sake of realistic storytelling (yes, in a surreal game), some things are cryptic just for the sake/fun of it and some references are so obscure that perhaps only 5-10 players in the world will understand them. For example, referencing some obscure Japanese adventure game (which was only released in EU/Japan on Sega Saturn or maybe even didn't have such luxury to be translated) is a pretty usual thing for me in that matter. Playing Sacred Line (a freeware game on which The Last Dogma is based on, available here as a free DLC) will also help to understand some minor details.

In many ways the game is similar to movie Southland Tales, I even put the name of the movie right above the logo. Both are chaotic in nature and absurd on the surface and both got very negative reviews because of that. I ended up writing a developer commentary with some explanations about the story as an extra bonus, but some people on Steam just take as an insult and developer's inability to provide a coherent storytelling.Which was never the intention.
Speaking of that commentary, you wrote the review about the same time the game website which had it was shutdown after four years of existing. I've already re-uploaded the commentary: http://sashadarko.com/the-last-dogma-developer-commentary/

[b]Missing textures and bad level geometry[/b]

You probably mean The Red Desert level. There's an ‚Äúred light‚Äù effect which I added to make it the location more surreal and haunting. I tested the level many times and honestly have no problem with it whatsoever, this is also the first time I read it's ‚Äúeye bleeding‚Äù to somebody.
There are indeed some problems with terrain geometry on Desert level and most of them tied to default Unity terrain engine, which is known among developers for being extremely poor and only allowing to create terrains which look like the 90s/early 2000s 3D games. There's an advanced solution (i.e. plugin) to create better terrains but it cost something around 150-200$ and I couldn't afford it.

HD = 720p, HD-Ready = 768p, Full HD = 1080p. Not sure how it's confusing, although...it's probably an European thing and Americans don't see these labels on US monitor/TV boxes.
True = The way the game is supposed to look, Medium = Medium (literally), Pentium 486 = A somewhat standard joke which means ‚ÄúOld hardware‚Äù and in the game context it means ‚ÄúLow settings‚Äù. I could name it ‚ÄúPotato‚Äù like some other developers do these days, but I have a somewhat nostalgia for old computers so it's named that way. 


[b]About Achievements[/b]
There is no Steam Achievements feature listed in the Steam features and there never were any Steam achievements (which is important). There are two in-game achievements, both of which are jokes which make fun of the Achievements system itself and will never ‚Äúunlock‚Äù.
These two Steam achievements you mean were recently made public on Steam for the matter of testing (no other way to do this). But then I found out that the Unity version I used to make the game (4.2) won't allow me to implement Steamworks without updating the engine to 4.6.1. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Yes, there are no puzzles. I'm not a fan of  puzzles which have nothing to do with common logic (like King's Quest puzzles), something like HOG mini-games wouldn't make any sense being in the game and they would be a stupid and unnecessary clich√©. I wouldn't mind to add some physics-based puzzles, but there are so many games with physics puzzles out there so it's practically impossible to create something new on that front. 

The game had two proofreaders, but only before the game was released. There were many changes in the story and dialogues after release, some parts were rewritten entirely. I suspect these new additions are the ones you mean. If you'll tell me where to look, I'll start looking. I'm obviously not a Native speaker and my native language is entirely different, but my English had improved significantly over years. 

There's might be some problem with Chapter Select, indeed. It seems it occurred after the last update, I'll look into it.
‚ÄúThe Last Disbeliever‚Äù is not a mistake, it was the game title right from the start and voice actor was given the lines which mentioned it. The name of the website and early promo videos also reflect that. It was some time before release when ‚ÄúDisbeliever‚Äù was changed to ‚ÄúDogma‚Äù. The reason is simple, it's just sounds better and also helped to make the logo look better."

[b]The Last Dogma[/b] is a first-person exploration psychological game developed and published by Sasha Darko.

[h1]STORY[/h1]
The game tries to mimic other games (such as The Stanley Parable) by creating a satirical story that is way too much ""in-your-face"" than other games of the genre. You play as Sebastian, an ATF special agent tasked with the tracking and eradication of local firearms dealers. You will find yourself in a village of cannibals, sewers, hellish landscapes, abandoned Christian schools and in Medieval times. It's a weird, non-sensical, satirical story that falls apart from the very beginning. If you really are interested to understand what happens, read the topic created by the developer who explains the story. Something that shouldn't happen.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
Made in the Unity engine, it performs really badly in the first sections of the game, with frame-rate below 20. If that wasn't enough, the game doesn't even look all that great. With pre-built assets, aggressive depth-of-field and incredibly shiny objects ([b]IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS[/b]), I got sick after 30 minutes. I played this game in bursts of 15-20 minutes to avoid headache and pain to the eyes, something that doesn't happen with any other game.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
The game is supposed to be an exploration game, but there is little to do other than finding some poorly hidden secrets. You will encounter a couple of enemies who, as soon as they die, will start squirting blood continuosly. You will also engage in running, finding keys to open doors, collecting pages and completing a driving section. All in the name of satire. However, unlike smarter games, it is all handled pretty badly: the controls are wonky, the dialogue tree is non-existent and choice-less, the combat is pretty much absent and the satire is heavy-handed. What could've been a good product turned into something convoluted, with multiple genres blanded together for boring sections.

[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]
There is little to no challenge: the objects you need are right under your nose, the enemies take forever to hit you and the ""puzzles"" are the easiest ones I've ever seen. Sure, the game's goal is to tell a ""compelling"" story, but that's not a good excuse to not add even a small amount of challenge.

[h1]SOUND[/h1]
The voice acting goes from cheesy to mediocre, while the low-quality sound effects are taken directly from freeware sites (this still is an indie game). I also believe that the soundtrack is made of Kevin MacLeod's songs, which are always nice, even though they feel out of place here.

[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]
There are multiple endings and two in-game achievements, as well as ""30+ well-hidden secrets"" (direct quote from the Store page). If you find what you've read before interesting, you will get your money's worth with this game. Maybe.

Overall, this attempt at satire fails on every point, with painful graphics, incoherent story, lack of gameplay, terrible sound and little to no challenge. I am surprised it isn't in Early Access. Avoid at all cost.

While one is welcome to say that ‚Äúyou just don't get it,‚Äù what doesn't change is the fact that the story isn't conveyed in a way that fits this medium of entertainment. One of the first parts of the game you're treated to is an overview of the history of the world, and the game itself places you in front of a tiny television screen, while a voice drones on in the background on what's been happening in the story. Can you skip it? Yes. Should this have been in the game? No. 

There's this thing in visual media called ‚Äúshow don't tell,‚Äù and this game just tells and tells and tells till your ears bleed. There's a difference between Dear Esther telling you things, because the theme of the game was a man writing a letter to his wife, and this having the demons droning on about what's going on and how you're nothing more than a puppet. You just stop caring after a while and that's a huge part about this game that no other review will tell you, after a while you just want to get it over with.

There's very few combat sequences (less than a handful), and very little to interact with.

The game focuses instead on dialog and story, however the dialog choices given have no consequences and have no baring to the outcome of the game. It's also incredibly cryptic just for the sake of being cryptic with out any connection to the gameplay. The story is also incoherent and a lot of the story sequences are incredibly drawn out, long winded, confusing, and with no player interaction.

The game is also plagued with technical hic ups, and poor presentation. There are parts of the game where the player can walk off the ledge of the map, visual glitches all over the place, and poor grammar and spelling just to name a few issues. The game also features a ridiculous menu system where you have to use the ""F"" keys to adjust your visual settings with the settings themselves vaguely labeled as anything useful. Also the game features inconsistent model quality and incredibly blurry textures when you get up close. 

So I've pointed out a lot of issues with the game, is there anything at all redeeming about it? The Last Dogma is a one man project, so in that context some of the environmental design is actually pretty interesting, and sometimes even look quite good, as long as you don't get too close to anything. The game is also priced relatively low as well, at $7.00usd it's not an overly steep price for the most curious.

Overall The Last Dogma falls flat on almost every aspect. Inconsistent visuals, technical bugs, and presentation quality are all issues, but the one aspect that takes the cake is the lack of gameplay and the incoherent story.

Pros:
- Some interesting environmental design
- Reasonable asking price

Cons:
- Incoherent themes and story
- Lacks gameplay
- Short
- Buggy
- poor presentation",1436824776,1436825379,False,134,5,0.83769911527633667,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Oh lordy, this game is so brilliant.
First the author is generous enough to start out by saying that if our tiny minds cannot fathom the depth of the story, fear not, it's already explained in a pinned forum post.
Well thankfully I saw that so I didn't have to waste my precious riddlin on intro cinema - which came, i'm told in HD. Sadly my computer just couldn't keep up and kept skipping frames.
After being told how stupid, useless and incompetent the Russians are -which is great satire I must admit. HA! - the narrator states that the U.S. Elected Sam Shotgun, aka Uncle Sam. It's funny because we have a reference to the idea of Uncle Sam, how witty. The United Kingdoms apparently kicked the Queen out and elected a Irannian, as you do, then was invaded by ""the arab states"" As you know, you cannot trust them. Then we tricked ""The Africans"" obeying the U.S. with the bible- because the U.S. only has one god- and since we airdropped them instead of ""contreceptives""  they thought to themselevs""the books came from the sky, it was the word of God.""
Such Satire is amazing. How could this writer even be making games? The next Stephen King is right here!
But I digress, my tiny mind was so thankful the narrator stuck around to give me a simple, not at all condesending tutorial. I felt like I was playing my old favorite games again.
I sadly didn't make it very far, my tiny brain couldn't focus on all that HEAVY dialog and jokes about unkillable characters being in a ""NPC"" state.
