And I FINALLY BEAT DREDMOR!!! 
Ill be honest I kind of cheese the win. Dredmor was behind bars and I pretty much unleashed all my fire spells on him and some laser wand attacks. Bit underwhelming but consider how the first moment I see him THE MOFO ONE SHOTS ME! Im level 24 and I get ONE SHOTTED!!!! HOW?!?!?!?

Anyways. I got this game from a body of mine back in college in 2011 and originally I didnt like it because I thought it was stupid and turn based RPG  with parody of everything was stupid also I was playing Skyrim at the time and didnt think anything else could compare. Little did I know over time I grew to love this game and now I want to try all sorts of builds. 

Also I had the non DRM version of this game on an old laptop that I lost the save file to and that one had more hours compared to my steam account.

This game. Oh my God this game. People have their First Rogue-like game. This one was mine and I am proud to say so. Ill come back to this game time and time again just to see how far I can get. I kind of wish there was a DoD 2 but honestly maybe not. I cant express how much I love the music that I even have it on my phone to play from time to time. Thats how good this is.

As far as dungeon crawlers go, the game is fairly standard:  it's a little clunky, but reasonably balanced with 3 difficulty levels, a permadeath setting and a less-grindy setting to suit your interests.  You pick your skills to guess at a playstyle, you head off into the dungeon, you fight stuff and level up and get gear, and then (most likely) you die.  All you get out of that run is becoming more familiar with the game; there's no persistent/metagame progress.

Where DoD shines, and the reason why I say it belongs in a museum, is how it delivers just so many references through tasteful writing.  More specifically, it's delivering references from the 2000's and early 2010's.  [i]It's a time capsule,[/i] a snapshot of Internet culture and a glimpse into what everybody liked at the time.

You'll notice there's a slight imbalance in the ""very""s up there.

DoD is an unusual example of a true roguelike, with no cumulative research or buffs, no unlocks, no filter and absolutely no mercy. To start with you will choose from an oodle of ""skills"" to tack onto your character, from weapon specialization to more out there ones like ""paranormal investigator"" or ""emomancy"". Once your character is done, you will be unceremoniously dumped into the first floor of a dungeon, and your job will be to simply go around the place, get EXP and items, and try to make it to the end.

The dungeon floors are truly massive, and as you increase your level, you will be able to improve the skills you chose at the beginning, with a number of tiered upgrades that will unlock truly wild and bizarre spells and skills on those skills. I'm not sure it would be fair to say that they are all equal in power, but to my estimation, you could probably beat the game by specializing on any one of them. Since you cannot see the possible paths when choosing the profession itself, a lot of the intended game route goes by the player trying wild combinations of perks and seeing what professions work better with which ones, not only in a mechanical sense, but also because some of these professions will allow you to craft a gazillion items and gear that will work better or worse with the rest of them. You will also learn new recipes as you keep on adventuring, and once you hit your stride, this game will give you all the dungeon you can handle to keep improving and experimenting on your builds, for hours, and hours, and hours. Seriously, I literally spent like 6 straight hours into a run, and I only made it past floor 3, so neither content nor playtime is being called into question here. It is incredibly fun and satisfying to get a build going, and once you do, you will want nothing else than to experiment and explore for better loot, more skills, and what surprises await you deeper into the dungeon.

This  being said, however, and while having an absolute DREAM of a groundwork and basic game loop, I cannot honestly recommend the game due to the constant annoyances, dragged out pace, and general frustrations that at this point and 12 years after its release, I can only attribute to either the developers not caring, or thinking it'd be hilarious to be a dick to their players.

See, you'll pick up a ton of stuff in DoD. At [i]ton[/i]. And not just gear, but also resources that you should be able to use for crafting, if you pick one of those professions. The selection is absolutely insane, and you can not only build, but also ""enchant"" your gear using those professions to craft and experiment with. But for that, you will need to find the right ingredients, keep track of them, and use them at the right time. For one, inventory management is an absolute fucking nightmare that I cannot in good conscience wish on anyone. Your inventory space is pretty generous, and you'll even get a ""pocket dimension"" acting like some kind of vault you can put stuff in, but good luck managing all that in a timely manner without going crazy. Your pocket dimension will in no time start looking like a hoarder's basement, full of piles of items that you can't use 'cause you don't have the right profession, and ""item management"" comes down to, essentially, either spend ungodly amounts of time meticulously picking up and dropping down and going back and forth, or succumb to the siren call of ""fuck it"" and be expeditious but inefficient, point at which you'll eventually reach because you'll soon learn that nothing means anything and you'll end up dying anyway. You will always be missing that one reagent because you can't control or predict drops, and by the time you inevitably die, your pocket dimension will always look like a collection of unfinished dreams and time wasted.

Combat is... okay. It's not particularly pretty, but spells usually will hit their mark, and enemies are dumb as a doornail so they are relatively easy to kite and eventually take down once you settle into a groove. There's an insane amount of versatility in what you can do and how you can use what you have and what you find to your advantage, and the game will use a random name generator for named mobs and items, giving it a very fun, dwarf fortress-y flavor to the world. But as you forge on through the levels, what started like a fun succession of rooms and enemy groups will turn into Somme-levels of attritional, repetitive combat that will grind down your enthusiasm and creativity. By level 3, you will whittle down a room full of enemies, coming down to a sliver of your health, with your reward being a handful of reagents that you can't use 'cause you don't have the profession and another door to another room chock full of monsters that you will have to whittle down to a sliver of your health, with your reward being a handful of... you get the drift. Granted, this takes a few hours to settle in, but every room of every floor will become this ever increasing ramping up of pressure of more powerful and dangerous enemies, tight situations, asshole traps everywhere and the possibility of a new enemy or boss [i]juuust[/i] out of sight about to introduce you to its room clearing, absurd damage spell until again, you end up dying.

And in death comes oblivion.

Listen, I'm not against roguelikes. In fact, I consider the genre to contain some of the most intricate, clever and interesting designs in all of videogames. But I would lie if I said that spending 8 hours in a row playing a game, minutely organizing my inventory, planning out my builds and crafts despite the incredibly obtuse and barebones item management and trudging through combat that ends up feeling equal parts routine and horseshit only to die and have my character wiped and deleted from existence with absolutely nothing to show for it feels anything close to good. Moreso when the game crashes on death and doesn't even record your run in your high scores, but that's really beside the point: your time and effort means NOTHING. You don't get any unlocks, or an extra level for your next character, you don't get to pass down money, or items, you don't get second chances, or even a fucking chest for your pocket dimension.

This kick in the balls is what truly makes me not want to recommend this game to anyone. Not only you can die to a sometimes temperamental click detection, but even if you and the game work perfectly as intended an elite mob or a ""monster zoo"" that you will just stumble in with no prior knowledge can and will get you in an instant, and then it's fuck you, thank you for wasting 10 hours of your time. The game has this design dissonance between looking like it was designed for multiple, quick runs, but at the same time being absurdly long, arduous and frustrating to deal with without a reward mechanism that makes dumping a work week into it satisfying or worth your while. And there's a million little things that make it *juuust* that extra frustrating, such as dealing with the traps littered everywhere that you *will* step on while backtracking and exploring, forcing you to be slow and methodical, or having to drop your lockpicks if you want to save them for chests instead of doors because there isn't a quick way to choose what to use, or doors being a pain in the ass to close if you want to try and block a horde of monsters bearing down on you, or the item management in general, or not knowing what telepad connects with which, all of which will just grind its goodwill with you a little more, and a little more, until eventually you come out of playing this game feeling frustrated and robbed of your time, and look, I'm not a videogame PhD, but I will go ahead and say that this is not what a game should make you feel like.

Has an exclusivity as both a gaming experience & latch-elements that some could supply as being 'off-beat'. However, as this is the first and only legacy title of it's type---- 
the 'hit and miss' style, including humour of it's own originality is owned by it's self. This style, takes a breathe of the 'creation process' and decision making branch that really holds the subject together.  But also fails to deliver upon the connectionary themes to which a first time player would be or feel suitable in trying to attempt to ignore. Such as a pool of in-jokes, catagorium and other such references--- which, may have ran away from the player tester base of other games and a creative process- over many a campaign of white-board pens and scribbled 'last minute changes' .

  The game itself seems to want to encapsulate all the leftovers and accessories of other items left out of other games and game types; as a 'point of accuracy' after having been placed in the 'inaccurate box' , and possibly looking after other, 'wayward personnel' of 'what' : the game, or it's content: does not reflect  .   Being quite charming: despite the source of freeze-dried smiles of what is going on---- behind those white-board campaign blanket skies--- and underneath the sprew of how the other decisions effect the off-beat pointing toward 'what is not outlined within the project'. 

Never the less, this seems to be a topic-opt to create; such as 'thee' which always does not reflect the option to re-reform or re-create: or, that it absolutely does.  With a governance: Yes, or with a governance: nah.  Which would remind anyone of a creative vestige of Once: when creatively playing with a toy--- is romantically or no--- to include the furnishings of the box or packaging: with the dynamic shifting into those rare play sessions that only compute to the view under the rare, or unique Appalachian dynasty: of make believe set-pieces. Just like that of the tamagotchi- pets, relations and other things--- makes myself wish I had 'more time' to experience this experience and then over periodicals - knowing that wishing that you hadn't.  As a tempo, set by the game itself: quite ingenious, rare: and an unfolding maze of Trust. 

As it was, or might have been the suspicion threshold by the creators plagued upon by their experiences of when, going through--- Gaming Dales of Adwenture: would up--- and crash in your face....and maybe, just maybe---- this game is a little 'pay-back' on all of those unspoken nubb moments; past the caverns of Icy-disappointment gotten over:  and the re-heat of 'just loading back-in' just one more time. -- - - - - -- In short, a Post Modern Dialogue Of A Classic----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- just 'what' : Post and to 'whose' : "" Modern"" - can never be asserted. Certainly a time laboured title, which I enjoyed and would only recommend to a devote RPG non-cataloguer or obscure compute layman denizen: but not too often as in itself, like the Dungeon of Peril it represents: is a trap within a trap--- a maze within a maze.....a plan within a plan. A Gaming Adventure certainly but one with all of the sprew upon, the inside.

But the game features a neat skill-system, where in the beginning, when you create your character (well, create... you chose some skills, name your character and assign a gender), you can pick, or randomly get, seven different skills which you can mix & match as you please.

スタート時にスキルを選ぶ方式で、そこである程度ビルドが決まります。どういうキャラを作るにせよトラップを感知できるスキルがあるとゲームが快適。あとは好みの武器、魔法、クラフトをひとつずつもっておくといいのでは。

ダイアゴナルムーヴ（斜め移動）なしの簡単操作で、斜め方向には近接攻撃も届かないので1 対 1の状況を作りやすいです。スキル制のゲームとはいえ、ToME4ほどバフの貼り直しで忙しくなく、黙々とモンスターを叩いて経験値を貯める作業ができます。サイドクエスト、クラフト、モンスターハウス、店など、ローグライクで考えられる要素は一通り出てくるので、とにかくやることがたくさん。

The pixel graphics and unique artstyle create a great atmosphere of pure adventure throughout the dungeon, each with a unique tileset and monsters, for the most part at least. It has a status showing character portrait. Loads of beautiful item sprites.
The music, instead of being per floor, which would get on the nerves very fast, especially the early levels, choose instead to just cycle thru all its normal level music. An elegant solution that more games could adopt. Of course, some events or special rooms get their own music. And the music is all download-to-listen-all-the-time worthy. Even if some compositions remind me bit too much of some specific tracks from Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy. 
The sound effects are competent, but the ""narration"" get misunderstood sometimes.

Story is minimal, but the atmosphere the game creates with every little thing it does is unparalleled. EVERY equipment, enemy, skill, consumable and even a lot of stage elements have it's own description. Almost always overflowing with humor. It's the crux of the game, and what glues all of it together. It has a lot of different styles, from references of it's time, like monsters quoting portal 2, and older music, movies etc, to environmental and just jokes and gags. You'll most probably find your preferred humor here.

Now, for the gameplay. It's a classic roguelike, which means grid based, you-move-everyone-moves type of games, with a different dungeon each run. You have a lot of information to contend to. Stats are influenced be your skills and equipment, each stat does something important, and you'll want to specialize in one or two different builds, which are basically Martial, Wizard or Rogue like (heh). For equipment you have a lot of weapons to choose from, daggers, swords, staves, etc. 
You have a lot of character slots: Hat, Body, Pants, Shoes, necklace, 2 rings and a crossbow. Each item can be enchanted for more damage of a certain type, resistance of said damage type (there are more than a dozen of damage types), or other stats.  
You have other consumable items like food for HP regeneration (over time usually, not instant recovery), alcoholic drinks for mana regeneration (if you drink too much you'll get drunk debuffs), mushrooms that have crazy effects, Potions and wands that do all sorts of things. You can, of course, craft them and a lot more, like weapons, armor and bolts for your crossbow. 
You also have traps to avoid, or disarm and even use them against your opponents.
For skills you choose 7 at character creation. They determine starting stats and equipment, you can mix and match as you like. Each time you level up you simply choose the next level of one of your chosen skills, no independent stat allocation.
It's an immensely complex game that will take a lot of your time, and may require a wiki to play. I haven't even scratch the surface here. Play and you'll understand.
The game has DLC, that adds more of everything, even dungeon floors and new mechanics, very much worth it. Like the main game is. Also, it has a good amount of mods in and out of the workshop. Won't go hungry playing this game (except for all the cheese you see here all the time that will leave you wanting some gouda or something...).

Difficulty, as expected, is pretty high, but surprisingly customizable. You can set permadeath on or off, and choose 3 difficulty levels. Don't expect easy to be a cakewalk, though, especially on your learning phase.

In a normal playthrough you'll start, die a monster. Restart, die to a trap. Restart, die to a monsterhouse. Restart, etc etc. Fun that don't end. For the completion, you'll earn a number of your achievements as you play normally, but some are also good as learning tools, as there are some for completing a skill paths, leading you to try out new builds. The finish-the-game-in-a-difficulty ones are very much doable, even the permadeth ones. There are a couple of achievements that are actually, literally impossible to obtain normally, one for a removed skill, one for having to meet the devs in person, but you can mod them in from the workshop. (Or used to be, I can't find them on the list anymore, they might have just removed them.)

In conclusion, this gem of a game is a must play for any classic roguelike fan. This game deserves much more praise and recognition for the amount of passion and work the devs poured into it.

In terms of market expectations, Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't have the name recognition of some of the bigger players in the genre, but it has a dedicated following of fans who appreciate its unique blend of humor and challenge.

There's no multiplayer in Dungeons of Dredmor, but the single-player experience is more than enough to keep players engaged. The game's narrative is largely delivered through item descriptions and flavor text, but the world is so richly detailed that it's easy to get lost in the lore.

The graphics in Dungeons of Dredmor are simple but effective, with colorful pixel art that perfectly captures the game's whimsical tone. The audio design is similarly charming, with a catchy soundtrack and hilarious sound effects.

In terms of technical performance, Dungeons of Dredmor runs smoothly and is relatively bug-free, although there are occasional issues with crashing or freezing.

In terms of value, Dungeons of Dredmor is an absolute steal. It's a feature-rich game with a ton of replayability, and it's priced to move.

Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic example of what a roguelike dungeon-crawler should be. With its deep gameplay mechanics, quirky sense of humor, and punishing difficulty, it's a game that will keep players coming back for more.

Took me more than 10 years and several runs to finally defeat the last boss and give a full review.

So let's start out with positives. This is a turn based, roguelike RPG game that has optional permadeath mode on. I'll talk about permadeath later but what you should know is the game has randomly generated dungeons. For some of you this might be negative but for me, I like randomly generated dungeons because they bring replay value, meaning every run you do in this game is different. The starting skills are the only skills available to you, so pick them wisely although there is a downside to them and I'll explain later, for now you should know that the positives are infinite replay value and tons of choices in building your character. The weapons and armor are also randomly generated which as I said means every run will be different run.

The game is quite long, took me around 15 hours to beat my last run so you will be playing this game for quite a long time. In addition there are also bonus dungeons which you can go through and acquire more loot if needed.

Crafting in this game is excellent, the materials are abundant and you can always find new recipes in the bookshelves

Oh and the music is excellent. It is limited though, for a game this long you would need a lot more soundtracks but they are really good.

One also thing to note, this game has a lot of humor based either from the 80s or 90s gaming, although it has a fair share of memes that used to be popular back in 2011, so some jokes you might find cringe. 

The combat is simple and it's quite satisfying when you get new equipment or spells and see how enemies get destroyed on your path.

Now for the negatives. This game likes to recycle enemies and dungeon designs a lot, but that's only a minor complaint. Even bigger negative is that as one user noted, there is a bug where auto saves cause the game to crash and sometimes even corrupt the saves. Developer Gaslamp Games went defunct in 2017 so don't expect them to fix this game, just keep that in mind. I did come up to this bug 2 times but I managed to recover my saves (somehow).

The second biggest negative is the permadeath. Normally permadeath isn't a problem in roguelike games like Binding of Isaac or Slay the Spire, but here is the thing: Those games have short sessions of gameplay, they are designed to have permadeath because each session of the game lasts for a short time. Dungeons of Dreadmor is not the type of game where permadeath fits, because as I said this game is long, really long. How would you like if you went halfway through the game, opened a door, find a monster zoo event (that's the room where every single square is filled with a monster) and right at the start there are 2 elites who 2 shot you, and your run is gone. If this game had maybe like 3 floors permadeath run, that would be fine but 10/15 floors with permadeath on? Unless you have a patience of a buddhist monk, it's not fun, at all.

The probably biggest complain is the last boss. Now when you pick skills at the start, you think to yourself you are gonna pick a melee class and bash the boss in the head right? Well no because not only the boss has ranged but he also has a very nasty melee damage that can 3 shot you even with the best armor and the armor skill maxed. So you think that you are gonna be a wizard and cast spells at him? Well no, because he is extremely resistant to spells and it will take hours of casting before you kill him. The only way to kill him is with ranged. That kind of sucks, and the last boss is the only thing that doesn't change in your entire run. He is always gonna be mage with stupidly high damage.

So is dungeons of dredmor worth your time. For 3.99$ if you keep in mind of the autosave crash, yes, although do note, it is an old game with some outdated mechanics and if you want a better roguelike games, then you should probably pick Binding of Isaac. With all the negatives, it comes out as an okay roguelike game, I'll put thumbs up just because of the extremely low price, but don't get your hopes that this is something unforgettable. In fact, only 4% of players beat the last boss.",1679177873,1679254707,True,14,0,0.663564443588256836,0,False,False,False,True,,,

It has its fair share of issues--it doesn't explain finer mechanics well, crashes are not uncommon, and random loss of save data can rarely happen--but if you can look past the scuff (and remember to back up your saves), you might find it becoming one of your favorite games like I did.

[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Dungeons of Dredmor[/i] harkens back to the early days of the roguelike genre: exploring a dreary dungeon, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, procedural map generation, and permanent death. It isn't all derivitive, however, as it sets itself apart thanks to a unique aesthetic, quirky humor, and a really neat approach to character customziation. I will say right up front: this is arguably one of my favorite games ever, but my recommendation comes with a few asterisks--it's a fun game, but it has some glaring flaws that you should be made aware of before buying it.

Before I get into that, though, I want to talk about the positives, starting with how [b]the game offers a lot of possibilities for character customization[/b]. For one, there are a ton of different stats: you have 6 ""primary stats"" that translate to your classic STR/INT/DEX/CON/CHA/LUK; as well as 19 ""secondary stats"" influenced by your primary stats and/or equipment, which includes everything from attack power, crit/counter/dodge chances, defenses, crafting ranks, and more. It's a little hard to wrap your head around at first, but you can eventually use it to create some very unconventional characters, like someone built entirely around counter chance who has to survive by never getting hit. My favorite part of the customization process, though, is the class system--or rather the lack of one. Rather than picking a traditional class like warrior or mage, your abilities are determined by selecting from a list of Skills--a grand total of 51 between the base game and all DLC, of which you get to pick 7 for each run. These range from the mundane like Swords, Archery, or Alchemy, to the badass or utterly bizarre like Viking Wizardry, Battle Geology, Archaeology, and even Communist. These Skills can radically change the way you play, and discovering which ones compliment each other is the key to reaching the end of the game.

[b]Traditional roguelikes are known for being difficult, but [i]Dredmor[/i] is surprisingly beginner-friendly[/b] with simple controls, different difficulty settings, and the ability to disable permadeath. It's easy to pick up, but the difficulty still stems from trying to beat it. Even on the lowest difficulty, your first runs will have you die fast and often in ways that might feel unfair--and in some cases, they kinda will be. Your character at low levels is fragile regardless of your build, the tutorial doesn't cover everything you'll encounter, and there are a handful of beginner traps to watch out for ([spoiler]red portal good, blue portal bad[/spoiler]). Rest assured that the feeling of unfairness will largely go away once you learn how things work. Having spent almost 200 hours playing as of writing this, rarely does a death happen now that I feel was the result of poor RNG. Most of my deaths tend to happen because I get impatient or careless, rushing into rooms without looking for traps or getting into fights without checking my health bar first. [b]My advice is to play without permadeath in your first playthrough(s) so you're not punished as harshly for experimenting, then turn it on once you get more comfortable with the mechanics[/b]. After a while, you can get decently far with many different character builds; but actually beating the game is another story. It does something that made me give up on games like [i]FTL[/i], where [b]the final boss introduces a sudden difficulty spike[/b] that will immediately end your run if you don't know what you're getting into. Unlike [i]FTL[/i], however, I don't think it's quite as reliant on RNG to win as there are multiple Skills that can guarantee a more level playing field (e.g. [spoiler]Magical Law's ""Gag Order"" ability[/spoiler]); though it still won't be a cakewalk.

Each of the dungeon's 10 floors (15 with DLC) has its own enemies, randomly-generated rooms, and even cosmetic tileset to try and give you a real sense of progression during your run. That being said, there's not as much variation as you might like: ""enemy variety"" often means palette swaps of older enemies, and the actual number of different rooms on a given floor is low enough that you'll exhaust the total amount to be found there after just a couple visits. All of this is to say that [b]the lack of overall dungeon variety between runs can make the game feel repetitive after a while--but that's where the modding scene comes in[/b]. The Steam Workshop has an assortment of mods offering new Skills, items, rooms, and more in case you're bored of the base game; and the amount of content that can be found in some of these can even rival that of the official DLC (you can find some of my favorites [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915043168]here[/url]). Fair warning: some mods (even on Steam) are old and no longer work, and any modding carries the risk of corrupting/deleting save files; so follow any listed installation instructions carefully and make manual backups of your save files (C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Documents\Gaslamp Games\Dungeons of Dredmor\).

On a related note, it's time to get into those issues I mentioned at the start, because [b]this game is heavily flawed--if not outright broken--in multiple ways[/b]. The first is that [b]it often fails to properly teach the player[/b]: the tutorial glosses over a lot of the finer mechanics (the most egregious example being crafting), the in-game descriptions for abilities are usually unhelpful and require a wiki to figure out what exactly they do, and there's even a character stat (magic reflection) that doesn't appear on your character sheet for no good reason. All of this can be resolved through continued play or community support, but what can't be resolved this way is [b]the litany of technical problems that plague an otherwise good game[/b]: some abilities have incorrect descriptions and warrant editing XML files to fix (e.g. Magic Training's ""Extra-planar Concentration"", whose -5 stat debuff was actually -50 in practice), you'll experience sudden freezing and lag spikes on even the most high-end machine, certain actions (e.g. completing a quest) can randomly crash the program (which happened 3 times while replaying for this review), and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/boobina/recommended/98800/]the built-in autosave feature can crash the game or even corrupt your save file in rare cases[/url]. Gaslamp Games dissolved some time around 2017, and the developers have all gone their separate ways in the years since; so unless someone buys up the rights to the game in the future, problems like these will never be fixed. I don't mention all of this to deter you from buying the game, but I want to make sure you know what to expect before picking it up.

It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but something about it has kept me coming back time and time again since I first played it over eight years ago. It's addicting in a way that few games manage to be for me, and even losing hours of progress to some stupid mistake does little to deter me from getting back up and trying again. [b][u]Despite some serious flaws, and despite occupying a genre I rarely have the patience for these days, [i]Dungeons of Dredmor's[/i] quirkiness, rich customization, and replayability have cemented it as one of my favorite games of all time.[/u][/b]

Dungeons of Dredmor has an attitude, and it's silly, but not in a ""scream in your face"" kind of way.

Even though it's a turn-based game, it's very fluid, and the game speed can be adjusted on the fly.

The experience is somewhat typical of a rogue-like: lots of items, enemy types, objects, traps, character classes, crafting, and secrets. What's not so typical? You fight creatures like bee people named Bee Arthur, turn your items into lutefisk using a lutefisk cube to be given to a lutefisk god statue to receive a buff, have the ability to choose a communist + capitalist class combination, and drink mother-effing PILSNER to restore your MP. I wouldn't exactly call the humor subtle in this game, but it also isn't rubbed in your face too much either, so if you don't like it, it doesn't affect the gameplay too much.

Даже один рейд сложно пройти, да. У неё очень много но, верно. Но, всё-таки игр с ещё более крутым билдостроением и разнообразием ещё поискать надо.

Графика и дизайн (7/10)
Графика в рогаликах не главное - это уже давно доказано сотней других примеров. Собственно, и DoD здесь нельзя назвать выдающимся. Спрайтов тут великое множество, есть свой некий уникальный стиль, пусть он зайдёт не всем (особенно хорошо выглядят арты), да и главный герой легко запоминается за счёт своих шикарных бровей. Кроме того, прекрасно (но не всегда) работают визуальные ожидания - если ты видишь легендарный меч в камне - наверняка у него будет максимальная редкость. А если ты видишь невнятную редиску - то с лёгкостью его убьёшь.
Но есть и проблемы. Так, игра очень злоупотребляет банальным перекрашиванием мобов. Мне кажется, что как минимум каждый из них встречается в 4-5 цветах, но технически - это разные монстры. Аналогичная ситуация с уровнями - их здесь 15 штук, но отличаются они в первую очередь полом и стенами, а типы помещений остаются теми же самыми. Кроме того, интерфейс у игры не самый дружелюбный - много мелкого текста и маленьких окошек.
В целом, графика пусть и поднадоедает, но зато она приятная, понятная и даже битвы тут выглядят вполне красиво за счёт множества разных спецэффектов.

Звук и музыка (7/10)
В общем и целом - звуковое сопровождение приятное. Мелодии не напряжные. Открывающая тема по-настоящему героическая. А при открытии карнавала монстров начинается вполне подходящая музыка. То же самое касается и озвучки. Пусть сам герой не говорит, но некий загадочный голос постоянно уведомляет о малом хп и мане, что очень полезно. Да и многие монстры и абилки имеют уникальные звуки. Вот только всё это рано или поздно приедается.

Геймплей (7/10)
Во многих играх геймплей - это главное. И для рогаликов - тем более. Вот только у Dungeon of Dredmor есть с этим некоторые проблемы. И главная из них - продолжительность игры. Всего игра состоит из 10/15 этажей. Казалось бы, это мелочь, есть рогалики, где они ещё длиннее. Вот только прохождение одного этажа полностью занимает минимум час времени, а то и больше. Из-за этого многое в игре очень сильно приедается, даже несмотря на разнообразие. И, более того, это сильно усложняет прохождение игры. А ведь исследовать этажи надо - без опыта не прокачаешь все ветки.
Но, с этим вы столкнётесь позже. А вот начало игры сразу же показывает то, насколько она разнообразна. При создании игрок волен выбрать 7 деревьев навыков из более чем 70 различных деревьев. И какие же это навыки! Помимо банальщины, вроде владения мечами или пиромантии, тут есть и Матемагия, Археология, Стимпанковство (!?), и даже Коммунизм! Я так играл за Амбидекстера-мечника-латника, владеющего псионикой, ковкой плоти, пиромантией и магией крови. А ведь в каждом дереве минимум шесть умений. Представьте, какие открываются перспективы для билдостроения. А ведь тут ещё есть крафт, алхимия и другие механики.
Различных параметров у персонажа так же более чем достаточно. Куча видов элементарного урона, много различных переменных, которые меняются при прокачке и от снаряжения (причём, не всегда в хорошую сторону). Правда следить за всем этим не обязательно - главное помнить правило ""Чем больше - тем лучше"".
Различной снаряги и вещей тут так же огромное количество и практически все они имеют шуточки в описании. Будь то легендарный меч в камне, шляпа Алукарда, или книга ""Король в Желтом"". И даже бесполезная броня для лошади.
Сама по-себе игра довольно обычная. Ходим, убиваем монстров, ищем снарягу. По началу игра довольно лёгкая (если не играть на харде). Враги убиваются быстро, наносят мало урона и проблем могут доставить только карнавалы (большие комнаты с 50-300 монстрами за раз). Но чем дальше вы идёте, тем...неожиданнее может показать себя ваш билд! Ибо баланс - не про эту игру. И это весело - сложно предсказать, насколько играбельным у вас выйдет класс. Мой последний персонаж забил босса Дредмора как нефиг делать, но его могла вынести тройка рыбо-паладинов из-за уязвимости к свету. Как и любой другой рогалик, игра не будет брать вас за ручку и разъяснять, что и как делать. Всё придётся тестировать весёлым опытным путём. И, честно говоря, это делать веселее, чем пытаться полностью пройти игру.

Сюжет и Лор (7/10)
Сюжета здесь почти нет. Есть злой некромант Лорд Дредмор. Вы должны его убить. По-факту, это всё. Почему же тогда 7 из 10? За отсылки и описательные тексты. Благодаря им мы можем очень много узнать о мире игры, а так же насладиться бесконечным количеством отсылок. Они везде. В достижениях, в описаниях, в речах, в визуале, в обучении. Давно я не встречал игры, которую можно описать одним предложением, но при этом с настолько цельным миром.

DLC, Дополнения, Бонусы (9/10)
Тут есть почти всё, что нужно. Два дополнения с навыками, дополнительными этажами, лутом и плюшками? Есть. Возможность полистать арты? Есть. Есть энциклопедия со всем найденным лутом и монстрами. Жаль только, что у монстров нельзя прочесть описания и нет счётчика того, сколько процентов открыто.

Баги, Фичи, Оптимизация (9/10)
Пару раз случались неприятные вылеты, что сильно плохо из-за того, что тут нет ручного сохранения. Оптимизация не требуется, ибо игра пойдёт на чём угодно. Из фич - вас могут забросить в место, из которого не получится выбраться или можно убить себя по неосторожности.

Итог
Dungeons of Dredmor - это та игра, в которую весело играть, но не весело проходить. Строить билды, изучать деревья навыков, однако 15 (и даже 10) этажей по 1-2 часа каждый - перебор.

Como eu gosto do estilo, adorei esse jogo. Além do mais, tem uma variedade imensa de itens e habilidades. Não sei se alguma vez eu vi uma árvore de habilidades tão grande quanto essa aqui, com possiblidades de ser um Vegano ou um Comunista, entre muitas outra opções. 
E aí entra outro ponto que faz Dredmor tão charmoso e viciante: é muito bem escrito! Todos os itens/habilidades/inimigos e a ambientação do jogo tem descrições muito legais e bem humoradas. O detalhe é que só tem em inglês, o que pode ser um ponto decisivo.
Outra complicação inerente ao gênero é que o jogo é muito difícil. Tem a possibilidade de jogar sem [i]permadeath[/i], o que dá uma aliviada, mas fora isso é ir jogando e aprendendo quais habilidades e itens são melhores na base da tentativa e erro.
A dificuldade é bem cruel quando você chega no último inimigo, o Lord Dredmor. Ele funciona de um jeito diferente do que o resto do jogo todo e tem atributos muito altos, ou seja, é provável que você morra algumas vezes antes de conseguir fazer uma [i]build[/i] capaz de derrotá-lo.
A parte artística do jogo é maravilhosa! Além do texto que eu já elogiei acima, o design dos personagens, inimigos e todas as artes de forma geral são muito bonitas e estilosas. A música é outro ponto muito alto, bem variada e de muito boa qualidade.
Mas no fim das contas, voltamos ao ponto inicial: é um [i]roguelike[/i]. Se você não gosta do estilo, não vai gostar desse jogo, não tem muito o que fazer.

Dungeons of Dredmor technically does everything correct. It has all the basic parts that make up a classic roguelike dungeon crawler: Permadeath, a huge HUGE dungeon, a variety of enemies, neat weapons and armor, and a ton of flavorful consumables. On top of that, it's got a lot of cheeky cute humor, and probably the most notable feature of all: The ""classless"" character builder. You choose a loadout of 7 skills to define your character, rather than simply picking ""Wizard"" or ""Fighter"" at the character select screen.

These are all really cool things, and when the game first came out I loved it. But I'm replaying now, and just realizing that all the little complaints add up until this game is just difficult to deal with.

What's so tedious about it? Here's a few things:
*Your inventory is essentially unlimited thanks to the 'storage dimension' they give you, but your actual in-game backpack is TINY, so you'll spend more time sorting items out in your storage dimension than actually playing the game. If you take any of the crafting skills, it gets worse... I mean there are 14 types of ingots alone, without getting into the potion items, and random junk like wires and springs. 11 types of CHEESE. Your inventory fills up in seconds.
*There's no way to split item stacks, except to alt-click one item out of a stack at a time. If you need to pick up 500 of a resource so you can drop it on an altar, be prepared to spend about 4 minutes clicking.
*Enemies and items can spawn inside of statues, walls, and inaccessible areas. This can make some treasures impossible to collect and some quests impossible to complete. No quests are mandatory, but it is still annoying. On top of that, items and abilities that do 'knockback' on enemies will frequently knock them through walls or doors, into places you can't see.
*There are SO many elemental types in the game that combat just gets flooded and messy. It's hard to keep track of what resistances you should worry about when every attack looks like this: ""You hit the diggle for 27 slashing, 4 crushing, 7 piercing, 6 freezing, 3 burning, 4 lightning, 3 aetherial, 6 corrosive, 4 temporal, 1 suffocation, 2 putrification, 5 necromantic, 3 righteous, and 14 blasting damage."" It's an absolute mess and just serves to make the combat log too flooded to read.
*The amount of backtracking you'll do to re-visit old shops and stuff is insane, and travel is slow, since you have many frames of animation with every step you take. There's no fast/auto-travel option like most roguelikes to save you from the mediocrity of spending 10 minutes holding down the walk button to visit a previous level shop that has an item you need.

Despite having released multiple expansion packs, problems that have existed since day 1 of release are still present and will clearly never be fixed since there's no real development on the game anymore. And there are so many problems, most a lot less obnoxious than the ones I've listed, but it just kind of goes to show that there was a lack of either developer skill or time spent on polish.

Anyway, Dungeons of Dredmor is a great example of how ""more"" doesn't mean ""better"". There's so many skills and items and elemental damage types to choose from but it just ends up making everything feel messy instead of interesting.",1649795029,1649795029,False,7,1,0.497778505086898804,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Adding that now we're at a time when there's sooo many bigger roguelike games to choose from and roguelikes are no longer niche.

I'm reviewing it now because I surprised myself by ending picking this up and playing it again recently. Pushing several hours once more into it. I had so many other roguelikes to choose from that haven't been even tried or some that are my usual go-tos.

And of course, its quirky humour.

The bugs it has here and there that I found are bearable.

Good humor and references, nice gather and craft system and countless builds to play around with. I really enjoyed messing around and seeing how far I could get. 

That was until I wanted to beat it. 

I played on easy and had a rather straight forward run. I was a melee build and tanked up as much as I could. I has the occasional difficult situation(all from monster Zoos) But for the most part it was easy. Then I found dredmor. With two spells he killed me. I had nearly full max star equipment, I was level 24 I had several potion buffs on. 
It felt like I had missed something, like several floors or something. 
Nope.
That's just how it is. 
My mistake I was playing on Iron man mode. I figured since its easy That will add some spice, bad move.
I choose that the dungeons be shorter which still took way too much inventory management, dozens of trips in and out of the dimensional space, constant crafting and about six hours of work just to get to him.  

It happened so quickly I am sure that even if I wasn't playing on Iron man, there was no way I could have beaten him. I checked steam discussion and there are ways to beat him, but its recommended not to play melee, to known he is weak to piercing and holy or have some way to escape and heal.

Now the holy I get but honestly I never like to look up wiki's on game, at what point am I really gonna look at the last boss of the game and not use my melee skill which up until this point has carried me, and instead go get a crossbow? 

I read that several people have beaten him with dozens of different builds, and hats off to those people, good job, but that's not for me.

I enjoyed the game until I saw just how much of a gap there is between the final boss and the rest of the game. If you don't have a broken build, or read the wiki, its probably not going to happen.

My second gripe is you don't get better with every run.  When you die you simply start over again.

Absolutely fantastic turn-based dungeon crawler, with a hyper-focus on witty humour (if puns are witty to you), very dated references for a decade-old game, and insane amounts of semi-cryptic wording for skills, item descriptions, and tooltips.

Cryptic is a valid criticism and description of this game, because it expects you to play the game with a lot of trial-and-error, and if you aren't familiar with these kinds of roguelikes or RPG's, the game can be overwhelming. 

I'm not entirely certain how to recommend the game because it's a genre I am so inexperienced with, but it's so much fun to play around with on occasion. It took 69 hours (nice) to finally beat the game on the normal difficulty, with the final successful run taking around 13 hours to complete while going at trickle pace. 

100% worth it for the price if you want a classic dungeon crawler that doesn't take anything seriously. If english is not your primary language, the verbatim and metaphors used in this game can be difficult to understand.

It was enjoyable, but I have a few recommendations.

1] Don't buy the expansions.  The game is long enough as it is.  Getting the expansions drags out an otherwise long period of play.

2] If you get the expansions, DO NOT pray to any of the Diggle Gods.  The one I worshiped really hit me with some severe bad side effects.

3] I played on the moderate (Dwarf) condition which does not have perma-death.  If you don't play permadeath then a portion of your game is collecting enough stuff to defeat Lord Dredmor in the final battle on level 10 (without expansions) or level 15 (with expansions).  The key to defeating Dredmor is to horde all of the invisibility potions/items you can.  Then horde the best throwing devices/arrows possible.  Clobber Dredmor.  When you get low on health, go invisible.  Heal up.  Clobber Dredmor.  Rinse/repeat.

4] Before the last level collect up all armor and items that you can that reflect spells.  That limits Dredmor's damage.

5] I played as a straight warrior and maxed out Archery.  Weirdly, throwing items were more deadly than arrows.  If I played again I would take
Potions - to make invisibility/regeneration/healing items.
Throwing - it must work better than archery for a warrior type
Smithing - to make great stuff
One weapon type - probably swords or maces not sure which is better
Armor
Shield
Either Magical Law or Tinker for the last pick.

Anyway, the final battle was not that hard but I had so much invisibility/healing stuff that Dredmor never came that close to killing me.",1629242459,1629242459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Seasoned veterans of the genre will appreciate the high quality of presentation and myriad of references to older titles, and newbies to this type of Roguelike will find that Dredmor is a much more manageable and user friendly challenge than many others in the trad-roguelike catalogue.

Dredmor differs from the norm in that there is no diagonal attacking in it, and as a whole the challenge tends to randomly spike much less than in games like Tales of Maj'Eyal or Dungeon Crawl. I would strongly recommend it as a title for people who bounced off stuff like ADOM or Nethack and want a way to get acquainted with the genre.

So how does it play? Your task is to descend the 10 (or 15 with the DLC) floors of the titular dungeon and dispatch the eponymous Dredmor who lies in wait on the lowest floor. You begin by selecting 7 out of a possible 52 skill trees that will define the way your character progresses, and you are unceremoniously dumped at the entrance of the dungeon after a short text box summarising your quest.

From there you explore each floor of the dungeon, leveling up, avoiding traps, and gaining new loot to equip your character. One of the strongest features Dredmor has is the skill system in the game, featuring jobs ranging from Big Game Hunter to Vampire, from Astrologist to Demonologist. There are professions in here you won't find in any other RPG, such as Paranormal Investigators who can transform Potions into different potions and discover crafting recipes by autopsying the bodies of monsters, or Magical Law, which lets you use the power of litigation to reset your cooldowns and silence monsters. If you're someone who just enjoys coming up with fun builds you will love the skill trees on offer here.

Once you get used to the fact that none of the stats are called what they should be called (Strength is Burliness, Spell Crit is Haywire Chance, Dexterity is Nimbleness) and once you get to grips with the 16(!) different damage types in the game which range from the usual Fire and Frost to Existential Damage (Existential damage: does it exist or not? We don't know, but your weapon may inflict it on somebody... if they exist.), the stat system in Dredmor is actually pretty fun and exploitable.

In most RPGs, stats like Armour and Dodge Rating suffer from diminishing returns as you stack them up to prevent players from becoming unkillable gods. Not so in Dungeons of Dredmor. For a lot of stats what you see on your character see translates one-to-one with your actual statstics, so if you see 100 Block on there, you block every hit. It's possible to get characters dual wielding mirror shields for 100% spell reflect, stacking encrusts (the enchant system in the game) to be immune to certain types of damage, or abusing cooldowns to parry every melee strike. It's a lot of fun.

The game isn't perfect by any means though, and there are a few problems with it. First of all the game has a crashing issue for some people that won't be fixed by the devs and isn't moddable. Secondly, the inventory management in the game quickly becomes a big part of it after you hit about Floor 4-5. There are vast array of random pickups in Dredmor, most of which you won't initially know what to use, which all supplements a complicated crafting system. There are far too many items in the game which only have one specific use for one specific profession, and it takes a lot of game play to recognise what's important to keep and what you can sell. In addition to this some of the aspects of the game feel a little half baked, for example the Dredmor fight. When you encounter him there is no change of music, no special throne room he inhabits, he is just randomly pathing around the dungeon doing nothing in particular. He's just chillin'.


You would like this game if:
a.) You like thinking up different character builds and trying them out
b.) You want a way in to the traditional roguelike genre that's user friendly
c.) You appreciate a sense of humour in your games
d.) You like really exploitable games
You won't like it if:
a.) You hate inventory management and crafting
b.) You are a roguelike purist who baulks at the thought of no diagonal attacking

[b]Dungeons of Dredmor[/b] is a satirical dungeon crawling “traditional” roguelike. For the uninitiated, “[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443430/Rogue/]Rogue[/url]” is an actual game from 1980 and the term roguelike was coined to describe games that were... like it. However, in more recent times it's come to surface that not all games described as such were actually that similar to Rogue. Hence the phrase “Traditional Roguelike” becoming more prominent. Of course, there are other variants now in the 'roguelite' sub-category that involve some sort of meta-progression to the runs.

That said, [b]Traditional Roguelike[/b] refers to the game being run-based, procedurally generated, grid/turn-based while featuring permadeath. The overall goal of Dungeons of Dredmor is to reach the final floor and kill Lord Dredmor themselves.

However, the one aspect where I would venture to say that Dungeons of Dredmor was different is that Dredmor only allows movement and combat to take place within the four cardinal directions. Whereas Rogue (or other more modern “traditional roguelikes” like Caves of Qud or Tales of Maj'Eyal) allow it to be done diagonally as well. [I believe older Civ games operated using the numberpad for unit movement as well, for instances where you'd want to move diagonally in 1 turn), Dredmor does allow limited interaction diagonally, but not movement or combat. You'll use WASD in conjunction with the mouse. You are able to pick up items and perform actions like disarming traps from adjacent and diagonal tiles, however.

The style of humor it uses is having off-theme sorts of gags, there's even a Mass Effect reference in one of the achievements. Other ""gags"" involve things like wearing traffic cones as armor or using baseballs as weapons. Not your standard medieval-castle sort of affair.

[h3]Gameplay — discretion is the better part of valor.[/h3]
A lot of mechanics are not obvious. However, the game is not aggressively obtuse either. I found that there's [i]just[/i] enough mystery in discovering new items, mechanics and enemies on the next level to keep you interested while remaining strait forward enough such that you don't really need to think all that much. So it fills the proverbial “podcast” game role quite well whilst retaining a considerable amount of depth.

[b]To give an idea as to what to expect:[/b]
[i](I would consider some of these [u]mechanical spoilers[/u], so don't read this section if discovery is your gambit.)[/i][list]
[*] There are more subtle things you learn as you go. For instance, while you cannot always tell what traps are arrow slit traps, (unless you take the tinkering perk) the arrow always comes form the top of the screen so you could trigger it and do damage to an enemy above you.

[*] Food and drink takes a number of turns to digest and replenish HP/Mana. Potions are instant. Eating food gives you a “well fed” status effect that slowly heals you over time depending on the food. Clicking the “digest” button allows you to fast forward those turns.

[*] Unfortunately, armor does not change character appearance. Weapons do, however.

[*] Portable (or stationary) crafting stations allow you to, for instance grind old meat or cheese into ingredients that can be further crafted into [i]better[/i] food for more sustenance, refilling more health. There is a general rule of thumb I noticed in that food restores health and drinks restore magic. Some things are written clearly within the [i]flavor[/i] text. However, many are not.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2528582239

[*] Kicking locked doors repeatedly has potential to hurt you. Finding lockpicks and successfully using them rewards XP. Additionally, bashing open locked containers can break what's inside. So using lockpicks is also helpful in this regard.

[*] Weapons like wands are not considered a primary weapon, they'll need to be placed into the active slot and used like magic or throwable items. Similar to how different types of arrows are used.

[*] Inventory space can be limited, but you can find a 'pocket dimension' that can be accessed anywhere that's restricted by cooldown. It acts as a tertiary inventory to your hotbar and bag.

[*] The UI can be pretty small and hard to read, however each element has a tiny square on it that you can click to increase its size.

[*] Sidequests can be obtained and completed mid-dungeon for extra XP.[/list]

You'll need to add “-opengl” (without the quotes) in the launch options if you want to enable the Steam overlay. And you'll most likely experience a few crashes.[u]I found disabling the Steam Cloud solved the issue. I've not experienced a single crash after doing this.[/u] There is actually an achievement the first time the game crashes — [b]Suddenly The Dungeon Collapses[/b]: “This achievement is our way of saying 'thank you for participating in our voluntary quality assurance program'.” All said, the small amount of issues apparent are relatively trivial to fix. Considering the asking price, I would be hard-pressed to list it as a negative. Though, it's certainly not a positive.

[h3]Anecdotes:[/h3]
The vagueness of some of the “flavor” text for the items feels a lot like 'Toejam and Earl' when you test mystery presents, some end up being really useful buffs or attacks while others end up spawning rocket boots, sending you flying off the map. Of course, in Dredmor it's more likely you're going to drink some acid or consume some horrid fungus that ultimately kills you.

[h3]Miscellaneous:[/h3] 
The perks you take at the beginning will alter your starting items in addition to your stats. They will also be the skill trees you're able to level into, provided you're able stay alive that long.

The game features a considerable amount [u]Steam Workshop[/u] support as well. Especially given the age of the game and its relative esoteric and niche audience.

[h3]The Gist:[/h3]
Dungeons of Dredmor is a game that offers a lot for very little. Both in entry price as well as what's needed to run it — which is essentially negligible.

It manages to pull all this off and still be simple!
It's majority point and click so no real need to remember awkward keybinds like a lot of roguelikes. It also has a subtle underlying comedy throughout the whole game without being in your face or cringy.

what they should have done is release a DoD 2.0 with more depth, better inventory management and more monsters and I'd have paid 100€ for that.

nope. they decided to launch an idiotic doomed from the start ultra-niche game that nobody cared about even from day 0. then they made that game crap to boot.

1) I wish in addition to the flavor text for all the items and monsters, that there was a more descriptive description of what the item/monster does.  Instead of me guessing or going to an external wiki.
2) It would be much better if the items I wear actually appear on my character.  It just all looks so samey after awhile with the look of your character.  Even simplier graphical tiles of DCSS or CDDA have items show on your avatar.  This can be jarring on a modern audience really.

If you want actual balance or challenge, pass.
If you want to play melee, maybe pass.

This is a game where 90% of the enemies are melee exactly as fast as you. So the instant you get the ability to A: Turn invisible or B: teleport, you can casually walk away from any fight at all that's any threat. Up some stairs/around the corner. Press + a few times so the game is faster. And walk backwards and forwards for max hp/mp. 
Because of this, only 1 non-optional enemy in the game is any threat at all: The final one. 

With the DLC you can just take magic lawyer and silence him though, and then he's also a melee only enemy that can never actually hit you. 

Balance wise, melee v others, is so insanely bad that if you do this on an otherwise entirely melee character, he will absolutely mawl you. Nearly instant death. While taking no damage. Melee is insanely weak compared to range/magic in terms of the damage it does, riskier and requires far more investment to 'make work'.

A melee character to be decently functional needs a dozen skills at decently high levels, good gear and even then is mediocre at the absolute best. 

A magic character literally just takes the fire magic and then however much mana regen you want. You can take 0 and just walk backwards and forwards, but I'd suggest taking some to make the game faster. 

A ranged character? A maxed out melee character is better served using a ranged weapon with absolutely no skill in it v the stronger enemies. Its that insanely strong.

Even with smallest level size and fast animation.

Crafting is almost unusable and very confusing, you never get the ingredients. You never want to pick any of the crafting classes.

Nothing about the secondary systems and encounters in the dungeon is explained. Blue portals and password are always an instant death.

Regarding items and inventory, you never feel that you find good gear, most of the time it is about collecting food and bewerages for health and mana, with many different names so makes it really hard to manage inventory and find things. After second level your inventory is full, you have to drop things in a dimension for storage.

Stats are there but you do not feel they reflect in your performance against different escenarios. Too few enemies, almost all feel the same. Would be great to be able to inspect enemies stats somehow, know what we are fighting and why my build is not holding the encounter. Anyways, the system is very limited regarding customisation of items / adapting to enemy types, so little can the player do: praise the RNG lord.

Character classes are cool. Playing bankster or communist feels appealing and hilarious. However, most of the time selecting random classes becomes into a non-win combination. When you find a working combination game becomes repetitive until you find a situation in which you sudddenly die. So class combination has its limits and you need luck with gear in the run.

Humour and tone in general is ok and original, ie jokes in the crafting recipes are cool. 
However, if you are looking for a classic ambientation it may be a drawback.

Animations of enemies are really good.

Too grindy and shallow to my taste. Thumbs up because played many hours and enjoyed figuring out combinations of perks that work.

Just picked it up again for a little blast of the past. In retrospect, it's really not that good.

Its main flaws are:

1) Lack of transparency 
2) Repetitiveness & Tedium
3) Crafting & Inventory Management

Going into detail:

1) Lack of transparency:
The game doesn't explain its mechanics and there's no way to read them up online. I'd like to know how chance to hit, dodge, block, counterattack and so on works and how the mechanics interact with each other, but the only thing the game tells you is (literally) ""bigger numbers good"". Cool.
The skills also don't tell you clearly what they do, they just have reddit tier meme descriptions. 
When I play roguelikes I want to make decisions what to level up and what to equip based on my understanding of the mechanics, just wearing stuff with big fucking numbers and picking cool sounding skills just doesn't cut it for me.
Oh yeah, the game also doesn't really have an exhaustive combat log, so good luck figuring out what the fuck is even going on while you're playing.

2) Repetitiveness & Tedium:
There's not a whole lot to do and see in DoD. Even with quadruple speed animations and the smaller floors option enabled, the game quickly becomes a chore starting at around floor 3. You kinda explore the floor, dodge or disarm traps, clap the occasional monster and stumble upon a monster zoo that just contains around 50 or so monsters. Very fun for the first time, alright the second time, makes you want to Alt+F4 the third time.
There's not a whole lot of enemy variety, they mostly just look different while moving next to you to hit you. Bosses are just stronger regular mobs.
Oh, and there's also no rest button, so you have to continously eat food and press ""digest"" to fast forward while regening 1hp per turn. Even if you have natural hp regen the game doesn't offer you a way to rest, it forces you to spam space or eat food. Why? Does this really add so much challenge?

3) Crafting & Inventory Management:
There are a lot of crafting tools and skills in DoD and they're extremely confusing. There's no good way to stash your crafting reagents and the crafting interface is so bad (I mean it, probably the worst I've ever seen) that I wonder how anyone could even bother with crafting. If you pick up everything (as you do as a new player), you'll very soon find your inventory to be clogged. I could go in great detail here but I don't want to bother, just know that inventory management is atrocious and will take way too much time.

You are a hero entering a dungeon to stop the rising of the lich Dredmor.  Explore.  Kill monsters.  Make new things.  Defeat Dredmor.

This game is more roguelike than many other games called ""roguelike"".  It is a dungeon crawl, with turn-based movement for you and monsters, with procedurally generated levels.  There's loot to find, things to craft from available supplies, skills to master, side quests to complete and an overarching objective.  There isn't quite a ""return to town"" functionality, but there's a private room you can gain access to where you can store your excess stuff, do crafting and the like.

When you generate your character, you have a large number of skills to choose from: weapon-oriented skills that let you specialize your combat, crafting skills that give you access to better recipes, more esoteric skills such as golem creation and mushroom finding, and even more esoteric skills such as Paranormal Investigator, Pirate and Tourist.  Each skill has a track you can spend skill points to advance along, which gives you new abilities.

It's simple, somewhat violent fun.  Be all you can be, so that when you finally get to the bottom of the dungeon you're prepared to kick lich butt.  I got it through HB, but the current store price of $4.99 is more than reasonable.

Dungeons of Dredmor is an incredible roguelike.  It's a liiiiittle buggy, but sometimes that bugginess is part of the charm.  Other times you get stuck in geometry by accident and crash to desktop.  It's a SOMEWHAT stable game, but it does sometimes hardlock, so make sure you save frequently(I recommend right before and after heading down a floor).

the classes are varied and creative, with literally over four dozen different skill trees to choose from, you pick seven and head off to your likely rapid doom.  Most skill trees have viability, there's very few out and out stinkers, and even then those can be propped up by better skills or even buoy good skills into amazing skills when combo'd together.  

the humor is top notch, it's slapstick and absurd, with some biting wit and extremely sarcastic and beaten-down enemies who spout one-liners at you upon aggroing.  One of my favorites is, say, busting down a door and revealing a Diggle who says ""only two more days until I can retire"" as it charges at you, or ""Strength in numbers, boys, strength in numbers"" or ""what, you again?"".  The equipment is often referential and ridiculous, with flavor text often alluding to silly things like the Dwarven Plasticsmiths.  I really love the earnest humor of the game, and the often ridiculous enemies like crabs who wear knight armor, eldritch potatos, and diggles who have spent way too much time at the gym are a regular occurence.

again, I love this game's humor: https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/391049170413542381/65D62805CEC02C489C3A3EF772F2C55163DB9B8B/

the combat is turn-based, you take a step or perform an action, so does everything else.  This lets you think out your next moves and plan around movement patterns of enemies, but like chess can also quickly put you into checkmate if you're too hasty.  And you WILL die.  A lot.  Much like every classic roguelike in the vein of Rogue or Nethack, the game is out to get you, and make sure you know it.  Drink from a magical fountain and you might find a shiny ring in the bowl, or you might be drinking acid and melt to death in two turns.  Think you can take that boss-class enemy from a prior level?  surprise, it's corrupted your equipment and now you're suddenly slower than everything and it two-shots you.  Playing cleverly and safely is often the way to go, but fast and loose can get you through a run much quicker at a much greater risk.  Attacking a shopkeep might let you loot the shops of all the possibly-insane loot they have, but it also incurs the wrath of a boss-class monster who summons infinite, extremely strong minions that can easily overwhelm you with numbers.

Death in Dungeons of Dredmor is often frustrating, but tends to teach you something each time.  Don't kick a door when you're at one health or you might stub your toe and die.  Don't open a door without an escape route or a Monster Zoo behind that door with 100+ monsters crammed in it might overflow into where you are and completely engulf you.  Don't assume that you'll always waltz unscathed over that Acid Arrow Trap trigger with your heightened trap sense ability and never set it off.  Again, hubris is one's greatest enemy in this game.

Beating the game is fairly uneventful, you fight an insanely tough boss and then get an end screen.  It's a small game made by a small group of people(who have long since vanished since the studio blew up ages ago), so the cracks do show occasionally.  But I love the rough, silly artstyle and the jank.  I've beaten it countless times and had a blast almost every time, once you get the hang of things try hitting Random at the generation screen and see how far you can make it with a random build, it can get pretty ridiculous.

The DLC is generally good and tends to add a lot of variety.  Realm of the Diggle Gods adds 5 more floors which are a little bit samey but I still like them.  Conquest of the Wizardlands adds further shenanigans in the forum of alternate dimensions, which can be fairly mundane and crappy, but can also have lots of ridiculous items and hidden alcoves, it also adds a storage dimension where you can toss all your crap.  The bundle package for DoD is 7 bucks, and is an incredible bargain for this amazing roguelike.

The sense of humor, interesting and unique skills, and reasonable number of floors got my attention.
The thing is, the game doesn't tell you what the skills do, making character building impossible without consulting the wiki. Leveling up a skill is vital to increasing your main stats, and it doesn't tell you what they will level. Stats are labeled only with miniscule icons. Difficulty spikes and cheap shots abound (in a game with permadeath, where it took me almost 10 hours to reach the 15th and final floor! Fortunately, you can turn it off and the worst that will happen is the game will crash when you try to load your save). Any door could be a monster zoo containing hundreds of enemies (no joke, triple digits). It crashes a lot, costing you progress. Regenerating health takes forever unless you have a great regeneration stat, not to mention the carpal tunnel potential that ensues when you have to mash the spacebar to pass even a single turn (unless you use food and click the digest button, which heals maybe a sliver of health).

Also, the communism skill tree (amazing first skill aside) is a liability that probably should never be used. You'd think the power of memes would be worthwhile, but no. Whenever you're in a fight, a freezing cloud could show up- and it affects YOU. Said cloud is impossible to escape unscathed without some kind of movement/teleportation skill, and this happens too frequently for my lifesaving leap skill to even come off cooldown.

Anyway, I'm savescumming the final boss now because I'm not sure how much more of this I can handle. I'm only bothering to finish it because there's just enough good in here that I'd feel empty for the evening if I gave up.

The achievement for having the game crash, (and yes, they really did put in an achievement for that), is the 8th most achieved achievement in the game, out of 122 achievements. This issue is made all the worse due to the fact that the crashing will sometimes cause your save files to corrupt/disappear, unless you manually edit the games config file to disable steam cloud saving. The game is 9 years old now, and from what I understand, the engine it was made in is now 11 years old, as of writing this review. As a result, there’s a very tangible aged quality of the game, and that’s not just in reference to the outdated humor and pop-culture references.

The problem is that after a while the game just doesn't feel like it has a real drive, that is a sort of tension.

Often its not that difficult, you just sometimes die rather suddenly.

So i can only recommend it if you have played it from somewhere else before this and want to relive old times again, when you have a sort of history with it.

Very moderately priced (so much so that there's really no harm in trying if this game suits one's taste). Cutesy graphics. A lot of variations for character creation. Mod support.

CONS: 
Very clumsy UI (so bad it can get you killed with accidentally wasted turns). It is not possible to play solely with keyboard or mouse, some actions require one and some the other. Dungeons are repetitive and get boring quickly (layout of the floor maps vary from game to game, but the dungeon level specific themes, monster types and general content seem to be always the same). Traps are marked with the same golden sparkle as treasures (!), resulting in unhappy accidents. 

There is a mini map (yay), but it cannot be used for setting waypoints, which would make moving to off-screen areas much easier and faster. Dungeons are also chock-full of teleportation devices, some areas can only be reached via them, and they often don't return you to your original location, resulting in an arduous and annoying mapping process. 

Pieces of equipment typically affect various stats in a myriad of ways, making it hard to figure out which ones are most beneficial. There's WAY too much junk (gazillion different items for healing, mana replenishment, buffs, trading, to be used in crafting etc., while carrying capacity is limited -- even with the inventive ""pocket dimension"", inventory management soon becomes an unbearable nuisance). 

Music is irritating and repetitive (but can thankfully be turned off). I found the game's all-encompassing. rather asinine humour more alienating than amusing, your mileage may vary.

A great rougelike with a ton of different skills and abilities that make every run unique and interesting. One run you might pick every crafting skill and simply brute-force your way through problems with your amazing equipment but lack of stats, inate combat capability or abilities. The next you pick shields, heavy armour and dual weilding, find two of the biggest shields you can and slowly waddle your way to victory in your equipment that more resembles a slightly portable bunker than actual armour. The third run you pick vampiracy, bloodmancy and viking wizardry and become the doom marine, ripping and tearing through everything.

That is another strong suite of this game, the comedic edge. While you have your bog standard skills like swords and axe that make you better with guess what? Swords and axes, you also have fun and weird choices like Communist that while not giving bonuses to not eating gives you cold resistance and buff-debuff abilities and passives themed around communism, like real-socialism that drains gold every turn. Some other interesting examples are: Emomancy where you deal but also become more vunerable to existential dammage. Archaeology that is more or less just an Indiana Jones refference with a bunch of skills to muck around with artifact items and Killer Vegan that has huge stat buffs but penalises attacking animals and eating meat. While it isn't the height of comedy, it isn't in your face all the time and there is a good game to fall back on when the skills lose their luster.

The modding community is quite good as well, I haven't taken part in it for several years now but when I left there was plenty of new stuff to mess around with so even if everything ended the day I stopped playing and modding you would have a pretty big backlog.

There are some problems with the game, some skills are definetly worse choices than others and due to the game being decently hard you will gravitate towards the better options and ignoring some of the dead-ends. The studio also is no more so if you have a technical problem don't expect it to be fixed... ever.

At the start you get to choose 7 different skill paths (from 36 - 60, depending on dlcs), and this will constitute your character. This gives each playthrough some variety, since they really change how the game plays. However, the dungeons themselves, as well as the monsters, get old after a while.

The game does a good job of teaching how to play and presenting information, at least compared to most other roguelikes. There is no identify mechanic; the game outright tells you what each item does, for the most part (potions, mushrooms and skills have some effects only show up when you use them, but that is easily done). This makes it easier to pick up and play without having to do a ton of research.

The graphics are ok, and the music is good, but very repetitive.

The core mechanics and gameplay are solid and easy to pick up, but with a variety of difficulty options and massive array of skill combinations you can make the game as accessible or unforgiving as you want. Top that with loads of items and your classic procedural roguelike dungeons and you get basically endless replay value.

The workshop also has loads of extra content to play, if you ever get tired of the base game options.

Audiovisually the game nails it for me. Compared to classic roguelikes, there is a lot of detail - however not everything that happens is visually represented, giving your imagination an opportunity to immerse yourself in the world. That being said, the world is not - and isn't meant to be - very immersive. Everything about the world is built with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. You will find (now dated) memes and references to all kinds of pop culture. This works for me, and I find the game to be a perfect mix of light-hearted fun and hardcore roguelike action.

⚠️NUNCA ENCRUST 2X ⚠️
Não Encrust o mesmo equipamento duas vezes, isso acabará com seu personagem. Você será amaldiçoado pela Haematic Drain, perderá HP total, HP regen, etc. Ou seja, vai fodar-se seu jogo e terá que começar novamente! É neste jogo você aprende errando! 
⚠️ NUNCA ENCRUST 2X⚠️

O melhor Roguelike que já joguei desde 2014 ♥ Fiz questão de compra-lo em 2020 e prestigiar os criadores. Parabéns Gaslamp ♥

Storage: 
- Encontre um lugar de fácil acesso ida/volta e deixe seus itens lá, salve o jogo e saía dele tranquilamente. Quando você continuar, eles estarão lá! Os itens da loja não resetam. Sugestão é usar a Portal Dimension room, por que lá você poderá ir/voltar para qualquer Floor.

Prós:
- OST do jogo incrível, tenho salva em minha playlist de ost.
- Diversão e desafio garantidos com Sistema de Criação de Mapas aleatório.
- Gráficos 2D lindos.
- Build Skill incríveis e divertidas.
- Dificuldade desafiadora.
- Farm de Craft é difícil. O sistema de craft exige mais do que um casual player.

Contras:
- Nenhum! Nenhum mesmo! Vale cada $ gasto!

Gaslamp
- Função de Print Screen pela Steam não funciona.
- Função de Painel pela Steam não funciona.

Sugestão de melhorias:
- É possível multiplayer?
- Melhorar a navegação pelo teclado na Aba de Craft. É chato clicar no mouse.
- Um Baú ajudaria bastante ao guardar itens, com filtro de itens e talz.
- Pesquisar itens na Aba de Craft ajudaria demais.",1581227840,1583219521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At the beginning, you need to pick 7 skill trees that you will be able to progress in throughout the game, stuff like ""dodge"" or ""axes"" or ""pyromancy"", which allows for a lot of potential combos. It can be expected that some builds are stronger than others, and you can get to the final boss with practically any build if you don't do obviously stupid things like jumping in the middle of monster zoo.
However, to actually kill Dredmor, you simply must use one of the few exploits - and they must be planned for from the beginning of the game.

So if you made an all-melee build, for example - you're dead. There's no chance for victory, because Dredmor has absurdly high defenses, thousands of HP and every turn will blast you with spells for 50+ dmg. You will have about 150-200 HP at this point, so you might die before you even get close to him. 
Don't rely on healing potions, either - you need to have picked ""alchemist"" as one of your starting skills to see more than two of them during your run. Not that they will help - they heal for 30 and take up turn to drink, Dredmor blasts for 50. Oh, and he also automatically ""corrodes"" your melee weapons, making them less and less damaging.
It doesn't even matter what difficulty you play, on Easy Dredomr is as much a monster as he is on Hard. 

But if you use Pyromancer? Well, it will be a walk in the park, because you have a cheap tough summon and firewall spell that will eventually burn him to a crisp.

My cousins and I actually turned this into a yearly competition at Christmas time where we watch each other play and take turns trying to get the most points/get further down the dungeon (none of us have reached Dredmor yet), and it's really great game. 

Seriously, you can't go wrong for the price point, and the dev is a great example of how to provide excellent content while being reasonable (and honestly, maybe even selling the game a little too low in my opinion) about the pricing of their titles and expansions.",1578767058,1578767058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[*] Permament corruption mechanic - where melee attacks of some monsters add random permament stat maluses to your magic items - makes playing pure melee characters impossible.

[*] Summoning a single ally turns every single combat turn to a slog. Summoning several is even worse.
[*] Abrupt music cuts when jumping back and forth between your stash space, dungeon, and shop, can really sour you on a catchy soundtrack. And the game practically drowns you on loot.

DLCを抜きにしても40近くのスキルがあり、それらを自由に6つ組み合わせて、ゲームを進めることになります
ポリコレのため（かどうかはわかりませんが）きちんとキャラクターを男性か女性か選択できるようになっております

システムとしては基本的には、各階層をくまなく探索してアイテムや素材、お金を集め、ショップ（装備のみ販売）で必要ないものを売り
各所で設置されている、自販機等でほしいものがあれば買い、また敵を倒してレベルアップで自身のスキルを強化していくことになります
クラフト要素としては武器や防具、消費アイテムを作成するためのいろいろな道具やスキルがあります
もしさっさと先に進みたいのであれば、各階層をくまなく探索する必要はなく、どんどん下へ下へと潜っていくこともできます
（当たり前ですが下へ行けば行くほど、強い敵が出てくるので準備なしに下へ行くと簡単に死にます）
自身の強化としては、レベルアップごとにスキルを１つあげることができ、武器と防具といった各部装備アイテムによるステータス強化
Life回復・Mana回復・各種耐性ポーション等の消費アイテムがあります

またこういったゲームの醍醐味である、キャラクターのプレイスタイルも、完全なフィジカルモンスターや
紙耐久の魔術師といった典型的なものだけでなく
格闘メインの魔術師、状態異常やバフを使いこなす格闘家といったキャラクターでも楽しめます

プレイして感じたことは、まず1つのフロアがかなり大きく、1回のプレイで結構な時間を使います
あとは特定の武器やスキル、アイテムの組み合わせがかなり強力で
また最終ボスがそれまでの道中の敵とは、けた違いに強いことが大きく印象に残りました
一部のワンドや矢、またテレポート等のスキルが最終ボスを倒すために実質的に必須になっています

스킬 조합해가면서 어떤 조합이 제일 던전 제패하기 쉬운지(그리고 던전 보스인 Dredmor 앞으로 유저를 안전배달해서 삼턴컷 당할 수 있는지) 테스트하는 게 주요 묘미. 보스 너프좀요.
잡다구리한(그리고 대체로 무쓸모한) 아이템들의 툴팁 읽는 재미가 쏠쏠하다. 
스킬 설명이나 아이템 설명이 패러디인 게 많아서 배경 지식이 많다면 좀 더 즐길 수 있을 것.

로그라이크 중에선 쉬운 난이도. 허기가 없어서 문닫고 스페이스 눌러서 몇 턴 넘기면 체력, 마나 풀로 채울 수 있다.
꼼수로 저장파일을 딴 데 백업해두었다 죽거나 뭐 안좋은거 당했을때 백업해둔 거 불러와서 다시 할 수 있음.

한국어 OS 일 경우, 난이도 선택이 안 되어서 강제로 중간 난이도로(그리고 강제 영구적 죽음 옵션 선택으로) 진행해야 했던 버그가 있었다. 지금은 고쳐짐.
그 외 가끔 게임이 강종되는 버그 있음. 그러면 지난 저장 포인트부터 다시 해나가야 하니까 사이사이에 저장해주는 게 좋다.

Sie nehmen sich wohl nicht so ernst:
In diesem Spiel ist der Weg das Ziel und vor dem ""gar pöhsen"" Lord Dredmor zu sterben ist keine Schande...es ist sogar gewollt.
Okay...die ""zufälligen"" Dungeons kommen einem nach zehn Durchläufen ein wenig bekannt vor; nur : man hat bis dahin zehn Durchläufe mit einem guten Spielgefühl hingelegt...und ist mit seiner Skillung halt gescheitert...der Tourist mit Diebstahl und Feuermagie macht sich halt nicht so lange ;) 
Talentbaummöglichkeiten und Kombinationen: UNENDLICH!
Und der Dungeon wird dir zeigen ob dein spezieller Liebling durchkommt...wenn nicht....GLÜCKWUNSCH!!! Sie sind gestorben!!
Leider begreift man den ganzen Witz nur, wenn man recht gut Englisch kann...einziger Wehrmutstropfen...ansonsten ein sehr guter Dungeon Crawler der alten Schule den man durchrushen kann...oder bis in Kleinigkeiten plant ""Nkay, wenn mir DER Gegener jetzt mit Feuer kommt und ich eh grad die Eiswaffe überhabe, warum versuche ich nicht mal...""
Und von seinem Witz, und dem ""Versuch und Irrtum (SEHR HÄUFIG Irrtum)"" lebt dies Spiel...und hat mich bisher begeistert...und wird es auch weiterhin, denn immer wenn es mir genug wurde kommt der Moment, wo plötzlich so ein Diggle vor seinem geistigen Auge auftaucht und raunt :"" Du hast dem Übermeister noch nicht besiegt...oder hast du?!""

DoD is ridiculous. The sheer amount of customization deserves a mention, even if some of the trees are of limited applicability.

There are a lot of other stupid things, like if you want not to waste your lockpicks on stupid doors, (because there are no advantages at all to lockpick doors, since you can break them), you must drop your lockpicks for every single fucking locked door.

Now it's much easier to play random skillsets and make it deeper into the game and I love it.

That being said, what stands out to me the most right now, and the reason I'm launching the game while at work is for the music. I don't get tired of it. Just enough to notice it's there, without being so overwhelming that I can't focus on other tasks. There's tracks to think, there's tracks to feel pressure rising and there's tracks to calm.

Everything I need in a day.

For the gameplay, it's solid. Even after all these years its unique humor and interesting skill passives make it great to play around with. Go for something balanced, or go all in with a certain gimmick, either way, if you don't plan well you're likely to die.

I definitely like the fact that there's the option for permadeath on or off. I now play with it always on because it's not as rough to start out as it used to. That being said, being able to reload a save and correct a mistake or misstep is always welcome when learning the game.

If you're looking for a decent roguelike that doesn't take itself too seriously you can't beat this one, at this price-point. Buy it for yourself or your friend and share the hilarious ways you die, the close encounters, the cheating monsters, and of course the lutefisk.

This is probably one of the most traditionally roguelike-roguelikes on steam, and it doesn't even force permadeath. (honestly permadeath now just feels like a tool for lazy developers, but I digress)

What IS important is this game is a step in video game history, a minor one, but albeit an important one, this was probably one of the first commercial, accessible roguelikes to ever get any kind of attention. Nowadays with way too many of these out there, and none of them traditional or fun, it may be hard to see the appeal or understand how anyone thought the ""lolrandom"" skill system and humor was endearing, 
But this was 2011. Back then, mouse usage and such a slick and user friendly interface was incredibly rare for games like this, let alone anything resembling sprites or an appealing artstyle. 

Back then, Brogue had just started development 2 years earlier and hadn't caught on, Tales of Maj'Eyal wouldn't get released until the following year, and on that, this game ran on netbooks and drove itself under the same impulses as Diablo, a game everyone was familiar with.

I decided to beat it anyway on the ""fast"" mode. After the second level, I couldn't tell a difference between the ""fast"" mode and the normal mode. It just has floors of monsters, and the boss rooms are always a hoard of mobs, which takes forever to kill but still isn't challenging. I eventually got so bored I started skipping floors. I ended up skipping 3/10 floors, wrecked the zoo room on floor 10, and then got literally one hit by lich Dredmor, when he was supposed to be feared and running away. I don't feel like grinding for another 12 hours to have another shot at Dredmor, so I guess I'll never beat this game. *shrug*

The game would also benefit from more polish. It's hard to tell what areas of the map are unexplored. You can't use mouse movement to walk through pets. If you mouse click a doorway, you will attempt to close the door instead of walk through it (which has gotten me killed). The food/drink mechanic is pretty annoying.

Несмотря на первоначальное скептическое отношение (особенно из-за графики), я полностью изменил к ней своё отношение, но на это потребовалось практически 8 лет. Казалось бы, нужно забыть то, что она есть в библиотеке, но нет. 2011, 2012, 2016, 2019 год… многочисленные попытки понять и полюбить проект наконец-то увенчались успехом.  
И помогли в этом:
1.	Музыка, которая оказалась пусть простой, но очень душевной. Пара треков так вообще, идеально бы подошли не рогалику или приключенческой бродилке, а например, «Космическим Рейнджерам». Музыка разная, что-то обязательно понравится.
2.	Множественные отсылки к культурным феноменам, знаменитым играм и просто каким-то глупостям. Сначала я не особо обращал на это внимание, но, когда игра навалилась на меня всем гигантским кол-вом контента, я сдался. Разработчики вложили очень много именно в этот пласт игры.

[i]…начал играть вечером, и потерял счет времени. Когда такое происходит, значит игра свою задачу выполнила.[/i]

Что же меня отпугивало от погружения и может также напугать новичка?
1.	Нельзя лениться всё читать. Игра на английском и если играть только интуитивно, то можно не разобраться в механике. Особенно это касается крафта, улучшений и т.п.
2.	Игра сложная и становится легче в процессе прохождения, только если благоволит рандом… ну или если игрок заранее посмотрел билд, который способен выжить в подземелье. Я лично билдами не пользовался… и пожалел на более поздних уровнях.
3.	Очень специфический интерфейс, который просто не доработан. Есть отличная возможность для масштабирования его элементов, но отсутствует привязка к местоположению на экране.

Советовать её сложно, так как она может затянуть не сразу. В ней есть проблемы, как плохая оптимизация, бесполезная система квестов и перегруженный интерфейс крафта. Но даже, если игру не удастся пройти, она все равно подарит удовольствие. За такую цену очень трудно найти что-то похожее и приятное.

It hits a perfect balance between a tricky dungeon with loads of dangers to learn to adapt to with a wide variety of builds and randomized drops... and learning the archaic practices needed to ascend in a tougher rogue-like like NetHack or ADOM. I was originally able to clear Going Rogue/Perma Death within ten tries just off familiarity with the genre and good practices in risk reduction. Since then I've played it on and off and eventually sat down to thoroughly clear all of the expansions, clear all of the achievements and really put the game to bed as mastered.

Dungeons of Dredmor challenges you to mix and match seven skillsets of deceptively simple complexity and to scavenge enough gear and consumables to survive the early floors. From there you polish your budding hero and carefully weather your approach through a wide variety of daunting floors, whether in a short and to the point compact mode or a full feast in the original big levels. Your best odds of success come from finding tried and true gear for various dangerous situations and to compliment your build and your many deaths will make you familiar with them all. There aren't many floors in Dredmor where you can kick your feet up and say ""absolutely nothing bad spawns here!"" Dredmor makes smart use of consistent dangers that run parallel to one another: traps are ever present and scale steadily, monsters develop nasty tricks that rarely venture into unfun and unfair territory, and ever-present surprises like set named mobs, monster zoos and That One Monster You Hate maintains consistent danger in every floor. The wonderfully balanced spread of loot keeps you pursuing that next +1 and the expansions add extra chances to jeopardize your smooth run with naked greed, as well as extra items and skillsets to keep your toolbox variety high! Of particular note is Wizardlands Pocket Dimension, offering packrats, craftsmen and rogue-like survivalists the perfect private space to unwind with some compulsive sorting. These are devs that know their audience!

This is a game where you can settle in and relax spending hours meticulously planning, clearing and leveling through one good run. Capping off the experience with grace is the final confrontation with Dredmor himself, or with the expansions the optional super-boss Vlad Digula. This game knows how to give you a finale and the last floor of Dredmor is often a nail-biting experience punctuated by the sight of that sneaky lich. This is it. Time to see if you kept up your defenses, picked up enough high value throwables and are ready to soak a few serious hits, maybe put your jukes to good use as they close in with their ""you call that min-maxed?"" game-ending melees. A perfect thrilling end to my favorite dungeon dive.

Dredmor has a sense of humor that should appeal to almost anybody, sticking to tongue-in-cheek and quirky over any chance of being in poor taste. The only legit flaw I can level against the game would be the balance of the skillsets and even then the weaker ones have a few gem skills that should have fans across the entire playerbase, and the skillset system is intelligently designed so that you can benefit from skillsets that you don't invest in! The ability to mod the game just boosts the replay value and helps patch that small hole, so what else is there to say? Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic casual rogue-like and the expansions are good value if you enjoy the base game.

這遊戲畫面有別於一般像素的地牢遊戲，很簡單的劇情，過程也沒有突發事件，就只是打怪、撿寶、煉金、鍛造，你能想到的RPG要素這裡都有。但也因為沒有穿插劇情襯托，遊戲時間久了還是有點膩。

主角身上一堆的「屬性」 設計，其相對的作用有些不太清楚，另外「技能」 說明不是很詳細，有時候搞不清它的作用。或許我不是數據帝，也懶得仔細去研究。這遊戲可能要普通難度以上才能體會吧，因為不想受虐只選了簡單模式遊玩。

因為沒太多劇情對話，沒有中文也不是難事，只有開頭一段魔王介紹；雖然推薦給喜歡刷怪尋寶玩家，但這遊戲好像沒有儲物箱設計，只能一個異次元小房間，看著在地上堆滿物品、裝備、礦石、藥水，收集真的有點傻眼無力。",1546239237,1604810537,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is first rogue like game I have played in my entire life and I simply enjoy this game! You have a huge selection of skills to choose from in which you can create some interesting specific builds and create interesting gameplay! You will die a lot in this game as the game is simply trial and error in what skills work together and which don't. However, I feel like this is simply what makes the game really enjoyable and has replay value! 

Also, the dungeon is random each time meaning the floors and monsters and the loot on the floors is completely random always giving you a different challenge each time. 

The first attempts through the dungeon I kept dying, Though I went and kept switching out skills and finally managed to find a good build.

The build I personally use is Axe, Mace, Duel Wielding, Perception( to detect traps more easily), Werediggle Curse( to go werewolf to kill multiple enemies at once), Viking Wizardry( Wizard that does electricity kind of spells),  Psionics(Make enemies go to sleep),

My overall score for this game is 8/10. It's a solid game with tons of replay value and a good rogue game for 1st timers new to rogue genre.

Like, there are roguelikes where you can turn self into a freakish mutant who drives a reinforced bus or uses convoluted crafting and deity worship systems to create incredible weapons, here it's pretty tame - although it's perfect if you're new to genre, or simply don't want your brains to melt trying to comprehend convoluted systems.

This thing looks nice, sounds fine, and has a setting which you can get a glimpse of in item tolltip descriptions, and it's mostly jokes and parodies, which is great - whole game doesn't take itself seriously, as a matter of fact. Anyways, it's pretty cliche in many ways, when it comes to activities - you scour dungeon floors, you fight monsters, and you level up to learn new skills and use equipment and other skills. There's a lot of options and interesting builds, and even more so if you get DLCs which get super cheap during sales and are worth it. And I mean it when I say interesting, where else do you get to be a multidexterous communist vampire who uses emo magicks? Or a kung fu were-bird alchemist steampunk knight? And the whole game is a bunch of goofyness like that. You gonna fight carrots and astronauts and loads and loads of diggle birds!

Another thing that's bit unfortunate? It's really combat-oriented. Like, there were many different roguelikes that diversified your activities over the years, but this one is mostly just combat and item management. Oh well, you still get a lot of options.

Go ahead, try it. Even if you're hesitant, this gets super cheap on sales, so why not grab it? Fantasic timekiller.",1544802961,1544802961,True,13,0,0.667102515697479248,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I played it for a few hours over the years, maybe around an hour each time. I play for awhile, realize I can't get into it then think about it a few years later and try again. I really just don't like this game.

Normally on a roguelike it's either already set (or you're able to change) movement to the numpad. Not in this game. I like my movement keys, food, rest and others on the numpad. I find myself using the mouse a lot in this game, which you should never have to do in a roguelike. Hell, you can't even go diagonal... WTF is up with that? In most RLs you can pick up an item and compare it to what you have equipped. Not here. (Unless I've missed something?) It seems like I have to open at least two menus to do anything. I dunno, I just hate the systems/UI. 

I will say that it is pretty funny, which is nice. That doesn't, however, excuse how bad the game is and how poorly it was designed compared to others in the genre. It is cheap, I'll give it that, but there are so many better RL experiences that you can play for free that you should save the couple dollars this game costs.

DoD is a rogue-like isometric dungeon crawler with a over the top sense of humor (literally everything is a joke) in which you create a hero and delve into the depths of Lord dredmors dungeon assembling a character by choosing 5 potential skills each 4 to 6 sub skill/spells from a massive collection of over 50 skills. Obviously this is alot of skills and abilites and opens up a vast number of possible combinations and with that come replay value; Not all of these are going to be viable and discovering combinations that work is a joy as you learn more about the systems in the game.

So what does the game do to earn a thumbs down from me? Well its the jokes. The game is packed with humor, every item description, monster, and plaque you find has some sort of joke on it, alot of them will make you chuckle, so whats bad? Well your stats and gear are also jokes and it just makes things a pain, rather than conveying information clearly the game is squeezing in another joke that just creates a hurdle to understanding the games systems (of which there are quite a few) and this is especially annoying as there are already so many jokes they really didn't need any more and the game would of been better for for it.

On top of that theres the horrible UI design, its tiny and difficult to read, it doesn't scale and is actually too small to fit in all the relevant information (if your character has more damage types or resistance types than can fit on the UI it literally tapes an extra box onto the side of the UI, like a loose box attached with tape, it looks bad) and on top of that all the relevant stats are represented by (tiny) icons; instead of just clearly stating on an item gives +5 fire damge +1 cold resist you instead have a square or a circle with little symbols, so instead of stats you have a set of tiny icons, (many of which look similar to each other) and need to open your character sheet to mouse over all the icons there (can't do it on the item) and match them up to know what they do (remembering that alot of them have joke descriptions that make this worse still).

I've beaten the game on the highest difficulty and it was a even after the time I spent with DoD I still couldn't remember what those symbols meant, it was a constant pain in the a*** as I tried to get seriously into the higher tier content the game has to offer and is a prime example of bad UI design. Its not game breaking, you can still play at a high level despite this, but the game is much more enjoyable played casually and you'll probably enjoy it if you just jump in for occasional quick dungeon crawl.

TLDR, if you want something to just jump into between other game DoD will provide you with many hours of good times and maybe the occassional chuckle, but the design seems to fight against you diving deeper into depths that are totally there with jokes taking precedence over cleary conveying information to player, meaning its a pain to get deep into.",1541329660,1541330128,False,14,3,0.579291105270385742,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A simple but highly addictive Rogue-Like. 
Over 50 different class choices with each class containing a sub set of four to six skills.
At the start of the character creation screen you are asked to choose five out of fifty one classes to mold the character that you will be dungeon crawling with. Awesome idea.

Sadly you can not change the looks of your character in anyway shape or form. 
And the characters appearance leaves little to be desired.
Gear that you pick up such as swords, shields, armor, etc... 
Do not show up visually either, which really sucks. 
I'm not really fond of the art style either. 

That being be said something about this game keeps me coming back for more.
Maybe because it has great difficulty options and I always crank those up to the hardest setting so the game
Play is consistently challenging / entertaining.
Or maybe it is the HUGE amount of choices you have for creating your character.

Some absurd choices
And 
Some very unique choices.

The amount of class options alone makes it well worth the price, you throw mods into the mix and there are no limits to class options. With the right skill set / research you could even create your own class mod.
If creating mods is not your thing, no worries. There is massive list of downloadable characters.
One of the benefits of older games.

Alright 
lets get to it.


[h1] Pros [/h1]

[*] Huge list of class / ability options. Including Magic and Melee of course.
[*] Humorous description text.
[*] Storage isn't a issue thanks to the alternate dimension storage room.
[*] Has crafting Classes, Blacksmith, Alchemy, etc.
[*] Can be rather challenging with settings cranked up.
[*] Turn based combat.
[*] Loot / loot chests.
[*] Mini quests.
[*] Alternate realms AKA the Diggle realm. You'll want to be extremely careful in this realm.
[*] Perma Death option (my favorite)
[*] A Score system to determine how well you did.
[*] Decent variety of items that have + X bonus to stats.
[*] Character stats: Str, Dex, Mana, etc.
[*] Mini bosses RNG can really F*** you here if you are not careful.
[*] Mods of all kinds: Character, item, New rooms, Classes / abilities.
[*] Random spawning shop keeper.
[*] Replay Value



[h1] Cons [/h1]
[*] Straight forward A.I.
[*] Can get repetitive.
[*] Arts not that great.
[*] Can't change character looks.
[*] Gear doesn't show up when you wear it.
[*] Shop having nothing but trash too often.
[*] No story


[b] The Verdict [/b]

There is nothing mind blowing about Dungeons of Dredmor but it has enough going for it to still be pretty fun to play. 
So many class options make for some truly unique play styles. And just messing around with those options could add
a great deal of re-play value.

I recommend buying the game on sale. 
Lots of new Rogue Likes coming out that are putting far more overall effort into their title which really begins to show Dungeon of Dredmors age. 
On sale though, totally worth it.

* Genuinely good humor nearly everywhere.
* Lots of classes that play differently. Since you mix-and-match several classes each run that means a lot of combinations.
* Fairly deep crafting system, if you take a crafting class.
* Good modding community with even more unique, funny classes to play as. Mods are well-integrated.

Cons:
* Very little variety in threats. Almost all enemies just charge into melee with the occasional one that shoots ranged magic while approaching. All have the same AI. You can usually ignore elemental weaknesses/resistances if you want. The only time you'll be engaging more than a couple foes at a time is one room per level which is huge and stuffed with monsters (which you can clear with area spells or run away).
* If you actually use the crafting system, you'll quickly run out of inventory space and it will become a drag.

Your time really disappears playing this game since it is very hard to put down. It feels like one of the best RPGs out there, especially for the price. The customization is insane and you can find synergies that can give you dozens of unique runs. Most of the skills are useful and it's easy to see which ones would be a compliment to your build. You are not intended to win and you get a great challenge as you try to make your way down the dungeon. The humor and easter eggs are really top notch, be sure to read all the tooltips for anything you can hover your mouse over. 

[h1]Complaints[/h1]
Depending on your playstyle, a full Dredmor run can take a very long time to complete. There is an option to reduce the amount of floors, but it can come at a cost of more loot, but the full version of the dungeons can take three times longer to complete. This might be more of a ""me"" issue, but I like to explore every corner for items. The length isn't a bad thing, but it does suck when you spend hours on a run to die accidentally and lose your progress, whether it be a long time since you last saved or losing a whole permadeath run. 

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
Dredmor has many ways to play and your starting skills are always chosen by you. Because of this, Dredmor offers unlimited playability by simply being able to change your build each time. Even if you repeat a build you used previously, you will find that the dungeons are randomly generated and you may find different loot as you dive deeper. 

[h1]Extra Content[/h1]
There are currently three expansions for Dredmor, one that comes for free and the other two are bought normally. They add more skills to chose from (most of them are quite powerful additions), more items to craft and loot, more floors to go down and an addition of the pocket portal which adds more mini dungeons and a place to store your items in a pinch. They are very much worth it if you enjoyed the base game. 

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
There are a couple of broken achievements that require either SAM or a Workshop mod to fix. The Devs are no longer in business and the game has stopped getting updates for some time. I believe the only mod that is currently broken is the ""Craft 500 wands"" achievement. I used the Workshop mod for this. Getting the full 100% does require playing a Permadeath run with the hardest difficulty, and this proved to be a very hard achievement to acquire due to the damage of traps and enemies. If you don't have the stomach to grind it out, Dredmor can be a rough game to 100%.

[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]
The game does not feature many technical options and has not been adapted for higher resolutions. It's not uncommon to have a super tiny UI when playing on 1080p or higher. If you play on a high resolution, the best you can do is click the tiny box on the corner of a UI element to increase it's size. This can be done for the skill bar, inventory and map. 

[h1]Value[/h1]
While the base game is $5, for $2 more you can get the full edition which is very worth it. Dredmor is a very deep game mechanically and it comes with a couple hundred hours of playtime. It's very much worth the price if you like classic rougelikes. I can't recommend it enough!

Essentialy, this is a roguelike that relies heavily on referential humor and old-school charm,, while giving you great music and nice graphics.  At it's core, it's a fairly deep game with lots of interesting mechanics, none of which you absolutely HAVE to use, and character loadouts with enough variety to make almost any playstyle viable with enough skill.  There's also sliding scales of difficulty and complexity (You can make the floors of the dungeon smaller, while XP gains for a faster, more streamlined experience), and DLC expansion that actually add quite a lot.

The only negatives really are glitches (there's an achievement for crashing the game) and the ones that are inherant to roguelikes, such as it being absolutely unforgiving.  Despite each new game starting from scratch (you can never unlock things to make your character stronger from the get-go), you may have quite an easy time as you slice, crush and kick your way through the first few levels, or you may die a few steps from the starting point because an above-average strength monster appeared there.  The game's layout for inventory and menus can be a bit unweildly, though you can move things around where you want them to be and resize most windows.

Also, good luck on getting all the acheivements, some of them are quite hard to get simplly because so many of them involve your character dying in weird ways (for example, if you don't have a lockpick, you can kick down a locked door, but there's a chance instead of kicking it down, you'll hurt your foot, takiing minor damage, like 1 or 2hp.  There's an acheivement for dying to this, which is pretty impossible to get, since you regenerate health naturally as you move, so you have to position yourself in front of a door while being at low enough health that hurting your foot will kill you, and then kick it, hoping the door doesn't just open.  Then, if you fail you have to get to another locked door while regenerating health, meaning you'll have to hurt yourself, but it'll be hard to not die doing that.)  There's also achievements that have been impossible to get due to changes in the game, such as filling out a skill tree that has been removed from the game.  So, if those sorts of things bother you, buy with caution.  Otherwise, great game.",1529507817,1529507817,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

(As compared to, say Nethack, where the ""fizzy potion"" could be healing one time and acid the next!)  You will, however, die a lot, so get out your favourite fantasy name-generator!  And it's turn-based, which means you can stop to think about your next move and take as long as you like.

For me, the real star of Dungeons of Dredmor is just how customizable it is.  You can pick 7 skill trees at the beginning, allows you to make almost any fantasy(ish) archtype you want!  Want a Viking barbarian?  Okay--axes, berzerking, Viking Magic, for starters.  How 'bout a straight-up D&D style thief?  Burglary (duh), Artful Dodger, Perception... Ninja?  Sure--throwing objects and martial arts.  A Jedi?  Keep the martial arts and throw in some psionics, maybe a sword or quarterstaff skill.  Wizard?  What kind ya want--dark creepy necromancer, studious crafty type, or set sh#t on fire battlemage?  We got it all.   Wanna be just a crafter?  We got that too.

OR...you can just give into the game's silliness, which at times reminds me of Kingdom of Loathing's sense of humour.  How 'bout a vegan pirate?  Vampire lawyer?  Club-wielding Communist mushroom-farmer. WHATEVER.   And each ""build"", no matter how silly, gives a distinctly different experience, making no two games the same.

What's the problem? Well, in a few words, Tales of Maj'Eyal does everything better.
I don't really see the point of playing this since Tales of Maj'Eyal is way better.
Dungeons of Dredmor isn't a bad game but Tales of Maj'Eyal is better and you could think that it would be best to play both but Tales of Maj'Eyal has infinite replayability so there is no point in playing this game.

Visually, the character equipment/clothing is always the same which shows how lazy/bad is the developer.
The game has lot of glitches/bugs.
The mouse cursor will randomly move at times, it is extremely annoying.
The game is slow in two manners, one, it feels like it plays at 20 - 25 fps and the paced is way too slow.

Music is good but honestly, you should just play Tales of Maj'Eyal instead, worth way more than this game.

5/10 - but keep in mind that i'm comparing it a lot with Tales of Maj'Eyal which is a better game but I can't get myself to not compare it and since Tales of Maj'Eyal is a better game, better spend your time on Tales of Maj'Eyal instead.

The main sort of gimmick behind DoD is that you get to pick all of your basic class skills at the start of the run (or hit random because it leads to some really interesting, unorthodox combinations). You know and can plan in advance for exactly what spells you will unlock, and what level to unlock them at. Some of the skills are balanced rather poorly, but due to the sheer amount of them (especially with the DLC), and the wide variety of gameplay offered by all of the strange synergies within the skill system is something that probably can't be properly balanced (so many skills effect others in unpredictable ways, so you get stuff like double-shield fist fighters, necromancers with high dodge and counter attack with heavy maces, or hammer + sickle dual wield communists).

It lets you move your character from tile to tile with the arrows like any other roguelike, but most things you do in the game require you to use the mouse.

There's an option to perform certain tasks, like attack enemies and open doors, with the arrow keys, but (a) it's insane that attacking enemies by walking into them isn't the default, this is a ROGUELIKE, and (b) activating items by walking into them doesn't feel natural. I accidentally activate items I don't want to. Just give me a use key.


The game description says ""Classic Roguelike gameplay with the sweet, refreshing taste of point-and-click interfaces. No longer must you press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-x to drink a potion."" But this isn't any better. It's the interface of an action RPG without the action. Just give me intuitive, well-designed menus that I can access with the keyboard, or god forbid, a controller! Being able to do most (but not all) things you need to do with the keyboard but then having to click the mouse to pick up an item, dismiss a dialog box, or access your inventory is incredibly frustrating.

I'd recommend Fatal Labyrinth over this. It's $2 cheaper, and despite coming out 2 decades earlier, it feels a lot better to play than this game. Arrow keys or D-Pad plus three buttons.

Hi folks! 
This is my review to ""Dungeons of Dredmor"" (""DOD"") . So what's this game about? 
In short, it is a classic, turn-based hack 'n' slay RPG / dungeon crawler with retro-style, pixelated graphics.

The main story is as simplistic as it is uninspired: You are the hero ( or heroine) who has to slay the evil king who is in charge of the (also evil) dungeons and you shall bring an end to its (ever-so evil) reign of evil.

In order to do that, you first decide which kind of class or class-combination you want to play. After choosing the corresponding skills, you are ready to go and you start at the first of (up to) 15 dungeon levels.

The dungeon levels of the game are arranged in a semi-random order, meaning that they are generated differently each time you play the game, though certain elements stay the same which you will recognize pretty fast.

In order to fight of your evil opponents, you can resort to melee attacks, ranged attacks with throwing or shooting weapons or you can finally resort to magic attacks of different kinds. Since - of course - the enemies get tougher with every level, you will need to look out for all kinds of loot after slaying the enemies, use the built-in crafting system or buy new stuff in the ""shops"" where you can also sell your outdated gear.

That pretty much covers the basic gameplay. Suffice it to say that the dungeon is not only covered with enemies, but also with deadly traps and some (very tiny) puzzles. You can optionally also take on side-quests which will reward you with some extra loot like a special unique weapon.
Depending on the initial difficulty setting you have chosen, you will be able to save the game and reload your save game after dying or your character will be permanently erased,  once killed. Also, you can choose whether you will be able to return to earlier levels by ""going back up"" (which helps a lot) or you will be forced to play the game ""rogue-like"" (which is much tougher).

So now let's have a closer look at the good and bad aspects of the game. Let's start with the good ones:

1) There are many classes to choose from and each class has different skills you can choose. 

2) The general mood of the game is funny. You will find a *lot* of references to other titles,  
movies, etc. etc. in the game and if you like this kind of ""nerdy humor"" (which I do), you will probably find that this is one of the best aspects of the game.

3) The crafting system is quite okay (though needlessly cumbersome to use).

4) There are a lot of mods for the game which you can use to blow some fresh wind through the dusty dungeon if you get tired of the original game.

So, why did I not recommend this game, you might ask?
So let's look at the things I did not like about this game:

1) The game is extremely repetitive. I know - that is to be expected for a turn-based game and I do not mind that, but combined with the fact that most of the time the full extent of ""strategy"" you have to use to overcome your enemies is just to click on them for a melee attack, that gets boring way too fast.

2) If you want to play the game on a higher difficulty level, be warned: Once permanent death is turned on, it can get very frustrating. Although the general difficulty seems to be okay, you sometimes end up being killed ""out of the blue"" after playing straight for hours without ever losing more than a quarter of your health points before. The problem is that once you get to realize you are in trouble this time, it is almost too late. If you chose a sub-optimal combination of classes and skills, you will not be able to run away from the fight and will simply be battered to death by your enemies. Yes, you could argue that this is only a problem if you play on higher difficulty settings, but it is also worth to consider this when looking at the next point:

3) A single ""run"" thought the dungeon (at 15 levels) takes way too long - especially when playing this game rogue-like. If you are playing carefully (mind pain point 2) and you collect a lot of loot, then you are in for a lot of tedious inventory management and walking back and forth. A complete run at lower difficulties may cost you up to 20 hours, not to mention higher difficulty settings. So now imagine your frustration of carefully grinding for 20 or even more hours just to fall victim to a stupid trap + enemy combination...

4) A lot of the in-game mechanics are not explained very well or are not explained at all (also not in the tutorial). This can lead to very frustrating moments in the game when you have just activated a new skill (with just an ominous explanation text to it which gives no real clue on what it truly does) and then finally realize that you do not know how to use it. The game gives you no kind of explanation or hints whatsoever.  I played one run with rogue-class, buying a skill which seemingly ""revealed all hidden items"" which never had any kind of effect during may play-through at all, although it was activated. This pain point might sound trivial, but if you choose the wrong classes / skills, your ""hero"" will be pathetic up to the bitter end.

5) There is no real skill tree. Skills of one category can only be activated linearly, meaning you cannot activate the last skill in the ""tree"" without having activated all others first. The problem is that many skills sound much better than they actually are, and - which is even more unnerving - you sometimes have to activate three or even four useless skills just to get a decent one.

6) The final boss / bosses of the game can be very challenging if you do not prepare for the final fight from the very start. I will not spoil this for you, but suffice it to say that some classes will have a *very* hard time beating the boss, even if they have been maxed out. Also suffice it to say that the final boss can deal out a lot of more damage with single hits than any other enemy can, so be warned!

7) This point weighs most heavily for me: The combat system is too simplistic. If you play with a fighter or rogue-class, then all you ever do is hack and slay. There is almost no kind of strategy whatsoever required to progress through the game as long as you collect the strongest gear and do not let yourself get surrounded by too many enemies at a time. Since all enemies behave somewhat identical with only little exceptions (some enemies can indeed use ranged attacks against you - imagine that!), that makes the game too boring way too fast.

8) (Auto-)Saving and Loading takes surprisingly long. 

9) During my 20-hour play-through, the game crashed multiple times for no apparent reason.

10) The soundtrack of the game gets boring very quickly. There are too few songs and the music is way to repetitive.

So what is the verdict?
DOD is - all in all - a mediocre game. It is not ""bad"" but it certainly isn't good or great either. It makes me wish that steam would offer a third, ""neutral"" recommendation. 
But since it doesn't, I am forced to not recommend this game. The retro-style artwork and humor of the game is good, but it cannot make up for the boring and tedious game play. In any case you should not be required to look up how skills work in a wiki to get a basic understanding of them. 

If you are heavily interested in mods, this game might be for you, after all, but I cannot really consider this fact in this review of the basic game.",1512060471,1512060555,False,11,0,0.50964653491973877,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Recently, bored of what I was playing, I decided to give DofD another try. My new first impression was that the text was way too small, so I fiddled with the resolution until it was more readable. That may have been part of the problem in my previous run- I could not see all the detail, thus did not understand much of the content.

So I restarted were I left off and made it to the final level, but Lord Dredmore just kicked my butt. That's when I really started studying up, reading  the forums and guides, learning the stats, memorizing the effects of shrooms, etc. There should be a University PhD of Dredmor for all the stuff you need to learn to be good at this game.

Os gráficos estão bem legais, o personagem principal se move, ataca, recebe danos e é atingidos pelas armadilhas. Já os monstros é um ponto negativo do jogo, não pela dificuldade ou variedade e sim pela caracterização, enfrentar monstrinhos coloridos, sem um tema definido é muito ruim e acredito que foi a unica mancada da Gaslamp (produtora do game.)
Eles são uma mescla de passarinhos coloridos, gosmas, tamagochi,  lulas, e até monstros mascarados.
Acredito que a decisão de usar monstros neste estilo, foi a premissa de humor que eles decidiram por no game, eu sou contra, acredito que o humor utilizado nos textos, falas dos monstros e até nas mensagens como por exemplo quando o personagem morre, e na tela aparece ""Congratulations! You have Died"" é um tipo de humor muito mais interessante do que trocar os tradicionais monstros dos jogos com temática fantasia medieval por monstrinhos coloridos que mais parecem exportados do desenho animado pokemon.
Já os itens, equipamentos e armas estão bem produzidos, bem variados também, assim como um jogo do gênero roguelike pede. Usando-os percebemos um UP no personagem e isso incentiva o jogador a explorar cada aposento das masmorras atrás de mais  e mais itens.
Os efeitos sonoros são muito bons, as musicas enjoam um pouco, mas não compromete, afinal tem o botão de volume, assim podemos abaixar a música do game e explorar o jogo ouvindo mp3 (assim como a maioria dos players que jogam roguelike faz).
Dungeons of Dreadmor foi uma grata surpresa, apesar dos poucos pontos negativos é divertido ao extremo e vale cada centavo. Eu não esperava um game tão puramente roguelike quando vi os screenshots.

[h1]Что это такое?[/h1]
Игра DoD предлагает вам рандомно генерируемое приключение в подземельях. Каждый раз, начиная игру заново, вы будете оказываться в новых интересных условиях. Знаете, какого слова обычно недостаёт в других подобных играх? [i]""Интересных""[/i]. Мне эта игра внешне сразу не зашла. Много текста, странная графика, шутки повсюду. Но стоило попробовать, как сразу стало понятно, что за этим стоит великолепная, очень обдуманная система — а шутки не такие уж снобские. Эта игра не сложная, но настолько глубокая, насколько можно представить, услышав слова ""случайно создаваемые приключения"".

[h1]Пять причин поиграть в DoD:[/h1]
• Огромная вариативность. Просто ""случайности"" нам неинтересны — интересно именно ощущение новизны, исследования, комбинаций разных вещей. Обычно подобные игры выдают тебе в случайном порядке три-пять однородных, скучных действий. Здесь случайные уровни создаются так, что ими даже можно любоваться. Это не скучные коридоры, въющиеся с разной длинной — это десятки комнат на одном этаже, каждая из которых действительно умудряется иметь своё лицо.
• Игра может быть очень лёгкой и очень сложной. Этот выбор вам подконтролен. Не хотите грызть гранит, но хотите приключений — пожалуйста. Хотите, чтобы комичность ситуаций доходила до абсурда, а смерть приходила минут через 10 — тоже есть.
• Действительно большой выбор механик. Да, крафтинг и рандомные комнаты только что в тетрис ещё не добавили, но от этого не начинает казаться, что у тебя интересное и разнообразное приключение. Здесь же... хотите выращивать грибы? Телепортироваться в другое, тайное измерение? Колдовать, драться без оружия? Это только то, что мне выпало при рандомном создании персонажа. Вы можете собрать всё сами или набросать себе что-то другое. И скиллы, которые я пробовал, не ощущаются как наскоро пришитая и ненужная скучная вещь. Для всего нашли своё место.
• Игра недорогая. Особенно на распродажах.
• Если есть сила воли, можно легко поиграть 15 минут, не заскучать и закрыть до следующего раза. Если депрессия или идёт игровой стрим, то играйте два часа — и, наверное, не надоест.

[h1]Минусы.[/h1]
• Без понимания английского здесь делать нечего. Игра шутит, крутит, придуряется и обучает; интуитивно разобраться было бы сложно. Есть любительский перевод части игры, я его не пробовал. Гуглил по ""Dungeons of Dreadmore перевод на русский"".
• Графика и анимация всё-таки немного утомляют. Они и недостаточно плавные, и при этом броские. Глаза немного устают на 23'' мониторе.

====

Я сильно сомневался, брать или нет — собирался возвращать. На видео мне игра сразу не понравилась. Но в итоге я выключил музыку, хорошо поиграл пару часов и понял, почему ревью на неё — Overwhelmingly Positive. Это просто настолько хорошо сделано как игра, система так хорошо работает, что трудно ей не увлечься и не любоваться.

Что-то такое я представляю себе, когда думаю о ""каждый раз разное приключение"".
По впечатлениям от первых часов: палец очень сильно вверх.

It looked like it would remind me of Chocobo's Dungeon 2.
It is kinda like that, but it's waaay too much going on at once.
The dungeons are randomized, okay that's not bad. 
The graphics aren't buggy and I found no issues with the game running.
There's no controller support, which I thought about setting up one on xpadder but it would've been worse playing that way with the layout of the controls.
Your character is a mess of a million different stats that don't make sense. You want a wizard to wield a great axe? By all means, go ahead, this game isn't gonna stop you... But if you want to use mushrooms you gotta have the skill. So inconsistant! 
Then, you constantly run into the same two monsters which drop a plethora of items so your inventory is full before you finish half the map on the first floor. Where's the pleasure in getting everything you need EVER before getting into the game?
You pray for side quests, which they make no effort to tell you anything about them, and when you finish it(if you even figure out wtf they meant), it doesn't feel very gratifying. 
There's random ""graffiti"" on the walls in which they tell you to write down somewhere because they didn't program your character to have the capacity of learned knowledge, so I wrote the ones I found down, then never found anything for which I needed them.
What is the goal, anyway? Oh, yeah, the beginning cutscene explains it in a massive paragraph that I didn't differenciate between a loading screen and plot so I missed it. I think you're going after some evil or getting treasure or something dull, I'm guessing because the game never shows any indication of explaination for anything.
There's an option for permadeath... Why would you do that to yourself? Roguelike games are made so when you have to start over, there's perks from playing before. Is the perk slowly figuring out wtf you're supposed to be doing besides killing a bunch of blobs, ducks, and bats? 
There's random stuff that constantly happens, like an anvil that when you put an item on it, it either is pleased with you and makes it better, or not and I dunno what happens because the 5 times I found the anvils, they were always pleased.
There's statues that you can break that give you a lot more exp than an actual fight... for apparently no reason ""heroic vandalism"".
There's been one monster that I ran into that was actually hurting me (and I mean like it changed my facial portrait once). I'm assuming it was a boss monster, and it gave me ten times the amount of exp than a regular monster, but nothing happened. Was it supposed to be a bigger fight for no reason?
I gained 7 levels before exiting the first floor, and in those levels, I figured out that the skill tiers felt more and more meaningless as time went on... I picked the banker atribute thinking ""Okay, money skill, must be important..."" NOPE!
There's a shop that tells you that you can pick up stuff without paying for it, then you can't even fight the shopkeeper when he ""stops"" you from leaving(He blocks the only entrance/exit to the room and you can't move past him). You also can't travel to another demension in the shop. I got stuck in the shop because I sold an item and filled his tables, but I picked up an item I didn't pay for and I dropped it on the ground but he still wouldn't move and I couldn't afford anything else to put it back on a table because I JUST STARTED and the item I sold only gave me like 10 coins. I had to restart. I later learned you could quick sell and not take up tablespace in the shop... WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO KNOW!
I tried using my get a loan skill that was in the corner of my screen, nothing happened. Still never figured out how to make that work.
I'm not going to do a pros and cons because my rant is far too long for that to even matter.
It would be great with some tutorials and a better movement system that would make you interact with something by walking into it instead of just walking into it 
i.e. if you use the arrow keys to move, you'll step on traps, but if you click on it, you can attempt to disarm the traps... WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE so if you use the arrow keys, you'll likely die from traps, leading to a TON of clicking to move, which is incredibly arduous. (PLEASE PLEASE play Chocobo's Dungeon 2 for psx, that controller layout was fantastic and it's such a better game)
OR If you find a treasure chest, or a door, you can't open them by walking itno them... The treasure chest you just walk through, and you just don't move with the door. 
Okay, this was waaaay longer than I anticipated. This game deserves a 2/10. I could see where you were going, but this feels very unfinished.

It's taken me a while to write this review - because I CAN'T STOP PLAYING.

[i] Thou art a pimple on the dungeon floor! [/i]

I used to play a dungeon based game called Larn when I should have been studying. In those days PCs only had two colours and in that game walls were portrayed using the '#' and 'U' was reserved for a creature called Umber Hulk. The little 'g' was a creature called Gelatinous Cube. I hated that guy. The whole world was built using key board characters which allowed your imagination to flourish. Cue deep romantic sigh.

30 years later we define games like Larn as part of the Roguelike genre and happily for all of us Steam has a pretty good collection.

Dungeons of Dredmor has quite a few roguelike elements. 

[i] Thine eyebrows cannot protect you this time! [/i]

Random dungeons, loot, knocking down doors, permanent death and save game wipe, cash to buy things from shops, turn based combat, funky music, a heavy eye browed hero, pointy hats, wands, an archaeologist...hmm.

Let's just say there is a lot here and some things can be turned off, like the perma-death or reduced, like game difficulty.

Another thing to note is that the game is simple to play but diabolically difficult to beat. In 200 hours I managed to beat the evil Lord Dredmor...once.

I liked the following elements:

Character creation: Choose your skills or have them randomly assigned. Concentrate on the standard Fighter, Mage, Rogue areas or just go crazy. 

[i] You do know I am at least five levels above you! [/i]

The Archaeology class includes the ability to send an artefact to the giant, secret scary government room full of boxes, and gain experience equal to its value.

The Blood Magic class includes the ability to pour your blood and soul into a secret hidden thing when you can tap when the need is greatest - or whenever you fancy a nip of forbidden sanguine juices.

It's nuts and I love it. Part of the problem in this game is figuring out what anything does. My current guy is concentrating on Polearms as his melee option and has completed the Very Long Stick Damage Enhance Training. How funny words translate to real dungeon mechanics can be a nightmare to figure out.

Graphics and Sound: It's very bright and loud. Simple stuff. Almost annoying. Deceptive because you often walk around the dungeon having a fun time then wallop! - you have one health point left.

Crafting: Look simple but pure crazy. Tinkering, Smithing, Alcheming, Pressing, Making Potioning and Wands. You can cultivate mushrooms and other fungus on dead bodies. It's almost like its own minigame. 

Monster zoo: It's a room filled with monsters. Filled to the brim. Each level from the second onwards has a zoo and behind every door that opens, might be a zoo. 

[i] We have ways of making you talk! [/i]

Panic? Yes
Ran away like a coward? Yes.
Came back and died? Yes and yes.
Tried to avoid? Yes.

The character screen itself is hideously complex. There are loads of stats defining your character and many more little symbols defining the various resistances. 

Let's just say I don't always know what things do. It's the biggest problem in the game. Behind all the fun and simple gameplay we have this nuclear physicist busting a gut working through all sorts of complex formula and statistics. The game is almost bursting through its seams.

[i] You walk like an undead turkey! [/i]

And I love it.

I also recommend Don't Starve and Dungeon of the Endless.

This game is definitely a wonderful surprise.

Pros:
- Tons of Replay Value
- Simple Yet Difficult
- Options for Higher Difficulty
- Hundreds of Skill combinations in Character Development
- Can See a list of your past Explorers to remember the best of your best
- Expansions

O jogo em si é muito bom. Um magnífico exemplo de jogos Roguelike e RPG. Muito fiel à esses gêneros.

Inimigos bem diversificados, alguns exclusivos de cada nível (ou andar, como você quiser chamar). Você só tem que tomar cuidado com [b]OS MONSTERS ZOO[/b] e alguns inimigos fortes demais para você, [spoiler]Como os que você pode encontrar usando os Endereços Arcanos.[/spoiler]

A customização de personagens é algo muito interessante no jogo, já que há várias possibilidades de combinações. Algo que é quase obrigatório em um jogo de RPG.

Algo muito bom que Dungeons of Dredmor traz é a possibilidade de uso de mods. Ele tem integração à Steam Workshop, o que torna o jogo mais diversificado do que já é. Os mods podem trazer tanto skills novas quanto monstros. Isso depende muito de qual mod você usar.

[h1] PREÇO [/h1]

- Saving
- Extremely difficult final boss--even on the easiest difficulty

Cons:
- Some of the skills are weak, and if you don't pick some of the good skills you are severely handicapped.
- Speed is either to slow or fast
- If your player noticed a trap, they should auto try to disarm when moving, stop movement, or prompt you to proceed
- Resolution makes it hard to tell icons and read text--this may be solve if playing on a 32"" monitor, however, a 15"" laptop screen is challenging
- The use of chokes makes it way easier, however, a bit boring
- The controls just feel weird
- Crafting is a pain--you can only craft 1 highlighted item, not select anything on the screen

So here's how the game works.  You start out on a somewhat massive floor that's been randomly generated and filled with monsters.  Every time you click or move a square, you'll use a turn.  The gameplay somewhat resembles Diablo 2, but the developer went nuts and made the whole interface a mess.  You custom generate a character with something like 6 skills you choose.  Every time you advance a level, you can improve one of these skills.  

Here's where things turn into a mess.  The character sheet has something like 30-50 stats that you can increase.  You have no idea what 90% of them do, but every item or skill will improve or lower several of them.  The major difference between this and Diablo 2 is that Diablo 2 stopped at 4 resistances and 5-6 stats.  Dungeons of Dredmore has 50 and it bundles them altogether in one cramped section that gives you a headache just looking at it.  

Because of what I mentioned above, the skill system is completely meaningless. I have no idea what would be a good thing to level up. Unless I spend an hour deciphering the stat screen, which I don't plan to do.  

Same problem with items.  I just find the most expensive item and equip it...  I have no idea what is ""good"" in this game.  

Another problem is the flavorless monotony that is the gameplay.  You are dropped into the middle of a floor full of monsters and have to clear it.  Then you go onto the next floor and do the same thing.  Then the next and the next.  In Diablo 2 they had some storyline to break up the monster killing.  Stories about this horrible monster and that horrible monster.  However, Dungeons of Dredmor has NONE of that.  Just one floor of monsters after the next.  

On a technical note, when you start the game for the first time, the game will let you set whatever resolution you like including ones WAY OVER your monitor's capibility.  If you do this, the buttons at the top of the screen won't be visible and you'll be stuck at the main menu until you fix the resolution.",1504652087,1504652087,False,8,4,0.337676703929901123,16,True,False,False,False,,,

笔者游戏时间远估计在100小时左右，steam上是补正后的时间~这个游戏时间可能是笔者这种20年游戏年龄中很少达到的，毕竟玩过的游戏太多，所以大部分游戏的吸引力不足。由此可见这款游戏的魅力！
鉴于如此好游戏的推广度太低，决定写点东西。相关百度贴吧已经无人打理了。
入门这些东西就不赘述了。多死两次就晓得~（笑）

刚刚用一个魔武build（BUFF物理近战）人物通关。
核心在于双持dual配合维京viking+埃及Egpyptian的BUFF技能，其实就是Viking的1，5技能以及Egpyptian的5,6技能配合以及增强双持的高伤害。尤其埃及的6技能，虽然没太搞清楚机制，但是明显使得近战攻击具有大范围伤害。再次就是发现维京的4技能，BUG一样的存在。
这次通关笔者感觉加点顺序有问题，（由于考虑到耗蓝问题，所以埃及的最后一个技能出的太晚），导致前期就是个近战，没有群攻技能。所以打算这次调整搭配，再来一次，看看前期出埃及的最后一个技能的效果如何。
P.S.维京的4技能简直就是BUG的存在，不清楚其作用机制是不是与力量属性挂钩。反正笔者用它几乎没有怪物能抵抗其恐惧效果的（眩晕效果不明显），尤其大家关心的BOSS，最多吼两声，BOSS就开始跑，跟着其到墙角，就任您蹂躏了，当然，记得插几下就再吼两声接着插~（笑）。",1503441166,1503441623,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The humor is amusing for awhile and trying out all the ability choices is fun and trying to see how far you can get is also fun.

It's fun enough to justify buying the game in fact. Buuut I do have some criticisms.

So the gameplay itself seems to take a long time. You can increase the speed of the game but it makes you very vulnerabile to stepping on traps. This means if you are playing non-tanky classes or non-thief classes you will need to constantly throttle the speed so you can progress faster and still stay safe from traps.

There is a shorter dungeons option but it's not as good as it seems. They seem to add a lot more monster zoos to compensate for the lack of dungeon space to space out the monster spawns and give you enough experience points. But after doing your 10th monster zoo this way it starts to feel repetitive.

Lastly, there's the skill descriptions. They are funny and all but when you replace actually telling us what something does with just 'humorous descriptions' that don't tell us anything it becomes frustrating. I need to open up the wiki to get the actual information on what some of these skills do.

But it's all about your playstyle and this game accounts for MANY playstyles. I could play a tanky melee warrior and have the game speed on near full throttle while laughing at traps. I could play a wizard who slowly but steadily grows in power and progresses through the dungeons to become a force to be reckoned with, or a thief who uses cunning to widdle away his or her enemies. Or I can mix and match or pick some seemingly incompatible build just to see how far I can get lol.

There are multiple crafting systems in this game if that's your thing too. But if it's not your thing, you can ignore it like it doesn't exist except minus some of the food crafting (which is easy enough). You can even set the auto loot rules to not pick things up that you don't care about (though you can vendor everything)

Aside from the flaws, it really is a fun game and after spending 130+ hours playing it I will go back for more every now and then.",1502335223,1504295527,True,11,0,0.621129333972930908,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I feel that this one is the most harmed by a poor visual presentation. I generally don't mind progammer-art, but this hurts my eyes. 

Longer version:
It is what it looks like. If you dig the video and screenshots, you'll dig the game.  If not, then not.   

The linux port ...  well, it's old.  It has problems with multi-monitor setups.  You'll need to disable secondary displays before launching if you don't want it to span across all displays (you can turn them back on once the game is running). There are no settings.  There is no ""fullscreen mode"". It launches in an un-resizable window, maximized across all displays. It's been about five years since this game showed up on Steam for linux with no fix.  I've never attempted to launch the game on any other OS, so YMMV.

I drop in for a few minutes every year-or-so, but nothing encourages me to keep playing beyond five minutes.  I think the art style is the biggest turnoff for me.  Knowing that I'll have to keep staring at this for hours if I really want to explore the depths of this game.  I don't have anything against pixel-art (FTL and Papers Please are among my faves), but the when the low-res east-meets-west syle of the sprites, combines with the noisy background tiles, it just becomes an eyesore to me.  I hate to say this, but just looking at the game makes me feel a little queasy. Again, YMMV.

At the same time, I am certain that a lot of thought went into this game. 

I'd like to like this game more, but I'd also like to like nethack more.  I've had it for five years and I've only racked-up 30 mins. Would your money be better spent on Nethack/Vulture?  I dunno. (Note: that's a trick question.  Nethack is free, and so are old versions of Vulture). IMHO, the game's presentation is an impediment to enjoying the game's mechanics.  I was just never able to fully engage with it.

When I really get down to it, I agonized over this review more than is apparent. I found reviewing this game to be more fun, challenging, and rewarding than playing the game itself.  In the end, I spent more time writing this than I did playing it over the course of five years.  I really Don't want to leave a scathingly negative review, because this game hasn't earned one. At the same time, I don't feel it's earned a remarkably positive one. 

""Maybe it's you.  Maybe it's me.  But i think we can agree we're not meant for each other""
-- Unattributed

The game does have workshop support, so If someone can recommend a cleaned-up tileset mod, I might be able to flip to a positive review.

Also, it could use some optimization or a frame-limiter or something.  A game this simple shouldn't 100% a whole core. Nothing about this game suggests it would need more than a 50 MHZ CPU, but it will happily chew up 3 GHZ.",1498379381,1498382960,False,1,0,0.427111715078353882,1,False,False,False,False,,,

This review runs very long, so here's my summary: A turn-based roguelike role-playing game that is as deep as it is comical, and totally worth playing. Score 8/10.

My very long review begins here.

The first time I ever tried this game I remember going straight to the tutorial, being bored, and uninstalling it. Yes, I was being impatient. Yes, having a big library of games on Steam and elsewhere has spoiled me. Yes, I wanted fun and I wanted it now!

And a few months later when I gave this game another chance, fun was all I kept having.

Dungeons of Dredmor is an unexpected gem of turn-based, rogue-like, role-playing game goodness that is deep and deeply humorous. There is a lot to see, do, and learn, but the game is extremely gentle about easing players into its breadth. The tutorial is excellent, and really, I was hasty when I judged it.

The premise is a simple one. You must traverse the depths of a deep dungeon, build your skills, defeat a lot of monsters, build your arsenal, and explore. The dungeons are generated anew with each play, so no two plays will be the same. This includes item and enemy placement, side quests, formulas, and so on. It feels sometimes nonsensical, but it just works. Every game is its own experience; every floor a journey.

The game play is turn based and on tiles. Every step, every cast, every attack, almost every click with certain exceptions is a turn. Turns are rotated at once, so everything feels closer to real time but things only move when you do. This give a lot of room for planning your next move, or in many of my cases, getting overrun with Diggles and stranger things. Action and inventory bars at the bottom of the screen make choosing what you want to do a snap, but you can also open your backpack as well and use items on hand.

The game felt a little too big at first with so many things to collect, enemies to defeat, and places to explore, all of which are up to the player. [b]As I played I felt less overwhelmed and more curious.[/b] What would this mushroom do if I ate it? This is a flask of what? Let's drink it and see what happens!

The customization is off the charts, an absolute wealth of possibilities await when you can combine seven different skills from the [b]more than fifty skills available.[/b] None of the skills are worthless. They all have something useful to offer, and their usefulness depends entirely on how you choose to play. Ever wanted to be a clockwork armored alchemist with psychic powers, skilled thievery, and exceptional eyesight? No? Okay, cool. Be an archeologist vampire mushroom farming wand crafter with a diverse stock portfolio and no morals! Seriously! Tourism, Smithing, Mathemagic, Viking Wizardy, Fleshsmithing, and a ton of other totally weird and totally awesome skills await. You decide how to approach, and the possibilities here are vast.

Crafting in this game is fun, Alchemy, Smithing, and Tinkering seem to have especially deep possibilities. You have a preset amount of skills, items, tools, and gear based on your chosen skills, but as you play you will unlock or discover many others.

My first big gripe is that there could have been more storage options for items. Space is sparse, even with the 'pocket dimension'. A couple of tabs for things, like a gem sack or a potion bag, would have been very welcome. I have never gotten further than four floors, and usually by floor two I've horded myself a huge collection of stuff, even if I sell things that none of my skills would allow me to use.

I also wish the potions, mushrooms, wands, and other such items offered details about what they do. You can always use a wiki, and you probably will, but truthfully some raw data on these would have been immensely welcome. There are just so many things to collect or use that details on the fly would have made the game feel smoother.

That said, the author's descriptions were, as with the rest of this game, entertaining and pretty clever. In some cases the description of the item, and the subsequent description of the buff (or power up) the item provided were cleverly done, and really funny. The same goes for the achievements; some of their descriptions are just so witty.

Mods are fun, and there are a lot out there made by fans that work pretty well with the game. [b]I strongly recommend reading comments on them before installing a mod[/b], just to be sure they won't cause your game to go haywire. I've tested and confirmed that [b]using mods does not affect achievements,[/b]in case you're wondering.

The music is good, kind of generic in some cases, but serviceable. The graphics are definitely of an old-school feel, but they really work here. In some cases they were actually perfect for what the game seemed intent on doing, like making a comical reference to something else, which is to say that the art style was excellent!

The story is fairly nonexistent, but the writing here is terrific. I loved the gags, the references, the oddball item descriptions. Sometimes it's Monty Python, sometimes it's Mel Brooks. A lot of pop culture references, many that will show their age in just a few more years. This game is dripping with wit and personality, and I found myself laughing out loud a couple of times when I got the joke. Don't let me build it up too much for you, just know that I really respect the writer's work here.

Dying happened a lot in this game, but it never felt unfair. The first floor of the dungeon isn't so hard. You get some levels, skills, items, and equipment to help out. Danger is everywhere, but being turn based there is a lot of room to think. Every defeat felt like a learning experience, and after a while I began to understand how I messed up. A key ingredient to a great roguelike, or really in most video games, is being able to lose and feeling like the loss was fair. It is a rare game that I feel this amicable about when I’ve blown my hours of progress on some careless mistake. Never angry, never cheated, and usually ready to dust off and try again.

If the thought of dying repeatedly doesn't appeal to you the game has a 'No Permadeath' option, allowing you to save and reload if you lose. The game doesn't appear to fault you for this, so it is purely up to you if you want the roguelike experience or are looking for more of a role-playing game.

Instead of choosing a class to play as, you choose 7 skills out of the over 50 available (much more in the workshop) and each time you gain a level, you can level up one of the skills you chose.  Each level you get to decide if it would be better for you to gain passive or active ability from, for example: Swords, Vampirism, Alchemy, Magical Law, Battle Geology, Perception, or Demonologist.  All of the skills themselves have a real identity, and combining 7 skills gives each character a real uniqueness.  This uniqueness coming from character creation is both why I like randomizing skill selection and why I like to play with permadeath, learning new characters can be as fun as maxing out a long lived one.

Calling the gameplay turn based is accurate but might give the impression that it is slower than it is.  For example you can click any tile on the screen to take as many turns as you need to move there, and fighting monsters using attacks and skills on hotkeys feels natural.  On your turn you can move to a new tile or use a spell or attack, then any visible enemies will take their action before its back to you.

The humor is on point, the core gameplay loop is satisfying, and the customizability is deep.  This is a game you can find yourself getting immersed in and coming back to again and again.",1496903581,1496903581,True,6,1,0.610345959663391113,2,True,False,False,False,,,

This is easily one of the two greatest roguelikes ever made - the other being Tales of Maj'Eyal - and it will hold a special place in my heart for all time. As you progress through Dredmor's lair, you will be consistently driven to bemusement, bafflement, and BRUTAL PLAYER DEATH in equal measure. And since the player death is so brutal, this game is therefore exceedingly funny and weird. It is one of the funniest games of all time in any genre. Oh, sure, the game's mechanics are perfectly functional and easy to learn, but the presentation - the sheer experience, the horror that creeps into your mind crying, ""that did what?! who would think of this? why would they think of this?"" - will likely cause a few existential deaths onscreen and off. Existential damage is actually a damage type that some abilities and monsters can inflict.

Seriously, though, pay close attention: most of the sprite animations have few frames... except, for some reason, monster deaths. Sure, you may be a little weirded out by what the monster is, but then you take a moment to really watch it die.

These developers were completely out of their gourds. I once got an achievement for somehow crashing the game, and another for getting killed during the tutorial, and of course one of my very first achievements was for dying on the first level with an identical build twice in a row. Your basic diggle is a small, yellow floppy bird with a rubbery drill instead of a beak, and you can collect achievements for getting killed by each of almost every species of diggle in the game. I will not speak of Thrusty. When you try to quit the game, the Unreal Tournament-esque (?!?!?!) announcer (...?)  will occasionally plead with you in his gravelly voice, saying, ""Please don't go. The diggles need you. They look up to you."" The same voice that, minutes prior, was yelling ""YOU NEED MORE MANA! DRINK MORE BOOZE!"" Also, you have to name the expansion pack.

The Steam Workshop content is full of great stuff, too! However, I strongly recommend spending a lot of time with the vanilla+DLC version before installing any mods. Some mods certainly approximate the devs' particular brand of insanity, but even now sometimes I have more fun without using any mods. And, yes, I bought the game when it came out and I still play now and again - and, when I do, it's ""one more turn"" all night.

Now with that out of the way, the game is good. It evokes that ""one more turn feeling"" quite well and is accessible for a roguelike. And there aren't terribly many accessible roguelikes around, that also have good amount of depth to them. It provides what it promises.

So the question arises, why is this a negative review?
Well one reason only, the crashes. I saw many players complaining about it and I understood the risk, but I wanted to try it. I've played this game for a few hours as you can see and it has crashed when I tried to save it 5 times when I was on the last or second to last floor. Flat out crashed, corrupted the save files and couldn't retrieve them. Literal hours of trying on runs wasted away in seconds.

This is a lovely game, but you need to be ready for many instances like what I stated above and have patience. Unfortunately, mine is worn thin.


EDIT: As you can see this was originally a negative review, but I had to come back and shape it around today's state for me.

So, after my anger has been calmed I got back to this game. It really magnetizes me and always makes me want to come back, thus doing so even after the aftermentioned crashes. Some time ago, I would recommend this game without second thought. The way it combines humor with some serious gameplay with tons of options to make your own build is really well made and seen through. It kept me for some hours and I know it will do so for more.

Çabuk sinirlenen biriyimdir ve oyunun kişiyi strese sokması değil rahatlatması gerektiğini düşünürüm ve rouge-like oyunlar için tam olarak zor diyemesekde insanı en çok strese sokan türlerdendir çünkü saatlerce oynayıp oyunun sonuna geldikten sonra ölüp en başa atılmak çekilmez bir şeydir. 

Ancak bu oyun çok farklı. Öncelikle ben çok DnD oynamış/oynayan birisiyimdir. Bu oyun dungeon hissini çok iyi veriyor. Oyun sıra tabanlı ancak pek de sıra tabanlı gibi hissettirmiyor oynayınca anlarsınız. Oyunun skilleri, silahları, zırhları oldukça çeşitli. Ayrıca henüz oyunu bitirmedim (kısa zamanda bitereceğimi de sanmıyorum) ama duyduğum kadarıyla oyun yalnızca 10 level miş (ben daha 3 e gelemedim) bu durumda öyle 100 lerce saat oynayarak 10 levele gelindiğini sanmıyorum yani oyun sonunda ölsenizde muhtemelen en fazla 10 saatlik uğraşınız gider. 

Rouge-likelarla ilgili diğer bir problemim ise sürekli aynı levellerden onlarca belki yüzlerce hatta binlerce kez geçtiğimiz için sıkmasıdır ancak bu oyun çeşitliliği kullanarak sıkıcı olmaktan kurtuluyor. Öldükten sonra farklı skillerle farklı spelllerle ve farklı silahlarla tekrar deniyorsunuz. 

Ayrıca oyunda isterseniz bu ölünce başa atma muhabbetini kapatabilirsnizi ama tavsiye etmem bir kapının önünde durupta acaba kapının arkasından 10 tane zombi çıkıp etrafımı sararak saatlerce süren ilerlememi yok mu edecek yoksa çok güzel bir silah mı bulucam muhabbetini tamamen yok etmiş olursunuz yani kısaca STEAMDEKİ EN İYİ ROGUE-LİKE OYUN diyebilirim rahatlıkla.

1- Sıkmıyor
2- Çıldırtacak kadar zor değil
3- Dungeon hissini iyi veriyor
4- Çeşitlilik çok iyi
5- Ucuz

- ler:

1- İçindeki metin sayısı oldukça az olmasına rağmen yalnızca ingilizce var oysa ki kolaylıkla diğer dillere çevrilebilir.
2- Bazen oyun çökerbiliyor ancak bununla ilgili bir başarımı var ve eğer oyun çökerse size bir başarım verip gönlünüzü alıyor bende oyunun çökmesine sinirlendikten sonra ''Zindan bazen çöker'' adlı başarımı görünce güldüm :D hemen başarım vitrinine ekledim bunu hoş olmuş aslında bunu + bile sayabilirim o derece.
3- Ufaktan karakter yaratabilseymişiz iyi olurdu (yalnıza 2 karakter arasından [kız ve erkek] seçim yapıyoruz)
4- Senaryo sadece girişteki 2 paragraflık yazıdan ibaret sanırım. bundan emin değilim ama eğer öyleyse biraz sade kalmış gerçe bu sadelik de bi yönden iyi aslında, bilmiyorum.

The music is meh, some tracks are good like the tutorial one but the others sounds like the cat of the composer got on the keyboard and started jamming the keys.
Overall the game is one of the best rogue-like that i've played even with all the little defects and i love it and the workshop adds that cherry on the top of the cake

Никогда не знаешь где тебя настигнет кончина - можешь помереть от любоого случайного события, особенно если герой ещё не прокачан толком. Ну, а если прокачан, то шансы конечно есть, но.. в общем, соболезную.
К счастью, наинать игру заново легко и просто - просто зашел и создал героя по новой. Правда, меня уже задолбало проходить снова и снова первый этаж, но от этого никуда не деться. ПРИДЕТСЯ ЭТО ТЕРПЕТЬ.

Dungeons of Dredmor has plenty of it. Item descriptions are absurd, enemies are bizarre, damage types are ridiculous, and the monsters frequently spout flavor text that will elicit a chuckle. The game takes nothing about itself seriously, and I LOVE that.

Dredmor also has an amazing class selection system, being one of the most varied ones I have encountered in a game. You are given a plethora of skills to choose when you make a new character. Mixing potions, dagger adeptness, vampirism, communism, emo magic—the list goes on. Each of these corresponds with primary stats (burliness, nimbleness, and sagacity to name some) and secondary traits (dodge chance, block chance, and enemy dodge reduction to name some). With the vast amount of skills that you can choose, there is a near infinite amount of variation in primary stat and secondary stat intensities as well as attacks that you can use.

However, these two things cannot save this game from the abyss.

The humor is fun when you first play, but it gets old after you’ve seen and heard everything.

The combat is grindy as fuck, feeling like a hack-and-slash game even though this is turn based. There is no strategy. Fighting is heavily dependent on RNG and the game does not force you to diversify how you approach each encounter. All you have to do is use your three favorite attacks, run, wait for them to cooldown, and then repeat. Nothing is stopping you from fighting this way, so I cannot help but fight this way.

The developers claim that there are “hordes of monsters never-before-seen in a video game” to be found here. Don’t be fooled. Only two enemy types exist: melee and ranged. The difference between each enemy in these categories is what types of damage they deal and what types of resistances they have. To top it all off, the creatures you fight are only reskins of things you already have seen with their stats changed slightly.

Inventory management is horrible. To make this even worse, there are so many different variations of ONE item (bleu cheese, grated cheese, cheese log, etc.) that your inventory will quickly become cluttered with crap.

Crafting is complex, but perhaps too complex. As with consumables and wands and ammo types, there are just too many different components that you can acquire and they are randomly generated. This will frequently make it difficult to craft anything meaningful.

Only the first twenty to thirty hours of this game is fun. While that might sound like a lot, trust me, it is not. I should easily be able to squeeze at least a hundred hours out of this before I get bored, because the developers clearly say 
“Infinite replay value: choose from a selection of mind-boggling skills to create your character. A new gameplay experience waits every time!” The only reason I have played this for sixty eight hours is because I like to pursue challenges. But all while I played I could not sit still. I was bored—I knew I was forcing myself to keep going.

If you still want to get this game heed my warning: complete it only once and leave with a good taste in your mouth.

I do. One of my friends actually bought this game for me for Christmas two years ago, saying that it was similar to one of my favorite games - [i]Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[/i]. At that time I played this game and wrote a negative review for it on Steam which relied heavily on comparisons between the two games.

That was unfair, I admit. I should judge the game on its own merits, not on how well it holds up to my own favorite game. I also bought both the DLC for the game – “Realm of the Diggle Gods” and “Conquest of the Wizardlands.” So, we'll see if all of this improves my experience at all.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game works. I can say that for it. It runs competently and seems to be more or less free of bugs. It did crash on me once, and actually gave me an achievement for it - “Suddenly the Dungeon Collapses.” So that was.... cute.

Sadly, that's about the only good thing I can say here. The game is just boring to me. I'm sorry to all the people who love this game, but it is. At no point while playing did I ever find myself really looking forward to what was going to come next.

I never looked forward to the next floor, because I knew it would be exactly the same as the floor I was on, but with different wall and floor graphics.

I never looked forward to seeing a new enemy. There were occasional clever designs, but they all work basically the same and are super wimpy. At no point was I ever forced to switch up my tactics at all.

I never looked forward to finding some fancy artifact weapon because they're never interesting. In most rogue-likes finding a good artifact can make or break your entire run, but here? At most it's just going to be the same as a normal weapon of its type but maybe with +1 or +2 to some stat that I never use. Yawn.

I also never looked forward to my next skill, because the game has you choose all of your skills when you make your character and you can never deviate, so there's no room for experimentation whatsoever. To be fair, I guess that puts the game on par with most other RPGs... but it's still disappointing.

Also, the levels are just... tediously long and boring. There is a “No Time To Grind” option that shrinks levels in size while giving boosted experience, but it doesn't increase loot, and so is therefore absolutely worthless.

In all: it works, but Is just so boring. 3/5.

[b]Presentation[/b]
Well, our main character isn't an “@” symbol, so that already puts it ahead of most rogue-likes.

Okay, but seriously, I have no real complaints about graphics or sound. Because the view isn't exactly top down, enemies, items, and traps can sometimes be obscured from view by parts of the environment... however, when this happens, the game politely points them out in various ways – sparkle effect on items, a pointy arrow for enemies, and a red outline for traps. So that's nice. It doesn't point out stuff hidden behind doors or dungeon objects, though.

I would also like it if my equipped armor actually changed my character's appearance, but it's not like the game has to do that. It would just be a nice bonus if it did.

I'll give presentation a 4/5.

[b]Writing[/b]
Finally, the last part. I usually put this as “story” but... you know, it's a rogue-like.

I'll be brutally honest. I don't like [i]Dredmor[/i]'s writing style. In my original review I described the writing as “edgy” but I don't think that's really the right word for it. The writing is just immature. I can't even call it parody. It's just random jokes that mean nothing.

This game was clearly written by the type of person who thinks “irreverent” is a compliment, and who believes knowing the word “sesquipedalian” makes you smart. And if you don't know what I meant by that last bit... then you're probably the type of person I'm talking about. I don't guess that really makes it bad, though. If you like [i]Family Guy[/i] and [i]Robot Chicken[/i], you follow Cracked, and you think the Clock Crew rules the Portal... then you'll probably love this game's sense of humor.

But if you'll excuse me, I need to pop my monocle back in, and go think about how much I hate you while enjoying my Beaujolais and camembert, and partaking of more intellectual entertainments... like anime. Anime is great. 2/5.

[b]KR Rating: 3/5 MEDIOCRE[/b]

In all, I give it basically the same score I gave it before. Owning the DLC didn't really change my impression that much. There's some fairly interesting additions in them, but nothing that makes the game any less boring to me. Even [i]Conquest of the Wizardlands[/i], which adds a huge number of randomly generated ""wizard tower"" mini-dungeons, is just... they're all the same. Yawn. At the end of the day, even with the DLC, it's still [i]Dungeons of Dredmor[/i].

And now that that's all said and done... yeah, I just can't end this without bringing up [i]Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[/i] again. It's an excellent game and a perfect example of a rogue-like done right. In that game, I actually did look forward to reaching new regions because they had unique properties and interesting enemies. I also looked forward to finding new artifact items because they actually meant something. Finding the right artifact weapon or armor could make or break your entire run, unlike this game where randarts just mean +1 to some stat I don't care about and I'll probably just sacrifice them to my Horadric Lutefisk Cube... speaking of immature writing.

I just can't recommend this game to anyone when I already know there's another game that's just like it only better in every way AND ALSO FREE already out there. I can't.

В очередной раз мне пришлось пожалеть, что в Steam’е нет возможности оставить нейтральный обзор, благо обозреваемая игра подходит под определение крепкого середнячка – все в ней выглядит добротно. А временами даже забавно, но она не вызывает сильных чувств и эмоций, как это бывает с другими рогаликами. Причина? Она достаточно проста: Геймплей упирается в то, какие навыки вы взяли своему герою изначально. Попытались сделать из него вора? Ну-у-у, поначалу вас будут нещадно бить, если, конечно же, не взяли перк на дальнее оружие. Взяли мага? Да вы всё и сами знаете. По первости своей мага убить может порыв ветра, а вот если каким-то чудом удастся прокачаться, то маг станет неостановимой машиной смерти. Ну а с воином все просто. Ходит себе такой танк и выносит все что подает признаки жизни. Это все было во множестве игр жанра слешер-рпг и к подобному раскладу геймер привычен. Другое дело, перед нами все-таки рогалик, а коли так ждешь того, что игра будет удивлять и раз за разом подбрасывать что-то новое, неожиданное и увлекательное. Есть ли здесь нечто подобное? Гмм, очень хороший вопрос.

В игре присутствует система рандома, будь это разбросанные тут и там фонтаны, выпив из которых управляемый персонаж может превратиться либо в козленочка, либо в Илью Муромца. Есть кузница бога Кронка, который подобно своему тезке из «Похождений императора» может улучшить ваше оружие. А может ухудшить. Тут уж никогда не угадаешь наверняка. Ну а еще есть квесты, которые заключаются в том, что надо пойти и убить местную страхолюдину за что игрок получит какую-нибудь вещь. Замечу, я не сказал полезную вещь, так как награда за выполнение задания чаще всего бесполезна, ибо предназначена не тому классу за который вы сейчас играете. То же самое относится и к зачистке огромной комнаты, населенной монстрами до отказа и прозванной ""зоопарком"". Лишь в редком, очень и очень редком случае вы можете рассчитывать на полезную вещь. Разработчики это знали и по этой самой причине сделали так, чтобы все упиралось не столько в вещи, которые на вас навешаны, сколько в навыки, которые вы прокачали. Взяли тяжелую броню вкупе с ловкостью? Отлично. Враги в шести случаях из десяти по вам и не попадут. Тем самым все упирается в те самые навыки, которые вы взяли изначально, а никак не в то, что в вас бросит игра. Таким образом элемент случайности пусть и выглядит слишком выпукло, но особой роли не играет. 

Звучит так, будто я только и ругаю игру, но это не совсем так. Перед нами клон Дьяблы с той лишь разницей, что бюджет у разработчиков был более чем скромен, но при этом им удалось сбалансировать навыки таким образом, дабы не один не был лишним. Да, некоторые выглядят достаточно странно, а некоторые и вовсе вызывают недоверие, но все они работают и вносят разнообразие в геймплей. То самое разнообразие, которое должна была давать игра по мере прохождения, а никак не сразу, ну да ладно. Был также сделан упор на юмор и высмеивание всевозможных штампов жанра, а также множество отсылок на известные, а порой и не особо известные произведения. Да и монстры, одним своим видом, вызывают улыбку. Посему, как я и сказал, – игра неплохая, но она проигрывает другим рогаликам именно тем, что сваливает на игрока сразу все и в дальнейшем «Dungeons of Dredmor» не сможет предложить ничего нового, оттого и интерес к ней теряется.

There are several options you can tweak to alter your play style, the levels are all randomly generated, plus you can choose from a long list of ""professions"" to change your abilities/spells with each new try you make at beating the final floor. (or at least getting farther than you got last time)
     Depending on what you pick from the profession list, you can spend your time crafting plenty of neat things to help you hack and slash your way through the dungeon. Engineering is one of my favorites to have, (making bombs, chainsaws and armor that lets me survive being struck by lightning is always a plus). But there's much more to pick from than that, which always gives you something new to try each time you play. Want to make a Thief that knows Blacksmithing and can teleport? You can do that. How about a Pirate that makes acid potions you can throw on crowds of monsters but can also summon minnions to fight for you at will. Yeah, you can do that too. There are so many combinations to choose from, it keeps the game interesting for a really long time.
     So yes, I recommend this game.

But I digress. Dungeons of Dredmor then. I like it. I won't go so far as to say that I love it, but I will just spoil this review right now and tell you: YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS FÛCKING SHÏT, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME.

I feel like I basically cut myself short just now, seeing as how I don't have all THAT much to talk 'bout when it comes to ol' DoD. I mean, the humour in it is nicely silly, without being overly dumb. And I do like that it's not pitching a tent in either the Bulletstorm cesspit or the Duke Nukem Forever leper colony, but the much less unappealing Monty Python-esque silly nonsense, uhh... fish factory. I dunno. I was struggling to come up with something, so I just wrote the first thing that came to mind.

Anyway! Moving on. I like that pretty much every single skill in the game is at least somewhat unique, and that they all have some measure of usefulness, even though some are pretty damn overpowered (lookin' at you, Perception (yes, that was a pun, get over it)) while some are... well... less useful (*coughs* veganism *coughs*). But anyway. The ability to mix 'n' match skills 'til your boxers squeal (because the expression ""till your hearts contents"" makes no göddämn fûcking sense!), so you'll have plenty of replay value.

The gameplay itself is nicely straight-forward. You typically walk around with WASD, you see an enemy, approach them, and then either bump up against 'em or click on 'em to attack. Not exactly rocket surgery, ehh? But the fact that the game is, how should I say... ""step-based"", I guess? Well, whatever you'd call it, it's the only hybridization of real-time and turn-based I've ever seen that actually works really well.

Those of you who've played Fatal Labyrinth on the SEGA Genesis know what I mean. To clarify, enemies can only move, attack, and do other stuff at the same time as you do, but you don't take traditional turns attacking each other. So when you attack an enemy, they'll attack you back. This makes it so that you'll ALWAYS have time to think about what to do next, but the pacing of the game doesn't necessarily suffer for it, unlike in games like Heroes of Might & Magic or XCOM.

The graphics are fairly simple and low-key, just to change the topic com-fûcking-pletely, but they have a nicely stylistic charm to them. Most pixel games generally just go for the 8-bit style out of sheer laziness, but DoD seems to take the same road as Stardew Valley or Shovel Knight, and instead have a pixelated style with plenty of details and actually nice colour palettes. Which I obviously like.

And now I'm reaching dangerously close to the final point regarding DoD: if it's such a solid game, why do I not like it more? Well, I will warn you right now that it's insanely fûcking grindtastic, and unless you play with the Smaller Floors option on, you'll be doing a fûcking retärded amount-a walking around in the game. There's also the fact that even though almost all skills are in some way useful, there are builds that WILL inevitably break the game, even on the hardest difficulty, and basically turn you into an all-powerful mega-god.

But I have to admit, DoD does a lotta things really, really, REALLY well, and since my only complaints with it are minor nuisances at most, I really can't give it that low of a grading. It's also worth noting that Dungeons of Dredmor (unlike nearly every single roguelite out there) does actually let you play on a fairly softcore difficulty level, and while I personally wish there were more options to customize the ""hardness"" of the game, this does make it so that even less skilled players can play it. So that's definitely a big plus.

All in all, DoD has a lotta solid points, and while it's a bit rough around the edges, it's still got a lot of charm to it, and it's definitely worth buying, even if you're normally not a huge fan of roguelite games. 89/100",1482732761,1516620752,True,5,1,0.463785678148269653,3,False,False,False,False,,,

I will note, though, that if you generially like the idea of ""rogue-likes"" but are mostly turned off by lack of feedback/graphics/music, this is a good game to get into the genre.

Quick review:
Pros:
-Varied builds
-Lots of loot
-Very good music
-Good graphics
-Standard hard rogue difficulty curve
-Cute mechanics like monster horde rooms

Cons:
-Very repetitive, imagine a single player only diablo
-Catastrophically bad inventory management
-Grindy as heck, even on the no grind game option (lol)
-Not very well balanced
-Surprisngly simple for a rogue game

Details:

Possibly the worst part of the game is the inventory management.  This sounds like a weird gripe, and I've played lots of games with terrible inventory management and just dealt with it, but this is definitely the worst inventory management in a game I've ever seen.  Basically you've got somewhere on the order of 1000 different item types in the game, and all can be used to craft stuff, but you can only hold onto 60ish items at a time.  Sure you have a dimensional stash that you can visit any time, but with that many item types, you'll be visiting it every 3 minutes.

Even choosing a no-crafting skills build, which seems to be the only option, its still surprisingly annoying to deal with given you need food and booze of which there's like 100 types.  So then it comes down to choosing builds that don't craft and use vampirism (no food), and don't use throwing or crossbows,  just to play the game without going insane.

Next up is the repetitiveness.  Most roguelikes have unique enemies with interesting abilities, enviromental hazards, and their own brew of general randomness to spice things up.  This game is mostly just stacking on various resistances and bonuses and dealing with your enemy's resistances and bonuses.  You look at the forums, and most build discussion is even just about choosing builds that let you stack certain stats.  This kind of munchkinery is super fun for about 15 hours or so, but it gets old really quick.  When you combine this with the fact that a floor takes about an hour (half an hour on ""no grind"" lol) and there's fifteen floors, and you're mostly just spamming the left mouse button, I think a lot of people will just get bored.  Even with the builds that implement some form of strategy, it's going to be the exact same strategy for any situation.

There's some major balance concerns as well, although since it's single player, you can just opt out of using the overpowered crap or choose random builds.",1482027898,1482030390,False,15,1,0.483217626810073853,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Essentially the game is played by traveling room by room. There are multiple stairways which are used to changed levels, and there are also a plethora of different interactable environmental items, and you also have your personal pocket dimension which you can use to store loot.

Primarily what is really good about this game is that it is beginner friendly. While experienced players can also find enjoyment from playing Dungeons of Dredmor, one who has never really experienced what Rogue-like games has to offer will likely be the targeted audience of this game.

I wish there was a “disable auto-save” button. It’s every five minutes or so and causes lag every time. Crashes the game from time to time but hey, you get that achievement very easy if that’s what you’re after. 

Positives: 
Nice not to be bound by rules of who can do what. You can define your skills any way you want.  
Side quests are offered. You decide if you want to do them or not.
The taunts are funny, making your own gear is really nice and you can have companions.
The monster zoo’s are difficult – brutal even. Often I’ve found myself out of lock picks, kicking the door down and whooa.. I was NOT prepared for this! Wyrmling? Come on boy – let’s do this! :)
 
Result:
To begin with I thought the game looked a bit “naah”, but that changed when I tried it. It’s a great game. How to play is easy to learn. The hard part – besides killing Dredmor – is to figure out what skill-combo and strategy works best for you. It’s trial and error. It’s brutal at times. But it’s fun, challenging and very addictive.

'Bout bloody time I did.

So, Dungeons of Dredmor... where to begin?  It's hard to really talk about all of the aspects of the game because there are SO MANY of them.  This is likely to be one of the first things you notice about Dredmor:  The sheer ridiculous amount of content, particularly once you have the expansions installed (and I highly recommend all three).  Character creation for example... even just the base game has 35 ""skills"" to pick from, with the number being just under 50 with the expansions installed.  And these skills are really skill SETS.  You choose 7 of them when you create your character (any combination is fine), and once you're in the game, each of these will start at their base skill.  When you level-up, in addition to getting a boost to your prime stats (more on that later) you also go into the big skill list, and you choose one of the seven to rank up.  Each rank in each set offers you something new... some fun new active ability, some wonky passive, some stats... in my experience, there really arent any ""duds"" among the skillsets here, and levelling up is always very satisfying.

And the skills are VARIED.  There's some crazy stuff here.  Some of them are fairly basic... for example, sword skills, or crafting.  But then you get to Dredmor's general comedic weirdness.  For example, one of my favorites is the Bankster set.  Right from the start, this one gives you an ability called ""High Interest Loan"".  Use it, and a big pile of money drops at your feet.  Sounds good, right?  Well, it has a fair chance of then also hitting you with a ""Bankster debuff"", of which there are about 7 types.  ALL of them drain money from you in some fashion, with one of them lasting indefinitely until you either run out or the effect is removed.  Now it doesnt seem so good, yeah?  Well, that's where the rank 2 ability, ""Dump Toxic Assets"", comes in.  You can take any Bankster debuffs you have at the moment, turn them into poison-based damage, and fling them at your enemy.  As with any skills in the game, these have cooldowns, so using this set PROPERLY (as most of the abilities in the set can debuff you) requires that you time your skill usage correctly, and that you understand what they do.   Skills and spells in the game are like that:  Some of them get complicated in an interesting way, and they often tend to be fairly creative in how they behave.  I mean, really, when was the last time a game let you kill a giant angry carrot by having a bad credit score at it?   Things get even more interesting when these skill sets combine, and with so many, there's TONS of ways to synergize.

Items are pretty similar:  Very creative, very diverse, very useful.  And this game LOVES it's items.  You'll get a ton of them.  WAY too many.  You have a large inventory, but you'll run out of space fast.  From things like food/drink (heal HP/MP) to potions or mushrooms to crafting equipment or much crazier stuff, the game has about a kersquillion items.  The best part is, most of them are actually USEFUL to you.  

And that's good, because the game REALLY expects you to be using them.  While the combat, at it's core, may be simple (walk towards a monster to strike them, and of course you have your spells and such) the game likes to throw alot of monsters at you.  Sometimes a HUGE amount, in what are known as ""Monster Zoos""... big rooms where every single freaking tile has a monster on it.  You could get anywhere from 50 to 150 monsters in one zoo; zoos are effectively the ""boss fights"" of the game (complete with unique music) and there's one on each floor (but you dont know where!) except the first.  Beyond that, sometimes you get elite monsters, the occaisional monster from a couple floors up, and of course monsters have various stats and abilities, some getting rather unpleasant indeed.

Which relates to one issue that some players may run into is that, yes, while the game may be accessible in some ways, it can get pretty darn tough.  I've seen plenty of players hit their first zoo and just get utterly splattered (and then try it a few more times, getting splattered even worse); traditional roguelikes dont exactly teach you to deal with 120 enemies (many of them with ranged spells or goofy abilities) all at the same time!  Yet the game expects you to do this on EVERY floor.  This is where all of those items and skills come in though... beating really tough encounters in this game, zoos or otherwise, is almost like solving a puzzle, carefully figuring out how to use all the stuff available to you to defeat it; you cant just beat everything over the head and do nothing else.  The good thing is that the game pretty much ALWAYS gives you the tools (there are a sqillion items lying around for a reason...) you just need to figure out how they can be used to get past a given situation.  It can get complicated.  Not to mention the way your stats work.  You have 6 primary stats, and 19 secondary ones.  Primary stats can affect secondary ones, but more than that, this means that there's LOTS of possible stats that can appear on equipment (or on buffs/debuffs).  Building your character well means understanding what all of these do.  In addition, there's ALSO like 16 damage types.  For players such as myself that love min-maxing and dealing with stats in these games, well, this game does it VERY well.  But for others this may be a major turnoff.

However, this IS a roguelike... one way or another, there are so very, very many ways to die, yet one issue is that this is a LONG game.  Each floor is huuuuuuuuuuuge, and in the base game, there are 10 of them (with expansions, there are 15, as well as special side areas).  And there's about a gazillion things to do.  A full run-through of the game takes quite a long time.  This isnt exactly new for this genre, but it's very worth mentioning.   You have the ability to save & quit at absolutely any time though.  But it can be very frustrating to do something like get aaaaaaallllllll the way to Lord Dredmor (who is NOT a pushover) and then die to him.  All that time it took to get there... lost in one moment of SPLAT.   The game will never kill you in ways that are genuinely unfair, but that of course never stops frustration in a case like that.   Accessible though the game may be, it really is best suited to roguelike fans that are more than used to things like that happening.

If you can get past that bit though.... this is an absolutely fantastic game.  I've played so many roguelikes, but this one is by far my favorite. It has it's small issues... but there's so very much going for it that it's way more than worth those minor quibbles.  Also it's got a really good sense of humor.

The game became a breeze, so it was a little odd for the final boss to be nearly impossible to beat. You have to run specific builds and honestly, that ruins of the fun of having so many oddball skills at your disposal if only a handful of them will get you the win in the end.

First off, the graphics are an old-timey pixel style and it relies heavily on humor, both of which are subjective. I happen to like them but you might not. Because it's so much a matter of opinion I won't be considering these things in my review. Also, some people have complained of bugs and save corruption, but honestly I haven't experienced any of that. It's probably dependent on your hardware, but I can't say for certain.

What I can say is, get the DLC. It's only a couple extra dollars for a [i]lot[/i] more content. Some of the most interesting and creative skill trees are in the expansions and they will vastly increase the longevity of the game. One of them adds a ""pocket dimension"" which you can usually unlock in the first level, which is essentially a safe room you can warp to at any time. I use it to store items far beyond what the regular inventory allows and I can't imagine playing without it.

First the good news:
[list]
[*]The game seems simple on the surface but there is a surprising amount of variety in the abilities you can employ and the enemies you will face. There's a lot to keep track of so it won't be for everyone, but for me it is incredibly satisfying to find a clever solution to a seemingly inescapable problem.
[*]All playstyles are viable. Obviously some classes synchronize well with certain others, but there's no single combination that dominates all the rest. As I said in the previous point, it's all about using what you have creatively to beat the odds.
[*]The developers have given a huge attention to detail. Whether or not you're a fan of the game's sense of humor, they have gone to great lengths to allude to a much greater universe in the descriptions of the items and enemies, as well as making their narrative themes line up with their in-game abilities.
[*]There's always time to think. This is more a matter of opinion, but as someone who can never get his head around fast-paced real-time action games, this one plays out almost like a weird sort of chess. You can take as much time as you need between moves to plan your actions. Because the AI is fairly predictable, tricky situations become more puzzle than battle, and if you want to succeed I recommend thinking of them as such.
[/list]

Now the bad news:
[list]
[*]There is a lot of RNG in this game, which makes things inherently unfair. It WILL screw you over, especially if you play with permadeath. You can't get too attached to your games because of this.
[*]The UI is pretty clunky, which seems to be one of the major complaints looking at other reviews. Because the game is turn based it doesn't [i]usually[/i] screw you over, but it is annoying.
[*]In trying to be witty, the descriptions of skills and items don't always give you a clear idea of what they do. I figured it out gradually just by playing the game, and I'm sure there's some sort of wiki you can use as well. Still, the developers could have made it a little clearer.
[*]Some of the settings can't be changed in-game. This can be annoying, but once it's set up the way you want it, it shouldn't be a problem very often.
[/list]

- The game is poorly optimized often lagging on machines no matter their power level.
- you cant change many options once the game has loaded
- important options like being able to scroll through the battle log are not in the game (hope you didn't need to know if your attack did any damage, or who out of the 8 monsters on you hit you the hardest) Change the ui on the screen? Nope, you get to fear walking down in this game because you ui blocks anything below you so you will never know what's there until you walk headlong into it.
- game has little annoyances that slow it down into a slog, like constantly having to pick things up manually (yes there is an auto option for pickups but its lackluster) or having to watch your screen like a hawk for traps because even though your character  can see them, he will happily walk into them like an idiot if you are not paying close attention.

and finally the most damning problem of them all

- THERE is a RIGHT way to build your character, and if you built them any other way you cannot win! At least not fairly.
The final boss has only one real weakness so I hope you chose one of the skills at the start that let you capitalize on that, else your dead. Restart and try again from the beginning chump.

I have over 400 hours put into this game and I still love it. If that's not enough proof, look at my achievements, certainly I wouldn't be playing this game to just get the achievements to prove a point.

Instead of the usual from what is said from many other reviews, I would like to point out what I liked about the game.

1. Skill Diversity: You can pick any 7 skills out of the ones presented before you. Truthfully based on my 400+ hour experience, any build is viable but killing Dredmor himself is entirely something else. Not all skills will/may be used and even a skill at their first level may be good enough throughout the whole game.
2. Loot/item diversity: There is a lot, and I mean A LOT, of items in this game. Most for crafting and some really good equipment. If you're the kind of guy that likes to hoard up on items for use later, this is your game.
3. Simple, yet addictive: When you start the game it's probably one of the hardest things to go forward from. You're weak, you're level 1, you might not have a weapon or enough food. But whatever the case once you get the hang of it you just can't stop playing, especially when you find a new and better weapon to use or a skill that's so freaking awesome.
4. Music/sound/animation: To complement with the game it has music. It's got sounds including voices. And they even had the time to animate pretty much all the attacks in the game. This ain't no ASCII nethack ( no offense to them really). Enjoy it while you can.
5. You can mod it: You may need an expertise to help you on this but nevertheless you can mod this game and make your own skills, skill portraits, attacks, and what not. There are literally thousands of mods out there, find one you like, load it up and play it.

Now this game isn't all perfect. There have been a number of glitches, annoyances, and bugs, can be game breaking, beneficial, and unfair, included in this game and have never been fixed. Some of them include game crashes, walking through enemies, mulitple turns, steam cloud issues (i only had this happen once and found out the problem), infrequent slowdowns on animations, and game loading issues. The bad bugs don't happen as often as you think and the good bugs are game breaking so I don't want to talk about how to do them.

Overall I really highly recommend this game. Don't be put off by the graphics, or let alone the innumerable number of stats you have to read. Once you play the game you'll find it to be quite appeasing, especially the countless number of jokes and references it makes to real life and fictional media. It's one of the running gags in the game. A very prime example would be the portrait you see on the bottom of the screen so go take a minute to look at the images for this game. It pays homage to the Wolfenstein games and your character gets more bloody the lower his/her hp, just like in Wolfenstein. Are you a Star Wars fan? The character Mace Windu has a sword named after him in this game called Mace of Windu. Not a Star Wars fan huh... what about Star Trek? Weld a Lirpa and destroy your enemies with its fantastically high attack power.
There's so much reference it makes to the outside, try to spot them all. That alone should be enough to keep you intrigued about the game.

PROS:
* As roguelike as roguelike can get. Sometimes RNG will bite you in the butt, but sometimes the dice are nice. For the most part though, it's pretty forgiving, at least early on. Most of the time it's just a matter of picking a couple skills that can reliably get you through the first few floors, and by that time you'll have enough levels (and lucky loot) to keep on climbing.
* Maintains an upbeat, quirky, and tastefully humorous tone in the music, dialog and flavor text, all of which belie the treacheries of the Dungeons.
* Mods galore! More rooms in floors, more classes with unique effects that are (usually) balanced, check out the Steam Workshop and see if anything tickles your fancy, there's plenty to choose from. 

CONS:
* Very bulky crafting system, with an equally bulky UI to go with it. More often than not, you're better off praying to RNGesus than trying to amass the skill levels and materials for some recipe you found. Ironically, the game itself makes fun of how bulky its crafting system is, one joke I did not smile at.

Overall, if you like roguelikes even in the slightest, this is a must-have in your library.

Лично я сторонник магического развития, так как это позволяет не входить в физический контакт с озверевшим мясом, а поджигать его издалека. Ключевыми для меня умениями являются Golemancy (Unliving Wall — стенка из камня, блокирующая проход) и Promethean Magic (Gog's Tactical Pyre — стенка огня). Даже босс игры легко блокируется каменной стенкой и сжигается огненной. Для мага важно ещё уметь элегантно сбежать с поля боя, поэтому знание Mathemagic крайне желательно, а именно Xeuclid's Translation. Так же полезно The Recursive Curse, чтобы напустить его на врагов иммунных к огню. Маг без маны — дохлый маг, поэтому удобно взять Blood Magic, Magic Training и Ley Walker. Вы поймёте почему первое архиважно, когда наткнётесь на свой первый зоопарк. Также полезным умением внезапно является Archaeology, точнее It Belongs In A Museum, так как экспы мало не бывает.

Of course you don't, that's pretty weird.
Fortunately it exists and it is probably one of the best ""true"" rogue-like games made in the past 10 years.

[h1]What is it?[/h1]
Dungeons of Dredmor is a Roguelike Fantasy RPG with several pop culture references from the 90s up to the 2010s.
If you are unsure of what a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike]Rogue-like is[/url], it's a gameplay style based on the 1980 release ""Rogue"". In a nutshell, you are given [i]one[/i] life to complete the entire game, any death results in a save wipe or a sentence back to the start of the game. As such the game itself is relatively shorter than other RPGs, maybe 2-3 hours with experienced players.

In the more traditional rogue-likes, like this game, you move in a square based grid and take turns with the enemies to either pick up one of the 20 or so types of cheeses, find new gear to equip, or die horribly to one of the many monsters in your way.
Controls to this game are rather simple, move in a grid based map with WASD and use the mouse to interact with objects next to the player. However, [b]I very much recommend turning off mouse movement[/b]. It sounds nice at first, but as far as I know you cannot cancel any mouse movement queues. So if you are suddenly ambushed, you have to take a good 3 turns just to move to the spot you clicked. Which is very bad.

Long story short, this is a [b][i]very[/i][/b] difficult game for newcomers to rogue-likes or even intermediate players who understand most of the things. 
If you really like the concept of this game and must play it first rather than others, thankfully you can lower the difficulty and disable permanent deaths. And it doesn't even make fun of you for it!
I highly recommend the tutorial even if you know what you're doing, it's humorous and gives you a good idea of how to play (character numbers good, hp good, damage bad). 
Further help can be found in this guide that i totally didn't pick because it is only the top rated one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148533918
If you want a more casual rogue-like experience to ease into the realm of insanity, I’d recommend trying the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series of games from Spike Chunsoft for Nintendo DS/3DS
If you want a harder, more confusing, and actively update rogue-like; try [url=http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/]Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode[/url] (good luck)

[h1]My Experience[/h1]
I've ""started"" playing this game maybe 4 years ago when I received it in a Humble Bundle. I played it, died, got angry, died again, and wrote it off as a bad game. Since then I have learned that there can be fun found in losing as well as winning. So, About a few weeks ago I picked it back up and tried to beat it again.
As I am writing this (August 14th, 2016), I have yet to complete the game in its entirety, let alone the DLC which extends the game even further. I have met my inevitable demise about 20 times over the years i played this off steam and even now. I plan to make it to the end on my own accord on Normal with Permadeath on, even if it takes me another 4 years.

[h1]Price Point?[/h1]
5 years ago this game released for an almost unheard-of price point of $5, it is still $5 because you can't really lower it anymore than this. They eventually added 3 DLCs. 2 for $3 and 1 for [b]absolutely free![/b] (under the caveat that you have to give it a name). Since then the made a complete edition bundle for $7, which is obviously the best choice in this scenario.
Sales of this game are somewhat common, roughly once every 2-3 months for 50%, with it having a deep discount of 75% at one point.

[h1]Game Updates?[/h1]
On [b]April 1st[/b], 2012, the devs [url=https://www.gaslampgames.com/2012/04/01/dungeons-of-dredmor-ii-3d/]""announced""[/url] that they would be making a sequel to this game. In 3D with the inclusion of Microtransactions and Social Media postings.
As of August 2012, after the release of the third dlc, the devs have no longer added content to this game and moved onto other projects.
Thankfully the game has native steam workshop mod support, so you can add a set of items, skills, or re-sprites to add more to the game. Of course there won't be many mod developers for such a small game as this, but there are quite a few at least.

[h1]Is it worth buying?[/h1]
[b]Yes[/b]. If you like the humor from Monkey Island, the gameplay styles of any ""true"" rogue-like, or even want to try one for the first time. Definitely pick this title up, even if it's not on sale.
(You're spending maybe $3.50 extra, that's like half the price of a fast food meal for 2)

It's a beautiful, funny and easy to play rogue-like (turn-based dungeon survival), full of jokes and terrible ways to die. It has options to be played on easier modes than the classic rogue-likes, and has a lot of interesting skills to try, but it is somehow limited on the number of monsters and itens. Playing on ""easy"" (non-hardcore mode) you will probably hoard a lot of powerful itens that you will never use, because you won't need it. Playing on ""hard"" is the same thing, because you will die before you get the chance. Reading the itens description will provide some laughs. Other than that, it's an addictive light-rogue, where you can select the amount of punishment you want to have, so if you are into comical graphical rogue-likes, you may like it.

Conclusion:
Addictive and satisfying, a rogue-like that makes you laugh and lets you get to the end within less than a lifetime.

- Workshop support.
- Witty Dialogue.
- Skill Trees (most roguelikes only have a class system, with each only having one specific ability that you're allowed to build on).
- Actually being a roguelike, in spite of its goal of easing people into the system.

Dredmor's Skills are on a build-as-you-want-it basis, so you can take a magic skill tree and pair it with a warrior skill tree with some (possibly disastrous) degree of efficiency. And with every update adding a few more skills, you can technically play a lot of classes without having to play the same combo ever again.

It's also actually a roguelike, compared to ""roguelikes"" like Binding of Isaac (don't get me wrong, that's a fun game, but it's not a roguelike as some people claim it to be), Enter the Gungeon, and so on and so forth.

When you start playing, you'll certainly spend a decent part of your playthrough managing your loot in your tiny inventory (remember to use Shift+left click to pick up and drop items with more ease). Thankfully, the ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"" DLC adds the Pocket Dimension - a place where you can store unlimited amounts of loot. By the way, this game is so cheap that you should buy the complete package for a better experience. 

Last but not least, I strongly recommend you to enable OpenGL on the launch options to achieve a smoother experience, avoiding crashes caused by memory leak, and making possible to use the Steam Overlay. To do this, simply right click Dungeons of Dredmor in your Steam library -> Properties -> Set launch options -> type in -opengl -> press ok.

It's got all the staples; permadeath (optional), difficulty levels, dungeon crawling, randomised level layouts, and different skills that let you customise your build.

And you have just one objective; get to floor 10 (or 15 with the DLC enabled) and kill Lord Dredmor. It's hard, but not copy-proven-builds-from-the-forum hard, and you don't have to be constantly searching a wiki either.

It's challenging, but not essentially impossible like so many roguelikes. Because it's turn-based and offers plenty of different skills, there's plenty of ways to tackle this one. I love that the weapons, trinkets and armour (of which there are many) are static and not procedurally generated. This means you can go hunting for a particular item you need for your build or to deal with a given type of enemy. And when you come across that super rare, super powerful weapon...

With all of the DLCs loaded, there are literally dozens of different skill trees that you can pick for a new character. Not to say that all of them are equally useful (because they're not), and it's entirely possible to cherry-pick an overpowered build - which, if you ask me, is perfectly alright: let people play how they want to. It makes hitting the 'random' button during character creation more exciting.

The game's sense of humor will either totally pull you in or will totally put you off. Every skill, enemy, and item you find in the dungeon will have a description that's punny, a meta-reference to something else, and/or just silly. Personally, I love it, but I could see some people taking the game's lack of seriousness as a point against it.

Levelling up almost always provides new skills and abilities that significantly improve your hero, so you really feel like you're getting more powerful - it's not just 'your mana bolt is now 1% stronger.'

There are negatives/things that bother me:

- There are only about a dozen different monster types. Going deeper in the dungeon will just unlock the same monsters with new color schemes.

- By default, everything moves wayyyy too slowly. Hit the '+' key at least once when starting out so you don't have to spend hours watching your character amble along through the dungeon.

- Inventory management is a total pain in the ass. Even with the Wizardland DLC (which I highly recommend), which gives you your very own dimension to store all the crafting junk you come across, you'll still find yourself constantly running out of room because you've picked up a dozen types of cheese, a bar's worth of different types of booze, masses of mushrooms, crossbow bolts made out of six different materials of four different qualities (not even including one-off bolt types!), potions, throwing weapons, wands, etc., etc., etc. Get used to hearing ""Your inventory is full!""

- The game's too long, and yet there are options to make it even longer! By default, there are 10 levels of the dungeon. At around dungeon level 5 or 6, your character will probably be strong enough that anything outside of massive monster zoos or a crazy mini-boss monster won't pose much (if any) threat. However, to be able to keep up with the power curve, you're going to have to grind through the levels anyway. With the DLCs, you have the option of expanding the dungeon to 15 levels, as well as having a virtually unlimited amount of wizarding worlds to explore - I would highly recommend NOT doing so.

- While there's an option 'no time to grind', which makes the dungeon smaller (yet having a roughly equal XP curve), which I totally recommend playing with, do note that by choosing this option, you significantly alter the balance of loot - specifically, any crafting class will find it more difficult, since you'll run into significantly less materials.

- Dredmor himself has been balanced against the twink builds. This means that it's possible to have a character that can clear out the entire dungeon but still be unable to actually win the game. Especially classes that are forced to go toe-to-toe with the big man himself - bring massive amounts of dodge and counter or you may as well just go home.

All those things are real problems with the game. However, I've sunk 120 hours into this game and have won it at all difficulties (with permadeath), so I obviously think that the game is well worth playing, despite its warts.",1466515426,1466515451,True,11,1,0.652400732040405273,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes I know rogue-like games are light in the story department, but this game is so severely and conspicuously lacking a story that I have to mention my disappointment somehow. It would have been so much better if it was accompanied by a whacky story to fit the mood but, as good as the mechanics of the game are, the soul is not there.

Diablo had a consistent mythos that sucked you in the atmosphere of dread and more (yeah just wrote that). Compare it to this game which breaks the fourth wall so much that it is like it’s calling the player an idiot to his face and expect you to like it.

I tried several builds to find some redeeming factor to my wasted time on this game and FORCED MYSELF to finish it after wasting many hours in it and I must say that I did not get any satisfaction from it.

If you are looking for the fleeting thrill of leveling up a character and looting some treasures, then this game is for you, just be aware that there is not a world to immerse yourself in, just a forgettable experience. IMHO this game is not worth the time invested on it, the aftertaste is bitter and disappointing.

For those of us who are not elite(ist) gamers, just think of it as a hard hack-and-slash game with procedurally generated content and very real risk of permanent death which forces you to start over (a little wiser each time)

My initial impression of this game was a very positive one. It's very easy to get into, has a lot of skills to choose from for character creation (implying lots of replayability, but I was wrong) and it covers everything with a layer of clever tongue-in-cheek humor (like witty pop culture references? this game has lots!)

However after playing this game on a netbook for over 80 hours, properly experiencing it in all its glory, I stand corrected enough to say that I would not recommend this game to someone else looking to derive some fun out of their play sessions, unless their entertainment consists in dying over and over unfairly...case in which I probably still wouldn't recommend this game because it simply isn't that good all things considered.

First off, a major technical issue. This game is built poorly, seemingly by dwarven plasticsmiths (those bastards) It's a little 2D game with sprites that have 2 animations each. Still it actively takes 600MB of RAM, reserving even more than that. On my 2GB RAM netbook I can forget running this and a browser at the same time. 

Shame, because it looks like exactly the type of game to be played on a netbook/tablet, and not on a proper desktop configuration like the game demands. It also personally annoys me as this seems to be a problem with more and more lazy pixel-style indie games: games that look like they were made 20 years ago demand 4GB RAM and 1GB VRAM. What the hell?

Onto the gameplay itself. It's balls hard. Not in a good way as it seemed on first glance. It's unfairly and frustratingly hard. It's unfair because while you have an ample amount of skills to choose from, only a few are actually effective (give you a high likelyhood of winning the game) while others are downright useless. The same goes for weapons (don't use crossbows unless you like taking 4x longer than a character with his bare hands to win the game). This wouldn't be so bad, as every such game has some strategies that work better than others, but this game in particular is very stingy with its descriptions of mechanics. Without reading a guide, you will frequently encounter weapons and abilities whose actual effects are very underwhelming compared to what their descriptions would have you believe. You pretty much have to read a guide before diving into the game, or you'll frequently wonder ""what does THAT mean"" when finding, say, an artifact or another with a typical description like ""The honorable poodles - it is studded with cheese crust and decorated with high quality tin""

Once that's out of the way, and you finally have a good understanding of the game mechanics that let you create an effective character with a fair chance of winning...you will run into another problem. Basically, once you figure out how to not die, everything all the way up until the final boss becomes one relatively simple, mindless, long-winded repetitive grind. And the final boss? FUBAR, because even many good builds won't scratch that guy (hints: [spoiler]Magical Law, Burglary, Crossbow, crafting/encrusting in general[/spoiler]). A situation in which 99% of the game play is mindless faceroll, and that 1% (final boss) has the shot of taking it all away because of RNG is not fun (again, unless you're a difficulty fetishist). I also have to ask myself why they even made the game with 51 skills to choose from when less than 15 of those are actually going to let you win the game. 

Could it be that in spite of first impressions, this is not that good of a game?",1460129423,1460298105,False,14,0,0.48987281322479248,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the most accessible rougelikes on the market, but don’t take it for granted.  This is a punishing, difficult game.

You start the game by selecting the skills your well-eyebrowed hero will use.  There are your normal RPG expectations, like Swords, Armor expertise, etc.  But then you get down to skills like Battle Geology, Necronomicomics, or Egyptian Magic.  Pick Vampirism, and you’ll sparkle like a bad actor in Twilight.  All these ridiculous and funny skills are useful in their own way, but its up to you to combine them in useful ways to ensure you can survive the depths of this dungeon.

Each randomly-generated floor of the dungeon is chock-full of monsters, traps, food to eat (which replenishes your health), alcohol to drink (which replenishes your magic), and most importantly, loot.  You’ll come across a sword that does existential damage (it may or may not damage enemies if, in fact, they do not exist) or a set of rubber pants that prevents conflaguatory and aetheric damage.  There are so many different stats to keep track of, points to weigh against one another, but it is not overwhelming.  Everything is clearly presented, and the random seeding will rarely give you useless stuff as you go deeper and deeper.

You can play this game entirely with the mouse, though keyboard shortcus and movement make it a lot easier.  You can either play with Permadeath (one life, no mistakes) or turn that off and play a little more casually.  I started with permadeath, but after losing a couple characters 3-4 hours in, I turned it off so I’d be able to rewind only 5 minutes instead of multiple hours.  This game is punishing, and sometimes can feel a little unfair as you run into things you had no idea would be coming, which you had no chance to prepare for.

The humor in this game is top notch.  From pop culture references to simple gags and dad-joke level puns, there is hardly anything in this game that takes itself seriously.

I did manage to reach Dreadmor, and I stabbed him a few times, but the power of his attacks are so far beyond anything else in the dungeon, he killed me in a few hits, even with every buff I could give myself.  I think I might never actually beat him.  Some things are meant to stay unfinished.

Dungeons of Dredmor has two paid expansion packs and one free one, if more ridiculous skills and bad puns are your cup of tea.

To start with, this game is probably the best roguelike experience on the market. It beats Issac, it beats Gungeon, it beats Nuclear Throne. You name it, it's probably not as good as this masterpiece.

Now with all this praise, you would probably think to yourself, ""Now what makes this game special?"" And the answer is simple. EVERYTHING. Have you ever wanted a game that isn't afraid to make fun of itself but also takes itself very seriously? No? Well, I didn't either, until I saw this treasure.

The way this game presents itself is as a generic dungeon crawler. But, it becomes far more quirky as you venture deeper into the dungeon. Just about every tooltip in the game is a joke, reference, or pun. All three of these things is very much appreciated. Thank you, DoD.

Now let's talk about the way a run starts. You pick 7 amazing and totally useful skills (almost always included in this set is Burglary, because of lockpicks.) and go into an amazing, proceduraly generated dungeon filled with monsters that taunt you with witty remarks and items that taunt you with witty tooltips. What this game has in cutting wit, it also doubles with deep gameplay mechanics. 

There are over 15 elements to attack with, and, like, a lot of other stats. But who cares about those? (Don't answer that.) You're here to have fun, and numbers are boring, lets talk art. The game has charmingly outdated graphics. From what you see of the screenshots, that's the game. You've seen it already. Why are you still reading this paragraph, it's useless in the whole scheme of things.

Oh yeah... A rating... uhhhhh....

Well I gotta say, those people don't know how roguelike games are, because the very nature of a roguelike is getting thrown in the game with no explanations at all, and being you the one who finds out how the game works. Games nowadays treat players like childs, telling you how to do everything from the beggining, and that results on the players being uncapable of solving a problem by themselves in an unknown situation where the game didn't teach them what to do.

[b]Title: Dungeons of Dredmor
Genre: Casual, Indie, RPG
Developer: Gaslamp Games, Inc.
Publisher: Gaslamp Games, Inc.	
Release Date: 13 Jul, 2011[/b]

[h1]Basic Overview[/h1]
Dungeons of Dredmor is a very intresting and very different from other Rogue-like RPGs I have played in the past. This game has randomly generated levels, along with loads of skills that you can mix and match to your liking. This adds very high replay value to the game, which is what you would expect from a (optional) perma-death game. It's sometimes frustrating to be killed by an enemy when you've spent to long on a play through, but that's to be expected from a perma-death run of this game.

[h1]Game play[/h1]
This game has a lot of variation, whether it's randomly generated floors or a huge amount of skills to choose from. Each run is very different from the last. I found myself dying a lot when I first started playing it, but the I kept coming back for just 'one more run.' Then that one more run turned into two or maybe three. The game really pulls you in, it has a great atmosphere when playing it on Perma-death. You never know what's going to happen which makes you more alert for what can happen, maybe you will find a monster zoo and then you have to be careful. There is a wide variety of different enemies for each floor, and each floor has a different theme to it with specific enemies that you will encounter along the way. As for the weapons and classes there is a nice variety for them as well which gives you a better attack damage for a specific weapon type and will depend with what happen you start off with. But what makes this game even more unique is that you can substitute a weapon class for another skill that may or may not be better. You can make the game even more difficult on yourself if the hardest difficulty is too easy for you by having skills that aren't very helpful to you. There are so many traps, and levers that you have no idea what it will activate. Maybe it will open a door, or maybe it'll teleport you to somewhere else. That's the beauty of this game. The attack system is turn-based, so you move once then the enemies move. It can be a simple point and click or you can use WSAD for moving your character, then attacking is just simple being close to the enemy (if you use a melee weapon) and clicking on them to take it in turns to attack.
[b]Score (Out of 10): 10 - Very high replay value and variation![/b]

[h1]Sound & Music[/h1]
The music for this game is perfectly fitting for the atmosphere and the game play for this game. Although it can get a little bit repetitive it's still nice to listen to when you are fighting a bunch of enemies at once. The sounds of each thing that you use, such as swinging your sword or axe is all very unique. It is quite obvious that the developers put a lot of time and effort into creating the sounds for each things. I would like to see some more music in this game that matches the atmosphere of the game.
[b]Score (Out of 10): 9 - Would like to see some more music that fits the atmosphere[/b]

[h1]Graphics/Art Style[/h1]
For me the art style of this game is just perfect. It really fits in with the with the whole atmosphere and dungeons kind of feel. It's not a too series style of art, but then again it doesn't look innocent. It just fits perfectly with the whole gaming experience. Some people might not like it because of the cartoon kind of style to it, but I am just saying it from what I think.
[b]Score (Out of 10): 10 - My own personal opinion, you might not like the art style[/b]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
So there is my whole review for this game, it's a very unique type of rogue-lite RPG game. It has [b]very high repay value[/b] which always makes you come back to the game. It has great atmospheric music, I would only want to see a few more soundtracks on this game, and the art style, well take it or leave it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it.

However, I must warn you, that if you are looking to buy this game and/or its DLC, know that it can be extremely difficult. Don't expect to win on your first try (if you are playing Permadeath mode). I'll list some of its pros and cons for those thinking to buy this game.

Pros
[list]
[*] At least 30 different skill trees to pick, all catering to different playstyles. You can pick 6 each time you start a game.
[*] Compared to other roguelikes (Angband, Nethack, etc) its pretty easy to learn, but still retains a lot of complexity. DoD also has a tutorial.
[*] Also unlike traditional roguelikes, it has mouse support. You can play the entire game with your mouse, but you can always use your keyboard if you want to.
[*] Lighthearted roguelike with a lot of humor and references,
[*] Creative monsters and mechanics.
[/list]
Neutral (depends on your opinion)
[list]
[*] Everything is unlocked by the get go, unlike the modern permadeath games you see today (Binding of Issac, FTL, Necrodancer, etc).
[*] Turnbased and gridbased, similar to the traditional roguelike.
[*] Long game, will most likely take hours to complete a single run.
[/list]
Cons
[list]
[*] Can get very grindy at times, levels are too big in my opinion (there is an option to shorten the levels however, but I haven't tried it yet).
[*] Crafting system is iffy. Not incredibly useful (at least in my experience), and you usually don't get enough crafting materials to build anything substantial. If you find yourself wanting for a certain crafting material, there doesn't appear to be a definite way to get that exact material. You have to leave it up to the hands of the RNG.

Der Beginn mit Dungeons of Dredmore ist durchwachsen. Ich kann keine Screenshots machen und das gesamte Steam-Overlay funktioniert nicht. Nach kurzer Recherche stoße ich auf den Tipp für Dungeons of Dredmore in Steam die Startoption “-opengl” einzutragen. Damit funktioniert zum Glück sowohl Fraps für Screenshots als auch das Steam-Overlay reibungslos. Als erstes wird versucht mir die Aspekte des Spiels in vielen kurzen Tutorials zu erklären: Mit Tatstaur oder Maus gehen, anklicken um anzugreifen, rechtsklicken um Fernkampfangriffe zu benutzen, Hebel ziehen etc. Als mir aufgetragen wird eine Armbrust zu suchen finde ich eine in meinem Inventar, rüste sie aus und erschieße den Gegner… doch nichts passiert. Im Nebenraum finde ich eine Armbrust auf dem Boden liegen und rüste diese aus. Der Auftrag lautet nun “töte den Diggle”… hmm der ist aber schon tot. Nur mit einem Verlassen und Neustart des Tutorials geht es weiter – unschön. Das hätte man anders lösen müssen, aber sei es drum, die anderen Tutorials erledige ich auch schnell noch und dann geht es ab ins erste echte Abenteuer.

[b]Munchkin - The Roguelike?[/b]

Als erstes wird unser Held (oder unsere Heldin) erstellt. Dafür picken wir uns aus 47 Skillbäumen 8 raus, die unsere Startwerte und -fähigkeiten festlegen. Neben relativ konservativen Rollenspielfähigkeiten wie Swords, Smithing oder Golemancy finden sich in unserer zufällig zusammengewürfelten Startausstattung auch sehr kuriose Fähigkeiten: Viking Wizardry und Paranormal Investigator. Auch Emomancy und Communist habe ich gesehen, das kann ja heiter werden.
Wir betreten das Dungeon weil… der dunkle Lord Dredmore vor langer Zeit tief unter der Erde eingesperrt wurde, nun aber seine magischen Fesseln gesprengt hat und deshalb gestoppt werden muss – schon wieder. Ein guter Grund. Von oben schauen wir unserem Helden zu, wie er die ersten Schritte in den unbekannten, zufallsgenerierten Dungeon macht. In typischer Roguelikemanier gilt es Truhen und Türen zu öffnen, fiese Monster zu besiegen, Dinge in den Mund zu nehmen, von deren Wirkung man keine Ahnung hat und möglichst lange zu überleben. Das alles läuft rundenweise abwechselnd. Erst führen wir eine Aktion aus, dann der Rest des Dungeons. Man sollte sich also gut überlegen was man als nächstes tut um idealerweise den ersten Schlag zu landen oder noch unbeschadet flüchten zu können. Das Töten von Monstern und andere erfolgreiche Aktionen geben uns Erfahrungspunkte und ggf. Geld und Loot. Besonders freuen wir uns natürlich über neues Equipment, dass uns direkt stärker macht. Jedes Item und jede Fähigkeit hat einen humorigen Text als Beschreibung und ich fühle mich an die Texte von den Munchkin Karten erinnert. Das ganze Spiel ist voll von lustigen Texten und Anspielungen auf andere Spiele. Recht früh im Spiel finde ich z.B. einen Threepwood Helmet – einen gusseisernen Topf. Großartig ist auch der Schrein von “Inconsequentia, Goddess of sidequests”, die uns auf Wunsch Nebenaufgaben aufträgt. Das Geld können wir in Shops und Automaten verprassen. Genug Erfahrungspunkte bescheren uns natürlich ein Level-Up und wir müssen uns entschieden, welchen der acht zu Beginn ausgewählten Skills wir eine Stufe verbessern wollen, was uns wiederum eine neue Fertigkeit oder einfach bessere  passive Boni gibt.

[b]Von Vielfalt erschlagen[/b]

Was anfangs recht übersichtlich ausschaut überfordert den Einstieger schon bald. Überall finden wir uns unbekannte Gegenstände, was tun die bloß alle und brauchen wir die später noch? Das Handwerkssystem haben wir im Tutorial gar nicht beigebracht bekommen, doch gibt es mindestens 7 Handwerksberufe. Zum Glück ist das Craftingfenster halbwegs übersichtlich und nach bekannten Rezepten und vorhandenen Zutaten filterbar. So schaffen wir es bald zwei Eisenbarren und daraus eine erste fesche eiserne Beinrüstung zu schmieden. Doch der Überblick über die Zahlreichen Fallen, Bolzen, Nahrungsmittel und Tränke geht bald verloren. Die einzelnen Dungeonetagen sind sehr weitläufig, so dass ich bereue nicht die Einstellung “no time to grind” gewählt zu haben. Mit dieser sind die Etagen kleiner – ob sich das auf den Schwierigkeitsgrad auswirkt werde ich in dieser einen Stunde nicht überprüfen können. ich komme an Regalen mit neuen Rezepten vorbei, treffe und erlege viele verschiedene Gegner, betrete Teleporter, lege Hebel um, sortiere immer mal wieder etwas aus meinem begrenzten Inventarplatz aus und betrete schließlich mit Hilfe von gefundenen Wizard Keys die Hölle der Diggles, eben jener Viecher, die wir im Tutorial und den oberen Etagen massenhaft erschlagen haben. Und nun schlagen sie zurück. “Congratulations! You have died!” Danke, danke, die Stunde ist ohnehin um.

[b]Fazit[/b]

Dungeons of Dredmore ist ein technisch limitierter Roguelike der durch Humor zu überzeugen weiß und ansonsten durch Vielfalt und ein funktionierendes Gesamtkonzept glänzt. Ich bin mir sicher es gibt noch jede Menge zu entdecken und ich werde mit den unterschiedlichen Spieloptionen rumprobieren müssen, denn in der Standardeinstellung kann so ein Durchgang vermutlich einige Stunden gehen. Sehr schade ist, dass sich die Ausrüstung in keiner Weise auf das Aussehen unseres Helden auswirkt. So muss man sich mit den Texten und der eigenen Vorstellungskraft zufrieden geben.

1) Lack of depth. A major part of roguelikes is exploration, synergies and ""huh thats cool"" moments. ToMe, ADOM, NetHack, Caves of Qud and many others excellent roguelikes do this well.
2) Graphics; although this purely a personal compalint, but i can look at an @ sign for hours but the terrible walk animation I can not.
3) Difficulty, the difficulty jumps incridably steeply, without giving players a good indicator of why, a chance to adapt or means of survival.
4) The games length is artificially extended by grinding out enemies and clearing floors to deal with the difficulty cruve.

That being said this game simplicity makes it an excellent roguelike introduction to players new to the genre as they wont be swamp with complicated numbers and stats.

The ASCII tiles of NetHack and ADOM aren't the best place to start for everyone, but the goofy classes and antics of Dredmor's bushy-eyebrowed heroes are an easy sell. It straddles an important line between more mainstream adaptations of the concept and the originators, where neophytes can find easy access and veterans can find a new take on old ideas. And while it may not be perfect in a lot of ways, it passes the main test of being something you can play for way, way too long.

Dredmor is really a traditional, grid-based, turn-based, everything-random roguelike dressed up in some handsome(ish) graphics and modern(ish) sensibilities. The only story you get is that you're a hero, and you're descending into the titular dungeons to whack the equally-titular Lord Dredmor. There's a thick layer of nerd humor over the whole package that runs more than skin-deep, as it even informs the class and stat systems with entries like Mathemagic and Caddishness. Luckily it's not the aggravating metahumor of something like Retro City Rampage, and is actually quite snappy and clever for the most part.

The aforementioned class system is probably the big draw of DoD, for newbies and veterans alike. Each character you roll gets seven skill sets to choose from a list of dozens, including everything from sword and shield skills to veganism and communism. Every time you level up, you can unlock another skill from one of your sets, allowing you to knock out one tree with half a dozen levels or diversify as you see fit. Sets tend to be eclectic mixes of active skills and passive bonuses, with some being demonstratively better than others but all of them interesting and worth a try.

Outside of the skill system, there's admittedly not a lot of innovation to be found here. You wander the dungeon, grab loot, kill monsters, and so on. There are shrines to pray to, gods to appease, vending machines to shake, traps to disarm, levers to pull, and plenty of things to die to. Unlike the roguelikes of yore, however, death tends not to come all that swiftly in Dredmor. It's pretty easy to keep your stats and gear up with the challenge presented by enemies if you're cleaning out the floors, to the point that by floor three or so, nothing's going to kill you outside of a room completely packed with monsters. Your demise is more likely to come via attrition, by small mistakes adding up to run you out of healing items and eventually health.

This ties into the main problem with Dredmor, the fact that individual runs can get pretty boring after a point. Unlike most roguelikes, the early game is when you need to pay attention to your skills and your loot. Once you get your rhythm locked in, levels start to blend together. The slow default move speed and animations drag things out a bit longer than they should, and your inventory and crafting windows really could have used another pass on usability. For as many steps forward that Dredmor takes as a modern roguelike, it has a couple feet planted firmly in the past.

All that said, I was able to sink 30 hours into the game before I grew well and truly tired of it. And those were an enjoyable 30 hours of looting, smashing, and giggling at the goofy jokes. The odds aren't good that you'll face down Lord Dredmor before boredom claims your character but on the way there, you'll get to charm diggles and make omelettes and wear a magic traffic cone on your head. Dredmor will go a lot farther with those new to the roguelike genre, but there is undeniably something for everyone, at least while it stays fresh.

Get used to the phrase ""YASD"" which stands for ""Yet Another Stupid Death"". 
When you die, it is your fault. Maybe you didn't pay attention to where you were going and stepped on a trap. Maybe you underestimated your opponent and didn't realise you had to run before it was too late. Keep your escape routes open and weigh up risk/reward before doing anything.
You are one step away from death at any and every point in the game.

The challenge is overcoming the dungeon, but also yourself. Those rash impulses that overtake body and mind as victory looms every closer.

The major cons that I would cite are not the fault of the developers. It's things along the lines of the fact that there is no readily accessible wiki that is up to date.

The other thing that I would note is that you can hit endgame gear  pretty quickly (about dungeon level 5-7 out of 15), so there can be a very odd difficulty curve where you no longer have any significant changes to your stats, but things will get pretty tough.

First of all, there are many technical problems with the engine. Crashes (with an achievement), bugs and input lag are always part of the experience. I never bothered with the non-permadeath mode but If you play this mode, the game is completely broken due to crashes corrupting the save file.

The humor in Dungeons of Dredmor is something most people seem to be in love with but I found it to be uninspired, unoriginal and not funny in any way. The more hours I spent playing, the less patience I had with the game's poor performance and input lag. These two issues are simply awful and unbearable after a while. Worst of all is the crafting and lack of a decent enough inventory system. If you make a character build focused on crafting, you will be in for the most frustrating, annoying, cumbersome experience in any crafting related game. It's so poorly implemented and backwards that once you go through the troubles of attempting to keep ingredients/items, organize them and finally begin crafting, you will never want to craft another item in this game again. The negative combination of the awful inventory system and the hideous crafting system is enough to quit playing and never go back to Dungeons of Dredmor again.

Chiariamo la cosa, giocandolo per 1 oretta ho capito che devi stare a perdere tempo leggendo qualsiasi descrizione di ogni oggetto che trovi avanzando nel dungeon, non è possibile che per 2 passi che fai trovi un oggetto!

Ho cercato di continuare facendomelo andare a genio, ma l'unica cosa che ho fatto in 1 ora è stato andare in giro per i dungeon uccidendo 2-3 mostri e leggendo le descrizioni di un sacco di oggetti.

Lo consiglierei? Si, se a qualcuno piace leggere e ha una buona padronanza dell'inglese.

Dredmor is..... well, it's not perfect, but it's a better middleground then any I've ever seen. Starting off is still a little tricky, but at least you have graphics and whatnot to lend a hand for once. Nonetheless, I'd recommend playing on Elvishly Easy mode and perhaps looking up some guides to get a handle on how the stats work. Melee damage is based on ""Burliness,"" which is based on how many ""Warrior"" skills you have. (as opposed to Rogue and Wizard skills) This is how most stats in the game are calculated, and it does take a little getting used to.

Once you get over the initial ""What the crap is going on?"" stage, the tactical turn-based gameplay really takes off. I've played this game dozens if not hundreds of times, and I'm still trying out new characters and new strategies all the time. I will say, the game got a lot deeper with the expansions, which means in retrospect, the base game felt a little shallow, but like I said, there's a steep enough learning curve that the pool won't run out for a little while, at the very least.

If you like turn-based games - old-school RPGs or certain board games or card games - Dredmor might just be the thing for you. If you like roguelikes like Nethack, Dredmor might seem a little basic.

In all seriousness, despite my relatively short play time (Just over an hour).

But like most games in the rogue liek genre, it turns into a loot rush as you scurry to gather gear all the while avoiding what would be considered tier 1 mobs and very easy fights due to the sheer squishiness that you character can suffer if the right traits aren't picked.

The simple graphics and combat of Dungeons of Dredmor obscure its incredible depth of design, functional mechanics and polishing, and it really is a fully fleshed out title. My fun in Dungeons of Dredmor comes from battling through hoards of monsters while interacting with the world, using traps, spells, crafting and more, all while exploring ever deeper.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]

There are plenty of little things that help this stand out and help to make it something more than most rogue-likes, but the central design philosophy of accessability and the respect it has for the classic elements that make rogue-like games so fun that make it very much worth my time and keep me coming back.

A plethora of additions and extra gameplay elements like crafting and landmines which would easily become an annoying chore or distraction in other games has been made completely optional and ignorable here, yet still adds lots of practicality to the game when you spend the time.

* The attention to enabling and supporting Steam Workshop content definitely deserves comment. It's been woven into the game perfectly and means sharing rooms, items, monsters and even things like insults and decorations is rewarding.
* The humour deserves mention. There are references to movies, old video games and culture not just spread throughout the world, but even in the U.I. and elsewhere.

[h1]Mistakes and Annoyances[/h1]

It has been genuinely quite hard to find something to dislike about this game and the only things that are worth pointing out haven't really affected the fun I've had with this title, but they're here in the interest of a complete 

review. The main drawback or limitation of the game is in the simple and, some would argue, boring combat. Fighting thousands of monsters in the same way, typically using the same specific skills and abilities can wear thin and unless you're willing to make some form of goal and targets, or story for yourself, reasons for playing can easily feel empty and flat.

* The tutorial is quick and simple, but also very lacking. There are a ton of gameplay elements and user interface mechanics that aren't covered anywhere and usually have to be searched for to learn about, or will simply be discovered by chance.
* Dredmor, the end-game boss can feel out of place and the ending can feel abrupt for some.

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]

Presently available on Steam for £3.49/4.99€/$4.99 and with no real limit in replay value, Dungeons of Dredmor will take around 20 to 30 hours to complete a successful run, but reaching that run may take you 100 hours or more. As a 

result, it's very fairly priced and good value for money even when not on sale, yet routinely goes on sale for -50% and -75% and is a must buy for anyone looking for an approachable rogue like.

The Complete version costs just 30% more, is available for £4.99/5.99€/$6.99. It is almost exclusively the better choice over the stand alone because it adds Conquest of the Wizardlands and the Realm of the Diggle Gods DLCs which add a total of 12 new Skill Trees, hundreds of new items, dungeon levels, monsters and mini-bosses and plenty more. Unless you don't expect to play more than a few hours or you're on a strict budget then there's no obvious reason not to grab the Complete pack.

I only have a couple of minor gripes with this game. After a while, room patterns start standing out more and more; leading to you memorizing all of the tricks the game can throw at you. The game isn't completely randomized; so this is more or less to be expected. Next, skills in general range from decent to just plain underwelming. I feel like a little buff here or there would do wonders. In my playthroughs, I ended up feeling like I slogged through a bunch of minor stat boosts to get to a decent spell or passive.

Some of the jokes appear to be aimed at veterans, though.  There are a lot of jokes and a very strange sense of humour.  This doesn't mean it's a silly game - the game itself is not a joke, but a lot of the flavour text is. 

Instead of choosing a class, you choose 7 skills, ranging from weapon skills, armour skills, numerous magic skills, dodging, veganism, geology, archaeology...  so although there's no ""warrior"" class, you can just make a warrior by choosing all weapon and armor skills.  Or make a mage, or a rogue, or just about anything in between.  Because of the way heavy armor and spellcasting work together (they don't), warrior-wizard hybrids have some problems, but any other hybrid can work well.

There are also crafting skills, and a lot of craftable items and discoverable recipies.  Thanks to some very powerful craftables introduced in the expansion packs, crafting is a bit overpowered.

Modding support is very good - indeed, the free expansion pack is mostly made up of of the best player-made mods.

I have very few complaints.  One is that the final boss is *MUCH* more dangerous than anything that comes before it.  The problem is not the toughness of the boss by itself, it's just that the rest of the game doesn't do a good job of teaching the player how to deal with him.

Also, this is an indie game, made with an indie budget.  Occasionally that shows, like with late-game monsters that look like palette-swapped versions of earlier monsters.  It also comes with an indie price tag, and that makes it excellent value for money.",1436109824,1436109824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

DoD simplified a lot of stuff but kept the standard mechanics of a turn-based roguelike. This game still has the most important things:
<> randomization  
<> Perma Death (there also is an option to turn that off, again trying to appeal to a broad audience)
<> Crafting
<> Skill Trees
<> Quests
DoD had all that but as I said simplified! And that's what makes this roguelike so great! It's simple yet so challenging and complex. It always keeps this fine balance between ""dumb-easy"" and ""complex-easy"". But this game is not easy to beat; not at all! 

DUNGEONS OF DREDMOR is pure roguelike-awesomeness, and it also is the perfect game to start for newcomers to the traditional roguelike genre.

Dungeons of Dredmore is your typical roguelike; maintaining the tradition of esoteric skill trees, randomly generated dungeon levels, and optional permadeath (ouch).  The actual gameplay is fun and incredibly engrossing in and of itself, the game could stand on that alone even though that is not what makes DoD truly shine.

The thing that really makes DoD the first among roguelikes, the reason that you should play THIS roguelike is the irreverent, unrepentant sense of humor.  It keeps you laughing through every.last.permadeath.  Nothing is sacred...least of all the protagonist.  The descriptions of the ""normal"" loot, equipment, skills, etc. are hilarious; and the standard content is just the tip of this iceberg of absurdity.  Then there is the humor inherent in the things that you would never expect from this kind of setting.  Really, though, who wouldn't love a game with skill trees for such things as Veganism, Archeology, Magical Law and Tourism?

Finally, this game will really reach out to you with more cultural references than you can shake a standard-issue 10' pole at.  Really, recognizing all of them would borderline on a superhuman ability.  Not only is the sheer number impressive, but the game creators chose to cast this particular net over a large area of pop-culture and sub-cultures rather than limiting themselves to areas of interest most common to gamers.  It would take a vastly longer review than this to list off all of the fandoms, but rest assured that something near and dear to your heart will be mocked.  It's a tough call, but in the end I think that the cultural references are the funniest part of the game.

There are only two criticisms that I have to offer.  First of all, the mad libs-style random generator for the names of places and artifacts is rather inelegant.  The intent is funny, as are some of the results, but frequently the grammatical issues with the names and titles just gets in the way of the humor.  Secondly, there seem to be specific room layouts that are frequently re-used in the random level generation, making the rooms occasionally repetitive.  I don't know anything about coding, so I have no idea if that is something that is even possible to change.  However, neither of these two issues drastically impact my enjoyment of the game.",1430945954,1480396945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

He absolutely rants and raves about how much fun he has with it... I'm not sure that we should be friends anymore. This game is extremely boring. The enemies are simple recolorings, the combat is not challenging other than trying to stay awake, and the levels are bland.

The humor in the game is slightly funny at first... But this is not enough to keep anyone interested on this alone. The battle mechanics are repetitive and the only real strategy is to funnel the enemies into a hallway where they can't attack more than 1 or 2 at a time and hack away. The graphics are HORRIBLE. A few floors in the background/floor/wall/everything looks like a gravel driveway with vomit mixed in.

At some point, I stopped playing the game, and just started seeing how many characters I could create with some form of ""eyebrow"" in their name... 

And then I shelved it....  Overall, I'd say if you've never played a top down turn based roguelike, or if you want a reason to never play  another top down turn based roguelike, maybe pick this up when it's on sale. If you want a game that will keep you interested for more than half an hour without feeling like repeatedly clicking on an icon in windows 3.0, pass this up completely.

Not because the game sucks, it's actually one of the best roguelikes I've played recently, but because of a problem I'll describe.

The game has an auto-save feature that sometimes crashes the game (Runtime Error).
You can NOT remove this auto-save feature, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't corrupt savefiles, but unfortunately it does.
The developers of this game even acknowledged the issue, but did nothing after 2 years of knowing about it.

The only workaround is to:
1) Turn off Steam Cloud
2) ""Save and Continue"" in the menu (unavailable if you play Permadeath mode)
3) Manually backup your savefiles from Windows folders every now and then,  so when it happens you can replace the corrupted save


I lost a 28 hours savefile due to not knowing of this issue, and I'm not gonna recommend the game despite it being rather good. I might give this another try someday, but right now I'm stunned.

I am writing this review, because the game pushed me towards the edge of negative emotions. Which is quite sad, because the game itself and idea are really good and addictive, sadly not enough to forgive all the non-stop, gamebreaking issues.

The mains reasons why I cannot, by any stretch of imagination recommend this game.
1. Game crashes. Crashes sometimes are game-breaking, as the game sometimes just does not save at all. A crash couple times after 1-2 hours of playtime led to completely losing the whole progress until that point and resetting everything including game settings, which is impossible to accept,

2. Game does not autosave for no apparent reason. It shows during gameplay that game has been saved, yet when starting the game the day after I'm still starting not from what I have left, but from the very previous save, which feels like even bigger waste of time - there is no way I am going to go through same thing I have passed already and got the good stuff and upgraded my character. It's just not fun at all and misses the purpose, because it's far from similar to replaying the game after death. It makes me not want to play it anymore because I don't know when save will work from the proper place and when it won't.

3. Numerous glitches, including popping through doors, attacks that were impossible to hit they still do, I believe it's some sort of trying to give an advantage to silly AI which sucks terribly.

4. Game performance is just plain awful. It has not been optimized for anything, and as far as the retro visual estetics go, clunkiness and non responsivness to keyboard is one more thing that CAN NOT BE ACCEPTED in game that has been out there for so long.

I swear, don't buy it. It's more frustrating than anything you've met and after reading revious others left you can see these are not an uncommon problems.

The gameplay is... Solid. It's turn based, so  you're hardly on the edge of your seat, but the enemies are unique and the taunts are funny. Lots of references. There's even a fantastic mod, ""Death by One Thousand Taunts"", which adds even more. It's great.

Because there's a surprising amount of workshop content for a near-six year old game, some mods add new skill trees, etc., so even if you do a playthrough of every skill type, there'll be new ones to try.

I never thought I could play rogue-likes. I'm not that great at Binding of Isaac, though that might be because you cannot save and exit it, however with Dredmor, you can save and exit, so you can come back and replay whenever you want.

Ensuite, quelques détails au niveau de l'interface : difficulté de voir certains objets lorsqu'ils sont sur le bord du mur inférieur (pareil pour les ennemis d'ailleurs) ou derrière une étagère/caisse/élément de décor; impossibilité de comparer les caractéristiques des équipements lorsque l'on tient l'un d'entre eux (si l'inventaire est plein, oblige à prendre un objet, le poser, prendre l'équipement dans l'inventaire pour voir ses caractéristiques); impossible de ramasser un objet sur une case adjacente s'il y a un allié sur cette case (créature invoquée), cliquer sur la case nous fait attaquer notre allié; option disponible pour ramasser les objets au sol automatiquement, mais ne fonctionne que sur la case sur laquelle on est (exception de l'argent, qui est ramassé sur les 9 cases) alors qu'il est possible manuellement de ramasser les objets sur les 8 cases autour; impossibilité d'avoir la carte autrement qu'en minimap et il n'est pas clair à la base de savoir quelles icônes représentent quoi (on voit facilement les escaliers, les marchands et les zoos, mais d'autres éléments seraient intéressants à voir, tels que les structures utiles aux quêtes secondaires, les statues, etc... qui sont en fait peut-être visible, mais vu la taille de la carte, c'est difficile à identifier); difficulté de savoir les dégâts que nous feront les ennemis; menus de ""crafts"" pouvant être fastidieux à naviguer (et je n'ai pas encore trouvé comment notre habileté dans les différents artisanats augmente), ce qui va avec une gestion complexe de l'inventaire (emplacements limités et nécessité de plusieurs objets spécifiques pour certains crafts, ce qui oblige à fouiller dans les crafts pour voir les objets que l'on peut créer, les composantes nécessaires, etc, etc, pour ne pas jeter ou vendre les composantes dont nous avons besoin); impossibilité de racheter aux marchands les objets vendus : un missclick et c'est tant pis pour toi!; voix énervante nous annonçant ""your inventory is full"", ""your health is low"", etc (je ne sais pas comment appeler cette voix).

Également, plusieurs objets n'ont pas leurs effets décrits. C'est volontaire et cela peut représenter un certain intérêt, mais je trouverais intéressant d'avoir ces effets affichés une fois que l'objet a été consommé une fois. J'ai personnellement du mal à tout retenir et je trouve énervant d'avoir à me servir d'une aide externe (notes personnelles ou site internet) à laquelle me référer constamment. (Cet élément est mineur et influe peu sur mon appréciation générale)

Build character, collect loot, be a god on one floor and die to a piece of vegetable on the next.


The long version:

This game is a turn-based, dungeon crawling, rogue-like-power-fantasy.

That last bit may sound contradictory but in the same game I slaughtered an entire room of 50 something+ monsters without batting an eye and ran like a baby carrot panda from a stupid corn thing.

The character building is fantastic as the player can choose a handful of skill trees which creates a lot of different character builds. Progressing down different trees in different order can create a new experience for the playthrough.

The rogue-like aspects are tweakable so the player can choose how difficult or easy a playthrough will be. They can even turn off perma-death and load a save when a character dies. Along with the built in options, this game is moddable with Steam Workshop support for easy browsing/installation.

Combat is turn-based and depending on how you setup your character it can range from flinging fireballs and running away until things are recharged to teleporting into the thick of things and slowly laying the smack down on every living thing in the area.

Crafting is a little clunky. It has a lot of depth and that can be a blessing and a curse. The player has a limited inventory space but the amount of crafting materials is a little overwhelming at first. In general, there is a crafting material for each craft (smithing, tinkering, etc) and for each crafting material there are multiple levels (copper, silver, brass, etc). Inventory can become cluttered unless the player is not a hoarder (what's wrong with you?) and they know exactly what they want to make and how much of a certain material is required.

On the other hand, the depth allows for a lot of customization and there are even recipes to be found on bookshelves to create even more things.

The humor and flavor text in the game is a bit of hit or miss. While it can be funny, at times it gets in the way of figuring out what exactly a skill does. This can also be half the fun for some.

As for the story, something something evil something something you are the one panda to save them all. Yeah, game's about loot and poking things till they're puddles of goo.

It's a great game for people who like to experiment with builds and go dungeon crawling/loot collecting through randomized levels. If you don't like the rogue-like element, you can turn it into a rogue-lite. Mods extend the fun.",1429997312,1429997312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A big fan of Gaslamp and their crew - I'm stoked to have been part of a lot of beta testing for the content of this game and even to where an achievement that I suggested on the forums has been added in! :D

Now. This game sets up the limits of...weird. And the DLC has only improved it. The crafting system is large and well varied, the Wizard Keys and finding graffitti scrawled on the walls with codes to new levels, all the loot you can shake a stick at, in-game vending machines selling you everything from baseballs to ground meat and nukes and Root Of T'char. 

The greatest thing about this game is how varied the outcomes can be. You have the choices of 6 different talent trees out of 15+ ones and none are ""right"" OR ""wrong."" The game gives you the freedom to play as you please and the Save-Exit function is a godsend when you start delving and you feel tired. Levelling up and playing is turn based and the enemies move as you move.

Overall: I have so much fun with this game that I've yet to finish ONE game. 70+ hours on and offline with this game and every time there's that itch to re-roll a character and try a new combination JUST BECAUSE the skill trees augment and vary your gameplay so much!

GOOD:
-Fair play RPG.
-Lots of contents, weapons, combinations, skill trees, items.
-So MANY bad/good puns and references to other bits of culture.
-Game never really feels 'unfair' or 'hard' as some other roguelikes. There's mostly always a way to live...mostly. Or run away.
-Diggles.
-Heroic Vandalism!
-Do you like eggs? WELL WE GOT A LOT OF 'EM!
-SO MANY community mods and addons for this game made by dedicated players. Hate the current skill trees/items? Well replace them!
-The monsters yell and insult you whilst you bash their heads in!
-Wands, nukes, steampunk, veganism, were-diggle skills, get Wizard-krunked, Astronomy, blacksmithing...gosh!

BAD:
-The game does have a tendency to be unbalanced at times when it is you happen to delve too quickly and the enemy levels outpace yours and you find yourself getting smacked upside the head.
-The same way you can combine types of damages on weapons and armor...remember that the enemy can do it too. Don't be shocked when you get slapped to all hell when you get hit by 4-8 different types at once and get instagibbed with Boss monsters.
-The game is rather lengthy and for some players it's a lot to sit through in one sitting. Breaks are nearly mandatory sometimes. Set your number of levels and difficulty in advance.
-Do not turn on permaDETH if you're not a fan of dying. Flushing away a couple hours/days work because you got teleported over a body of water and can't swim is enough to make you cry.
-Butcher Rooms. Nuff said.
-The stability of the game is still questionable at times and prone to some far-spaced but non-lethal bugs. It's a lot to deal with but the game is still stable.

PLEASE NOTE that this game is NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. This is a CLOSED project. Gaslamp has given up nearly all the resources to create the game back to the community to continue making content and debugging and in general have been very, very good to their players. 

From allowing us to name the expansions, to adding our own achievements, to allowing bug reports in beta they have done so much for this game and honestly...it's a project made with a lot of love.

I may be selling you this game wistfully but I guarantee anyone who buys and plays this wonderful project WILL enjoy themselves immensely. I do recommend this game.",1429813499,1429813499,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Roguelikes are at once brutal, Entertaining, And very often a timesink once you work out the patterns.They are the games where you quite casually toss characters into a meat grinder to see what comes out.Roguelikes are glorious, And this, While easier than the usual genre fare..Is a good option.

You begin by selecting a hero/heroine with no random name selector, Forcing some creative juices to flow.The next screen is somewhat more imposing, Especially the first time.Seven skill groups are picked that define what your character can do in the game context, And then you are let loose with a short blurb that basically says the hero meant to head down was on his lunchbreak, So you go down instead.

The above build i mentioned is based around a style of play, Namely that of the sturdy and/or drunken warrior.It is very possible to be a sneaky fellow lobbing crossbow bolts, A drunken mad scientist with helper fungus..Or a vegan emo-pirate, Because why not.The drops are random, Creatures silly and endearing, and victory is never a sure thing.

If worth nothing else, The game is good for a brief look to dip your toes into the roguelike genre.Skol!",1429573529,1429573529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- has a fun set of monsters
- invites you to try out new skill combinations, thus has replay value
- has a _great_ music
- includes lutefisk

but looking back, there are some negative points too:

- bugs roughly every 10 minutes (at least on the linux version), ranging from misplaced items (cant reach) or monsters (4 stacked upon), crashes every 30 minutes (after some in-game time / progress)
- the crafting system is dysfunctional (getting a lvl1 recipie in the last lvl of the dungeon - too random, too many ""silly""/useless crafts, 3 ingots for a simple item without stats - ingots too rare)
- fun for 99.9% of the game, then Lord Dredmor kills you with 2 strikes
- nonexistent help/tips: ""what does potion/mushroom xxx do?"" is part of most roguelites, but a simple tooltip how to use knightly leap or what some stat-gain gets you would be very pleasant.
- lutefisk cube: The idea is that you can transform every non-food item to lutefisk and then donate it to the fish-god who gives you a random item. But to have a good chance you need about 200 pieces. But trading a 13k gold item for 1 piece of lutefisk?? Would just need some price/lutefisk scaling.

Сегодня речь пойдет об игре под названием Dungeons of Dredmor.

DoD - это пошаговая RPG игра поджанра roguelike, созданая Канадской компанией Gaslamp Studios и полностью выполненная в пиксельной графике. Сюжет в игре прост и скучно банален - есть злодей, когда то заточенный в подземелье и готовый вырваться наружу,но наш герой не прост и собирается отправиться в самый низ подземелий, дабы сразить врага, вот и весь сюжет.

Геймплэй-же отнюдь, интересен и затягивает игрока целиком с самого момента запуска. В самом начале игры вам дается выбор пола, имени и способностей вашего персонажа, этих самых способностей целых 34 штуки, хотя выбрать вам можно будет только 7, которые по ходу повышения уровня будут улучшаться вами. Сами способности представляют собой сплав фэнтэзи, паровой механики и юмора, а так-же всяких разных ремесел, которые позволят в будущем создавать и улучшать экипировку главного героя. Далее ваш персонаж появляется на 1ом этаже подземелья, где его дружелюбно или не очень встречают двери за которыми таится ваша смерть, или же нет ? В этой игре все основано на удаче, на каждом этаже есть тонны ловушек, сундуков и дверей которые так и жаждят чтобы их открыли, сломали или разбили, все зависит от вашей удачи, ну и от отмычек конечно, куда-же без них ? По мере прохождения вы будете спускаться все ниже и ниже, тем самым увеличивая уровень сложности, попутно уничтожая полчища монстров с отличными друг от друга характеристиками и слабостями, собирая разнообразную экипировку, материалы и зелья. У главного героя есть 6 основных характеристик и 18 дополнительных которые будут расти в зависимости от вашего уровня и снаряжения одетого на героя. Ах да, чуть не забыл, в игре имеется разнообразнейшие волшебные палочки, растения, метательное оружие и сыры. Нет, серьезно, просто море сыра, а так-же есть разные квесты которые дает статуя богини, наковальна бога Кронга позволяющая улучшать или ухудшать снаряжение в зависимости от желания самого бога и много, очень много другого.

Хардкорна ли эта игра ? Да, конечно-же, начнем с того что в игре есть функция Permadeath, удаляющая вашего персонажа после его смерти, я уже не говорю о том, что игра иногда делает вам сюрпризы ввиде толпы ядовитых или огненных гадов, окружающих вас со всех сторон.

Но есть и минусы, такие как например бессменный костюм главного героя, редкие магазины, а так же неимение мультиплеера, все это на самом деле не значительно по сравнению с количеством плюсов.

У этой игры есть 3 DLC, каждое из которых дополняет игру довольно сильно, а так-же доступен workshop, позволяющий изменять игру под вас и ваши желания.

Я часто спрашиваю себя, почему эта игра так популярна ? Из-за схожести с великолепным Dungeons and Dragons ? Из-за отличного, подбадривающего саундтрека ? Или может быть из-за толики юмора, столь саркастичного по отношению к самой игре ? Мне никогда этого не понять, но я все-равно запускаю игру, ставлю галочку перед надписью Permadeath и создаю персонажа. Снова и снова.

It took about three years of hiatus and 107 hours to finally kill Dredmor...[i]once[/i].  On Easy (and Permadeath)...

Dredmor is a roguelike, and I think it's a pretty good introduction to the genre since I've not really played many of them.  You start out by picking from three difficulties, if you want your character to be permanently deleted when he/she dies or not, and if you bought the Realm of the Diggle Gods expansion, if you want to have 10 or 15 floors.  From there, you're given a page full of skills and you're to pick seven to make your character build, as opposed to having set classes like Warrior or Battlemage or whatnot--or you can just pick Random and see how that does.  And then you're given your choice of cosmetic gender, you name your character, and you're sent on your merry way.

Everything is laid out on a grid and every time you move or attack uses up a turn, where everything else is allowed to move or attack.  You can quite literally stand with enemies surrounding you and nothing will happen until you do something.  You level up with enough EXP by killing enemies, destroying Dredmor statues, or unlocking doors/chests with lockpicks.  When you level up, you recover all HP/MP, and you're given your choice of your seven skills to raise which will influence how your stats increase.  Skills work on a linear tree system, but you're allowed to raise your skills in any order, between raising them all up evenly or maxing one as soon as possible.  Every skill in every tree does [i]something[/i], be it simply raising your stats by a set amount or giving you interesting new spells or moves or powers.

Combat is pretty much ""hit it until it dies"" if you're going melee, but every character can use crossbows provided they have ammo and wands as long as they have charges, no matter what build you went with.  Some enemies use long-ranged spells too, so it's a matter of using what you have to counter their threat.  Monsters typically don't show up en masse during the game except in Monster Zoos, big rooms where mooks and minibosses pretty much Zerg Rush you.  You don't necessarily [i]have[/i] to clear them out, but you get a free item for wiping everything out, and it's a lot of EXP, too.  You also get free items for doing sidequests gained by praying at the Inconsequentia statues scattered through the dungeons.  They're pretty basic quests--kill this enemy/group, retrieve an item, use this item on a special statue, etc.  

I think Dredmor is a pretty fair game in terms of difficulty.  If you die, it's almost always your fault.  Died to a trap?  You carelessly marched forward without enough Trap Sight Radius.  Fight an enemy to where the point both of you are near-death and you miss, dying to its attack?  You didn't heal yourself, retreat, try to lead it into traps, etc.  Of course, this game is randomly-generated so you can quite easily end up with a bad draw on items and stuff, but one draw of roguelikes isn't the game giving you the tools needed to win, but winning with the tools you're given.  No one game is unwinnable if you keep your wits about you and don't get complacent.  

The expansions...well, expand.  RotDG adds monsters, skills, items, five more floors; YHTNTEP adds more monsters, items, skills; CotW adds even more monsters and skills and items, but also adds new floors apart from the main dungeon on top of a customizable safe zone (though the base game has a basic version of this place).  There are also quite a few mods on Steam and not on Steam that add more of the above and with things like additional room layouts and so on, but some may require some or all of the expansions, so watch for that.  

So yeah, TL;DR I would really recommend this game.  If you're new to roguelikes, this is a pretty good place to start.  Easy mode is pretty easy, hard is pretty damned hard, but that all depends on how the RNG treats you and how you build your characters.  There are a lot of achievements here...though a lot of them require you to die to various critters.  But you know what they say:  Dying is fun!",1425580829,1542850109,True,5,0,0.560437679290771484,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Dungeons of Dredmor: An old schoolish, dungeon crawling, loot grabbing, Diggle killing, grid based, rogue-like indie game from Gaslamp Games. 

Dungeons of Dredmor is a really simple and challenging game, when starting a new game you are first asked to choose between difficulties, permanent death or not and smaller dungeons with the same number of enemies and, if you have the DLC an additional 15 levels to go through. You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons! 

The story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke. 

The game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game. 

Items come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft. 

The graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated. 

Music in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.

Dungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!

TL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future!

You have all the essentials:  procedural levels, turn-based combat, deep customization, perma-death, punishing but fair gameplay.  What really sets this apart for me from a lot of faithful rogue games is that unlike most rogue games that have tiny tiny sprites or ASCII graphics, Dredmor has big, beautiful sprites.  I cut my rogue teeth on Azure Dreams so I just got used to the idea of having a normal sized character on screen.  When I started getting into rogue games on PC, I was really disappointed to find so many had teeny tiny little sprites for graphics.  It made me feel more like I was looking down on an overhead map, it made it hard for me to get immersed in the game.  Dredmor solves that problem, has a normal sized character and enemies but in my opinion sacrifices nothing.  The UI is a little weird but not bad and you get used to it quickly.  My one complaint is that after dozens of runs, you do start to get tired of seeing the same enemies, but the expansions are cheap and great and I highly recommend buying all of them right off the bat.  It also adds more classes to the game, making the character customization possiblities go from large to astronomical.  Permadeath is optional but as far as I'm concerned, the only way to play.  The risk of death keeps you always on your toes.

The Dungeon/Item/GUI Art I think is great pixel stuff, but the Characters/NPC's look like they have a HEAVY Super 2xSai/HQx3/Whatever filter like what you'd find in an emulator and I think it looks terrible.

Not enough enemy variation imo. Also, the filtered look I mentioned makes them look so washed out.

Would help if gear showed up on your character as well.

Seems too easy on max difficulty. I get bored before going to far but I rarely die. I generally just stop playing and start fresh on the next run. It -might- get harder, I don't know.

E devo dire che merita il suo successo. In pratica, per chi non sa cosa sia un gioco ""rogue-like"", si tratta di esplorare dungeon su dungeon, affrontando mostri su mostri e raccogliendo centinaia di oggetti. la visuale, dall'alto, gode di una grafica grande e dettagliata e lo stile è colorato e scanzonato. Potremo scegliere a inizio gioco un avventuriero o un'avventuriera dalle ENORMI sopraciglia (e dico ENORMI!!!) e scegliere le abilità che useremo durante tutto il gioco. In questo modo potremo avere un classico guerriero, un ladro, un mago o qualcosa di originale mischiando le carie abilità. La componente gdr è piuttosto sviluppata, con molte statistiche da tenere a bada e le skill sono varie e piacevoli. I dungeon sono molto vasti, con teletrasporti e centinaia di accessi ai piani superiori o inferiori. I nemici sono moltissimi (a volte entrerete in camere chiamate ""monsters zoo""!) e tutti ben disegnati, spesso molto spiritosi e il loot vario e abbondante. Avrete anche accesso ad una vostra camera personale (in qualunque momento, essendo interdimensionale) dove lasciare gli oggetti in più, visto che l'inventario non è proprio capiente... Il gioco non è in tempo reale, ma a turni che lo imitano. Ogni vostro passo, attacco o semplice attesa (premendo la barra spaziatrice) fa avanzare il tempo, facendo muovere i nemici sullo schermo o facendoli attaccare. Ci sono poi statue da distruggere e altre che danno side-quest (molto semplici a dire il vero), divinità da nutrire con strani prodotti finlandesi e incudini per migliorare l'equipaggiamento. C'è anche un sistema di crafting (che però ho usato pochissimo, in giro si trovano oggetti molto migliori, almeno per i guerrieri puri). Come dicevo il gioco ha molto humor, centinaia di citazioni e idee divertenti... però è tutto in inglese, non difficile da tradurre per carità, ma magari questo potrebbe fermare qualcuno di voi. Non so se in giro per internet esiste una traduzione. Ultimo appunto, esiste un esteso workshop, pieno soprattutto di nuove skill. Elementi negativi non ne ho trovati, però è ovvio che il gioco è abbastanza ripetitivo come meccanica, essendo un esplora-ammazza-raccogli. Se però questi giochi vi piacciono, gdr con tanta ""azione"", allora Dungeons of Dredmor fa per voi!!!!

The game is pretty easy to understand. You get thrown into a dungeon in order to defeat the evil final boss. But before you are able to reach him, You will have to face plenty ammounts of floor with alot of different monsters. Monsters will get stronger on each floor and will be different too. You will encounter random events, quests, challenges, vending machines and alot of other things. Monsters are always able to spawn, even from behind in the fog. You are able to level up, getting new items and you are able to safe the game at all time.

Gameplay could be repetitive and is not having alot of variety.
Music is pretty bad.
Graphics is okay.

(Like, really minor, but spoilers nonetheless.)

This game is a unique combination of simple, easy, difficult, relaxing, laid-back, humorous, and just general old-fashioned fun. Holy crap it's fun. Basically you crawl your way through levels of the dungeon to get to the main bad-guy, accumulating a number of unique and silly items, skills, and badassery. Levelling up always feels good, and gaining a skill almost always has a noticeable affect on your combat.

Fair warning, you will die a lot. And if you're like me and love pain, you'll play on perma-death (which is optional). On about my fifth character, I was really getting into the swing of things. I had tons of items. I had a pocket dimension I could go to to dump unwanted detritus that might be useful in the future, and I'd just made it through the second floor (still haven't seen the third; the floors are fairly big and ooze with content and monsters). I was fairly powerful at this point, at least for the floor I was on, and easily laid waste to waves of monsters with the help of my zombies and clouds of poison that I conjured. So, feeling like a badass, I hopped over to my pocket dimension to drop off some loot, when I noticed that from said dimension I could also leap to other dimensions! ""Okay, cool,"" so I did. Plowed through one small dimension, no sweat. So I go to another, run into two monsters, kill myself with my own poison cloud. It was my fault for not paying attention, but alllll the hard work, the several hours I'd put into his skills, levels, items. Gone!

At that point I said to myself, ""Okay, this is probably the point where going back to the first dungeon just becomes a tedious grind, and I won't want to play anymore."" Well tonight I felt like trying again, trying some new skills. Frankly, it's no less fun than when I played for the first time. The floors are all randomly generated, so it's never the same run between characters.

My current character has kicks that literally explode into fire, tearing through enemies like nothing, and I'm only on the first floor.

It's not just the content, it's the little quirks. You can tell the developers had a blast making this game. Everything shines with creativity and humour, and it's just a lovely little game gah I love it.

By that, I mean that your actions count as turns. You don't go into a battle mode, the entire game works on turns. If you take a step, pick up an item, use an item, use a spell, use an attack, defend... all of these things count as a turn. So whenever you do something, every enemy gets to as well. This is also used in coodowns on abilities and regeneration of health and magic. Insead of waiting on a timer, you do actions to keep the game moving. It's great for pacing. Before you even start playing, you have some options you can set, and then you get to pick from a number of different abilities. So you're not restricted to a class, as in some other games like this. Instead, you just pick whatever abilities you want, which is fun for customization and replayability. As you level up, you can chose to level up those abilities as you see fit, but only one per level. The gameplay, aside from the turn system, is pretty standard. You walk around a huge dungeon, fighting enemies and looting the place. You can also craft a great number of things along the way, provided you have the materials, the tool used to craft it, and enough points in the required skill to make the item. This is where I start to have some issues.

See, you can pick your own skills. You can also level your own skills as you please. But sometimes you'll pick skills that don't cover the areas you need in order to make certain items. If you don't have that to level up, you simply cannot make those types of items. That can be annoying. It can also be annoying to have all the materials, the skills, and not the tool required to make the item. Although that can be remedied by finding one somewhere in the dungeon. My biggest complaint is that the inventory you have is a tad small. It makes you have to manage your items well, constantly craft items to use up materials (but that's not always so easy to do), or constantly backtrack to the shops to sell things. I guess you could leave stuff laying around but then it'd go to waste. Having a few more slots would help a lot. I guess it comes with the territory of looting. And with the skill complain, I suppose you just have to plan ahead and know what you can and can't do, which in turn will help you identify which items you do and do not need. Some of the skills in the begining don't explain what they do, choosing to have a joke description instead. This can be annoying to deal with and try to remember what they actually do later. Some of the drinkable and edible items you get aren't specific about what they do either. You might drink something or eat something that puts a debuff on you, hurts you, or even kills you! And the game is littered with traps. Some you can see, some you can't. Sometimes you can go around them, sometimes you need to walk over them to get to another spot. Sometimes you can disable them, sometimes that'll fail and they'll go off anyways. Imagine hitting a random trap that you couldn't even see, only to have THAT be the end of all your hard work. With permadeath on (as the default), it's quite maddening. 

Still, this game is massive and... very difficult. I've sunk almost 20 hours into it as of right now and and never made it past the second floor. Am I bad? Maybe. But it's pretty easy to die from random stuff. I may have misread this but I think there's something like ten floors normally and fifteen with the expansions. So there's tons of stuff to do in this game. There's even tons of things I haven't even figured out yet! It's an amazing amount of content and playtime for what only costs you 5 bucks. Heck, toss in the extra buck for the DLC and get even more out of it like I did. It's very well worth the price tag and I'm really surprised it isn't going for more than that.

While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.

Good: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.

Bad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering. 

Ugly: Not much.

Possibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of ""I move, then all enemies move, then I move"" is showing its age as a design process.

So many skill trees means that the customization are nearly infinite - every game is different, every character is different, every time you press ""New Game"" is a new experiment. IMHO the only negative thing is the last boss itself: if with a mix of careful actions, knowledge of the game and a little help from the blind goddess you can often survive long enough to reach the final boss, with nearly every playstyle, killing him is another story - he is really powerful, a lot more than the normal enemies, and with some builds is practically impossibile to beat (especially if you are a melee fighter). It's also a positive point - this is a roguelike game, so it's a good thing that it's not too easy - but often to beat him you must change drastically your playstyle, put away many of your abilities and use one of the possible specific strategies.

Но есть пара минусов и плюсоминусов: она не очень сложная (ну по крайней мере, на лёгком уровне сложности), музыка приятная, но со временем немного приедается, приходится отключать. Ну и у меня иногда подвисает, но возможно, что это проблемы моего пека.

Pros:
- excellent systems for crafting, damage/resistances, and character stats
- a myriad of skill trees, of which each character can choose 7 (can you say synergy?)
- completely irreverent pop culture references, quotes, and tropes, all with great dry wit
- simplistic control scheme for entry level players (but still as satisfying for veteran rogues, IMO) 
- huge selection of items, randomized weapons, potions, and unlockable crafting blueprints

Cons:
- can't see armor on your character
- very easy to get lulled into a false sense of security and then get merked
- diggles

This game is incredible. It's similar to Pixel Dungeon, but deeper and more difficult (as there are many paths to ultimate victory). I've been playing it on easy and medium levels and the difficulty ramps up in jumps, but each time I experiment with builds I get closer to success.

The game mechanisms are straightforward: Kill monsters, collect loot, improve your class-specific skills and delve deeper until you face Lord Dredmor himself and slay him for great glory.
There are, of course, some sidequests (issued by the godess Inconsequentia herself) that are equally procedurally generated as the dungeon itself, as well as Monster Zoos or other opportunities to obtain some especially fat loot.

What I especially like about DoD is its humor, especially when it comes down to achievement hunting, for which you mostly need to die for the most diverse reasons, and generally recognising all the pop (and nerd) culture references.
A big plus is that this game is also easily moddable via Steam Workshop, even though lately the number of good mods is mostly stagnating.

Long story short, DoD does everything right that a rogue-like needs to get right and some things are even done much better. Therefore, I can only highly recommend it.

Dungeons of Dredmor is simultaneously an addictively expansive roguelike with heaps of replay value and a disappointingly, shallow experience, and in this way, it is the World of Warcraft of it's genre. For it's price it absolutely is worth it, but at the end of the day you are left wishing the devs would have put a bit more thought into the game to create a solid experience.

At it's base, DoD is a turn-based dungeon crawler with painfully basic combat. You walk around rooms, meet monsters, left click them until they're dead. Occasionally you'll meet a situation where the enemies are statistically and/or numerically superior to you, at which case you must randomly spam offensive/defensive items and abilities at the issue until it's solved, and you really don't even have to pay much attention to exactly what it is you're using. It's just too inconsequential, regardless of the vast amount of options available to you. Increasing the difficulty or enabling perma-death somehow manages not to address this issue, it simply requires for you to pay more attention to the handful of mechanics that really matter. It might seem better for the first few floors of each playthrough, but regardless of settings and skillbuilds, the experience will degrade into the above mentioned simplicity by floor 5 no matter what it is you do, which is primarily due to XP and high level items being too abundant, leading to overleveling reducing the difficulty. Again, this stems from a lack of critical thinking employed in the basic game design, and while it'd be unfeasible to change anything at this stage of the game, it should have been taken much more seriously back in it's development infancy. The importance of a balanced experience distribution in an RPG game is one of the first things any old scrub with a couple hours of dabbling in RPG Maker learns, so it's downright embarrassing that Gaslamp Games took it so lightly.

So that's the core of the game. Why is this a good purchase then? Well the game has three factors that save it from itself; Humor, Content and Steam Workshop.

Humor, I would say, is DoD's greatest asset. Without it's presence, it would crumble and fall into the realms of indie shovelware, and it combines together with a feature that you can never go wrong with; content. So there's a lot of humor is what I'm trying to say. So the way this game works is, after presumably completing the short tutorial course, you start a new game and enter character creation. This process is unlike anything you've experienced before. You right off the bat get to chose a number of skill trees (1-8) for your Adventurer and decide your playstyle on the spot. The fun factor in this is all the various combinations made possible by this formula. Simply put, you can be a regular Melee user, a wizard or a mix of both, and if you'd like you can take the Warlock tree to help with that. Or not. It's very freeform, although hard to explain. Right off the bat you'll notice via the Skill Trees' descriptions that the game's funny. You have skill trees like ""Battle Geology: Like all geologists, you can create earthquakes, armor yourself in stone, and petrify enemies. "" and ""Warlockery: Warlocks are wizards that really wish they were warriors. Or Rogues. Or cheesemongers. Anything but wizards, really. Their ""spells"" (as they are) serve to make them less wizard-like in a variety of ways."". If these two make you chuckle, or at least make you go ""heh"" internally, then you'll have an absolute blast once you actually plunge into the game. Every item name, item description, skill, spell, room, monster, monster description - really everything that's anything with words on it will have humorous dialogue that simply never gets goddamn old. Even monsters often make snarky comments from a list of a thousand or more phonemes. It ranges from low to high brow humor, references and even some memes here and there and it never feels distasteful or tired. If you're imaginative and weird, like me, you could also give a voice to all the text in your head, so that the Narrator from Trine 2, or hell, Jef Goldbloom says all the stuff, and it'll be all the more hilarious. And there's tons of this content, just tons and tons and tons. Rightfully so, because the game consists of 10-15 dungeons per run with each floor taking at LEAST an hour to complete unless you're leaving stuff unexplored.

This is where the Steam Workshop comes in. I personally don't recommend playing the game without all 3 DLC's installed AND the majority of the workshop content subscribed to and loaded up. The almost inexhaustible supply of content is the single one thing that can and will distract you from how shallow a game Dungeons of Dredmor actually is. When you're pretending to be a Vegan Necromantic Steampunk Knight and reading funny bits all the time, you don't care about gameplay. You'll be immersed into the whackiest, stupidest scenarios you've ever seen and you'll make it work. It's all novelty, but when there's this much of it, it works better than a real freaking game.

I should fleetingly mention that crafting and inventory management is a huge hit and miss. During some runs, I'll have patience and indulge in the hassle that comes with dealing with it. Other times I'll simply ignore 90% of the loot that spawns all over the floor and wish they put more effort into it. Ironically, while I'd say it's bad in this game, DoD's crafting is exactly what today's MMOs could use in order to make crafting actually freaking interesting. Because MMO's are MEANT to be timesinks, and items there would be worth the literal hours it takes to get specific equipment with noticable and snazzy uses like in DoD. As opposed to stupid junk you will NEVER pawn off on marketplaces, nor even think about using yourself. Oh and the music is loud and obnoxious but it grows on you.

One last, last thing; The gameplay is crap, alright, fine. But I should tell you that if you're of the particularly imaginative sort, there's plenty of room to create fun, self-imposed challenges that could alleviate this issue. On a basic example, you could stylize your character to only wield clockwork/steampunk styled items, which limits your equipment and arsenal. You can take concepts like this to much deeper levels that I can't really explain without you having played the game. It's like those weird people you see on GameFAQ's making up weird challenge run guides for Final Fantasy games. You can do that if that's your sort of schtick.

-TL;DR-

Gameplay: 2/5 - Shallow. Relies on your imagination to make it fun. Not for the casuals.
Replay Value: 5/5 - There's lots of ways to play and things to try and as a Roguelike, the game does excell.
Content: 5/5 - Thousands upon thousands of hilarious descriptions, names and phonemes is the game's primary source of fun.
Music: 3/5 - It grows on you, but nothing to write home about. Title song is catchy.
Art: 3/5 - It's pixelart. It's alright. Level art styles will leave you scratching your head sometimes.",1416180361,1416180822,True,21,5,0.717735826969146729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Those who say that have not met our Lord and Saviour Lutefisk. The Lutefisk is a kind giver, and also a taker, for one cannot recieve what they are not willing to give away. Thus has been taught to me by the Lutefisk. As we delve deeper, we will all be taught by the Lutefisk; we will all join the Cult of the Lutefisk. However, a new Cult is not the only thing that Dungeons of Dredmor offers. 
   
   As a roguelike RPG, gameplay is simple: run around, grab loot, kill monsters, and don't die (and not just because Lutefisk does not promise an afterlife). However, there are many fun and exciting features. An advanced set of skill selection, in the form of multiple skill trees with linear paths, keeps combat unique and different. For example, I have had builds where I run around and just kick monsters to death (yes I mean kick, as in with a boot) while dual-wielding shields and builds where I teleport in, drop mines, push monsters onto said mines, and teleport out of explosion-related danger. There are several different interactions in the game that either reward or punish you. For example, Krong, the God of Anvils, leaves blessed anvils randomly on floors in the dungeon that you can enchant your gear with. It is not until you place your gear on the anvil, the point of no return, when you find out if Krong blesses or curses you. And of course, interactions involves our dear Lutefisk. Tithing Lutefisk at a Lutefisk Shrine, a food item that offers barely any health regen, may appease the Lutefisk God, and he may give you an enchanted item. DoD also offers a completely fair difficulty curve: each floor means significantly harder enemies. Therefore, as logic dictates, you should complete the entire floor you're on for as much experience and items as possible. The only exception to this rule is random minibosses and of course, Dredmor. Minibosses are literally there to make sure you're paying attention to the game. If you're punching everything, and notice this one monster is doing half your health in one hit, you should probably use a different strategy. Dredmor is a completely overpowered piece of... bologna... but I mean, to me this makes sense. It's HIS dungeon, HIS realm of power, and you're trying to stop him. If he was weak, why would a HERO (and quite the hero you are!) need to stop him? If nothing else, this hard task merely forces you to further investigate every chest, to question every move, and to work ever harder at making that perfect combination of skills. 
   
   Another good part about this game is that it's very accessible. There are three difficulty levels, permadeath is optional (so you can save your dearest characters), there is an option for smaller floors with the same experience gain, and with DLC, there is an option for 5 more floors of grinding before the boss. Speaking of DLC quickly, two DLC packs are super cheap (2.99 USD each and actually the Deluxe edition has the game and those two DLC for just 6.99 USD), and the third DLC pack is free. Cheap and easy to get into means that casual players can enjoy as well, while advanced difficulties and more options means that the hardcore Roguelike fan can cater to their style as well. 
   
   Another important thing about DoD in my opinion is the community. This is one of the most friendly, most helpful, best communities I have ever experienced on any game ever. Most questions get answered in minutes, and the number of guides for new players is seemingly limitless. These same helpful and friendly people also make amazing mods that add even more playability to a game I haven't been bored for even a second in. 
   
   TL;DR: All in all, DoD is an accessible, fun, pun-packed, Cult-creating, deceptively simple Roguelike RPG with a good community and workshop integration. I would highly recommend this game even off of a sale, and when on sale I will attest that it's literally a ""can't miss"". If anybody has any questions, ask in the comments section, I will do my very best to answer them in a timely manner. Similarly, I will try to continue to edit this guide at appropriate times.

This thing has hilarious descriptions for everything from en-meatening Pork Swords to cringe-collecting Meat Wands.

Not everything in this game is a dick joke, either. Beyond the humor, the gameplay itself is compelling, because it basically makes no attempt to balance its skills, and allows you to take something like 7 of them right off the bat, from a pool of something like 30. Then, when you advance, you choose which skill to improve, which usually boosts your base stats a little and then gives you some kind of rules-bending ability/spell/mutation/fell aspect that fundamentally changes the way you play the game after acquiring it. This makes every playthrough new, and is only helped by the semi-random dungeon, with its themed floors and heaps of treasure. Seriously, this game has so much loot they give you an interdimensional ROOM (forget bag) of holding to store all of it in. This is important, because there's also CRAFTING! Which is practically a minigame of economy in and of itself if you choose to go that route. Fortunately, since that item management shtuff is not for everyone, it is totally possible to play through the whole game without ever crafting a single thing; turning all that useless detritus into lutefisk for the lutefisk god. He is a benevolent fishy deity that you will come to worship, should you delve deeply enough into the dungeons.

Anyway, there are a LOT of quality roguelikes out there. Why pay for this one when you could enjoy a free one like Dungeon Crawler: Stone Soup? I think it's simply down to the overall quality of the game; as a whole, it makes for an attractive, entertaining, funny look at the genre that is both a sendup and an experience that stands well on its own, once you get past the laughs.",1415241796,1415241796,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

November 4, 2014
Where to begin... Well, I guess let's try and figure out where and why I bought this game. That may shed a little light on how Dungeons of Dredmor (Further referred to as DoD) came to be in the 1K Game Stream Challenge.

As best I can guess, DoD came with a bundle of games. Either some HumbleBundle or one of the other ""Value Bundles"" being sold by one of the flavor of the month Steam Key re-sellers on the internet today. See, the Indie Developers tend to get their games lumped together, because the consumer of PC games seems to like value above quality. This is not always the case, but unless your dealing with the likes of HumbleBundle, then you're probably going to find a few games in each bundle that equate to a happy meal toy.

Let's start at the beginning. For the record, I knew nothing about DoD coming into the playthough. I literally couldn't have told you anything about the game. After playing it for 3 hours straight on cast, I can tell you it's a Rogue-like RPG Game, and that's about it. From the point I started playing, I was confused by the mass amount of loot just lying around. Some may find this interesting and want to pick up every little thing, but honestly it seemed more like a videogame about hording than adventuring. There is so much crap lying around that you spend far more time messing with the tiny inventory screen than the tool belt where you store important spells and skills. This seems boring and tedious, neither are what I consider a gaming experience. Even trying to figure out the crafting system was cumbersome and not intuitive.

Now, I am a supporter of Indie Games and when it comes to Rogue-Type games, I love them!  Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Rogue Legacy are amazing. The difference is they are mainly platformers, and this plays well with the Rogue style of death machines. You care very little in most cases that you have to start over. In DoD this can be a nightmare if you leave the Rogue option on. Starting over each time is hell if you've just lost an hour of crafting work. One final note, that may be just a gripe,  in the game the characters always look the same no matter what armor you equip them with in the menu. Metacritic's average complete argues against my finding with a 79 for overall reviews. I would probably have put this more in the range of 40-50 based on the issues I've stated above.

The one area that DoD wins in is price. Being an Indie title, the cost of the game is going to be on the lower side of the scale. When I say the lower part of the scale, I mean less than $5 on steam everyday. The complete edition is $6.99, and has a decent offering of DLC. The other advantage to DoD is that it supports user mods from the Stream Workshop, which can really extend the life of any game. To be fair, I did not install any files from the Workshop. I can't say that I would recommend  buying the game, but if the opportunity arises that some bundle has the game, give it a try and see if you can find anything interesting from user generated mods.

I've mentioned in other reviews that I don't like games with a short lifespan and little replayability, well this game then is an absolute wonder to me because not only does it provides almost an endless amount of gameplay and tons of replayability, it is incredibly addictive and fun to play.

The mechanics are very simple and there is little to no story at all, which leaves your imagination to get carried away and fill in the gaps as you crawl through the large dungeon areas slaying hoards of quirky little monsters and farming items you have no desire to eat, use or sell. This is a game where you will probably only ever be using the arrow keys and a mouse click, and the simplicity of this provides an easy gaming experience.

I will say I have never played past the medium difficulty level, and I will go further as to say that I have never even completed a single save, I don't usually play with permadeath on either, it's mainly a case of me creating various heroes and forgetting how far I got on each one and deciding to start all over again. This is not a game you could finish in one sit through, even when enabling the mode which reduces the size of the levels, this game is still massive and takes a lot of time to cover each area and collect each item.

One thing I would imagine playing this game is that the simplicity and repetitiveness of this game would get boring, but it never seems to do that, I believe it is probably the desire to push on for more loot, gold and exp to max our your skill sets, as well as find interesting new items with cool stats and comparing them with your current inventory, perhaps one of the most thrilling discoveries you can make on any level is finding the store, which always stocks a bizaare inventory.

The music is also really good, and while it may feel repetitive at some points, it still manages to sound really great and perhaps helps in setting the mood for becoming immersed in the game.

I would say the main factor for enjoying this game is that it excels in making you feel that you have achieved and made progress, there are a lot of achievements you can unlock, and two expansions which add more levels and crazy skills to master, this is definitely a great entry and perhaps a little overlooked work within the roguelike genre and I cannot recommend it enough.

That being said, this game is pretty buggy at times, the levels appear to be randomly generated and at times this can result in some items being blocked off and unattainable without the right skills, and this while slightly annoying, doesn't really take much away from enjoying the game, the game was also very buggy when I played it around it's time of release, but it does seem a lot more stable now.

It has some things that really annoys me, first and foremost the lack of transparency in many places. But that's nothing that a few seconds of search on the great wiki won't fix (not to mention that it's less of an issue when you aren't obsessed with min/maxing the way I am).

Overall the many qualities completely overshadow the few problems. Really good aesthetics and tone of the game make this possibly the most appealing roguelike I have ever played. The way class/skills interact makes for a a huge depth of strategy and builds to explore while being amazingly well balanced for such a complex system. The system looks weird and hapazard at first, but once you get used to it you realize that there is a framework of simple concepts underlying it all; and once you see that, it's very easy to grasp how various things interact and how new things will work. That makes for an exceptionally experience in mastering the game and getting to know how it works.

The great community and all the love the developpers poured into it (obvious from the large and completely free DLC that's available) seal the deal, making it one of the best games I have ever played.

Also it makes Dredmor not twice as hard, but TEN FUCKING TIMES HARDER THAN HE SHOULD BE, and ends up dragging the game not to a crawl, but to a crippling, sliding, agonizing limb-shaking slide across the floor. It's fucking terrible. I get there are hardcore gamers out there but this is just fucking ridiculous. It's like turning your bicycle gear all the way down and then going up hill.

Es ist Rundenbasiert (ohne Wartezeit) und man sollte auf den späteren Leveln schon aufpassen das man nix überstürzt :P

Según [url=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike]Wikipedia[/url] podemos encontrar una lista de características y Dredmor las cumple todas.

Ahora empiezo con mis palabras: Dungeons of Dredmor es un roguelike nacido en la ápoca en la que este tipo de juegos han ""resurgido de sus cenizas"" y la gente se ha hecho eco de este tipo y hay un gran número de ellos en el mercado. Puede que no sea gran cosa gráficamente, puede que la música no sea de vuestro agrado, pero intentad darle una oportunidad y observareis que el juego os va a borrar del mapa en cuanto os descuideis.

Este juego tiene una gran libertad tanto en ""perks"" del personaje cómo en acciones: ¿Quieres ser un hombre-diggle emo comunista vampiro? Adelante. ¿Prefieres ser un herrero con artes mágicas egipcias y turista? Ningún problema. ¿Quieres beberte ese alcohol puro 100% que has encontrado en el suelo y que probablemente consiga envenenarte? Trae p'acá ese alcohol.
Hay que tener en cuenta que estamos en una mazmorra totalmente hostil, aquí no hay nadie que te pueda ayudar, salvo Brax que es nuestro ""querido"" vendedor, un demonio que no durará en mandarte al nivel 1 de vuelta si quieres robar algo de su tienda. Bueno, también hay máquinas expendedoras... en una mazmorra. Sí, yo tampoco sé con qué están encendidas, pero bueno.

Llegar al nivel 10 y encontrarnos con Dredmor será todo un reto, pero el propio Dredmor no será ningún hueso fácil de roer, luchará hasta el final con una dureza extrema hasta que sólo quede en pie uno de los dos.

A pesar que antes hemos comentado las características de un roguelike, Dungeons of Dredmor proporciona una opción para la gente que no le gusta morir y perder el personaje, por lo tanto podemos encontrarnos con 3 niveles de dificultad (""Los elfos quieren divertirse"" o fácil, ""Moderación enana"" o normal y por último ""Yendo Rogue"" o difícil) y una opción para elegir si queremos jugar con permadeath o no.

En la página de Steam junto al juego encontraremos 3 DLCs para el juego, comento por encima lo que lleva cada uno:
[list][*]Realm of the Diggle Gods: Aquí encontraremos 5 niveles más para el juego (es decir, ahora Dredmor nos esperará en el nivel 15), seis nuevos perks que podremos elegir entre saqueo, emomancia, persona-diggle... y nuevos objetos, aparte de más cosas.
[*]Conquest of the Wizardlands: Aquí podremos encontrar Wizardlands, unos nuevos niveles a partir de códigos que podremos conseguir por ""graffitis mágicos"" que encontraremos por la mazmorra, Diggle Hell, seis nuevos perks entre los que encontraremos poder ser un banquero, un turista, un comunista... y por supuesto más objetos y enemigos.
[*]You Have To Name The Expansion Pack: Este DLC nos da cuatro nuevos perks, enemigos, objetos... no es tan extenso cómo el resto pero es gratis.
[/list]
Dungeons of Dredmor también tiene una gran cantidad de mods para el juego por la Steam Workshop, así que si estais hartos de ser un hombre-diggle vegano quizás podais encontraros a gusto siendo una gallina robótica del futuro (nota: si este mod no existe lo siento, es lo primero que se me vino a la cabeza)

Mientras avanzais por la mazmorra no os será raro encontraros con monstruos que os gritan frases extrañas mientras intentan hacerse un vestido con vuestra piel, y es debido a la gran cantidad de referencias que tiene el juego, ya sea por frases, objetos o cualquier cosa que podais encontrar mientras descendeis a por Dredmor.

Para la gente que no se sienta a gusto con el lenguaje de Cervantes, lo siento pero el juego sólo está disponible en inglés, aunque también es cierto que Dredmor no requiere un gran nivel de inglés.",1412207158,1412207158,True,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Es un roguelike que sigue el modelo de los dungeon crawler tradicionales de un heroe que adentra en una mazmorra para luchar contra el mal.

El juego no intenta profundizar mas alla de eso, no hay npc con los que relaciones mas alla del demonio de la tienda. Algunas estatuas de la diosa te pueden dar alguna mision y poco mas. El juego no intenta presentar un mundo o un guion solido. Tampoco hay puzzles o desafios.

Dungon of Dredmor es jugabilidad, ni mas ni menos. Los diversos modos y opciones para diferentes tipos de partida junto con el basto repertorio de arboles de habilidades donde elegir solo tienen como objetivo asegurar partidas variadas y una alta rejugabilidad.
Sumale un sistema de crafteo y encantamientos complejo, numerosos objetos y consumibles, niveles generados de forma aleatoria y una dificultad que castiga los errores y tendras una formula arcade que llega a ser bastante adictiva. El combate y el movimiento/acciones es por turnos.

El personaje dispondra de un inventario y las ranuras de equipo junto con una hoja de estadisticas. Si queremos craftear habra que elegir la habilidad  correspondiente y rezar para tropezar con el equipo (yunque, etc).

Cabe resaltar que todo el juego respira humor, desde las frases de los muros o las exclamaciones de los monstruos hasta las propias habilidades o equipo, todo esta repleto de detalles graciosos. En algunas ocasiones puede resultar hilirante.

El apartado grafico no luce bien ni lo intenta, lo primordial es la fluidez. Tampoco hay tantos modelos/animaciones de los enemigos como uno se esperaria. Los niveles si que estan claramente diferenciados. La BSO es igual de simple que el diseño visual, cumple y poco mas.

[b]Pros:[/b][list] 
    [*]Mucho humor
    [*]Gran variedad de: efectos de daño, objectos y consumibles, habilidades y estadisticas.

One of the original indie rogue-like darlings in my memory. A truly fantastic rogue-like with a great sense of humor, exploration and music to boot. This game is all about exploring randomly generated dungeons floor by floor until you reach the deepest level and defeat the big bad guy. That being said, it is no small feat doing so and will take quite a long time.

The game starts out by allowing you to choose a number of skills trees to associate with your newly created character from Mastery of Fungi to Viking Magic and everything in between. The first skill from each tree is automatically granted to you at the start of the game. Each time you level up you gain one skill point which can be placed in any skill tree you desire. This system of mixing and matching what skill trees are available to your character allows for a great deal of customization and replay value.

Each floor in the Dungeon of Dredmor is increasingly difficult and will require you to raise your level as well as seek out better equipment for your character. There are an incredible amount of items, weapons and armors for you to discover and that number is made even larger by secret recipes you discover along the way. Crafting is another large part of the game as many of the items you pick up are only useful for crafting other items. For example you come across many different type of ingots which are used to smelt armor and weapons both mundane and special. Without crafting these items simply take up space in your inventory so it is important to learn the usage of many items in recipes.  

There are monster galore in the dungeon and simply clicking on an adjacent creature will attack it. Enemies can dodge, block and even counter your attacks and the same goes for you. It's all in the stats and this game has many, possibly too many? Many more stats than I can go into here, but with such a wealth of useful ones there are plenty of ways to build a functional character.

The humor is spot on and I have found myself laughing at a number of things in the game from achievements to items and beyond. Enemies also like to give witty quips as you attack them and subsequently as they die. 

Musically Dungeons of Dredmor nails the MIDI sound and I can't say that's an easy thing to do. Usually I find MIDI sound to be quite limiting but not in this game. Almost all of the songs are very catchy and fit the mood one way or another. The soundtrack alone is worth checking out.

If you're not daring enough to get through the entire game on its intended settings you can disable permadeath and/or lower the difficulty.

This game is also highly moddable, which should further extend the large amount of replayability that already exists in the base game, just look at the steam workshop for some fantastic user created mods.

Everything around you kinda looks vomit-colored and some of the monsters blend in with the scenery so well that they look like furniture.

+ The game as well as it's DLC is often featured in the steam sale, so it can become very cheap
+ The amount of skilltrees featured in the game as well as the random level generation guarantees a unique experience each   playthrough
+ The variety is yet increased by the addition of mods via steam workshop
+ This game has great humor seen in the enemy taunts, item descriptions, skill descriptions or random stuff you find in your quest to slay dredmor

+- It's hard as balls! Be prepared to die over and over again. First you'll die at the first few floors, but as you get better you start dying in the last few floors because you're overconfident^^. 

+- I'ts not made for short play-sessions. Even on the ""No time to grind"" setting which let's you have smaller floors worth the same experience points it will take you 15+ hours to beat to game (or lose those 15+ hours dying from a mistake on the last floors)

To be honest the game doesn't really have glaring flaws, however combine the difficulty with the fact that you might spend a lot of time on one character only to see him die can be quite infuriating.

Sziasztok ! Gaaraati vagyok. 
Szerintem ez a játék egy tökéletesen kidolgozott roguelike játék. Én egyébként is nagy Indie és Roguelike fan vagyok úgyhogy nekem ez egy ""nobrainer"" volt. 
Ez egy olyan játék, ahol konkrétan beledobnak a közepébe és nesze b+ tanulj. Egy kis játék után hozzálehet szokni a félig-meddig rts, de mégis körökre osztott játék furcsaságához. A crafting rendszer végtelenül egyszerű csak a megfelelő anyagokat kell begyűjtenünk és mehet is a crafting.
A grafikájáról annyit szeretnék mondani, hogy nem egy BF3 és nem is kell annak lennie. A pixel-art egy tökéletes módja, hogy kifejezzük, amit szeretnénk és ez sok játékban vissza is jön.

[h1]In-Depth:[/h1]
Usually I am not a fan of turn-based games, but I love RPG's, which is why I decided to try Dungeons of Dredmor and it was totally worth it. You won't actually notice the turn-based part of it too much and you can even increase or lower the speed of the animations.

With a very quirky and enjoyable soundtrack comes along a great sense of humor as well. From item descriptions to enemy taunts, the game is filled with jokes and references. There is a lot of masteries and items to choose from, although the end game can feel slightly barren.

Crafting allows the player to both create new equipment but also enhance it. Several game modes add challenge to the game if it felt too easy. I've played it several hundred hours off Steam, but I keep coming back to it. Definitely a game that every RPG enthusiast should play.",1409966358,1620003892,True,4,0,0.586831629276275635,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Warto zaznaczyć że wszystko dzieje się w turach a każda przeprowadzona akcja (ruch, otwarcie drzwi, użycie umiejętności, atak itd.) to jedna tura, podczas której każdy przeciwnik może przeprowadzić czynności co trzeba brać pod uwagę podczas zarówno walki jak i ucieczki.

Dungeons of Dredmor has been my most favourite purchase on Steam.

First off is the choices when making your character, some sound normal and make sense such as Dual Weilding and Blacksmithing, and then you find the lower end which are just as useful if you know how to use them, Tourist where your camera flash stuns surrounding enemies and the fungal arts, unleashing the power of mushrooms within the dungeon.

Then we finally get into the dungeons, equipped with the various skills of choice and setting forth on our adventure, vending machines placed around the levels to give you the quick buy of food, drink and various items.

Food gives you health regen and alcaholic drinks give you mana regen, it's very realistic like that.

Now exploring the dungeon you will come across monsters, and of course you need weapons and armour, but don't worry you're spoilt for choice with swords, knives, axes, maces, polearms, tomes, wands, crossbows, traps and throwing weapons not to mention you can just fight unarmed if you choose too, and various armours  for preference can be found littered across the floors protecting all your squishly fleshy parts from harm

So with the choices of weapons, skills, armours and items, they must have been boring with the monsters right? Wrong! You will run across a large variation of bats, demons, slimes and diggles and many more things that must be killed before facing Dredmor.

Right now I suggest spending a measley $9.99 or so have a bit of fun, oh and see how many references you might notice within the game.",1409528486,1409528486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is fairly hack-and-slay, which can feel pretty tedious, but there's a ""no time to grind"" option for smaller floors, and synergetic abilities can finish battles a lot faster.

Tile based procedurally generated dungeon crawler.

From that alone most people will already know whether this is the type of game they want to play. If that's the kind of game that appeals to you, then you'll be happy to know that Dungeons of Dredmor offers a pretty polished experience in that vein.

However, the game is sadly a victim of the typical problems of procedurally generated games. Just as the items that litter the dungeon floor and the level layout are random, so are the enemy placements and sheer volumes of them, the knock on effect is you can wander floor after floor with few health recovering items being spawned while being expected to clear out swaths of enemies. The difficulty of enemies and power of the weapons found does increase as you progress through the dungeon; the usual difficulty curve that you'd expect, but because of the random nature, whether its actually possible to progress more than a couple of floors leaves you entirely at the whims of the game's random number generator.

The game features the concept of a ""Monster Zoo"", which is basically behind a door you'll find a room filled to the brim with enemies. Clear the room out and you'll be rewarded, though if you use stairs to escape to the safety of another floor, you'll forfeit the reward. These are cool the first couple of items you encounter them, but on later floors they're just a nuisance. I've had the first door I've opened on a floor be a Monster Zoo and been completely annihilated in mere turns.

The lone shopkeeper in the game also seems to be randomly generated rather than guaranteed every 'x' floors, which can lead to some frustration, especially when you're flush with gold and nowhere to spend it or simply tired of lugging a hundred items in your inventory intended for resale. The items he has on offer also vary each time, so you can be at Dredmor's doorstep only to find him trying to flog the types of items you didn't even bother picking up on the first floor.

As such whether you'll enjoy the dungeon crawling on offer here is purely down to your luck with what the game spawns for you. On the one hand, this is par for the course with these types of games, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that the game basically decides randomly whether it will be fun to play or not.

Destroying monsters, disarming traps, unlocking doors or smashing statues (for some reason) will provide experience, however level ups themselves aren't really of that much use. Instead of the traditional major boost to your stats (you get your health and mana raised by a painfully small amount), they basically just provide you a way of unlocking a skill in one of the skill trees you selected at the beginning of the game (so make sure you actually choose something worth levelling up, as appealing as it is to just let the game randomise it).

The game offers a lot of different ways to spec your character, but almost to the point of overkill. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and that extends to the options available here, but they only serve to muddy the waters as a lot aren't worth using. The steam workshop does feature a number of additional ones you can add to your game to extend it a little, some of which I found to be more useful than the default ones available.

The game provides a whole host of different weapon classes to choose from, but generally swords and arrows seem to be the most commonly found type in the dungeon. The game also boasts a magic system, but I was never able to work out how to make it work. In addition there are also wands you can use to cast spells regardless of your innate talent for the mystical, which are used in the same way as class based skills.

The item limit does feel a little restricting, but it does prevent you from trying to be a jack of all trades, since you simply don't have the space to fit all your alchemy ingredients alongside the ingots of metal you want to stockpile since they might prove useful at some point. I rarely ended up using them, but never failed up pick them up, something feels wrong about leaving loot lying around on the floor.

The game isn't the most aesthetically pleasing, but does at least feature a fair number of different enemies and the level tile sets fit together to make levels that fit together well. Each floor also makes use of a different tileset but for the most part that's all that sets floors apart so it can start to feel very ""samey"" by the time you've made it to later floors, though some do have some gimmicks like specific tiles that will erupt into flames when you walk over them.

As mentioned, the game is a light hearted affair (though that can go out the window when you're fuming over your most recent death), so the item descriptions feature of a lot of ""references"" or a simply ""funny"" designs themselves, such as the traffic cone helmet. Of course the enemies are all fairly whimsical too, for the most part you'll be finding some kind of penguin hybrid called diggles or black balls with arms, legs, a face... and a huge moustache. The most common health restoring item found in the game are various forms of cheese, though if that's a reference it was completely lost on me.

The game does feature a rather hefty, though initially confusing, crafting system. With the correct ingredients and a high enough ability in the corresponding skill you can craft everything from potions to armour to cheese on toast, the list of options gets rather long, and there's ""hidden"" recipes in the game that are uncovered by investigating bookshelves. However the limitations on inventory space led me to ignore the crafting aspect entirely for the most part.

Despite its shortcomings, the game can be enjoyable to play (if you can get a decent dungeon to play in), and scratches the itch of looting dungeons for progressively better items pretty well. Each floor can take a substantial amount of time to fully investigate as well, usually around 20-30 minutes I found. While the random nature of the dungeons does make the game infuriating at times and feel unbalanced, it plays well and the dungeon generation does at least feel different enough each time to offer up a reason to replay.",1407488038,1407488055,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If I had to pick a gripe, however, it would be an aesthetic one. I don't love the way the game looks, though it is serviceable. The main character's eyebrows are almost distractingly large.

A LOT of skills, crafting options, and equipment within the dungeon to choose from.
All skills are chosen from the very beginning and are upgradeable as you level up in the game. They range from highly practical to just downright shits and giggles (though still useful).
A lot of the fancy crafting has to be done with specific crafting skills that you have to choose when you start the game. They can range from armor, weapons, crossbow bolts, more crafting materials, potions, etc. Every type of item category in the game has a lot of items under them. The fancier stuff either have to be crafted or, if you're lucky, just found randomly as you explore.
Loot can be far too plentiful and since I usually like to hoarde loot I was easily overwhelmed by how much I had to let go and sell off to make room. If you're a bit lucky you can get a storage-like item in the form of a big room where you can put a load of crap in and access it whenever & wherever you want.
The whole game can be rather difficult if you just rush through it so you're sort of forced to keep killing enemies and exploring to find and/or make better equipment.

Along with the cool stuff here I've also got a few personal problems with this game and one of them is how lenghty these dungeons can be. I like to explore every nook and cranny of a dungeon usually and these maps can be huge. There are 10 levels in this dungeon (15 if you have that DLC). Exploring can be delayed by way of a huge mob of enemies coming at me, kicking my arse, and forcing me to reload to my last save thus having me think of better ways to get through said obstacles.
Another problem I have is that I crash every now and again when, I presume, it attemps to auto-save which I can't toggle on or off. Luckily there's a manual save but there's no real way to load a file while you're in the dungeon. If you want to quit the game you're either forced to save & quit, crash, or end the process via task manager. You can only make ONE file per playthrough too meaning you can't choose another slot for another save in one run; you only have your manual save file and your auto-save file.

This probably won't happen to everyone but the one thing that ticked me off the most is that after 30+ hours of playing this game I get to the final Level, run into the boss of this whole game (Lord Dredmor) and suddenly have him disappear thus leaving me with no way to finish the game. While fighting him he teleports every now and again just to mess with you and throw magic at you but for MY case he teleports and just vanishes. I've explored the whole dungeon multiple times to see if he's just messing with me again but he was nowhere to be found thus labeling my over-two-dozen-hour playthrough to be a waste. It was guaranteed a waste because my only saves took place after he bugged out since I thought he was just somewhere in the current level waiting for me.

I decided to review this game called Dungeons of Dredmor. This dungeon game is a tongue in cheek game that is quite a random dungeon romp, although it looks very silly and acts that way, it is quite a hard game..i have played it with lots and lots of difficulty. There are also references to lutafisk in it too. Not sure what that is about, it could be a reference to the developer of the game. I have yet to finish this game due to it's difficulty.

The game also contains several DLCS for it. One of the most unique ones is the one you can name yourself the DLC. There is even a achievement associated with it, which i found very interesting to do.

The game is well designed and quite fun, but i still found out it is very dififcult. I will recommend because of how good the game is designed.

Man erkundet mit seinem Avatar ein gefährliches Dungeon und hat das Ziel den bösen Herrscher Dredmor zu besiegen. Dabei startet man am Anfang mit einem ziemlich geringen Repertoire an Fähigkeiten und Gegenständen und muss sich erst mühsam hoch arbeiten.

Am Anfang wählt man den weiblichen oder männlichen Charakter, gibt ihm einen Namen und wählt zum Start ein paar grundlegende Fähigkeiten aus. Dabei kann man sich schon hier entscheiden ob man lieber als Magier spielt oder ob man doch lieber Schwert oder Axt schwingt oder irgendwas dazwischen. Im Spiel kann man dann gänzliche frei seinen Charakter formen. Man kann am Anfang einen gebrechlichen Magier haben und am Ende einen blutrünstigen Berserker der trotzdem noch mächtige Magie wirken kann. Es ist alles möglich. Danach wird man auch schon mit einer kleinen Erklärung zur Mission ins Dungeon geschmissen und kann es frei erkunden. 

Schnell wird man dann Bekanntschaft mit den ersten Monstern machen die man auch schnell besiegt hat. In den oberen Etagen sind die Monster noch relativ einfach zu besiegen, desto tiefer man in das Dungeon steigt desto stärker werden aber auch die Monster. Ab hier ist eigentlich alles wie in einem normalen RPG, man kloppt Monster weich, sammelt fallen gelassene Items, erreicht höhere Level, vergibt Skillpunkte, nimmt Quests an mystischen Statuen an. Und nicht vergessen Lutefisk zu sammeln!

Dabei darf man aber nicht vergessen das in Dungeon of Dredmor der Permadeath gilt! Stirbt man einmal ist alles vorbei und man darf wieder komplett von vorne beginnen. Deswegen wird man vor allem am Anfang sehr vorsichtig zu Werke gehen. Für Weicheier gibt es auch noch einen „Noob“ Modus bei dem nach einem Tod einfach der letzte gespeicherte Spielstand geladen wird. Im normalen Modus werden beim Tod die Spielstände gelöscht. Dazu gibt es noch einen Hardcore Modus der nochmal extra schwierig ist.

Die Grafik ist klassisch gehalten und einfach. Man merkt das die Grafik überwiegend handgezeichnet ist und es gibt viele kleine Details. Die Monster sind teilweise etwas eigenwillig gestaltet, nachdem man sich daran gewöhnt hat werden einem die Monster inklusive der putzigen Diggles schnell ans Herz wachsen. Die Animationen sind durchschnittlich, es gibt für fast alle Waffen unterschiedliche Schlaganimationen das war es aber auch schon. Die Präsentation passt zum Spiel, es gibt viele unterschiedlich gestalte Räume die alle Abwechslung ins Spiel bringen. Mit dem Steam Workshop kann man sich dazu noch sehr viele zusätzliche Räume, Waffen oder Fähigkeiten holen. Das einzigste was mir nicht gefällt ist, dass man Ausrüstung und Waffen nicht optisch am Helden sieht. Es ist schade wenn man eine richtig krasse Rüstung hat und der Held immer noch mit dem einfachen Wams herumläuft.

Dungeon of Dredmor ist ein Spiel mit Ecken und Kanten, aber es macht viel Spaß sobald man sich an den eigenwilligen Stil gewöhnt hat. Die Grafik ist einfach erfüllt aber gut ihren Zweck und hat trotzdem einige Details die einen schmunzeln lassen. Das ganze Spiel ist eher auf Humor ausgelegt, man möchte sich einfach einmal die Skillbeschreibungen durchlesen. Für alle die auf Rouge-like RPGs wie FTL stehen werden auch mit Dungeon of Dredmor viel Spaß haben.",1404937930,1404937930,True,11,0,0.683889091014862061,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- Loads of character and item stats and skills that govern almost all aspects of play and almost all of which can be important at some stage or another.  For example, the visibility range stat seems less than usefull until you get a great item that limits visibility and you are looking and just adjacent squares when moving.  Then you start looking for any other item with some more visibility stats!
- Power creep and level difficulty seem to balance quite well with just the right amount of toughness to keep you trying again and again.  
- Ability to combine a range of the many available skills make for near limitless variety in character buils. 
- Every character level you get to add a new power from one of the skills - so every level-up is actually worthwhile.
- Has that old rogue-like tension to it. Nothing like wandering around a monster filled level all beat-up  with no more food to heal and hoping the next door you open actually has food instead of monsters!
- Artifact system is cool as it makes true unique items out of any of the tons of standard items.  You can literally get any combination of extra stat bonuses to a fixed item.  The anvils that have a chance to upgrade items by adding random stats are cool as well.

Cons:
 - A bit too silly and cartoonish for my tastes - prefer my classic orcs, goblins and ogres - samurai robots, leprechauns and Diggles not so much.  Unique Item names are also nonsensical   - A sword called ""Sapfurpor the Potent Aardvark""!!  Really?
 - Not as much variety on monsters as I would like - lots of reskinning and just power creeping of a few core models.
- Crafting skills while implimented well are not as usefull as they could have been,  You can basically find any item you can craft (fairly easily) and with crafting you end up filling up spending way too much time collecting and organzing crafting componets. When i do take them it's more for that stat bonuses then the crafting itself. 
- A little unstable for me in the late game with lots of crashes but auto-save mitigates this rather well.
- Lack of decent documentation.  Had to resort to the wiki to actually understand what the heck many of these stats and skills actually did! 

Bottom line -  100 hours in and I am still enjoying the game.  How can you argue with five cents an hour for entertainment!",1404912996,1404912996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To get the basics of the game out of the way, Dungeons of Dredmor is a hilarious turn-based dungeon crawler RPG with permanent death and brutal difficulty (which are both technically optional but we all know how the game is meant to be played). I love this game and I've decided to present my thoughts in a pros-and-cons list:

[H1]Pros:[/H1]

-Consistently silly visual style throughout the artwork and sprites, which is retro-ish and visually appealing at when it wants to be. Sometimes it's just goofy and you have to wrap your head around the fact that they decided to draw a [i]mustache golem[/i].

-Charming audio design. The music is a bit repetive, but the sound effects of the enemies and spells are sometimes as silly as their descriptions. The real beauty of the ""sounds of Dredmor"", is the announcer. He is very HAM and his gruff voice is always there reminding you to DRINK MORE BOOZE.

-A fair number of skills to choose from and combine to make new characters, with many unique playstyles able to be experienced. I've heard that past roguelikes have had more deep character building and stats, but DoD still has excellent replayability and there are no class archetypes restricting your skill combinations.

-A very large amount of equipment and consumables available to collect, with an enchantment system that revolves around randomly added statistics and the possibility of cursing your equipment because you're a greedy SOB and we all know you'll ruin your best weapon with spontaneous combustion.

-Absurd enemy types (again [i]mustache golems[/i]) that randomly spout out movie references while rending you eye from brow.

-Absolutely every item/skill/enemy/random dungeon furniture description is worth reading.

-It has 3 difficulty options and [strike]optional permadeath[/strike] absolutely required permadeath for real gamers. Generally the game is pretty difficult, but you have options and that's a plus no matter what.

-Very cheap, the whole game and all DLC can be bought for less than $5 and that is incredible value in my opinion.

-Functional UI that adequately accommodates the many complex systems of the games. It's not perfect but it gets the job done.

[H1]Cons:[/H1]

-Some skills and skill combinations are just too reliant on finding good items or are outright too weak. While this trend is not uncommon in roguelikes, in a game that presents itself as a silly RPG, sometimes you just want to do something silly and make it work.

-There is a lot of RNG, ei random chance, involved in the combat and the acquisition of new and powerful equipment which you [b]must have[/b] in order to progress. This can be mitigated by choosing skills which lower your build's gear-reliance but that's still impinging on your build freedom.

-The capabilities of the enemies and their AI are fairly limited throughout almost every level of the dungeons; 90% of them either avoid you and throw out random spells from afar or try to brawl with you at melee range no matter the circumstance (every enemy has a melee attack of some sort, fyi). The last 10% consists of the very few enemies that casts spells while also slowly advancing towards you. I have yet to encounter a boss monster with unique mechanics.",1404815952,1593144399,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're looking for a fun roguelike that allows you to ""break"" the game by finding unique combinations and laughing at the in-game humor, you've foudn the perfect game!

This is a fun game to play but the majority of the game will be you killing enemies that can't hurt you if you play your cards right. If you take the opposite approach and give yourself random skill rolls (or force yourself to use bad ones) then this one can be a fantastic game to play with a god edge of difficulty.

Unfortunately, the only ""real difficult"" aspect of the game is the final boss; I took no more than 5 damage at a time until I got to the very end and suddenly the end boss is doing 8 times that! He could still be defeated thanks to the near infinite amount of items found as the game went on, but this jarring spike in difficulty from the boss can definitely be a downside to someone who doesn't want to min/max everything and only use the best perks.

Other than that, play the game and have fun. Find a friend with the game and compete to see who can get the farthest with the same skills.",1404791674,1404791674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Doesn't try to over balance (i.e. make eveyrthing so readily comparable that they aren't really differentiated) which allows the game to be fun [less so than more complex roguelikes; but tearing a rift in spacetime to destroy a room is still fun].

Also: the game looks way better when playing than it does in stills!  (Seriously, I almost didn't get it because it looked so ugly in screenshots; but I actually really enjoy the graphics when playing the game.)

This game is quick to suck you in, although it's easy enough to save your progress if need be and pick it back up later. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to figuring out which combinations of character skills you need to actualy survive based on your play style, but with three different modes to play on, one of which being a permadeath mode, you can learn as you go. A couple of other great things I like about this game, is you can actually choose to be a female adventurer, which to me is great, as most dungeon crawlers try to put the female character as a spell slinger or an archer. I'm a girl, I prefer to be hacking off limbs in the front lines. This game lets me do just that. Replay values in this game are insane as well, since you never know what your dungeon is going to look like. Each one is randomly generated, with mobs, side quests, loot... This is just amazing to me. Heck, you can even get mods and install mods and extra content for this game that other people have created. Controls are fairly simple, and you can adjust your keybindings if need be as with most games of this genre. All in all, this game is well worth the cost, and getting it on sale is definitely a must.

Two true downsides though : the boss (Dredmor) is kinda disappointing and fighting him is not very fun, and the money which you don't have when you need it at the beginning and a bit later you have a ridiculously large amount of it.

To begin with, every time I die, and that happened frequently, I’m happy that I can start a new game. 
Because the game is fair and always when I have to start over, what is certainly a pleasure, I know it’s my own fault.

The music in this game is exactly what I want to hear in a game like this. It’s a way too much orchestra song kind of music what really give the feeling of a middle age castle period. 
Call to arms and conquer!! Tadadum tadum tadum…Very good choice!

The interface and menu is very detailed and clean. Compared to the graphics of the dungeon itself it’s modern style. 
The dungeon is old style, but with enough diversity and eye candy to not feel boring or repetitive. Even that the dungeons are randomly generated every game plays like his own story. Every random set up is like handcrafted by an experienced level designer. The placement of monsters and goodies is a surprise every time, but always very well balanced. Behind every door you open on a gigantic random map is a whole new game generated before your eyes. Within every room dozens of monsters to fight and dozens of pick-ups to find.
 
Every character you build, chosen from tons of skills yourself or totally randomly, is unique. But really unique. Not unique because the skill you are good in blocks your access to all other skills, but because the skill you develop really makes sence. Every skill point you spend for a skill is game play changing in real time.

Another very good balanced, well designed aspect of this game is that for the first time (I played hundreds of RPG’s and TBS games) you can use all your skills on many, many places of every map.
The fighting is fun, fast and rewarding and it’s even turn based, so you really have time to make every turn and every action you make count. Also it’s very easy to understand and again perfectly fair for the AI and for the player. Fast because every action is just one point, so your turn or the computer’s turn doesn’t take more than a second to make. What is also groundbreaking is that the turn based gameplay in battles and the exploring part of the map is seamlessly. So you don’t have to push the end turn button a thousand times if you are not in a fight but exploring the map.

It was running flawlessly the first few hours after installment and without any glitches, lags or crashes on a three years old laptop with a build in video adapter.

The only bad thing was that one time I had to kill my own summoned monster, a golem, myself because he was blocking my only way out. This was done in a second, but it was just horrible to kill my own loving pet with my axe.

This game is also original in many ways. The art, the item and spell description and the subtle, delicate jokes all around the game. Sometimes just written on walls or as little text balloons above NPC’s or monsters. But again it is done so balanced and it fit so naturally in the rest of the game.

The last time I walked from my PC to take a piece of paper to write a secret code on it to gain access to a secret portal was 15 years ago. Cést magnifique!
This game is just brilliant in many ways and I can only thank the developers to let me play this game for a few bucks. 
It’s really worth more!

At first the game is charming. Then the charm wears off and you're left with a randomly generated clusterfuck that makes no attempts at even being winnable.

How long this takes depends on how long it takes to roll an absurd unwinnable game, which doesn't take that long.

I don't mind roguelikes, I love the genre - but Dredmor is the perfect example of what's wrong with the whole randomly generateed nonsense everyone loves to make. From the game actively mocking your loadout by generating completely useless equipment and items, to discovering that any and all elements you can use are actively negated by just about every enemy in the game. But heaven help you if you get hit with the ""Hidden Element""  , because nothing you have will -ever- defend you.

On the bright side, it's a FAR greater step up than the likes of Hack, Slash, Loot which is an even worse roguelike.

Во-первых это рогалик. Хочу сказать не самый дружелюбный к игроку рогалик, как например Rogue Legacy. В этой игре первые пару часов вы будете бесконечно умирать от ловушек, попадать в западни и, не дай бог, встретить комнату, полную монстров (Monster Zoo). Зато потом почуствуете всю ее прелесть: игра дает нам возможность самим делать персонажа. В игре предложены несколько десятков черт вашего персонажа, большая часть которых потом сможет развиваться как самостоятельная ветка скиллов. Все это дает нам возможность создать как самых стандартных персонажей, типа мага, война, рыцаря, так и совсем странных, как, например, войн-вегетарианец, по совместительству адепт огненной магии, турист и криминальный следователь. Звучит забавно, не так ли? Это не все, что заставит вас улыбнуться в этой игре. В Dungeons Of Dredmor юмор присутсвует везде: в описании предметов, врагов и умений. В этой игре время, которое проживет ваш персонаж, зависит только от игрока, от того как быстро и хорошо он умеет ориентироваться в той или иной ситуации, как он изучал умения, да и как ведет себя в бою. В игре почти нету места рандому, разве что банальная генерация локации и монстров. Не стоит забывать и про музыку! Она тут отличная. К сожалению самих композиций тут не так и много, но все они очень качественные и самое главное — приятные на слух и подходят под игровую атмосферу. Если тут есть ярые любители собирать ачивменты, то их тут предостоточно, причем как минимум 10 из них займут у Вас не меньше сотни часов. 
Могу смело посоветовать всем любителям хардкорного игростроя купить DoD, а лучше со всеми вышедшими дополнениями, как по мне, так она эта игра того стоит.

One word of warning however: The game does not interact correctly with the steam's SteamCloud remote savegame system and the developers have so far been unable to figure out why, so it is recommended that you turn SteamCloud off for this game if you don't want your save files randomly erased.

Well, for one, it's one of my favorite games on Steam. I could spend countless hours playing character after character looting and exploring dungeon after dungeon, and never have the same experuience twice. I'm not kidding. Not even once have I found a room exactly the same. Talk about Procedurally Generated. 

The joy of this game does not come in any one category. There are parts of this game that, if anywhere else, would make for a horrid experience. The combat isn't that complicated, but it can be difficult, and it's always fun. Wearing a piece of clothing or weilding a specfic weapon doesn't effect your outward appearance, only adding (or subtracting) from your stats, so for people who like to see your appearance change it's a problem. 

Dungeons of Dredmor isn't like most other games out there, as you may have already guessed, but it is ery entertaining, and hours will go by without you even knowing it. There is so much content in this game, and of all the hours I have played so far, I have not made it past the second dungeon. Is this because it is difficult? Maybe a little. But the real reason is that the game is really really big. Too many different types of monsters to count, as many weapons, more items than I've ever seen in a game, and interesting text on everything.

This game has a lot of pop culture references and stuff like that, so for people who hate that with a passion, this game probably isn't a good choice for you. But if you want a game that can make you laugh, that's really fun, and can let you waste away hours of your life, then this game is perfect for you.

It's a rogue-like through and through. In character creation, you start off with about 25+ perks to choose from. One thing I like to see in these kinds of games is that, right there. You level up and kill enemies with melee, ranged, and spells (all kinds of spells). You only get one life and that's it, as it should be. Granted, this game is not all that difficult. However, if you get careless you will die within 2 or three turns. Getting careless happens a lot if you find one piece of gear that lets you become a complete tank or decimator or whatever. I would not say that this game is as deep as ADOM or TOME or Dungeon Crawl or Nethack. I would see this as a game to get into rouge-likes like these; a gateway game of sorts. Sword of the Stars: The Pit comes to mind when talking about this as I feel as if these games are cut from the same cloth. Dungeons of Dredmor itself is a very funny game. It has memes in it at times and various refrences to movies as well as witty humor to boot. The game is a very pretty game with colorful yet simple graphics and effects. The game has a lot of base content, even more with DLCs (one of them is free, just so you know). This game even has the Steam Workshop if you're still bored and it has mod support.

Well, for me, Dungeons of Dredmor is the opposite.  I really don't want to like it.  It's a 2D rougelike, top-down, turn-based-ish dungeon crawler with an odd sense of humor (it's hit and miss) and a 90's feel to it.  While each floor is randomized, each room is a template of sorts, so after a few hours of gameplay, you'll start to see the same rooms pop up over and over (just with different loot sometimes).  It doesn't feel like there's enough content for a game like this.  And yet, I can't stop playing it.  

On normal, the game is easy enough to lure you in until you find yourself suddenly dead (health is mostly gained by eating food, but it replenishes 1 point per turn (usually for 10 or so turns, depending on the item) so you need to be careful when getting into combat.  The enemies are unusual, yet somewhat bland, but they will sometimes insult you (via text above them) that is actually pretty charming (""You smell like diggle pee"" or ""I hope they nerf your playstyle"").  The biggest draw for me, though, is the item collecting.  There's all kinds of random loot to find, better equipment or something to sell for money so you can buy better equipment.  It's actually sort of relaxing.  All this on top of crafting (which could have been done better, to be honest), leveling and basic (go here and kill this mostly) sidequests that are there to parody the RPG genre.  Plus, you regain magic by drinking alcohol.

In the end, I suppose Dungeons of Dredmor feels like a poor man's Torchlight, but I find it to be a little more likeable than Torchlight.  The music is good, the graphics are decent and it's pretty easy to pick up and play.  I recommend this game!",1399476168,1399476168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However it is flawed.

Sadly this is not the case with Dredmor, making the early levels quite laborious on repeat play throughs. Since it is a permadeath game, I soon tired of trudging my way through the early levels and soon put the game into my archives.

说到复古风格，这就是毫无剧情的下地牢踢门砍砍砍，除了商人以外连个友善的NPC都没有，挡在面前的一切生物全部轰杀干净就对了！而且当然要选择永久死亡，不是永久死亡的Roguelike不是好的Roguelike（抖M之心）～

游戏系统的最大特色是技能搭配，没有职业，而是从一大堆奇怪的技能里面选出（或随机出）若干技能来创造角色，因为游戏走的是幽默恶搞路线，所以有很多奇怪的东西，比如有Mathemagic这种听起来就很奇葩的技能树（其实数学法术非常好用，法师类最强辅助技能树），而各种技能和物品的描述也充满了捏他（比如克苏鲁神话这种万用梗当然不能少），可以感受到作者作为死宅的很多恶趣味。
在原版里面其实主要还是正常的技能树，比如各种武器精通啊防御强化啊法术流派啊制造啊之类的常见东西，而到了DLC里面各种技能树就越来越奇葩越来越莫名其妙了，比如最新的DLC里，有银行家、游客、共产主义者、偏执狂调查者、魔法律师（逆转裁判梗）等非常奇怪的东西，如果去论坛里挖Mod的话，还能找到更加诡异的技能树……

然后是缺点，首先游戏并不稳定经常崩溃，乃至于作者都做了一个关于崩溃的Steam成就来自嘲……好在自动存档和Steam云端备份，角色彻底丢失或者坏档的情况并不多，但还是会让人感到不爽；
另外就是各种技能描述提供的信息太少，如果不去Wiki看公式的话，很多技能（尤其是被动技能）光看描述根本不清楚是怎么作用的，当然简单难度非永久死亡模式这些信息可能并不是很重要，但至少给个数字或者伤害属性什么的让大家知道技能的强力程度啊；

最后就是平衡性的问题，有些技能非常逆天，有些技能存在感稀薄，而且最终Boss的打法是有限的，某些Build应对起来会很困难，比如近战物理系Build，基本唯一的活路就是设法堆到物免魔免，不然近身Boss后逃不开死亡率极高，而法师Build如果输出过于依赖亡灵系法术的话（亡灵系法术中期出了AoE大招以后可以一路横扫），会发现Boss根本是不吃那些属性的，需要另外准备一些恶心的方法来猥琐Boss，如果没准备好就等死吧——诸如此类，很大限制了Build的空间

Dungeons of Dredmor contains all manner of thinly veiled pop-culture references, right down to the title screens for the game, one of which is styled after the DOOM 1 box art, and another which resembles a classic Star Wars movie poster. If you are knowledgable about these kinds of things, you'll find A LOT to appreciate.

Don't let the cartoony visuals fool you though, because under the hood lies a deep and engrossing numbers game. There are quite a bit of stats, buffs, and skills to worry about.

It takes the deep, varied gameplay of the ASCII rougelikes before it and layers on charming, occasionally over-the-top graphics and a very usable UI; all without sacrificing gameplay. Pros and Cons:

+Excellent combat system with a plethora of melee, ranged, or magical attacks.
+Crafting galore. Want a mace that smashes atoms? A dagger that cuts your enemy through 40 dimensions? A nice, warm pair of mittens? It's all there.
+The skills are amazing. Emomancy. Necronomiconomics. Fungal Arts. Piracy. There's the typical weapon proficiencies and rogue/warrior/mage schism, but everything's got a unique touch.
+Nigh-infinite replay value. Only limited by your own attention span. Every floor is randomly generated and every treasure is unique, and the skills add a lot of variance to gameplay.
+The DLC is amazing. It's not essential, but it adds so much to the game experience. I'd recommend it, especially if it's on sale.
+Modding. Now the replay value is infinite. The community's got a lot already, and it's only getting better.

-The humor's a little excessive. Personally, I love the corniness, but that's a matter of taste.
-Compared to existing roguelikes, it's a little slow. I credit that to the ""accessible for non-veterans of roguelikes"" part.

But the fundamental issue with for-profit rougelikes are two-fold: they are directly challenging some of the greatest games ever made, and two, all of their competition is free. 

I will put my cards on the table. I am a diehard Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup fan. I play it on my phone when I’m waiting in line. I squeeze a quick game in before bed most nights. The depth, years of production, and meticulous balance are difficult to find outside of the RL genre. And, it’s absolutely, positively, 100% free. So when the competitor’s game starts off costing infinitely more than nothing, it’s already at a disadvantage. 

This is compounded by DoD’s other glaring flaw which is balance, or lack thereof. It is clear that the game was built, from concept to code to graphics, as a lark. Everything is a joke. All the references make it a blast to play. There are enough jokes that it even adds to replayability. But it also killed any shred of equality the game once had. Instead of picking a class and a race, as is standard with most RPGs, you pick seven skill trees which effect both passive stats and activated abilities, and go on your merry way. But pick the wrong trees, or wrong combination of trees, and you will find progression past a certain point impossible. For example, I would love to use the pole arm class. But the scarcity of the weapon itself, along with the subpar nature of the skill tree, makes it useless when compared to the sword or mace or even unarmed skills. About a fifth of the skill trees involve crafting, which in all cases is satisfactorily powerful, but turns the game from a fast paced dungeon romp into a painfully accurate hoarding simulation. Jokes about polishing your wand are great, I just wish the wand crafting skill was as much fun to use as it was to read about.

But in light of all this. In spite of the cost, regardless of the glaring flaws in the mechanics, I have still spent time playing this game, and avidly suggest it to friends who aren’t ready for a full on ASCII rougelike experience. It’s a fantastic gateway to a genre otherwise regarded as impenetrable. My issues arise from playing games like it for years, but for someone who doesn’t enjoy their eyes bleeding, a few extra dollars and inept skill trees will not sullen the experience. The controls are straight forward and predictable. And the experience is still that of a rouge like. All the frustration and theory crafting in a nice, accessible package. You will love this game. You will hate this game. But most importantly, you will play this game. You won’t spend all your time in menus figuring out how to quaff a potion, or figuring out what a certain object is. You will spend your time dying, and that’s what rougelikes are all about.

So if you’re looking for a new experience, and have no idea what a NetHack is or think Dwarf Fortress is a chapter out of Lord of the Rings, there is no better place to start than with Dungeons of Dredmor. If, like me, you have past experience with the genre, you may find the depth a bit lacking. But overall, I applaud the developers efforts to make a deserving medium accessible.

(1 балл забираю за то, что вылетела пару раз во время прохождения. Впрочем, проходил давно, полагаю уже все исправили.)

Чем доставляет:

1) Разнообразие. Нет, даже лучше сказать _РАЗНООБРАЗИЕ_. Целая куча предметов, веток скиллов (я про те, которые выбираем при создании героя), монстров, ловушек. Много видов крафта. Не хочешь крафтить - покупай в магазине. Или воруй. Или убей владельца и забери все из магазина. Или... Есть, вообщем, интересные методы.
2) Графика. Полностью аутентичная и узнаваемая. Нет лишних деталей, но и не голые пиксели. Короче говоря, есть стиль, приятный глазу.
3) Механика. Скилами можно убить как монстров вокруг, так и себя. Рекомендую читать описания и вообще думать о том, как их сочетать. Можно сделать могучего мага, ловкого вора, а так бронированного воина. А еще можно сделать steam knight (For the empire!), туриста-коммуниста, повелителя плоти, второе явление Индианы Джонса... Просто попробуйте.
4) Юмор. Разработчики не стеснялись его применять. Читать описания способностей одно удовольствие. Как вам разбивание статуй главного злодея на каждом уровне с лозунгом ""heroic vandalism?"" Клево же. А наличие ядерной бомбы и вообще ветки скиллов коммуниста? Есть и более тонкие шутки, предлагаю поискать их самим.

Минусы: спрайтов монстров могло бы быть и побольше. Нет, их много, но часто мы видим перекрашенные аналоги только что убитого моба. Это огорчает.
Огорчает еще жуткий рандом и проблемы с поиском редких вещей. Порой половину прохождения находишь мусор. Впрочем, хардкорность этой игре только к лицу, чего это я?

And it is gloriously addictive, if you like that sort of thing.

The first forty hours of Dredmor I didn't even get to see the namesake Lich at the bottom of the dungeon. I was playing on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath, and I just kept dying before the fifth floor. Then, suddenly, playing a character named Pyra Mancy, everything lined up perfectly and victory was assured. It was delicious.

Triple A games have abandoned this concept, that insane difficulty makes ultimate success that much more rewarding. But of all the games I've beaten on my gameslist, it's no wonder that I'm proudest of Isaac and Dredmor. The art is amateurish, the music repetitive, the story nonexistant.

Axetar (have you seen guitar of Gene Simmons from KISS?)
Axekeytar (what a nice purple guitar shaped keys? errr... I mean axe)
The Sword in the Stone (ever heard about one of this kind? Little help - it starts with ""E"" letter...)
Bolt of mass destruction (imagine atomic bomb on the end of the crossbow bolt - nice!)
Razor sword for her (this one is really good for... killing enemies)
FUS RO DAH!!!! (mighty Thuum used by creatures - unfortunately for them, it does nothing)
N'wah (not everyone will remember this...)
Horadric Lutefisk cuve - I hope many players know what Horadric cube is. Well this one converts everything to... lutefisk

Next, look on skill images and achievements:

Archaelogy skill - man with fedora, everyone knows one of Harisson Ford's best roles
Bloody mess achievement - Have you ever heard of flying limbs and lots of gore in any of Fallout games?
Realms of the Id achievement - Id Software, enough said. When you see what you must do for the achievement, it brings smile to your face
Suddenly the dungeon collapse - At last! Thank you developers for making this behavior good for something - this time to get achievement

Seventh character and third floor down into the dungeons, I was armed with the Murderous Shiv of Crowbars, and Interdimensional Axe, and a Crossbow Bolt of Mass Destruction. I was feeling good. So good, in fact, that I tried stealing the world's most amazing three-bladed sword from Brax, the salesdemon. Then I proceeded to flay his cheap suited form with it. Ecstatic, I frolicked through the loot - Bolts of Squids, a Cyber Construction Cone helmet, and a Steam Powered Mechanical Arm of Crushing that belonged to some guy whose name I couldn't pronounce.

Then the Dread Collectors came.

Pink, blubberous monsters with pot-bellies and devious Spanish goatees. I unleashed my Bolt of Mass Destruction from Cranky (TM), by automatic crossbow. It bounced off... The walls of the dungeon were rent apart by the force of the nuclear blast, and a handful of the Collectors lost a tenth of their health. I scurried down an aisle of shelves to form a choke point, and smeared poison on my new weapons. I chucked Flasks of Brimstone and Softballs. I turned on my Swashbuckling Auto-Counter ability. I ingested at least six different mushrooms, endowing me with lobstery skin, flannel, a beard, and the might of Chuck Norris. Then the first Collector reached me. I counter attacked him into a fine pink mist.

With chants of ""Slay the eyebrowed one!"", the second Collector counter-criticalled me into next Tuesday with a vengeance as I tried to escape into my pocket dimension. I slumped down, blood pouring out onto the floor.

The atmosphere the game creates also doesn't really click with me. It tries to hard to be funny. Which end up in lame enemies with an art style I don't like. The dungeons look fine and with better characters the game would look a lot more appealing. The music also doesn't help. It's annoying and repetitive.

Fantastic game! Picked up recently during the humble bundle and (like many games) I didn't think I'd get around to playing it. I love games with RPG elements but i'm not a huge fan of turn based games. I was pleasently surprised with Dungeons of Dredmor. It has a simple, but appealing, art style (reminiscent of a flash game). The gameplay is fun and easy to pick up, plenty of pop culture refrences and throwbacks to games. Before I wrote a review I wanted to put a couple more hours in and i'm glad I did. 

My few gripes with the game:
-The control customization is lacking some but easily remedied with a simple AHK script
-The fast travel system is a little annoying, would have prefered an in-game memory system
-The crafting/profession system (although helpful) just remained unused in most my playthroughs and it didn't make a difference",1390846391,1390846391,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is how it's meant to be. You build a unique character from skill pools ranging from simple swordsmanship and spellcraft to things like math, legal, and veganism-based combat, and proceed through a randomized, turn-based dungeon in the traditional roguelike style- which is to say, slowly, with an emphasis on choosing what you'll do next and contending with the consequences. Commands are never overwhelmingly complicated, with the game dishing out new active skills conservatively, and yet there never seems to be a shortage of ways to handle any given situation. As frequently as death comes (it's the nearest thing to an inevitability), there's always the sense that maybe, just maybe it would have been better to hurl something at that last monster and run away than to have tried to sneak up on it. 

While there's inevitably some frustration in trekking through a dungeon for a full hour before being reduced to a bloody, lifeless high score, Dredmor eases the pain with variable difficulties and and the option of turning off the permadeath, so impatient adventurers might throw themselves into something brutish and horrible just to get the full experience before rounding out their experience with a swift death, while more anxious players might tone down the experience to something more casual and preserve their precious adventurer until the game's proper end. The sheer extent to which your uniquely-tailored character can actually be developed keeps the latter approach from getting stale too quickly, while the extent to which your handpicked skill trees actually matter from the beginning keeps the quick and dirty approach fresh from restart to restart.

In the end, if there's a single thing working against Dredmor's lovingly-crafted delves, it's the entire genre's problem: Every move is its own intimate life-or-death decision, with all the time in the world to choose between as many actions as your character is capable of, and as such it can only have ever been a single-player experience. As tempting as it is to tell your friends about that incredible time you narrowly escaped a desperate one-sided fight by electing to abandon your sword and instead physically throw the monster into a brutal trap, it's an experience you'll have invariably shared with yourself alone. It simply can't be helped- Dungeons of Dredmor is a very single-player game, and yet it still does its best to keep you company. Each learned skill rarely comes without a joke to accompany it, monsters sling petty insults your way, and even in your most dramatic victories, the game's narration will do everything in its power to take the piss out of you- but what more can you expect when you're a law-school educated burglar, communist viking, or Regent of Throwing Stuff At People? Dredmor's a lonely experience, but makes every effort not to feel like one.

Overall, if you've ever been a fan of roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is a refreshingly unique presentation of everything you're already certain you like, and if you've never touched one before, Dredmor is still a perfectly complete example of everything the genre ought to be, with success dependent on what you do, rather than how fast you can do it. As hard as you make it, as deep as you feel like going, and dripping with wit and charm (and other fluids), this game isn't content to simply kill you repeatedly. It wants to be your friend while it does so.

My advice? Let it. Unless you've specifically got a problem with turn-based or single-player gaming, Dungeons of Dredmor is a humble yet delightful dungeon-crawl worth far more than its modest price tag in delicious suspense, strategy, humor, and gratuitous fantasy violence.",1390684098,1390684098,True,1,0,0.500265002250671387,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its pretty good, and the permadeath harder modes make it a lot more challenging to beat the entire game. A lot of the stuff in the game is plain retarded though, as if they put no thought into the quality of the artwork or the art style at all. 

The limited monster variety is pretty shit too, you end up fighting recolored generic grunts a lot.
Even the harder modes are pretty easy, most character builds will plough through generic enemies and the only times I have died is when i have encountered a monster zoo (its a room packed with hundreds of similar grunts) as i was surrounded and unable to move my dudesman.

Gameplay is walk and click. RPG elements keep each playthrough challenging in different ways, and a huge number of skills make the game replayable for a long time. The modding community, although small, is fervent and helpful to newcomers.

Dungeons of Dredmor is a dungeon crawler for Dungeons and Dragons enthusiasts and overall geeks and nerds, using those terms endearingly. Exploring multiple floors (10 to get to Lord Dredmor, 15 if you're using the Realm of the Diggle Gods expansion), your character must grow in strength and loot to take on the challenge of battling Lord Dredmor himself, an evil lich that you have to kill because the game tells you to. That's pretty much all there is to the plot. The formula for a dungeon crawler has been boiled down to it's basic components:  large dungeon full of traps and monsters, the occasional store to sell your stuff (you can even attack the storekeeper and attempt a five-finger discount, though I wouldn't advise this as crime usually ends in death in the Dungeons), and a variety of equipment and items scattered on the floor as if a kleptomaniac had a hole in his bag. 

The core of the game lays in the character creation and the random dungeon layout. Notice how I said earlier ""your character""? There isn't a named hero or heroine to Dungeons of Dredmor. It's an avatar with massive eyebrows and whatever skill set you want that avatar to have. The game starts immediately by picking out 7 skills from a bank of 35 (+6 if you get the Realm of the Diggle Gods DLC, +4 if you get the You Have to Name The Expansion Pack DLC, and +6 if you get the Conquest of the Wizardlands DLC) either by choice or by random. Then you pick a name and either the massively-eyebrowed male avatar or the massively-eyebrowed female avatar. The process is kept simple, allowing players to spend as little time as possible on rerolling characters once they die. There's even a ""Last Choice"" option, allowing players to repick the same skills the previous life had. My complaints with this are that (as far as I'm aware), you can't see what the skill trees will look like before or as you choose the skills, which means you can't pre-plan skill progression beyond guesswork from what the name of the skill implies. Also, some skills are rather pointless or even completely weak in my opinion. The loading time between games can also be considered choppy as you have to get past an arbitrary scoreboard before you can get to the new game screen. 

The random dungeon layout also adds some uniqueness to Dungeons of Dredmor. No two dungeons are going to be the same. Now, when I started writing that sentence, I was about to type ""no two adventures"", but then I realized every game of Dungeons goes the same way, which can make the game stale quickly to those not interested in the mandatory grinding it takes to get strong enough to get to Dredmor. The random dungeon layout and room layout can also make some rooms inaccessible because of object placement, such as an impassible candelabra or iron bars. Store placement can make or break a run, as the inventory is cripplingly small. Doing so makes have to prioritize items you want in your inventory for the upcoming battles even though you're only on the first or second floor. Shop items are randomized too, which means you can find expensive, yet powerful, weapons on the first floor or junk for crafting. 

The crafting system is meh. In order to craft items, you must a) have the appropriate skill level, b) the appropriate items to craft with, and c) a crafting tool. There are also secret crafting recipes that can be found in bookshelves or dropped from monsters if you have the right skill. However, in order to have a high crafting level, you must have a crafting skill in one of your 7 selected skills. This makes crafting nearly moot, as the more powerful (and more  useful) items require high levels of crafting in order to make. At least the item-upgrade system is easy. Just find an enchanting anvil, pick your item, and bam! It's enchanted! Of course there is a risk of making the item worse, which is always a gamble in any RPG when it comes to item enchanting. The game is secretly turn-based. I say secretly because you don't really notice it until you have a screen full of monsters who are acting at the same time as you. What you may think of as lag is actually the monsters taking their turns in response to your actions, making moving one square at a time feel like a chore, especially if you're attempting to run away.

The game can be, and most of the time is, really frustrating. A lot of grinding is necessary to get past the monsters that lurk in the Dungeons, and traps can be difficult to spot quickly if you're using the WASD controls to move. A really good run can end in moments by stepping on a mine you didn't notice in time or by not paying attention to your health when battling your way through a room. As of writing this review, I still haven't faced Lord Dredmor, even on easy. But even with all this difficulty, I wouldn't quite call it Nintendo-hard. A lot of the deaths I've had have been my own fault, either not paying attention to my health or where I'm going, or just getting so burned out on the run I'm on that I get reckless. 

The humor of the game is based entirely on nerdy references. Almost everything has flavor text, and most items and skills make references to nerd culture such as Doctor Who or Supernatural to name a couple. It's cute at first, but grows stale after a while because there really isn't much more in the ways of humor for this game. It's funny the first time you see a little Diggle shouting FUS RO DAH at you as it charges into your sword, but the screen can get littered with corpses, items, monsters, and flavor text quickly. The same can also be said of the soundtrack, which I stopped listening to after about a week of gameplay. The smooth jazz doesn't quite scream adventure or exploration to me, and feels out of place.

Despite of all the complaints I have, I'm still playing. I'm still grinding out achievements and levels, still climbing that mountain of corpses to get to Lord Dredmor. Every time I go in, I say to myself, ""Yes, THIS is the run!"" only to die ten or twenty minutes later to an Unfriendly AI. It's a game that definitely bites back, and for that I find it somewhat enjoyable. My score for Dungeons of Dredmor is 7/10.

While it certainly doesn't stand up to the big name traditional roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Tales of Maj'eyal, it's an excellent choice for someone new to the roguelike genre, and can be a good step up for those who want to give true roguelikes a chance.

One of the biggest drawbacks of the game is the animation speed, so it's worth noting that it can be sped up with the + key. The other big problem is inventory management; even with the free DLC, if you take a crafting skill you'll be playing inventory shuffle a lot. That said, the absurd number of skills you can choose from do give you some interesting choices and keep the game interesting for quite a while. For those who are used to the older roguelikes such as DCSS or Nethack this game will come off as a bit easy, but for anyone new to the genre it will give a solid challenge, and is worth at least a few playthroughs trying different builds.

If you're a roguelike fan looking to try something a bit different, or if you're interested in the (real) roguelike genre and you're looking for a good introductory game, I would recommend this highly. On the other hand, if you're already a skilled player of deeper roguelike games such as DCSS or ToME, this game may feel like too much of a step back for you.

What sets it apart from other genre competitors is its presentation handsdown.

This is one of those rare games thats overgrown with little jokes and references but still stays funny and unique.

The additions of mouse controls and real graphics vastly increase the accessibility of the game, while at the same time not compromising on the difficulty one expects from a roguelike.

One thing I think could still be improved is the targeting of flying enemies.  Flying enemies can't be clicked like regular enemies when you attack them.  You have to actually click the square the flying enemy is in, rather than their graphics.  If you're playing a melee character this probably won't be too bad, but if you're focusing on ranged combat or magic, you may find yourself having misclicks a fair amount of the time.

The game used to have a glaring inventory space problem, but that's not so much of an issue anymore.  An update a while back added the ""Pocket Dimension"".  Once you find the keys to it, which should be in the first level somewhere, you have access to it and can store an unlimited amount of stuff there.  So go ahead and be a packrat, because you can just hop into the pocket dimension to grab what you wanted to sell off when you get to a merchant.  Although, there are better uses for certain items than offloading them to a merchant...

For just a measly five dollars (or whatever regional equivalent), this game offers HOURS of content and nigh-endless replayability. 

Pros: 
Despite the price tag, the dungeon crawling aspects of this game are fairly in depth. There are many different kinds of items, different ways to play, and each playthrough is a bit different every time. The loot is MASSIVE. I kept finding new types of items well past the twenty hour mark. The game doesn't take itself seriously, and it's a light-hearted romp throughout. With Steam worksop integration, mods are plentiful and practical to install. The number of different skills and equipment types make it difficult to play the same character twice. 

Cons: 
While this game is quite nice, I found a few nagging problems. For one, I found the experience repetitive after a while. This is natural for every game, but only when I notice it does it become problematic. The combat is mostly fine, but it quickly becomes a clickfest which may bore some. The music ranges from decent to just plain grating; the same couple tracks play over and over and OVER. I was tempted several times to just mute the music. Without playing with perma-death and/or a higher difficulty, I found this game boring over time. 

However, any gripes I can find are fairly minor and don't detract from the game overly. 

At such a low price with so much content, it almost feels criminal to buy this game. There's so much in such a tiny package that I can't recommend it more.",1387054848,1387054848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game leaves a fantastic first impression - it's easily one of the most intuitive, easy to learn Roguelikes, without sacrificing customization and a level of the strategy.  It's colourful, full of personality, and clearly made with love.  Amazing for introducing someone to the genre.

It also, however, begins to drag after a while; a complete game with Realm of the Diggle Gods and full-sized floors takes an absurd amount of time for what quickly starts devolving into incredibly repetitive content.  Monsters have little variety, stellar equipment slowly starts fading into a pile of ultimately unremarkable items, there's extremely little secrets or rare content to discover... it lacks the meat, depth, and sense of discovery to actually sustain itself over long periods of time.

So to be most specific on whether I'd recommend this game or not: If you don't know what the word ""Roguelike"" means yet, this is a great way to start the genre and enjoy yourself.  But if you're already into Roguelikes, as charming as Dungeons of Dredmor is, you'll find that once you get a game that survives the first ~4 floors, the game is ultimately just reptetitive and boring.",1386759943,1386760039,False,60,1,0.692056834697723389,3,True,False,False,False,,,

1. Rejouabilité : Joueur une partie peut probablement durer jusqu'à 4-5 heures, peut-être plus dépendant de la quantité d'effort qu'on y met et du temps de réflexion utilisé. Sinon, dans la plupart des cas, vous pourrez jouer au moins 2-4 parties dans ce lapse de temps. Donc si on prends une moyenne de 1 heure et demi, j'ai environ 100 parties de jouées. Et à celà il faut ajouter le temps que j'ai joué avant d'acheter le jeu sur steam (les mise à jours automatiques c'est divin). Donc J'ai probablement au moins 2-300 parties de jouées... Et je recommence quelques heures à chaques mois, encore.

2. Personnalisation : Pour chaque partie, le joueur choisis 7 compétences différents qu'il mélangera afin de réussir à conquérir le dongeon. Je crois que je n'ai pas encore rencontré une seule personne qui n'avait pas de ""build"" préféré, sa stratégie infaillible avec 2-3 compétences qui sont tout simplement trop forte. Le seul hic, c'est que je n'ai jamais entendu la même combinaison une seule fois.

3. Hasard : Comme pour tout dungeon crawler, il faut un peu de hasard pour rendre les choses plaisantes. DoD se régale de hasard, mais uniquement dans les endroits intéressants. tous les dégâts sont fixes (avec exception de bloc/critiques/etc.) et dans la plupart des as, les combats sont plutôt prévisibles.

4. Difficulté : 3 niveau de difficulté. Initiation, Petite partie plaisante et Cette fois-ci c'est la bonne. En gros, comme le système est assez développé, il faudra au moins 4-5 parties avant de réelement comprendre ce que vous faites (encore plus si vous prenez les DLC dès le début). Ensuite, la difficulté Dwarven Moderation (normal) devient un peu facile pour certains, alors tu a le choix de perdre à la difficulté la plus haute. Personnellement, j'ai réussi le niveau difficile peut-être une fois seulement, et c'était avec un truc qui a été ôté la patch d'après. Sinon, si je veux simplement tuer Dredmor, j'enfile une partie à facile sans expansions et je peux la compléter en ~1 heure habituellement.

5. Humour : DoD a choisi de ne pas suivre les traces de plusieurs Roguelike avec un univers immersif. DoD a choisi plutôt d'être accessible à tous. Si vous ne comprenez pas une seul blague dans les 15 premières minutes, vous avez un problème de culture. Chaque item, la majorité des compétences/magies, et quelques monstres/salles sont des références envers d'autres jeux/évenements/personnes. En plus d etout celà, la note reste tout de même très humoristique.

6. Extensibilité : La seule raison que je pourrais ne pas conseiller les expansions, c'est qu'il est possible de jouer plusieurs milliers d'heures sans elles. La plateforme est fixe, mais son contenu modifiable, et avec la Steam Workshop, il est très facile de trouver ce que l'on veut. Par contre, avec les expansions, la plateforme est étendue, le code plus modifiable et il y a plus de mods de disponibles.


Conclusion, si je ne pouvais garder qu'un seul jeu pour le restant de ma vie, DoD pèserait lourd dans la balance.",1385593103,1385593103,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Fond of Rogue and its hoard of -like successors? Easily amused by nerdy jokes in flavour text and tool tips or by pop culture references in the names of achievements? Want to pretend you're a game developer and name an expansion pack? Then Dungeons of Dredmor is the Roguelike for you!

It's also a pretty good little time-wasting game in and of its own right, even if the things above don't apply. Even if you don't get the expansion packs, the base game will occupy plenty of your time, so long as you have a hankering for wandering dungeons, picking up loot and learning what potions do by the time honoured method of drinking them and hoping it wasn't horrible poison. DoD is a Roguelike, obviously, so anyone with a low tolerance for RNG-related failure or starting over for the 8th time this morning should either avoid it or only play on Elves Just Wanna Have Fun Difficulty with permadeath off. The pointy-eared wimps. Dredmor lacks a traditional Class system - your character has a set of Skill trees which you pick out of a pretty long list from the obvious (Shieldmaster) to the slightly more bizarre (Tourist). These make for some weird and wonderful synergies as you combine your Vampiric powers of sparkling with Necroeconomics. A large part of the fun comes from exploring these skill trees - what exactly does a Magical Lawyer Clockwork Knight with Burglary and Viking Wizardry end up like?

Like any Rogeulike, DoD can suffer from repetitive grind, but there's enough different skills to mess around with that it stands up to some pretty heavy play without becoming wearing too quickly. And any game can get dull if you spend too much time with it. There are a few issues, like the way that magic/missile builds can be the only way to win (assuming you ever actually GET to Lord Dredmor himself) and the crafting system is... well, functional. When you get to higher crafting levels, the lack of filters or a basic search option in the crafting menu is a little irksome. And, of course, the RNG plays a big factor in what ingredients and which blueprints you get to play around with. But these are minor flaws that don't detract from  Dredmor's overall experience. And since it has Steam Workshop, you can get around some of these with mods.

With a total of 51 traits you can create a lot of unique character to explore the dungeons of Dredmore. A few examples of the crazy traits are: Emomancy, Tourist and Clockwork Knight.

There is also a crafting system in the game which you can use to create potions, weapons and armor. There are a lot of materials to create armor from. From plastic to steel, they got it all.

I can't remember what I spent it on, but I know that I had a few dollars left and wanted to get rid of my credit. So, I see that there's this game called ""Dungeons of Dredmor"" on sale for about what I have left. ""Hm, this game looks fun."" I think to myself. ""Kind of simple, maybe, but I could get my money's worth in less than an afternoon. Why not!"" And so I purchased Dungeons of Dredmor. 

The fact that I remember buying Dungeons of Dredmor and not the rest of my gift card's value should speak to what I think of this game.

First and foremost, this is NOT a ""simple"" game. There is a vast amount of depth here, particularly when it comes to crafting. I've hardly scratched the surface of what Dungeons of Dredmor has to offer, and I can say that it's one of the best roguelike RPGs availavle today. The gameplay is far from revolutionary, but is also very effective. The graphics are charming, and the writing is at times hilarious. Additionally - for a ""roguelike"", it's surprisingly approachable. The inclusion of permadeath toggle and multiple difficulty settings allows Dungeons of Dredmor to function as a truly hardcore roguelike, or as a more forgiving dungeon crawler. 

I do suggest buying the expansions for this game, if you do choose to buy it. Some of the skills and features included serve to even out the experience in some much-needed ways. On that note, Dredmor certainly isn't perfect. Choosing skills always feels like a lottery, with almost no description of what they actually do. The game itself can be equally cryptic, and expect to alt-tab to your internet browser of choice more than once during your stay in the Dungeon. Of course, the game IS a roguelike, so saying that it's ""difficult"" or ""cryptic"" isn't really a detriment, but rather something to keep in mind if you have no experience with RPGs like this. However, I stand by my point that Dungeons of Dredmor serves as an appropriate ""entry-roguelike"", with the potential to scale alongside the player's ability.

I had previously seen the game-play trailer on the Steam store page but wasn't sure about picking up the title until I saw this video from The Cynical Brit. Who, by the way, is awesome, and not just because his English accent makes everything just slightly funnier.

Dungeons of Dredmor is basically an old-school roguelike game, similar to Angband. It's got all of the typical roguelike features: it's really hard, you die a lot, there's random junk everywhere, there's tons of monsters, you die a lot, etc etc. What it adds to the genre is, wait for it... graphics! Don't get me wrong, roguelikes are great, I've had a lot of fun with Angband, but monochrome text characters gets a little tiring. Also, I have a mouse; it is not a new invention; it is wonderful for controlling things. Dredmor is capable of understanding the mystical signals that emanate from mice, it's amazing!

What's especially great about the game is that it really doesn't take itself very seriously. Everything is silly and strange and ridiculous. For example, my character specializes in growing mushrooms. No, seriously, I grow mushrooms on the corpses of my slain enemies. And then I eat them (the mushrooms). You can get suits of armor made out of bright pink plastic. There's references to all sorts of pop-culture and even terribly obscure geek culture. Just before going to bed last night I found a ""Horadric Lutefisk Cube"". If you don't get the reference, then you are a poor and sad creature and I pity you.

Of course if you don't like roguelikes, you probably won't like this game very much. It's about as old-school as you can get and still be a new game though. Luckily, they've also implemented 3 difficulty settings, and the ability to disable permadeath, for, you know, giant pussies. Which does make the game a lot more approachable.

No? Well, maybe I'm overstating. But it's definitely one of the best -if not THE best- Roguelike I've ever played. I will always return to this game. It will constantly captivate me in its shiny roguelike eyes. Maybe it's because every character you make can have a new and exciting build. Maybe it's because no run-through is exactly the same. Maybe it's because there's actual crafting that's better than in some big name MMO's. Maybe it's because your death is always your own damn fault.

Negatives? The humor is sometimes a little too much, I think, like every-blooming-thing needed to be funny. Oh, there's funny in there, but sometimes you just want the flavor texts to give it a rest already.

Dredmor is a turn-based procedurally generated dungeon crawler (with the option for permadeath) in which you clear out a dungeon level by level until you hit the bottom and kill the final boss - a pretty simple premise and no back-story to speak of; but that's okay, this game is all about the gameplay, and the loot (oh so much loot).

The crafting system is pretty well designed and there's a lot of cool stuff to make (such as chainswords!!) but it's also kind of a pain because it's hard to know what scrap metals and garbage to keep in your limited inventory as you won't have access to all the blueprints at the start of each play-through, and you rely on randomly finding the right ones.

Dredmor has all the standard RPG skill trees like swordplay and archery, but it also includes some pretty weird skill trees such as mathemagician, tourist, and communist. The best thing is that, regardless of what seven skills you pick for your character, you are not locked into using certain types of equipment. If you find it, you can use it regardless of class or level. This means you can just play the character any way you want to, which is a lot more fun than being locked into the standard warrior, mage, or thief classes like in many other RPGs.

Dredmor includes lots of references to other games and popular culture, and it kind of reminds me of older games that didn't have to be so serious. This really gives the game the extra shot of charm it needs to help you look past it's flaws (and there's a lot of flaws in Dredmor, I just choose to ignore them because it's so much fun).

There are so many mechanics in this game that it'd be tough to mention anything in a recommendation, but I think the fun of a roguelike is exploring the game for yourself and experience all the ways you can die and figure out builds that work for you.  I think everyone has their own way of playing through a game like this, but I highly recommend anyone that picks this game up to play on hardcore mode, because it will force you to learn from your mistakes and you will never forget why doing what you did was a bad idea.

This is turn-based, which means when you move, the world moves.  This can give Dungeons of Dredmor a chess-like feeling as you figure out which fights to take, and which fights to run from.  There are a pretty heft amount of classes you can pick from, which are actually limitless with the addition of steam workshop support, as well as all the extra classes from the two expansions.

The only downside that I really disliked in this game is the achievements.  If you're an achievement hunter, you will probably never 100% this game legitimately, as there are stupid secret achievements such as buying the developers a beer in person.  When I last played, there were also a ton of broken achievements which you could never get (although I'm not sure if they have ever fixed these).

If you're looking for a fun turn-based roguelike to play, then I would highly recommend you to play this, especially if it's your first roguelike (as the interface is a lot more simple to use than other games).",1381531196,1381531196,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Dungeons of Dredmor remembers...

Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the first indie rogue-likes to gain popularity on Steam and probably the reason why we have hundreds of rogue-like games today, but unfortunatly most of theses other games reduced the content and increased the price as they released, making Dungeons of Dredmor one of the best games of the genre despite it's age.

The game works like this: The objective is to clear as many floors as possible before eventually dying and having to start all over again. Before each run, you can pick a few perks that determine what kind of character you will be playing, what kind of weapons you will be using, etc...Then you're dropped in the first floor of the dungeon. From that moment on, you have to level up your character to improve your skills, find items that make you stronger and find the stairs that lead to the next floor. Obviously, the difficulty quickly ramps up as you advance through the dungeon's floors and you are encouraged to grind for EXP and thoroughly explore every floor to prepare your characters much as possible before advancing to the harder floors.

This  game has A LOT of content! Huge item variety, huge enemy variety, great character customization options in terms of skills and perks,  randomly generated floors with shops, quests and awesome loot. Apparently the game has 10 floors, which might not seem like much, but I never got past half of the second floor and most people have never seen floor 10. It's that hard.
If you want you can turn off hardcore mode and play with saves but hardcore mode is the best way to play Dungeons of Dredmor.

The game also as a lot of personality. The graphics aren't amazing but they have an interesting and unique style and there's a lot of humor everywhere. From the enemy design to the scribbles on the dungeon walls, there are references and jokes all over the place.

This is one of those games where you will sink hundreds of hours just trying to get past those first couple floors. It's one of the most complete rogue-likes in the market and, if you like games like Binding of Isaac, you will definitely like this one.

Dungeons of Dredmor is a humor-filled, turn-based (in a sense) roguelike. It is reminiscent of games like Ancient domains of Mystery, POWDER, and NetHack. 

[h1]Gameplay breakdown...[/h1]
Naturally, you'll start by choosing which bushy-eyebrowed character you'd like to play as. You'll then select what abilities and traits your character will carry through the game. From here, it is all a matter of exploring each level from wall-to-wall and ransacking every room. You'll accrue experience and upgrade your chosen skills - as is standard in RPGs. This really is about as far as a gameplay summary needs to go to get the point across. There are no crazy story-lines or twists, and there aren't any genre-defining features.

[b]However[/b], there is a lot to unpack from run to run. There are whole crafting systems to take advantage of, tons of resistances and stats to manipulate, and lots of taunting dialogue tossed around by enemies.

lo consiglio agli amanti del genere e lo consiglio a chi non conosce il genere, ovviamente non aspettatevi un Diablo o un SoTP o un qualsiasi roguelike RPG di ultima generazione dalla megasuperiper grafica ma invece aspettatevi un gioco complesso anche se apparentemente semplice, longevo AS FUCK, con una colonna sonora epica e un gameplay perfetto.
Insomma un gioco da provare e riprovare, magari insieme ad un buon boccale di Tennet's e bestemmie libere.

- - - - -
Imagine, if you will: You are in a room. There is a pair of pants on the floor, a hunk of cheese, and a door in the far wall. There are vending machines to your right and left, and you have a sword in your hand.

These are your first moments in the dungeon.

You grab the pants and cheese, walk over to the door, and push it. Its locked. So you kick it untill it finaly splinters and falls down. Inside the room, wall to wall, floor to celling, packed with monsters. 

And they all turn and stare at you.

These are your last moments in the dungeon.

So, overall? This game will beat you over the head with a rusty pipe, mug you, and then call the police and tell them you called thier mothers fat.

Yet, you will grit your teeth in frusration, slam the reload button, and take another shot at the Monster Zoo that turned you into a pile of mewling organs.

Very rarely do I find a game that I consider I might actually play -Forever- (or at least until I am no longer able to).  This is one of those games.  I will play it, revisit it, time and time again, until I can't anymore.  It's that epic.

True to it's rogue-like nature, there is very little hand-holding in this game.  There isn't -too- much to figure out for yourself, but there is definitely enough to keep things interesting.  The turn-based combat is refreshing, as is the way you can use items (clicking on an enemy while holding a bolt from your inventory will shoot them with said bolt).  

The base stats are a a refreshing new twist, with stats not seen in any other games.  Of course, you've got about a million ways to start your character depending on what type of play-style you're going through.  Base stats serve only to enhance secondary stats, which are used throughout most of the game.  Nothing big to figure out, but you could definitely be a min/maxer if you wanted to be.  I prefer the role-play / lore route.

Perma-death mode is the only mode I'll ever play.  As your characters die, your name, level, and score all get added to a giant headstone which shows all of your previous deaths as well.  Making it exceedingly interesting to see just how much farther you can push into the dreaded Dungeons of Dredmor.

On first glance, it seems pretty basic and generic as there are so many games with the same genre. However, Dungeons of Dredmor manages to stand out from the rest with it's wide array of skills, items, floors and monsters, it's humor, and how much fun you have playing it. 

Dungeons of Dredmor has you as a hero to defeat Dark Lord Dredmor. On you quest to defeat Dredmor, you will need weapons, armor and a brain to slaughter monsters across the 10 dungeon floors.

 DoD has you start off with you picking from about 30 skills (Excluding Deadshot which was removed) and you have the freedom to choose whatever you like. It's a great sense of replayability that is added this way. You can mix and match different skills to see what you like as a player and various skills change your playstyle.. If you happen to mix to certain skills together, you may come up with an amazing combination to destroy some enemies. When you've picked your skills, you get spawned on the first floor. It's good to note that every floor is randomly generated and that the game is turn-based, allowing you to strategize your next move.

Now as you progress through the game, different items will be there to enhance your character through different stats, I won't go into detail though. While the same items do pop up on occasion, they feel different because the stats and it's name is always different. Killing enemies will give you XP and will eventually get you to LVL up, therefore giving you one skill point to give you a passive or active skill. As I've said before, the game's large variety increases how much you play. DoD also has a surprising in-depth crafting system that will let you make better weapons, armor and various items like food and potions. 

DoD also has DLC, which is a must buy. It only enhances the game that's already worth your money.The DLC's add more skills, items, floors and balances the game in general. There is also a decent sized workshop community, constantly added mods to make the game better. 

Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is an amazing buy. It's challenging with the option of Permadeath and it really makes you think in a lot of situations. For anyone who loves rouge-likes, you must check this game out.

You can look at your character sheet at any time and see what your current stat line looks like. It has multiple difficulty modes and a deep dungeon to explore. It randomizes floors and even has side quests and everything. The game is chock full of references and silly humor that will lighten your day. The story is your typical roguelike story setup, but let's be honest; who cares about the story in a roguelike except for the opening and the ending? That's not why you play these games! You play these games because LOSING IS FUN!!!!

What makes this game unique in my opinion is the classless setup. Rather than pick a class and go with it, you create a class by combining 7 skills and then leveling those up as your character levels up. These skills fall into one of the three major categories. Warrior, Wizard, or Rogue. Your base stats are affected differently by each point invested in these skills depending on the category it falls under.

Where it fails in my opinion for being a 'real' roguelike is the fact that permanent death can be turned off. The other issue I have with it, and more egregious n my honest opinion, is the fact that your hero automatically knows what everything is. There is no need to identify anything, at all, ever. What kind of roguelike lacks the need to test things and figure out what thay are? There is also no curse system to make equipment unable to be removed, at least not that I have encountered.

Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic starting point for people who wish to play an often unforgiving and visually lacking genre. So let's start at price, Dredmor is dirt cheap. At £3.49 for the base game, it's a steal that will offer countless hours of adventuring fun, and this is helped by the fact that no dungeon is ever the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons! The story is the Evil Lord Dredmor is here to do bad things and you are a hero who has to kill monsters, pretty generic... However, the game is packed with humour, which is super pleasant and the game doesn't take it's self serious! Gameplay revolves around stat-checking, crafting, combat and cleverely disguised turn-based mechanics. The game is surprisingly tactical and you can often mess up if you don't think about your character's positioning! And that leads me to my final point: Permadeath and replayability! You can pick 7 base 'Perks' in character creation (which can be randomised). As you level up you can evolve these Perks. However, should your character get killed (and they will), you stay dead and start fresh! This is optional for the less hardcore rogue-like players. In conclusion I say if you like role-playing games you should give Dungeons of Dredmor a shot. It's fun, simple and hilarious.",1363275255,1363275255,True,1,0,0.515430450439453125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But don't stop there! Once you've died a horrible death or five, (heh, don't worry, it'll likely be a quick demise!) you'll start to get the hang of it, and be able to delve deeper into Dredmor's residence; killing off his foul minions and living vegetables with ease.

There is also a lot of humour and references to be had in this game too, which is certainly one of its strong suits; whether it's finding a Holy Hand Grenade from Quest for the Holy Grail, or having the option to purchase incredibly expensive (and pointless!) horse armour from Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Another one of the pros of DoD is that it's a completely new experience every time you play it, as the floor layouts differ between playthroughs, as do the items you find.

So yeah, at the price it's at, I'd definitely recommend buying it if you're interested in a very challenging and rewarding experience, provided you're prepared to potentially suffer for an hour or two, before you get the hang of it.

But you get the idea, it's a game that can consume many hours of your time and it's something that will make you come back for 'more'. I also highly recommend the DLC as well, it's worth every penny. If you still need something new to change things up a bit, there's plenty of player created content as well! (Items, abilities, etc.) So in short, there's tons to do and many ways to beat it giving it a unique feel each and every time!",1359536036,1359536036,True,0,0,0.477178424596786499,1,True,False,False,False,,,

You play as an adventurer going down into the Dungeons of Dredmore. You pick you gender and then choose a set of 7 skills before you are plunged into the randomly generated levels.
The skill customisation is fantastic as you pick whatever you want and there is plenty of variety from the normal swords, assassination and magic training to moe obscure skills like fleshsmithing, tinkering, necromincomics. As you level up, you can improve these skills to higher levels. The skills can interact and synergise, making the system incredible deep and complex if you really think about it.
Levels contain enemies, traps, loot, interactive objects with lore, shops, side quests and so on. There are lots of different items that you can collect and use, but you have a limited inventory and you DEFINITELY cannot pick up and use everything. Battles with enemies is turn based and there are many different types to encounter.
You can choose how you want to play the game from the start: you can change the difficulty level, whether you want to respawn or not on defeat, whether you can even respawn on death or completely lose that character forever, start off with a completely randomised skill set or choose your own skills, etc.
Replayability is definitely high and with 3 DLCs and plenty of user mods, you won't run out of things to do or play with Dungeons of Dredmore.
Perhaps one of the best aspects to it is its humour. The game is hilarious and takes every opportunity to make jokes, poke fun at itself as an RPG and the archetypal features of RPGs (an example would be the character stats and the description for each stat), even making jokes about you as a player. It keeps the game fresh and entertaining all the time.

Due to the large amount of skills you can choose to start with (7 out of a total of 33, 43 with both DLC's), there's an almost infinite choice of characters to play, so experimentation is a must.

There isn't a whole lot of information in the game itself, a lot of potions have vague descriptions, and even most skill tooltips don't give full explanations.

This is a throw-back to Castle of the Winds, NetHack, and any other rogue-like you can think of. This will not be a game that you're on the edge of your seat playing. It requires much more methodical planning and strategy. With the combinations of skills you can use, it is incredibly deep. Some combinations of skills make the game borderline impossible, but once you get your feet wet, you'll have a good idea of which skills work with which other skills. 

Don't forget that permadeath is the default, so if you don't want your save files to be deleted when you die, make sure to turn that feature off.

Losing is fun! And you'll be doing a lot of it. This is a pure roguelike, meaning you'll be crawling around dungeons, killing monsters, casting spells, and never being 100% sure if the next door you open will reveal a room full of hundreds of hungry monsters.

DoD really does feel like a more graphical Nethack, with its own charm and sense of humor.

The Dredmor School of Dungeoneering was my crash course in Dungeoneering, and I endured long and painful hours of trial at the hands of Lord Dredmor's enforcers and the loathsome paladins of the Lutefisk God, not to mention the Voluntary Quality Assurance Programme. But you know what? I could never have become a Master Dungeoneer or Adventurer or even Hero without this struggle. Dungeoneering on Going Rogue with Permadeath CHANGES a man. Fighting Brax and cleansing floor after floor of legions of Dread Collectors was mere practise for my eternal struggle with the Shopkeeper. The Dungeons of Dredmor were my undergraduate programme, just as Spelunking under Master Israel Blargh was my postgraduate programme. I cannot overstate the cultural impact that these have had even upon my writing. Few works of any kind operate on my cerebral wavelength, but this is one of them. A unique curriculum for unique students.

Game got a lot of  love from both the Dev's and the players. If  you want something that can soak up over 100 hours of ur gameplay time (depend on how much you like playing with different class builds) I say get this. Has 2 pay for dlc that are actually more like full on expansion packs, and 1 community dlc that is free for everyone.Lots and I mean lots of mods,I play vanilla for the most part but I put in a few craft mods and a skill mod here and there.The game has different difficulty modes for different flavors of players from casual players to hardcore types.

For the ol school player out there I HIGHLY Recommend this game.Get the complete version and you will not go wrong goes on sale for a wooping $1.75 for a single and is worth the purchase.Or get a 4pack and share with yor friends.

Dungeons of Dredmor is the first of two games Gaslamp Games made before they went under- and it's really quite a sad story. I'll spare the details, but essentially they went on to make a Dwarf Fortress-like, and then disappeared off the face of the planet with no further contact. It's a shame, because they come from where I was born and raised and I think dredmor is a fantastic (if not a bit flawed) roguelike.

What makes Dredmor so special in my opinion, is that it's casual enough to not be soulcrushing but allows you to get in deep if you want. There are many stats to consider and things to juggle, many skill tree combinations and factors to... factor into each encounter, but honestly if you really want you can just whack stuff mercilessly and not think much at any point while continuing on your crusade. It's a ""You can't really go wrong"" type of game, where even if you have the most terrible build you'll at least be able to survive to the midfloors if you know what you're doing. This plus the fact that there are a lot of items and drops that allow you to escape or mass murder things on a moments notice removes a lot of the stress that roguelikes usually carry with them.

Of course, you can still get instakilled by stepping on a trap. Or getting hit by a crit (spells can crit too!). Actually, I think the main problem with Dredmor is the lack of player information. Skills grant you passives and other things but the game doesn't tell you what half of them are, some items do mysterious things where the side-effects aren't clearly displayed, lots of ideas are obtuse and confusing and need a look-up on a wiki to be clarified, honestly it's all a mess and not really in the positive way. Cryptic things are fine when needing to know what they do isn't essential to your survival. Also, some skills or items are woefully unbalanced one way or the other, and it kind of punishes you for screwing around later on in the game as from floor 6 onwards it gets pretty strict with strategy. I think there are a few mods that rebalance things available including some that fix tooltips, but a lot of them are on the now defunct forums, so you might have to go searching around for it.

The humour is really funny and often not laid on too hard, it's something that comes of more endearing than anything. I can see people hating the humour just because they think roguelikes shouldn't have humour or something, that is fine and it's just personal preference. Just know that it's got quite a lot through and through, it's very much a comedy game in the same silly vein as something like Monty Python (maybe a lot less humourous, but a similar style). I like the art style and music as well. It comes off as lovingly made, if not a little cheesy.


Bottom line, I recommend Dredmor and all it's expansions wholeheartedly. They're so cheap (especially on sale) that you can't really go wrong. It's more casual and chaotic than other roguelikes, but in my opinion that's what set it apart. I feel like some of the issues with accessibility and bad balancing could have been fixed by the company surviving and patching it or releasing a sequel, but unfortunately they promptly died about a year ago.",1325208157,1501402479,True,2,0,0.504761874675750732,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Truth to be told managing those very items is the main hindrance to hold the game back: they pile up high above the limits of your inventory—or your crafting abilities, or some practical around-the-corner selling—to the point an inelegant fix had to be thrown in as the easy-to-stumble-upon Wizard Keys, which provides the player a portal to a… storeroom.

Still, some skills can take advantage of that baggage overweight in a more interesting fashion, be them a late bandage or not. In DoD skills are the practical tip of the developers’ poisonous tongue, making form overflow into content. Experimenting with different skills combinations (and their respective trees) lends the game a much meatier replay value and helps a lot on letting the player work around failure and the genre’s typical lack of clear intel.

The original build had 10 floors available for exploring—which could be even smaller/quicker with the handy tool called No Time To Grind, used for cramping the same amount of XP into smaller maps—but I was only able to beat it after the hundredth hour of play. Anyways that’s not necessarily a testimony of some brutal difficulty level or over-punishing permadeath—even if some stupid demises were ensued in that front; it’s more like an awkward environment being a catalyst to a more playful approach where failing can be as fulfilling as winning.",1325079129,1526316702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Great art style with tons of personality

- Inventory management is tedious, and almost everything is useful in some way so hoarding is almost necessary to a degree. Wizardlands mitigates this a bit with infinite storage, but it's still kind of a pain

I wanted to be that guy who wasn't afraid to pay money on a chance he'd like something that seemed amazing.

So I tried.  I tossed money at this game, knowing full well that there were numerous other free alternatives.  Every one of those alternatives would actually turn out to be much better than this game ever could dream of being.  No matter how many times Dungeons of Dredmor releases ordinary updates and makes people pay for them, it'll never be as good as those other indie rougelikes who are making games to provide entertainment to as many people as possible, not to fill their pockets as much as possible.

I lied to myself.

Perhaps the worst part of all of this though, is that I besmirched the glorious art of the game recommendation.  Not only did I lie about the game, but I wrote a straight faced serious recommendation.

I had no idea what a ""roguelike"" was, but I thought the art looked pretty silly and decided to give it a try.  Within 10 minutes, I knew I was in for a long haul of booze-fueled spell casting and Diggle whipping.  

On the surface, the game seems rather unappealing: Stricly turn-based; very minimal animations; dry, flat, squared-off environment; absolutely simple controls and mechanics.  And it is hard -- very hard.  I died, and continue to die, a lot.  And death is permanent for your character and his progress to that point

But beneath the surface, the game is a refreshing and compelling peice of work.  The instrinsic randomness of nearly every game element means that each replay is its own truly unique run filled with delightful surprises and totally unfair que-sera-sera situations.

Dungeons of Dredmor è un esperimento perfettamente riuscito di ridare lustro ad un genere per troppo tempo abbandonato. Dimenticate la complessità spesso frustrante dei vecchi classici degli anni ’80 e ’90, Dungeons of Dredmor combina la profondità dei vecchi roguelike con l’immediatezza delle produzioni attuali miscelando il tutto con un’ironia citazionistica raffinata ma mai  banale.

Probably the most accessible roguelike ever is silly on more levels than just a few, but being beaten by an arguably retarded run of the litter game is as taunting to ones ego as it gets.

Dungeons of Dredmor takes this one step further but this time endless complexity of deadly hidden game mechanisms is replaced by brute brawn and genuine lack of giving a fuck.

One of my favorite Roguelikes of all time. And yes. I mean Roguelike and not RogueLITE. This is an actual game that mimics the mechanics of the old-school game Rogue. The thing that sets Dredmor apart though is its humor. Dredmor is exceedingly funny. Whether it's sacrificing massive stacks of lutefisk to a hedonistic fish god for forbidden magic tomes or playing a run as a super saiyan vegan, there's always something to get a chuckle out of.

When you start a game, you pick a number of skill trees to level up. Every time you level, you gain a new passive or active skill plus some stats from one of your trees. The number of skill trees is enough that over a hundred hours of play, you will likely not have seen all the fun combos the game can offer. Add in the workshop content and you have yourself one of the greatest bargains on steam at 5 dollars. 

If you can tolerate the game's clunky interface and dated graphics, the price is a real no brainer. You won't find any game that gives you more time for 7 bucks out there. I have a joking metric for determining game cost and worth. ""How many Celestes and Hollow Knights is this game worth?"" Like I said. It's a joke. You can't expect every game to have as good of a value as Hollow Knight.

Is this game worth half a Hollow Knight though? Absolutely. 

If you've bothered to look this game up, odds are someone recommended it to you or you were looking through the relevant tags. That said. If you're LOOKING for a game like this, this is one of the best examples out there.

Mas como todos sabem, gráficos não são tudo, o que importa mesmo é a jogabilidade e após ler reviews positivos resolvi comprar. Ainda bem, pq o jogo é sensacional!

Para quem é fã do gênero roguelike não preciso nem falar mais nada além de COMPREM AGORA!

Mas para aqueles que querem se informar mais:

Nesse gênero de jogo vc só tem uma vida, se morrer perde todo o equipamento, toda a experiencia, todos os itens, todo o progresso, TUDO! E deve recomeçar o jogo do zero da primeira fase.

A movimentação e combate ocorre em turnos e é baseada grids (a fase é dividida em quadradinhos) e cada quadrado que vc andar conta como 1 turno. Os monstros só se movem quando vc se move, basicamente o tempo só anda quando vc anda. 

O mapa é gerado aleatoriamente bem como a localização de itens, escadas, monstros, etc. portanto cada sessão vai ser diferente e por isso que morrer infinitas vezes não torna o jogo cansativo nem chato, pq à cada sessão será uma experiência completamente nova.

No inicio de cada jogo vc pode escolher seu gênero e 7 skills (dentre 37 disponíveis no jogo base http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Skills) o que permite a criação de personagens que sejam bons com mágica, armas, escudos, crafting, ou um pouco de tudo. 

Após isso vc começa no topo da masmorra que é dividida em andares. O objetivo é descer e atingir o andar mais inferior da masmorra e enfrentar o chefão. Quanto mais vc descer maior será a dificuldade e por isso é importante explorar bem cada andar para encontrar itens úteis e ganhar o máximo de xp possível. 

O jogo conta também o um sistema de progressão onde vc pode ir atualizando suas skills conforme vai ganhando levels. 

Outro fator interessante presente no jogo é o crafting. Com o auxilio de engenhocas que vc leva com vc ou encontra no mapa vc pode fazer poções, itens, criar melhoramentos para armas, etc..

O jogo base conta com uma tonelada de conteúdo, diversas armas, itens mágicos, receitas (para criação de itens, magias ou arma), boa variedade de monstros e mapas. Com certeza esse jogo irá te render dezenas, senão centenas de horas de diversão.

Muito bom recomendo pra quem gosta de RPG e combate em turnos!

ps.: Compra definitiva pra quem gostou de Binding of Isaac.",1322457209,1385665205,True,7,0,0.619940757751464844,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Right so basically this is a stunning introduction to roguelikes and an incredibly easy to get into game, there are a ton of awesome abilitiies such as summoning a moustache to fight for you and kicking things to death jackie chan style.

Basically you work your way through the floors of a randomly generated dungeon, with the aim of getting to the bottom to kill Dredmor, a very hard task indeed.
By default the game has permadeath enabled which means if you die you start all over again which adds massive replay value, only being able to save upon exit. Although this can be disabled but is less fun and takes away the tension.

My two previus experiences with rogue-likes are ADOM and Dungeon Crawl SS.

The game gives you a good range of skills to pick from, enemies to fight, and gear to collect or craft.  At the same time it mixes in nerd culture humor ranging from Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Indiana Jones, Hellsing (anime), or just making fun of Canadians.  The thing that makes this work for this game a lot more than Magicka is that if you took the humor away from Magicka the base campaign of the game loses almost all of its charm, while as DoD is still a much better base game when you're not laughing at the humor.  That is at least MY feeling, being a person who enjoys playing RPGs.

Difficulty feels nicely balanced on Normal and isn't as punishing toward the new player as it could be.  Permadeath can be toggled, bringing much needed sanity to the roguelike genre and letting less dedicated (or insane?) players enjoy the game too.  For just $5, a great buy.

EDIT: In retrospect, this game has a serious flaw that needs mentioning.  The game does not give clarity of its mechanics, namely in how skills may or may not scale off of certain statistics or the values of their outputs.  This obfuscation is not new to RPGs but it is more relevant here in how you combine many different skills from many different skill trees to create your character.

I just love exploring every part of the dungeon. Until I get myself in trouble that is, which usually doesn't take all that long. You'll die a lot in this game so it's advised to safe often. But somehow dying never frustrates. You'll just load your savegame or start an entire new game. Both choices can be fun. So... Like I said; excellent game. Highly recommended !
