Straima is a game developed and published by caiys

The game offers some nice graphics and a beautiful aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Straima overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good platformer game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

I did every level getting the deathless requirement and the time requirement at the same time, not realising I could do them in 2 separate runs until later. My biggest problem with the game is the lack of explanation for what's going on, and the rare requirement for very specific moves. A level around 70% of the way through requires you to throw boxes directly beneath you by pressing down while holding one, something that might be taught in the tutorial but this was the first and only time you needed to do it in the game. A level right at the end left me completely stumped as to how you reached the targets in the top corners, until I remembered you could grab ledges (this was the only level I ever needed to, and it was so awkward to pull off I never used it elsewhere). There's a couple other mechanics specific to single levels that are never taught and never used again, which is terrible design.

Another major gripe is how player-unfriendly the game is. If you jump a pixel too late off of a platform, it'll use your double jump and you'll die. It's impossible to push a box off a ledge consistently because the second it's off the ledge it gains a hitbox and kills you. There are blue platforms you can dive down through, except this is fiddly and trying to dive and LAND on a blue platform will almost certainly end in an unfair death. If these had been replaced with forgiving, in favour of the player game logic, the game would have been a LOT more enjoyable.

SO I just finished Straima, an indie platforming game that has 1-4 players, and I've finished it 100%, having nothing but fun.

[h1]Initial Reaction/Gameplay/Overall Experience[/h1]
When I first got into it, I had little no idea what the fuck was going on, though I quickly learned you just need to hunt down pink creatures to destroy as well as recieve no deaths and finish the par time to 'goldify' a level. If you are a completionist (or an aspiring completionist) like me, this gets very addicting! The satisfaction that came from finally clearing all the 90 levels is unmatched.

[h1]The Graphics[/h1]
I have no doubt there had to be at least some kind of drugs involved in the design process itself. The game's overall design is pretty good in my view, and nice to look at. Be advised, some people might think it's very hard on the eyes and may look confusing - though I personally very much liked it, sprite design was real good.

It's an aesthetic fever-dream, but it's functionally very similar to other platformers:  You navigate a map for each of the 5 worlds (not unlike a classic Super Mario map), unlocking paths by beating levels; there are also multiple ways to reach the boss at the end of each world without completing every level.  There are even roaming ""enemies"" on each of the world maps, and you'll be forced into a mini-game if you cross paths with one of them.

Don't be fooled by the initial levels (which are deceptively easy)--before its end, Straima ramps up the difficulty with harder enemies, obstacles, and novel level design.  Fortunately, you'll unlock additional items and abilities as you get further into the game, so if you find yourself hitting a ""brick wall"" on a particular level, you can usually try different strategies in overcoming a tough map.  Additionally, the game never reaches the extreme difficulties of, say, Super Meat Boy's harder zones.

Regardless, the fundamental goal always remains the same every level:  Stomp the shit out of every ""pinky"" (a little pink glob) in sight.  Sometimes that will be done in a room with low-gravity.  Sometimes that will be done in a dark maze filled with traps.  Sometimes that might even be done while being chased by enemies who freeze as long as you look at them.  But the objective will [i]always[/i] focus on destroying those helpless, weird little globs.

Items include consumables that allow you to ""clear"" a level without actually beating it (useful for particularly troublesome maps); abilities include the option of temporarily turning invisible, destroying all projectiles around you, and melting through solid floors.  Not all of these items and abilities are created equal, however, and several of them will likely sit in your menus, untouched.

Mechanically, Straima definitely sits on the slower, floatier side of platformers.  Whereas a game like Super Meat Boy has tight, responsive controls, the player moves ponderously in Straima.  I suppose it gives it that ""slowly trying to run away in a nightmare"" feeling, but I still wish the game was more responsive.

Overall, Straima seems to be a solid option for somebody who likes platformers, but still wants something a little novel.  A little strange.  It's not a perfect game by any means, but at its price point (and especially if it's on sale), fans of platformers will likely find some enjoyment in its ~100 increasingly weird levels.



[b]PROS:[/b]
+ Excellent difficulty curve, with a fair number of options to help players progress (like taking an alternative path on the world map, or using limited consumable items to clear levels) with minimal frustation
+ Consumable items and optional abilities give you more options on how to approach a level...although they're not all equally useful 
+ The implementation of both Co-op [i]and[/i] Level Editor features are not something you often see in these types of games


[b]CONS:[/b]

What I find when I play is that I always feel that victory is just in sight if I adapt my skill or play a little.  As a result Straima pushes me to be a better gamer.

I love this game so much but it is super-intense and I can only take it in short bursts.

Local co-op (2 players)
Local deathmatch (Up to 4 players)
Pink blobs that explode into memes upon death
Slang text which somehow makes you smile 
Level editor
Runs on a potato
Better than drugs (I had to)

The main goal for each stage is to squash every pink blob (pinkie) on the screen. There are also two side-goals for each stage; finish within a certain time and/or without dying. The game tracks your progress for the side-goals in the form of gold trophies next to the level on the menu and these goals can be met on separate runs. Most stages have a target time between 20-60 seconds. One might think that this is worrying for game length, but Straima offers excellent replayability.

The game can be rather addicting when it comes to completing a stage under the par time. There were many occasions where I was only a few seconds away from reaching it and couldn't walk away while thinking “I'll get it on the next try!”. Of course, the run I was looking for was sometimes a dozen or two attempts away. Though, there were times when I was stuck on certain levels (I'm looking at you, Pinball Wiz) and needed to move on to another. The great thing about Straima is that there are so many levels to choose from that this isn't an issue. As you play other stages, you will learn certain tricks that might allow you to shave off a few seconds from previous levels that the target time was just a hair out of reach. At times, Straima even felt like a puzzle game to me. I would sit here and map out my route, trying to finish the level in the quickest way possible. The time trials can be rather tight even if you don't die in a level which makes this planning very necessary. There are also stages that are designed to be a puzzle through use of mechanics such as levers to open and close passageways in a maze.

Each level is very unique compared to the rest and never once did I get the feeling that I played the same stage twice. This is rather impressive to me given the sheer number of levels put into the game. Straima achieves this through it's great variety of enemies, hazards, stage modifiers, and choice of power-ups. Utilizing the power-ups to the best of their ability is the key to completing each stage under the par time. When selecting a level, you are given the choice of picking one power-up out of a handful that pertain to the current stage being played. Sometimes, it is beneficial to use the slow-time power-up in order to dodge particularly difficult enemy fire; but is it worth using that over the ability to warp through the floor and potentially skip certain sections? I found these decisions to give a lot of weight to which power-up to choose when starting a stage. Through experimentation, you will learn the best application of each of these abilities.

There are two features that I didn't get around to using; a level editor and party play. The level editor offers the same tools that the developer used to create the core levels of the game. Created stages are able to be shared with others by downloading the file and placing it into their game folder. Unfortunately, it seems there is no community for this feature so right now even with a dedicated Steam sub-forum for user designs. As for the party play, it's local only and features a deathmatch mode for up to 4-players and a co-operative mode for 2-players. Most of the deathmatch stages are designed specifically for this mode whilst the co-operative mode shares stages with single-player.

Straima is definitely one of the better platformers that I've played in a long time. It's hard not to recommend a game that has such tight controls, varied level design, “one more” addictiveness, unique visuals, and great soundtrack. Keep in mind that even though it sounds like there is not a lot of content to be had with such short levels, it took me about 15 hours to achieve both trophies on all of the stages. If you're looking for a very challenging platforming experience, Straima is your game.",1444480347,1444480347,True,81,3,0.825369596481323242,3,False,False,False,False,,,

This game makes me think of an old C-64 game called JumpMan but on Acid.

Really Original Game with Nice Pixel Graphics in Vivid Colors (probably too bright for some), Good Multiplayer Action and some Great 8bit Music to go with it. Add to that a Level Editor which I didn't touch but sounds like a great addon for anyone wanting to push the Gaming experience some more (maybe play mind tricks with your friends too).

The Downside for me was some missing information about Gameplay but already in the last week the Dev added a Tutorial Level which explains some basics, I wish he adds some more info to it like explaining the different super-powers you can pick from but nonetheless it's already a good step forward.

Story: You are a hero and you need to kill those weird pinky things to complete the levels. THE END :D

Gameplay: I found this game extremely hard. There are over 100 levels, so you will easily destroy your keyboard/controller. It has co-op, so you can play with your friends which is really nice :D It also has level editor, so the community can create more levels (if the 100+ is not enough for you -.-). The main target of that game is to kill all those weird pink things and then go to next level and so on. You also have an optional target to complete the level without dying, which is hard as f**k.

Sound: The music is AWESOME !!! It is very minimalistic, but it is really awesome.

Graphic: It is pixel style one :D Also your eyes might start bleeding since it is very psychedelic :D

Recommended to platform lovers who are looking for challenging game, full potential and best fun is in coop^^

You should destroy all of them if you want finish a level and you have also another optional target, which mean you shouldn't die. A game really not easy and have more hundred levels. A game also have a coop up to 4 player and level editor. 

So my verdict

+many levels
+coop
+nice music
+colorful style
+level editor
+cards

-a bit hard
-not for everyone (not all people like minimalist pixel graphic style)
-a bit anoying menu
-a bit high price 

Overall: 6,5/10

I think its a game can be really enjoyable for that who like platformer games and don't afraid from pixel graphic style. A game have a good music, in coop you can earn a lot fun and if you want a challenge its game for you.
But if you not really fan of platformer games, but want its try, i recommend to you wait until game get a minimum 50% discount or going to bundle.",1443467369,1443467369,True,19,2,0.491266399621963501,0,False,False,False,False,,,
