No, I don't know why the screen resolution is so small. A shame that is a deal-breaker for some of you out there.

I read a review outside of Steam that said Dungeon Girl was a game of menus or was like an idle game. Actually, not true.

Even though I am usually strict about having an intuitive GUI and clear instructions, I found that trial and error works here- just starting playing and learn. I was able to learn the ins and outs after an hour. In the future, I will focus on mixing (crafting) more.

It also has a lot of potential. I wouldn't say things are outright bad, more like meh.

First of all, it's a lot of clicking. It's a match-1 and that makes it a lot easier than if it were a match-2 type game. Matching tile 2+ is not necessary to advance, but it eventually hinders you if you do not. The fighting is so unengaging that I end up clicking through tiles quickly and missing the details about my health, mind, and status effects. I think this is because they're so tiny and the clicking can be mesmerizing. It bothers me a LOT how time moves in game. I just made it to level 100 and it has supposedly been [b]26 years[/b] in game! That feels so disjointed from everything else in game. It bothers me. Time doesn't matter, beyond for bonuses.

The characters are that JRPG-side-side-character kind of shallow and sort of childish. They are't really fleshed out. It takes forever to get the story bits out of the game, and the character development is so minuscule to begin with. It leaves me feeling like I'm not getting much out of it.

The item mixing mechanic has so much potential, so many cool items with very useful effects, but the actual mechanics don't get explained very well if at all, and there are so many variables going on at once that it makes it hard to distinguish what exactly is going on with your results; it's hard to figure out what to mix so that I can achieve what I want. 

The art is kind of different (in a good way), and the coloring gorgeous, but it seems like the artist(s) for the characters didn't fully understand angles. For example, the art is just funky underneath and around the torso and chest areas for several characters (like Monika). 

Overall, it's playable and enjoyable honestly. There's enough content and it's understandable enough to enjoy. The clicking is soothing and mesmerizing. While making it a match-1 rather than a match-2 makes it more easily playable, I wonder if they could've given us the option for that difficulty to give us some more fun.

『レミュオールの錬金術師』等で有名な同人サークル、犬と猫制作のゲーム。
内容はダンジョン探索＋アイテム合成の経営シミュレーション。

ゲーム内ヘルプが非常にわかりづらい上、
大したチュートリアルもなく放り出されるのでクソゲー扱いされがちな作品。
しかし仕組みがわかってくるとサクサクステータスを強化して
バリバリ階層を進めていくことが出来るようになり、楽しくなってくる。
かなり極端なスルメゲー。

[h1]攻略のコツ[/h1]
[u]アイテム合成は高ランク（★）アイテムを作るより、低ランクの強化合成を繰り返すほうが良い[/u]
他レビューを見る限り、この仕様に気づいてない人が多そうな気がする。
高ランクアイテムは重量もスキルコストも重い上、必要素材も多いため強化もしづらく、
一見ステータスは高いように見えても使いづらい。
一方、低ランクでも強化合成を重ねてPを積み重ねれば重量もコストも減るし、
ステも高ランクを凌ぐレベル（最終的にステ150%、コスト50%、重量50%、スキル2つ装備可能）になる。
これに気づかないとアイテムポイントや重量のやりくりが苦しくなり、
稼ぎにかかる作業時間も無駄に多くなってしまう。
高ランクに乗り換えるのは、合成可能回数が6回くらいまで上がってからで良い。

[u]アイテムはガンガン使うべし[/u]
上記にてコストを減らせばアイテムポイントはほとんど気にする必要がなくなる。
HP回復＆メンタル回復は常備必須だが、それ以外で特に重要なのが変換系のスキルで、
「回復＆採掘→探索」「探索→攻撃」を用意すれば普段は探索変換でサクサク階段を出し、
ボス戦では探索を攻撃に変換してワンパンKO可能。
ステ次第だがこの戦法だけで1000階まで突破できる。

[u]ショップはガンガン使うべし[/u]
稀に出現するショップパネルが非常に重要。
特に「帰還時に装備アイテム品質+1」は飛躍的にステが上がるので見かけたら買っておこう。
他にも恒常ステアップ系は出来るだけ買うこと。

[u]優先すべきステータスは攻撃と探索[/u]
ボス戦及び階段探しの早さに直結する最重要ステータス。
回復はアイテムで出来るので不要。採掘は稼ぐ時以外は不要。
そもそも金は中盤以降余る。

[u]友情ポイントは、まずはキャラアンロックを目指して振る[/u]
新キャラのアンロックを最優先で目指すと良い。
ティコは全ステ+10%という強力なパッシブを使えるので最優先で育てる。
育成時はノノが友情ポイント2倍のパッシブを覚えるのでパーティーに入れておく。
鍵とストーリーは後回しで良い。

[u]鍵が足りない時は低層クエスト稼ぎ[/u]
クエスト達成でもらえるので、フィルをクエスト+2にして低層で稼ぐと良い。
中盤以降は余った友情ポイントを鍵に出来るので、勝手に大量に集まる。
余った鍵は更にマテリアルに変換できる。",1538274440,1538289023,True,26,0,0.738864243030548096,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The basic gameplay cycle is - you go into a dungeon, descend through it (completing missions as you go, to earn keys to open treasure) - come back to the surface - mix treasure items, spend friend points, and go back in. Rinse and repeat.

For the first 40 or so levels, the game is very simple. (Note: the store page says the game has 1000 levels!) I didn't really feel like there was much strategy or thought that needed to go into play - mostly I was just trying to complete missions and reap treasure. But the challenge does eventually ramp up, and you'll need to start thinking about status ailments, dig into that crafting system, and play more strategically. But you can always go back to early levels to reap treasure / money / mixing materials.

In terms of story - this game is *very bare* and I think assumes that the player is already familiar with the characters from other games by the developer ""Inu to Neko"". Unfortunately, I've only ever had the chance to play one of those - another game on Steam called ""Let's Eat! Seaside Cafe"" which I just can't recommend because its English translation (by Zoo Corporation) is truly abysmal. But I recognised some of the characters from there.

The translation for Dungeon Girl seems just fine. I should mention that!

Story segments are not really handed out to the player via progress descending the dungeon, but - as you travel, you take some support companions with you, they earn friendship points which you can use to spend on various power-ups, skills, etc - but also unlocking more support characters, and unlocking story segments.

All of the story segments I've seen so far have been mainly about food. Not very deep stuff. But I like food, so, eh. :) 

The user interface in this game - I often feel like this game could have done with a bit more tutorial, or a better user interface. It often feels like the space on screen - for mixing, and other stat-heavy things - is showing a lot of data, but not necessarily the data I'd like to see relevant to the decisions I want to make.

This is definitely a good game for people who like turn-based puzzle battles, and people who take pleasure in immersing themselves in different game mechanic systems - looking for balance and optimum customisation by sticking their face right in and experimenting. 

That's a bit niche, but I like it plenty. Thanks to Fruitbat Factory for eventually releasing this game! (but you took ages!)",1533471624,1533471848,True,9,0,0.542528450489044189,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Dungeon Girl - из разряда именно таких.

[h1][i]It Takes All Kinds[/i][/h1]

Казуальный Puzzle RPG, обладающий ярким и красочным оформлением вкупе с непретенциозным и тривиальным геймплеем. Основной смысл игры заключается в прохождении тысячеярусного подземелья под названием ""The Tower of Light Blue"" (дословно: Башня Голубого Сияния), в процессе чего предстоит добыть и скомбинировать более трёхсот активных предметов и особенно тесно подружиться с десятью жителями родного городка.

Основную часть геймплея представляет весьма заурядный Puzzle. Поле 6х6 заполняется кубиками (по местному лору: панелями) четырёх видов, за каждым из которых закреплено своё внутриигровое действие. Так, search - это исследование подземелья, work - сбор полезных ресурсов, life - самоисцеление, attack - атаковать. Исследование подземелья позволяет заполнять шкалу продвижения по уровню - по её заполнению открывается проход на следующий ярус (в буквальном смысле падает панелька stairs, если её уронить - некоторое количество очков из панели исследования заберут, чтобы вы могли её набрать заново); примерно на каждом пятом или десятом ярусе появляется выход из подземелья, который впоследствии становится чекпоинтом (если вернуться в город, всегда есть возможность вернуться и начать с тех уровней, где был найден выход). Сбор полезных ресурсов позволяет добывать различные металлы, которые впоследствии перепродаются и трансформируются в деньги. По мере продвижения вперёд на вас нападают различные монстры, от которых приходится отбиваться при помощи панелей атаки и/или специальных активных предметов; по такому же принципу восстанавливается здоровье. Чем дольше находишься в подземелье, тем выше становится уровень риска - становятся опаснее монстры. Периодически в процессе изучения подземелья на поле также появляются treasure (сундуки сокровищ) и material (материалы), из которых добываются новые активные предметы. Для открытия первых требуются ключи, которые или покупаются (не только за уже упомянутые деньги, получаемые внутриигровым путём, но и в результате прокачки друзей-сопартийцев за friend points), или получаются в качестве награды за выполняемые мини-квесты (выдаются автоматически по мере исследования подземелья, все по типу: убрать n-ое количество панелей такого-то типа, не использовать предметы в течение n-ого количества ходов и т.п.). Время от времени некоторые противники накладывают на вас и ваше поле негативные эффекты - от этого некоторые кубики заменяются всякими параличами и отравлениями, которые, при попытки собрать, ранят, а в ином случае мешают комбинировать панели; с некоторой периодичностью появляются и положительные бафы - они увеличивают очки действий (нужны для использования активных предметов из инвентаря) и выносливость (тут его роль выполняет mind - рассудок). Также с какого-то уровня игра будет частенько закидывать вам на поле shop (магазин), который за некоторое количество игровой денюжки предлагает вам дополнительные ключи для сундуков, замену имеющихся панелей на поле, полное восстановление выносливости и т.д.

Что действительно делает игру ненавязчивой: пускай эффективность при комбинации, конечно же, выше, убирать панельки можно хоть по одному кубику, главное - успевать следить за собственным здоровьем, количеством ключей и выносливостью.

Время от времени возвращаться в город, отвлекаясь от бесконечного сбора панелек, в буквальном смысле вынуждает сама игра - первые два раза по сюжету, впоследствии - из-за того, что монстры, вам встречающиеся, оказываются слишком сильными. Вообще, оказывается, возвращаться время от времени в город скорее нужно, чем следовало бы, т.к. по возвращению вы выгружаете все материалы и сокровища, которые вы успели собрать, и тогда получаете возможность обновить свой инвентарь: например, взять предмет, восстанавливающий здоровье, куда мощнее. Если такого предмета нет, всегда можно поиграться в крафтовом меню: при сложении двух предметов вы всегда получите или усиление для уже имеющегося, или совершенно новый предмет. Не стоит, правда, забывать про механику веса в игре: у каждого такого активного предмета есть свой определённый вес, поэтому впихнуть вот вообще всё самое не получится.

Или получится.

Надо только лишь поиграться с крафтовой системой (; 

В ином случае на помощь приходит прокачка отношений с вашими компаньонами: оказывается, в процессе боя с монстрами в подземелья вы зарабатываете friend points (очки дружбы), которые впоследствии можно тратить на friend map (карта друга), где представлены и усиления ваших характеристик, и покупка дополнительных ключей для сундуков, и отдельные story - короткие новельные вырезки, которые позволяют раскрыть персонажей чуточку лучше. По старту игры вам даётся три базовых компаньона, по мере прокачки карты каждого можно получить нового. У каждого друга свои уникальные пассивные умения, которые действительны только в том случае, если выбрать его в качестве компаньона на следующий заход в подземелье. Всего в качестве компаньона можно брать одновременно трёх персонажей. 

Лёгкая и непринуждённая жизнерадостная атмосфера достигается благодаря использованию ненавязчивого инструментального музыкального сопровождения. Колоритная двумерная графика отрисована вручную в векторном редакторе, хотя и не блещет особым разнообразием (один спрайт на персонажа). Немногим присутствующая озвучка - на японском. Прилагаются достижения и коллекционные карточки. Русская локализация отсутствует, однако используемый в игре английский достаточно лёгкий, чтобы заинтересованные могли попробовать себя даже с гугл-переводчиком под рукой. Вообще, игра лишена как такового туториала, однако вполне свободно познаётся на интуитивном уровне.

[b][u]Вердикт[/u]:[/b] Идеально подходит для всех возрастных категорий, поскольку не имеет цензурных изъянов, проста в освоении и немногим развивает внимание, выступая своеобразным тренажером для глаз. Отличное предложение для особых любителей головоломок и match-3, чтобы скоротать часок-другой и расслабиться после тяжёлого рабочего дня.

Впрочем, несмотря на достаточно колоритный геймплей и плюсы, расписанные ранее, Dungeon Girl остаётся всего лишь казуальным Puzzle с незначительными элементами RPG, что практически низводит её до ранга игры-однодневки. Любителям сложных головоломок строго противопоказано.

[i][b][u]Послесловие[/u]:[/b] Исходя из всего описанного, для русского комьюнити цена, вероятнее всего, сделает небольшой жадный кусь.

Didn't know what to expect.

So, after waiting for two years, I was super hyped to finally play it. When you start up the game you get a brief prologue, maybe 2 minutes. There is no story. After this, you're in the 'menu' right away. You get explained everything at once, which can be pretty confusing, I couldn't remember everything, but luckily you can bring up the info/basics any time. 

Gameplay is simple. Click blocks to make them disappear, more blocks = stronger effects. There's attack, search for a staircase to the next floor, recover life, and a few more like finding treasures/recovering mind etc. 

When you get knocked out you still get your items and you can re-start from the last floor.

It's a VERY simple game, with no CGs, repetetive music, and no story at all. Also no lewds or even a little boob/butt.

Don't buy this if you're expecting a great anime dungeon themed match-thingies game, Huniepop was better for that and has 10x the content (if the sexual side isn't for you, just try bejeweled or something.) 

PROS:
Plays easy, you'll want to try again after dying.

CONS:
Repetetive music
Bad/no story
No in depth crafting system, just mix this and that to get better item, only a few items available.
No CGs, just same sprites/art on a different background.
Weird explanations, could've been explained better/less chaotic.

Even so, that didn’t affect my opinion of the final product.[/i]

This game was a nice surprise. [i]Dungeon Girl[/i] is an adventure puzzle RPG with kinetic visual novel features developed by the Japanese group [url=https://twitter.com/Inu_to_Neko]Inu to Neko[/url]. You play as a cute girl called Monica, and your objective is to conquer all the floors of a dungeon, up to 1.000. It's very simple: you just match symbols like ""attack"", ""heal"" and others to perform actions. You can also get help from your party: you can unlock a total of ten characters and have three of them set as support members. 

The more you explore through the dungeon together with them, the more ""friendship points"" you'll get and you'll be able to unlock new skills of your friends. You can also unlock short stories featuring those characters; they don't have an impact on the main story, they're basically just for fun. Besides those points, you can also get money, items, etc. There's also an option to mix items in order to make them stronger or to create entirely new things to help you through your battles. According to the developers, there are around 300 items to craft and 200 skills to use. I think that a guide would be very useful, and I wonder if it's ever going to be made (by the developers themselves or a regular player). [b]I think it's worth mentioning that Dungeon Girl can get kind of hard after a while.[/b] But that's probably me, I like games like this one but I really suck at them too, lol. I also recommend saving your game with a certain frequency, you never know when a powerful monster will show up and drag your face across the floor. 

The art style is pleasing and consistent. But, at least in my opinion, the animation during the story mode seemed a bit ""stiff"". The characters basically have one sprite pose, the only variation is their facial expressions. Still, sometimes their expressions will go unchanged regardless of the situation, and that kind of bothered me a little. Maybe some people won't mind that, I guess that's more like a pet peeve of mine. BGM was alright, but it gets very repetitive after a while. Also, this game has partial voice acting: Monica is the only voiced character, but she only speaks during her battles inside the dungeon. She will mostly say a few words instead of a whole phrase. It would have been nice if all characters were voiced too.

Overall, this game is cute, simple, and it's visually appealing. There are a few problems, though: Dungeon Girl has an intuitive menu and gameplay, and there's a brief explanation of how the game works. However, I think there could have been a step by step tutorial to help players since you just have to guess how things work when you're creating a new item or even when you're using a skill in battle. The resolution of the game is also quite low, and there's no resize option. I haven't finished this game yet, and so far it took me six hours to reach floor 75 and unlock eight of the ten support members. 

7/10. If you like puzzles and match-3 games, you'll enjoy Dungeon Girl! It's all about strategy and some patience. This game can also be very addicting, it's one of those titles where you say ""I'll only play it for a few minutes"" and you end up playing for hours straight. Also, don't expect a deep story and more depth to the characters' personality, this title is heavily focused on the gameplay and the story is kind of ""just there"" in the end.",1533072294,1533072294,True,51,2,0.737861156463623047,3,False,True,False,False,,,

This game is a nice puzzle about exploring a dungeon. The main game mechanic is simple - click on the groups of same-coloured tiles to make them disappear, but the game has a lot of advanced systems on top of that.

PROS:
- Cute visuals
- Familiar game mechanics
- Lots of achievements and systems to explore

CONS:
- The tutorial is text-based and you start with most of the systems already unlocked which might be overwhelming at the beginning
- Fixed-sized window
- The interface has a lot of numbers and indicators, so it feels like a plane dashboard untill you figure it out

TIPS:
- Click Search tiles until you fill the purple meter above. When it's full, you'll get a Stairs tile to go to the next level
- Attacks only work when you have enemies around (left part of the screen) so it might be good to save them for a while
- ""Mind"" is basically stamina. Eat Bentos regularly to keep it up. If it reaches 0, you go back to town and lose treasures from the dungeon.",1533049802,1533050589,True,5,0,0.40309828519821167,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In this game, you will start with 4 characters (MC + 3 characters as support) in which you need to explore a dungeon (alone or as a party). The game will focus on exploring the dungeon (1000 floors to explore in tile-matching style), gather ore/materials/treasures, mix items and fight with monsters (in the dungeons) and gather friend points. The friend points will be needed to unlock more abilities, stories, and support characters, in which you will start with 3 support characters, gain friend points and unlock more characters (more 7 characters available for unlock, totaling 10 support characters). Check their abilities and change your support characters that suit better for your strategies. By unlocking characters and their abilities, you also can change the party type (eg.: warrior, merchant, explorer, etc). Mixing items will allow you get an upgrade or get a new item that can be helpful in your exploration. You also can bring those items to help your journey, however, they will need item points to be used, the item points will slowly recover, so use the items wisely. 

Keep the eye in the Mind and your HP, because once they reach zero, you will be withdrawn from the dungeon and will lose items, materials that you found in the dungeon, only keeping friend points. You can do 3 moves per day (clicking at panels), after doing your moves, will deplete the Mind and start a new day. 

The game can be separated in 2 phases: first, as your main goal is to reach the floor 200, once you reach here, you already finish the game. However, the story continues and your new goal is to reach floor 1000; here will be introduced the auto-mode, where you can customize how the auto-mode will work (eg.: auto explore the dungeon until your HP reach X%, appear a shop, when the mind reaches X%, etc), and with this you can let your PC play for you.

You can only play as Monica (MC), but you can choose your party members that suit better in your strategy. Each support character has few stories scenes to be unlocked and once unlocked, they are available if you want to see the scene again. The plot and character stories in the game is at the minimum as the focus of this game is still mainly on the puzzles. Even so, will worthy view the scenes, some of them are fun.

[spoiler] the only negative part, in my opinion, is the game have partial VA, and in the backlog, only the text will redo, not showing the character name, and this can be confusing. [/spoiler]

Having said that, if you like cute clickers with minimal challenge to zone out while playing, it's not bad. I still wouldn't recommend it without a half-price sale at least.",1533003341,1533003341,False,51,4,0.732046365737915039,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Dungeon Girl is about dungeoneering by squashing big blocks on your screen with your mouse and... Cookies? There's quite a lot of cookies in the game.
Games like this one - none. Seriously. At least none that I know of. This one is fairly odd. I could not talk about the game without immediately hitting the minuses, so let us start where we always start - the pluses:

- the game managed to keep me engaged. The story seems fairly lightweight. Your guild wants you to explore 200 floors of this dungeon, your sister and friends are helping you to do so and they keep on trying to cook food for you to try so that you can bring it to your dungeoneering expeditions. However it is kind of cute in some ways. You continue climbing the floros and unlocking chapters of your friend's stories, just to get a small slice of life.

- once you figure out what you're doing the game is not that difficult to play. You have mind that decreases every time you do anything. You have items that don't use up, but rather use up ""item uses per day"" meter, that refills, so you should keep your mind up by using the mind restore items when you can. You have life. Monsters reduce life, life blocks either refill life or grant extra life. Search tile builds up a bar near your healthbar, once that bar is full you get either an exit, or an ability to climb up a floor. Work generates cash (I think?), attack, well... Attacks. Every time when you enter dungeons you get quests, quests give keys and treasure tiles use them, in turn giving you loot, that is if you manage to exit the dungeon and don't get to 0% mind or health. No matter you fail to leave the dungeon safely or not, you still generate friendship points (each friend has its own generated friendship point ammount) and you can use those points to upgrade your friends, unlock new friends and unlock those friend related stories. 

- rather casual. The consequence from failure is losing your floors up to the last exit you used and losing the loot from that run, but other than that you can just re-enter and try again.

- you can play the game in Japanesse, if you know Japanesse.

Negatives:

- first thing that you'll notice is that there's no graphics options. Game launched in what I'm pretty sure is a 480p window and windowed. So in order to record this I had to record my desktop and zoom riight in. 

- There is no tutorial. You're thrown in and kind of overwhelmed by buttons. 1 hour in I sort of started finding my way around, though I'm still having issue mixing items. At first I thought tha you drag blocks around, like in beweveled. Then I ran out of mind twice without realizing that this isn't just ""my magical power"" used to heal me, but I need it to make any moves at all. 

To sum up:

This game is actually great for me. I love the cute sound effects, I like the casual game style and I want to unlock all the silly stories about them trying to cook up main girl Monica some food. However I think it is up to you to decide if you can live with the negatives, so to be fair to me and everyone else, I'll give Dungeon Girl a 7/10. Don't let the score detter you though if this sounds like something you would play too.",1532984448,1532984448,True,24,0,0.709808528423309326,0,False,True,False,False,,,

[I] One note, while the review was written when my steam account says 46 hours, it's close to 25-30 (as it was left on in inactive periods[/i]

Dungeon Girl is a case of not letting the substance of a game speak for it. It's rough around the edges, with restrictions on the Resolution and some compacting of information, along with some color choices that are really hard to justify (orange and white combos?). Look on the surface, and you've got a game you'd pass on....until you get to the gameplay. The gameplay is an interesting mix of simplicity with the 6x6 grid and reasonable set of tiles that focus on matching things at the right time. That's complemented by a lot of secondary mechanics that allow you to go really in depth with customizing your playstyle, whether it be defensive, offensive, or just chaos. I like the item mixing in particular, as there's several levels to it with the two skill ability that you eventually get. What's interesting is that despite being able to buy permenant upgrades in simple runs of grinding, the game never felt too out of balance once hitting the 50th floor and working your way repeatedly down. 

It's the type of game where you put a movie on that you want to pay reasonable attention to, but still allow you to play while still being engaged. Grinding in the game never got boring because of the focus on the puzzle aspect, and it was quick to do a run or two without thinking. But if you want to get super serious, then you can as long as you pay attention to your mind (stamina) and don't get yourself in a bad situation. Granted, you need a bit of time to really understand the secondary mechanics in the game (item crafting in particular), as I wish the game gave a more interactive tutorial to teach you the information you need.

Overall, if you're need hardcore puzzles, this may not be the puzzle RPG for you, as the game may not entirely challenge you in that aspect difficulty wise. But if you're looking for more of a casual puzzle RPG, Dungeon Girl may be right up your alley.

[b]Positives:[/b]
[list]
[*] A lot of secondary mechanics to help customize your gameplay and experience. Between the items, classes, party members, upgrade system......yeah, you've got a lot to dive into here.
[*] But despite that, the game focuses on the simplicity of the puzzle system in most cases, and that's a good thing. Allows players to let their mind wander a bit in the casual nature of the game.
[*] Like the item system and its balance over the long haul of the game. You need to use it to get further into the dungeons, but it doesn't overwhelm the puzzle portion. 
[*] The status effects actually are thought out well. Sure, some are thought out well like darkness, but confusion/stun stopping you from using items at crucial times are actually well thought out.
[*] Good balance over the life of the game, at least until you get past the first segment of the game (which makes sense to let the player get up to speed).
[*] Despite not using them entirely well, some interesting characters with basic traits. Want to see more of them in the future. 
[*] Good pacing level wise. Understands when it needs to stretch things out difficulty wise rather well.
[*] Like the row mechanic giving a little extra, in conjuction with 1 matches. Sometimes selecting one block makes sense.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] The resolution being so low at 960x600 presents challenges, but it really could have used the extra space. I get that this seems to be aimed to also work on mobile applications (tablet mode option), but there's a lot of compact info on the screen.
[*] The game seems to rely on knowledge of the Inu to Neko universe, and I believe this is the first game translated to the English language. So there seems to be a lot of missing context to enjoy the story at its full capacity. 
[*] Would have like to see some tool tips in certain places to better give information. 
[*] Enemies are hard to see their uniqueness at times. Would have done well to give a bit more of a visual there. 
[*] The game could have used a little more flash, a little more pizzaz.
