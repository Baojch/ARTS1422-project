TLDR: Subscription based MMO that has you roleplay a soldier who can walk around bases and enter vehicles. No one plays servers are deserted.

Review: Menus took forever to load on a really recent machine. Graphics look like mid nineties abandonware. Loading controller defaults did not allow me to actually drive the jeep around. Yeah... because thats a combat aviation game but every time I go in a single player or multiplayer game I am dumped in jeep that I get to drive pointlessly around textureless, empty, barebones military bases. My country was called Red Country. All online modes were solo only except one mode with one server for 10 players. It involved going into instances around the map and supposedly capturing stuff to flip it to your team. The map was perfectly evenly divided between both the teams so I can safely assume nobody captured anything in forever. I tried loading the game again to see if I could get in a plane in single player and the intro music looped 9 times until I tried to tab out and it decided to work. It wanted my email to spam me offers. Buying this game gives you one month with all vehicles unlocked after which you have to pay a fee.

Warning: This game is not for the amatuer / average gamer

This game was developed quite some years ago and was ahead of itself for what it offered. It has been updated and now out on steam.
The game is air combat flight simulator with a very realistic feel and control. After playing the steam version it still feels the same as the old school versions, very hard to learn and I suggest you def' want to get a joystick to help fly.. trust me the keyboard and mouse does not cut it.

Pros: 
~ A good mix of content
~ Realistic controls
~ Flight sim buffs im sure will be happy
~ Dogfights with computers or other people in multiplayer

Cons:
~ Graphics and sound are a little outdated
~ I wish it was easier to learn , this is not for the average gamer
~ I had trouble with this and Windows 8.1 and 10{Windows 7 worked perfect}

If you want realistic flight models, an opportunity to fly in historical events run by the community and supported by the publisher, and a mature community, then this is for you.

Most of the negative reviews will be for the graphics and to an extent the difficulty of the flight models.  It takes a little time to learn how to fly effectively, but the payoff is that you are getting as close as it gets to what it might feel like to have flown one of these planes into action in WWII.  Great community of people, good trainers, and most of the all, the weekly S3 series is immersive and REAL.  Want to experience what it was like to escort B17's deep into Germany against the Luftwaffe, where you are constantly looking over your shoulder wonder if those dots on your high 6 are 190's?  This is it!  The rush of making a clean kill in these series is as good as it gets!

I think the game needs a graphics update, and some work on gameplay, but if realism, immersion, and a great mature community are important, then this has it in spades.

Great game!

""While WarBirds Online is free, IENT is a business, so of course there are limitations. During the first month online you have complete access to all features at no charge. After the first month, you can still play free, but you are limited to an early war plane set, which varies from arena to arena. To access the full set of all aircraft in all arenas, Steam players can purchase day, week or month passes, which range from $2.99 to $15.95. If you just want to play in a specific event on a specific day, the Day Pass is best for you. If you want to play with the best planes, against the best players, whenever you want, the Month Pass is your best choice.""

Recommend you do not buy. Aces high is essentially a more populated version of the same thing with a sub, but no up front fee. I'll admit that the flight model, damage model and graphics are better here. Not ok at all that they charge for the base game if they're going for subscriptions. Feels greedy.

EDIT 1 2015/12/19: Apparently with steam you're supposed to get a month of sub with the purchase so the 15 you spend is supposed to cover the first month of online play. The UI advises to create an account after every training, instant action, mouseclick, but if you make a new account it won't link with steam correctly.

It certainly does NOT require continual in-game purchases to upgrade and/or grinding to get into an aircraft that is competitive. From day one - in off-line and on-line play (depending on historical arena timeframes & subscription) all aircraft and loadouts are available. The selection is entirely up to you.

The flight models are as realistic as the WB development team can make them and they are based on actual performance data. Some aircraft are more forgiving than others - just as they were in real life. There is a learning curve as in all flight sims.

Right first things first this isn't War Thunder so if you are looking for flashy graphics this isn't the combat sim for you. Where this sim compromises on graphics it makes up for it in its large open area online combat in arenas spaning 100s of square miles full of targets, such as airbases, towns, docks, supply depots and carrier battle groups. The aim is in closing the enemies bases/towns etc. to allow friendy troop transports to paratroop and capture them for your side, with victory being achieved when you control all of the map (though don't expect it in a single day cause as mentioned they are LARGE maps). 

Flying is not to difficult as long you don't stall ('Realistic' flight mode), I recommend using a joystick not a gamepad, and flying the training and offline combat in easy flight mode first in order to get a feel of the 100+ aircraft (all of which are available to fly, none of this unlocking and paying for special types), though I do stress that all online flight is with the 'realistic' flight mode so get the hang of flying with it on before venturing into the online arenas.

The aircraft models are are mixture of realism and the need to allow ease of playability, and I will say straight away to head off the 'they don't fly realisticly' crowd, of course they won't this is a COMPUTER SIMULATION (this is why I put qoutes unquotes Realistic above), as with all sims compromises had to be made in order to have a large number of combat flyable types within a 4gig package ALL READY TO FLY FROM THE GET GO!! 
That being said each aircraft has its own quirks, and you need to know whether the type you are flying is a 'Turn and Burner' Like say the Spitfire and A6M Zero or a 'Boom and Zoomer' like the Bf109 and F4U Corsair, because this will dictate how you use them in combat. Also bombers, you need to know whether you will need a full fuel load or not cause this will dictate whether you would be able to take off or not with that heavy bomb load of yours.

The online community is for the majority freindly and approachabl with great comradeship within the arenas and the different sqauds available to join once you have been flying online a while. Though the number of online players will Vary from day to day and within in the different timezones due to us all spread out over different countries. 
I also recommend getting the free downloadable TeamSpeak com system since this is where all squad voice coms are controlled.

As a note basic online membership is around $13 a month or there abouts (don't qoute me on that) and that gets you unlimited access to the main arena.
