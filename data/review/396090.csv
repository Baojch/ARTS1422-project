Since fps is locked at 36, mouse is a little laggy even with v-sync off but it's fine since this isn't a real-time action game. Infact, i like to play at 30 fps if possible since it reduces power consumption; exceptions will be racing games or fast paced action games.

Well so far i'm liking it and probably will be playing this more but i have plenty of other games yet to be played.

It was released on 16 October, 2015. In Rogue State, you play as the leader of Basenji, a nation state ravaged by an uprising that removed the predecessor leader King Salman.  Your objective is to rebuild the country from this turmoil. 

[h1] [b] Campaign [/b] [/h1]
Rogue State features a fun, albeit short story. In rebuilding the country, you are required to complete 60 turns to finish the story and, in this time, you run your country including enacting policies, building infrastructure and bilateral regional relationships, and participating in annual speeches to your population. These mechanics all form part of the campaign where it is imperative you obtain approval of your Cabinet and build country relationships, except Russia who is featured in the game, but they are not nearly as involved as the United States by design (and I am not sure why).

Rogue State’s central concept is an infrastructure tree allowing you to unlock different things across ‘Security’, ‘Society’, or ‘Trade/Diplomacy’. You unlock the items using your finances and they unlock new systems or provide bonuses. For example, an intelligence centre enables you to invest funding into gathering intelligence. The infrastructure tree is pretty good, providing a layer of depth to the game. It includes some neat ideas, notably in the defence space, and think it lays a foundation for it to be built upon in future games.

Throughout my three plays, I particularly liked the events system. Each turn presents you an event that requires a decision and your choice impacts different relationships. I found there to be a nice diverse range of topics presented and an overall number of events covering two playthroughs (about 120 in total). I also found the writing to be generally solid, but thought the dialogue was basic, lacked depth, and there was a lot of repeated content, particularly in the phone calls with other countries, and the voice acting was poor.

I will also note Rogue State has a fairly awful User Interface. When you select different screens in your office, your character walks to the location of the function. For instance, your player will walk to a globe in your office if you select ‘regional map’. This is cumbersome and can get fairly annoying. 

Elsewhere, I think the games’ 60 turn scope limits some of the functions, such as special project development and intelligence, where investing in these facets do not amount up to anything material. The developers introduced an ‘endless mode’; however, this mode excludes the storyline.

[h1] [b] Replayability [/b] [/h1]
Earlier, I noted Rogue State has a short campaign, which I timed each playthrough at about 2.5 hours. To address this, Rogue State includes multiple endings and procedural generation (different countries and situations, and randomised events per campaign). I think Rogue State shines in this aspect and the short nature of it allows you to easily try different tactics and tackle different situations. I would suggest three full plays is an optimal amount to uncover all story elements.

[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]
Rogue State was a decent experience that features a fun story that introduces an interesting premise in the conflict of Basenji. It is further supported by solid writing, a very nice ‘events’ system, as well as the central infrastructure tree. This is offset by a limited amount of dialogue, poor voice acting, and a terrible User Interface. Overall, Rogue State has provided the introduction into the series and has sold me on the sequel Rogue State: Revolution. At $11.99, I recommend this on sale.

Really, really entertaining. You are the leader of the revolution that toppled the previous government, and the whole game happens inside your ""presidential room"", where you can decide which infrastructures to build, set tax rates, set policies, interact with foreign leaders (mostly for trading the 2 resources any country gets) and finally checking the military. Every turn, something happens that will require a decision from you, a decision that will influence the support from the 4 major social groups: of course, keeping them happy with you is essential, but doing so is also costly so you have to balance the social requests with the state's budget and the need to develop infrastructures to get more money and support, etc.
In the main story, the game ends near turn 60/70, where you have to defeat a counter-insurrection to win - but there is also an endless play, where you go on indefinitely. 


Honestly, i really liked it. Managing the state is complex, but not frustratingly so - and, nice bonus, there is no micromanaging money and infrastructures. Every turn there is something new happening and, while the decisions you take are not major, they still helps you fit in your ""role"" as glorious leader.; plus, these events are numerous enough that you don't see them twice in the same normal playthrough (but it does happen in the infinite mode).

Удивительно, но на нее мало русскоязычных обзоров, хотя она, безусловно, стОит подробного описания.

Вы начинаете игру как президент республики Басинджи, где совсем недавно свергли злобного монарха.
Кроме вас на карте еще три государства (одним из них по воле рандома может быть Чикенистан под руководством натурального императора-петуха). Кроме этого в игре незримо присутствуют ООН (можно организовать приезд Президента Штатов), США и иногда Россия.
В стране 4 сословия- патриоты, либералы, фундаменталисты и капиталисты. Значительное время в игре вы будете бороться за их поддержку, в том числе - двигая бегунки политических решений.
Также в игре есть правительство, одним из министров которого работает ваш старший и тупой брат. Министры (кроме брата) иногда подбрасывают квесты - передвинь войска туда-то, снизь ставку налога и прочее. За выполнение квестов министры выдают бустеры - деньги и поддержку сословия.

Ходу на пятом вы восстанавливаете страну и она начинает производить рандомные ресурсы. Эти ресурсы вы можете экспортировать, а также импортировать ресурсы соседей. Определенные сочетания ресурсов обычно увеличивают поддержку какого-то из сословий.

Кажется, все просто, да не тут то было. Восстановив страну, вы мирно просуществуете пяток ходов, а затем начнутся проблемы. То эпидемия гриппа, то террористы, то экономический кризис, то сепаратисты начнут отделяться. Для каждой проблемы - свое решение. Не убьют террористы - так родной братан может свергнуть.

Также можно построить ядерную ракету и пульнуть куда-нибудь ей. Можно убивать лидеров соседних государств. Можно построить нефтепровод. Можно оскорблять посла США. Можно продать соседям оружие. Можно вторгнуться в соседнюю страну...

Примерно к 60-му ходу игра заканчивается. По результатам вам демонстрируется счет очков, после чего можно начинать заново.

Игру рекомендую. Своих грошиков она стоит

It's actually more difficult than I was expecting it to be compared to other similar games I've played in the past so if you like a challenge you might enjoy the challenging aspect of this game.

My biggest qualm with this game is that you are very much steered towards having o be corrupt as a leader in some way.  Many of the things you purchase in game are geared towards corrupt dictatorship.  This is something that I feel unfairly stereotypes the Middle East which in this game is of course largely fictionalized.  It also sterotypes Islam and largely portrays in negatively in the game.  It doesn't call it ""Islam"" or it's followers ""Muslims"" which I can only assume is their way of trying to get around offending people but this takes place in the Middle East the people are dressed in stereotypical Middle Eastern clothes, women in the game are portrayed in hijab, etc... Instead the game refers to the religion as the ""Old Ways"" which I also find a little offensive as if to suggest that they are old and thus no longer relevant (something which some of the discussion options also tend to express).  All of this makes it so that you can never truely explore what it would be like to create a free and liberal Middle East which still respects and upholds cultural traditions and respects religious values.  You can really only be a religous fundamentalist dictator or a liberal dictator.  You can't find a balance where you can have everyone relatively happy, your funds are so tight that it makes it extremely difficult to move in positive direction without being highly corrupt and pandering to capitalists all the time.

If you like these types of simulation games then you'll probably enjoy it but if you thought this was maybe your only viable outlet for experiencing peace and prosperity in the Middle East this will be a let down.  It's skewed towards despotism and dictatorship.  On the other hand that does seem to accurately reflect the current state of most Middle Eastern governments but I play games for the escape from reality even when they are based in reality and simulation so I don't think this is as good a match for my tastes personally.

It's one of those games where ""neutral"" recommendation is the best answer but not available so i went with negative because i can't in good conscience recommend it - despite some good things about it.
First the positives:
+ It's a ""political"" themed strategy game where your main area of interest is in internal affairs, not conquest or international politics. This is a ""+"" in my book because such games are on one side something I enjoy and secondly are very, very few. 
This game very strongly reminds me of a late 80s game ""Hidden Agenda"" - except less deep and more silly than ""HA"". The biggest difference being that here you have a fictional Middle-Eastern banana republic in 21st century instead of a fictional Central American banana republic in late Cold War era. The similarities are so big (also in some gameplay elements) I wonder if it's only a coincidence. Another title that might have been used as source of ideas is ""Crisis in the Kremlin"" from early 90s, If those games really served as source of inspiration - that's not a bad thing at all, I believe that taking ideas from forgotten old gems is not done enough in the game industry.
+ It has some climatic elements done well, like the bull***t interview as the intro.

The downsides however, oh my...
- It's shallow. The mechanics are extremely simple to the point of being ridiculously so. The worst offender are probably the ""policies"". Basically you can change them as you see fit at any time on every turn. No delay, no political cost, no problem in implementation. One day the country has no social policies at all - the next turn it has them on level comparable to Germany or Sweden. And then on the 3rd turn not at all again. Because why not, makes sense, right ?
- The only challenge comes from heavy RNG, Otherwise getting both money and good ratings is easy once you learn how. Which can be ""mastered"" in one, maximum two games. Some of the major crisis are brutal but which one you get is rng based. Except the last one as i understand it which is always the same.
- Some gameplay elements are completely useless, like the resources which are good to make money but otherwise don't serve a purpose (and not, the laughably weak bonuses to relations with certain groups if you complete some ""sets"" of resources are useless as ratings are much easier to come by than money is and money can buy ratings via many events and buildings anyway not to mention is essential for fighting the major crisis),
- Too many gameplay choices are simply always the optimal ones. For exemple the special projects - they're only moderately useful and some are mostly added for ""fun"" it would seem. However one (the hydroelectic power project) is very profitable if done early (and won't fail which is RNG based you can only modify the chance but never to 100%).
- Low replayability value im my opinion. There are some additional starts to unlock and ""hard difficulty"" but they don't seem to do much, except even worse rng in hard mode.
- And one of the worst things I left for last: interface. Or rather the fact that every single thing your character does is animated. Sure you can skip some/most of the animaions but there are some that I don't think you can, for exemple the talks with an American Ambassador. In general this game looks and plays as if too much effort went into ""cinematic looks"" instead of on more interesting, challenging, varied and deeper mechanics.
- The whole thing feels like a collage of semi-random elements glued together without much thought, spiced with heavy RNG and mixed with a lot of forcibly ""funny"" or ""cool"" elements but not resulting in a coherent gameplay.

Overall:
5/10

It's not a terible game. It's good fun for the first 2 or 3 (short) games. It's still a ""political"" game even if extremely simple, silly and shallow mechanically and ridden with horrible design decisions like the mentioned animations.
As i said in the beginning, i would give it a ""neutral"" recommendation if I could. For anyone who like the sub-genre it's worth a try (buy at heavily discounted price). For anyone else my recommendation is: don't bother.",1531049674,1531050725,False,2,0,0.535711705684661865,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Turn based, government and menus. Play Democracy3 instead. Every turn something bad happens, your interactivity is low and you repeat the same steps every match.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/245470/Democracy_3/

Rogue State starts you off controlling a little guy across two rooms. There are hotspots in the room but there whole office is just a frontend for the toolbar. The UI however lacks the ability to skip walking from the president. There are no hotlinks to go straight to appropriate sections for objectives, favors of ministers and other subquests.

You unlock bonuses for your money or your approval by spending money on infrastrutuctures and can do minor tweaking on a dozen different policies to try to balance the approval from the four different factions.

No matter what you do the game will have you place a bad minister in one of the 5 main ministries ensuring you have a major weakness. While one minister will just go unboosted due to lack of ministers to assign.

So you go from turn to turn, each turn a random event happens, sometimes the choices you are given have the same + and - modifiers despite being different options. 

Ultimately however there is no rhyme or reason to any of it. All you end up doing is scanning your multiple gauges for the one group you cannot piss off and you sacrifice the other group to try to keep all your spinning plates balanced.

Assuming you manage to be lucky and finish the dam project, build your infrastructure in just the right sequence and you might be able to weasel through for a while until eventually the random events end up being too great a penalty to absorb and your population riots and you get exterminated.

The thing is random events add permanent penalties and not only a on time hit. So that even if you have everything under control you can find yourself in a serious deficit through no fault of your own.

The game tries to break approval rating in the senate and by the population and from the military. However there is no way to simply rely on one branch of the government and forsake the others. I could not for example, find a way to abandon religion and just go full capitalism and pro west. Or the other way around, or go full communist so on and so forth.

I found sending military to attack was also cumbersome, with my troops getting dispatched turn after turn even though the health bar for the foes were at 0. 

When you finally die your death by 1000 cuts you get a bit of scorepoints which you can spend on permanent upgrades on the dictator but the amount of grind to achieve that is a bit daunting and the bonuses did not immediately appear like they would really spice up the gameplay.

Conclusion: This game appears ambitious at first glance, like someone had a fairly refined idea of what factions they wanted in and how they should interplay with each other. But somehow that careful act of scripting, balancing, adding more government wide policies, more one time boosts and events you can willingly partake in and better control over the military would all had been needed but are missing. As things stand this is shallow and formulaeic. If you are going to stare at gauges play Democracy it is much more fully fledged, interactive and visually clear. It is probably too bad because the turn based tour of the office, the voice acted little dolls, the middle eastern music playing had decent flavor.",1531037891,1531038531,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've tried to like it, I spent on it 7 hours, and 12 more after some pause, and in the end I felt robbed.

The game lets you feel like a ruler in terms of stress and management, but not in terms of making a difference. Sometimes the game doesn't seems to answer to your choices, sometimes it's misguiding/arbitrary, and sometimes it feels too cruel or even too sugared.

About choises:
You can disallow the death penalty and give amnesty to defeated enemies, but anyway NPCs will say that you executed them publicly, and sometimes the game will obliviously suggest to punish your subordinates with nonexistent measure.
Random regular events – an important gameplay feature – contribute to the sence of powerlessness. Event can ask you to deal with, say, ecological problem, and the only way to resolve it... is to encounter this crisis not before, say, 9th turn. Player needs do have specific construction, and it's impossible to build it earlier. That could add some drama or ""realism,"" but player can never defer the decision for later, not even for a month, and it doesn't always makes any sense.

About misguiding:
You can lose the game while having 100% approval of every person and institute in the country just because UI doesn't help you to understand objectives. It feels like the game cheats, and it's not the only case. After every walkthrough you'll earn some XP to unlock new gameplay features. Unfortunately, some of them are mediocre, and others just have no effect (literally).

About cruelty or sugary:
Again, it's just another case of inability to play as you want. You can build liberal paradise, but your subordinates will anyway fail to interrogate prisoner without killing him. Alas, it was mentioned in a dialogue, and dialogues doesn't react to your play-style, they all written for default heartless dictator. Sweetness is the opposite: a severe ruler can forbid hamburgers and western haircuts, but the most brutal measure he can inflict on liberal manifestation is... turning a blind eye on it.

You get 5 years, i.e. 60 turns, which you have to survive and hopefully rack up a good score.

The good:

- A good breadth of approaches are possible. You can please some factions while neglecting others, you can be a corrupt kleptocrat, you can be a warmonger or a peacebroker, side with the USA or Russia, oppress or empower the ethnic minority, and more.

- It's varied. Each playthrough randomizes the events you get, the resources that become available, population faction membership, ministers and the big late-game crisis (such as a recession or terrorist threat). Makes for lots of replay value.

- There are collectibles, including game modes with alternate start conditions, and some easter-eggy unlockables.

The Bad:

- The military aspect is atrocious, or at least woefully underexplained. I never have any idea why my units are winning or losing. I don't know what forces the enemy has since they're not shown on the map, and I don't understand why my buildings are getting destroyed when I have forces at the border. It's so bad and obtuse, I almost gave the game a negative rating. 

- Expensive superprojects have a chance of failure. This shouldn't be. If you put millions and millions into a project and it fails, you may as well start over. Very ill-conceived system given how tight your budget is and how much money is involved. Maybe instead there should be multiple levels of funding that get you more bonuses the more you invest in the project.

- The intelligence system seems like a lot of expense for little gain. 50 million might get you a tidbit of info that you can use one time to increase relations with one neighbor by a bit. I just didn't find it worth the expense. It's super-insulting too when you pay tens of millions just to get a morsel of info about a leader that Wikipedia would have told you. I know you can get more indepth stuff, but the expense is just unacceptable. If you could direct intelligence spending on specific areas, or the investment needed for each type of intel was more transparently explained, it would be a much more engaging mechanic. See, like the military aspect, the game seems to think uncertainty is an involving game mechanic, which it can be but not when you don't understand what is happening or why. The rules need to be clearer and better represented in the game. Uncertainty should come down to the player making informed choices knowing the risks, not to being left in the dark about vital information.

Other remarks:

- As with real life, it all comes down to money. Practically everything takes money. It's really easy to get people to love you if you just throw enough money at their problems. Which is good if you want a financial sim, but perhaps not so good if you expect a complex political sim. Once you've tried a playthrough or two, you'll get the picture that, while it's easy to keep most everyone happy and stay in the green in the early and mid-game, the late game throws you a curve ball that - you guessed it - takes lots of money to solve. So you learn to be frugal and squirrel away cash into the treasury for that stormy, stormy day.

Verdict: It's clear this team put a lot of effort into this game, and this is why I'm giving it a positive rating, but key aspects are too half-baked and underexplained for it to be consistently fun. These are things that can be patched, and that would make Rogue State a real gem.",1495699163,1495699977,True,26,0,0.745314657688140869,0,True,False,False,False,,,

THE GOOD: For a political game, you have a lot of directions you can move in.  Advisor confidence, international relations (un, us), national relations (three neighboring middle east countries), faction relatons (liberals, fundamentalists), and intelligence projects that can be used to manipulate all of these.  There's a lot of interesting aspects for such a cheap political game.

THE BAD: Ultimately, the game is just a matter of answering politically-oriented questions with the end result being that some points go here and other points go there, while trying to maximize your total points across all piles (each pile being something that can acccumulate influence, like a faction or a country).  In that sense, it can get boring (especially in the long run), but I pardon it on account of its price.

THE SIMILAR: The policy and faction aspect of Tropico is clearly visible here, but not the SimCity-aspect of Tropico.

Instead of writing a technical review of what this baby can do, I'll tell you guys the tragic tale of Glorious Leader Hedegaard of the People's Republic of Basenji.

*** SPOILER WARNING ***

The honourable ruler had managed to please (or dispose) of everyone in the proud country of Basenji. The people where happy and the economy was risen - things where looking bright for the young republic.

The Glorious Leader had, as a Glorious Leader must, prioritized the means avaible to him. Hospitals where not an important thing - We didn't have them before, why would we need them now? People seemed to agree with reasoning.

Until a deadly virus came upon the land...

Devestating the fragile economy, the borders where closed. All funds where allocated to treating the deadly virus. All of the country's monetary reserves (and more) was spend. The economy was cripled, but the virus was eventually defeated and export could provide steady income once more.

Basenji's weakness did however not go unnoticed by the neighbouring countries. In an act of cowardise, Basenji was attacked one morning. Being a responsible Glorious Leader, Hedegaard deployed all forces to the border. At the brink of defeat Basenjis forced prevailed and held back the enemy onslaught. All but annihaleting the Basenji army.

With a decimated army stuck in the desert my all but forgotten brother decided that his time was now...

BTW: Once we get Steam Workshop on this baby, this game will be downright insane!

Rogue State is a politically-themed roguelike infused with a surprisingly deep and satisfying level of strategy. The core of the game focuses on keeping your popularity high with your four key factions: capitalists, patriots, liberals, and fundamentalists. At the end of each round you are faced with a random event. How you choose to deal with these events may have positive or negative effects on your factions, on your neighbours, or even on your relations with the US. Balancing all of these factions can prove challenging, but after a few games you start to ""see through the matrix"" and understand how to best manage your country. 

The game features a charming sense of humour that never overstays its welcome, and the writing is very effective. It's clear the developers have a strong understanding of political science and used that knowledge to help flesh out your role as the Glorious Leader.

You're the chosen leader of an intermediary government attempting to rebuild the country of Basenji after the overthrow of a monarch. As you rebuild your infastructure and balance relations between the various factions of your society, you must keep an eye out on foreign leaders looking to exploit your vulnerable country. On top of all this, your brother is constantly seeking an opportunity to plot a coup deta against you. You have to keep a healthy relationship with the armed forces and your cabinet if you plan to keep your power in office.

Random events occur in every session, making every playthrough different. You will not know when these events will trigger, and they can disrupt your short term plans, leading to complete anarchy.

There are also interesting special projects that can be created in secret by your government. Some of these can lead to disastorous conflicts of interest between you and other nations, such as the United States.

Some of these projects reflect actual real  life political conflicts of interest, while others are just silly and fun. 

At the heart of this game is a satirical look at government overthrows, similar to the ones in Iraq or Libya. The game is more nuanced in its politics but parallels can be made in some of the gameplay and ideas represented. 

My only complaint would be that the tutorial was not detailed enough to really learn all the features on my first playthrough. This made the game a real learning process in the first couple of attempts, but I was never mad or annoyed by this. I was never frustrated when I lost a game as for the most part failure was a consequence of poor long term planning. And when you finally do win, it is incredibly satisfying. 

Graphics - 7.5/10 I'm a sucker for retro and indie style graphics, and it was one of the things that sold me on this game. Granted, not everyone will appreaciate this art style, but it really fit the game. Some of the models for characters could have looked a little better, but overall the game looks nice.

Music - 8/10 Solid. Fits the theme of the game in every way, and any given piece of music fit an event in the game. The Basenji national anthem is possibly the greatest anthem ever made, right up there with Kazekstan. 

Gameplay - 9/10 I can't praise the gameplay enough. This game is FUN. It's not as complex as civilization, or age of wonders, but its not trying to be any of those games. It has a unique gameplay style that is easy enough for anyone to learn that has the time or interest. No outcome is ever the same, because the challenges you face every time will vary.

Story - 8/10 The story was fun. Depending on how long your regime survives, you'll see more of the story unfold. And because playthroughs aren't the same, you might see new story threads each time you play. 

It's rare that I even recommend games, but I felt compelled to share my opinion of this game because of how much fun I had. Really. Check it out. If you're really on the fence about it, I'd recommend to pick it up during a steam sale. But if you're into strategy games, you will probably like this game.

独裁者不总是坏人，只是他总会因为各种原因坏起来。

rogue state是这类游戏中一个全新的体现，你扮演中东一个小国的新任民选总统，在周围三个国家以及美国爸爸的威胁之下你必须找到重建并发展国家的道路，同样的，你只能靠你自己，你还得平衡国内各派的意见，防御外部势力的袭击。
[h1]TL;DR:优秀的地缘政治模拟游戏，操作简单易于上手，却略失随机性和重复可玩性，体验感觉相对平衡却也在外交等某些方面显得过于简化。[/h1]

7.5/10 +人群好评度系统简单清晰 +对诸多体系的抽象化
            - 随机事件库相对较少 -外交手段单一 -UI

政治模拟游戏是相对比较稀少的一种游戏类型，至今比较有名的也就只有被莫名其妙吹起来的Democracy3和有真才实干长期积累的P社Grand Strategy大系列，以及，Rulers of Nation这个UI糊成了不知道是啥的系列。

其实在这三部作品里能和rogue state拿出来比较的只有democracy这个我一再点艹的游戏。
democracy在我看来的问题是各种数据体系本身过多而政治力量在政策修改中只是简单的三段式算法导致游戏直接降档为三流。
rogue state系统其实在维度上多了一个战争和间谍页面，同时政策页面的简化也直接趋近于两难的抉择即讨好民众或增加国库。
设计的逻辑非常清楚，玩起来也并不是太过于困难。军事的数值设定比较合理。政策设计相当合理。

但是后期的一些选项又会因为太过直接而缺少牵一发而动全身的情况，这点上确实还要和Democracy3学习学习。

对于政治模拟游戏我一直觉得你很难真正意义上去反应真实心理，对很多小朋友来说他们会觉得玩玩游戏就能被启蒙，但其实这些游戏往往只能把你变成国家主义者。他早已经把你所谓人的这一层属性褪去了一大半，在游戏之中你只是一个开了上帝视角的代表国家的幽灵而已（此为引述Necromanov)，所以，娱乐就好，放宽心态。",1455082568,1455082580,True,42,6,0.794933557510375977,10,True,False,False,False,,,

For starters, it really depends on if you like this sort of strategy game if you should get it or not. Certainly not as complicated (not even in the same vein of complication) as games like Victoria 2 or EUIV, but still complex.

My biggest issues with the game, was that it was hard to grasp how the policies worked in conjuction with the parties, also I felt like certain policies should influence more or some parties should have more policies attributed to them. That being said, it's not very hard to keep all the parties in line, you just have to be careful.

The military doesn't exist. Like it does, but it's extremely neglibile and hard to grasp, the funds aren't really there to allow much freelancing with the military in the first place. It's also extremely difficult to fulfill the advisors requests sometimes, like they could just be out of reach and you either don't have the funds or the means to perform the tasks they're asking you to perform, which becomes frustrating very easily because next thing you know, shawty got low (low low low low) and your brother just took over the government cause all of your advisors hated you.

Some of the infrastructure literally doesn't matter, like at all. I'm personally of the opinion that your game should be like a plate of food. Everything on the plate should be edible. Translated to gaming terms, everything should matter. If you have to spend resources on something, it should matter unless it's cursed or trapped or there's a specific reason why it doesn't matter.

The graphics and voice acting are.. Fine. I mean, they're not good, they're not bad. They're passable. I think better graphics and better voice acting and UTI would definitely help take this game to the ""next level"".

Your speeches. Sometimes they'll end up making no literary sense, which is a risk you take when you have that kind of mechanic in a game. LUCKILY for Rogue State, it's a nice mechanic, just maybe should be fleshed out a bit better. In the same vein, diplomacy always feels a little clunky, and I wish espionage was easier or done in a better way because I shoot myself in the foot a lot and end up getting invaded from all sides like I'm Sasha Gray.

Faro is a little twat. Fluff that ninja, I hate Faro.

All of that being said, it's a fine game. Not a ton of replayability but replayability does exist. I think it simulates the parties well, I think it simulates the stress of running a country and making big decisions and taking risks and even managing a house of representatives well. I enjoyed it's simplicity, at times.

In short, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody that I didn't see struggling with games like Vicky 2 or EU4, but still loving strategy.

Out of ten, Rogue State is my idea of a perfectly average game, so a 5/10. I recommend it, but don't expect a lot.",1453726014,1453726014,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As always I reserve the right to change this ranking to thumbs up but right now this is a pretty poor game. I'd stay clear if I were you. I got it for $6 on the Steam sale and it's currently not even worth that. 

It's a cute game of supposedly running your little kingdom after a coup d'etat put you in charge. You build infastructure, make decisions, talk with your neighbors, build a military and try to stay in office. I'd love to be the dictator of a third-world nation. The idea has so much potential to be both evil and good...but that potential isn't realized here.

The biggest flaw in Rogue State is that there aren't enough ""levers"" to make things interesting. You simply don't have the tools to cope with the types of disasters - financial, health, war - that you'll be confronted with. Much of the ""strategy"" comes down to which two resources you get. If they're good and they have synergy, you can get a robust economy going. This is important since EVERYTHING TAKES MONEY. Need military units? Money. Need to build infastructure? Money. Need to avert a natural disaster? Money. Need to spy on your neighbors? Money. If you don't have it you simply can't do anything but hit next turn. And since your resources drive much of your economy....basically you might as well quit out and restart if you draw crappy ones. That's not strategy, that's simply poor design.

As I said, you don't have enough levers. You have access to about a dozen sliders that are either generally on, mid-way or off. Once you've set these tinkering doesn't help much because they're long term sliders and, truthfully, there's very little evidence that they do anything substantial (more on feedback later). Need to boost your standing with your neighbors? There's no lever for that - there's about 5 conversation options and once those are exhausted (ONE TIME USE) there's literally no point in talking with your neighbors except to renew trade deals. 

Unemployment is another great example of not having enough levers. There's literally one option in the entire game to boost employment (foreign visas). If that's off already then there's nothing - zero, zip, zilch - you can do about unemployment. It doesn't matter if you're running a $30m surplus, you can't hire more people into the government (which is 1 of hundreds of things in the real world a government could do to boost employment). 

I said I'd talk about feedback. There isn't enough. Why did your surplus go from $30m to $22 this month? No idea and there's nothing to tell me why. Why is unemployment high? No idea. Heck, what is the unemployment rate? No idea. What's the GPD? No idea. What resources are in demand? No idea. Why does my neighbor not like me? No idea. What impact did moving a slider have? No idea. You get the point. No feedback + few options makes Jack a Very Unhappy Boy.

Then there's the bugs...this game isn't Early Access. There are game-breaking bugs to be found - ones that will absolutely destroy your game. For instance, there are about half a dozen special projects in the game. They're not that exciting to be honest but they're there. If you decide to invest in one (you do so with an up front cost and a monthly fee) and somehow that project gets canceled or fails, the game will continue to deduct that monthly fee FOREVER. So you end up continuing to pay in perpetuity for a dam that was never built or a nuclear program that was stopped due to international pressure. There's no excuse for a bug like this, especially when it's been reported but not patched. That's just one of a few bugs that I've come across. *shakes head*

Then there's the graphics (meh - looks like something from the early 90s), the tedium of watching your guy walk around the office, the lack of any real replayability and just the feeling that you're really not in control of most anything that makes it pretty bland.

Conceptually, I'd like to play a game like this. But Rouge State has too little content, too little feedback, too many bugs and is ultimately too forumalic to be much fun.",1452720167,1452720219,False,126,5,0.821118414402008057,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is a turn based, point and click roleplay game where you play as the president of the new Republic of Basenji. There are many funny events and some easter eggs you get as you explore the dialogues and all the panels. It is actually a bit hard in the beguinning and I only managed to beat it after failing some four times. 

I found it enjoyable and would recommend it if you are into such gender and/or indies games, specially during sales. 

However, there are many features that I think could be changed to make the game way better. Although the first couple of runs may be quite challenging, once you get the hang of the ideal policies configurations and learn to never accept increases in your expenses during the events the game actually gets quite easy. It is relatively easy to be loved by all factions after some time and investments, if you remender to keep good relations with your neighbours so they do not invade you the game is already half won. The storyline events and crises to add some flavour, but end limiting the replayability after a few runs. Still, it took me quite some time to get the hang of it, and I still an trying to get all the secrect propjects, so I dont think the game is actually too short.

The main problem I see is the lack of depth given to some features. For exemple, there are many events, decisions and policies that affect the GDP, but these do not actually affect your income in any way. Should the economy and poliocies be revamped to have more variation and possible choises ( not an ideal perfect standar), the game would be way more interesting. 

The war system is mostly uselless as of now, it costs a lot to build an army (mostly drones), and even when you win the batles you just loose some troups and nothing happens. Getting a positive armistice is quite hard and does not give any substancial amount of money. If the war system would allow for the conquest or great financial benefits with high political risks a whole new dimension would be added.

It is, at its heart, a resource management game.  This game is similar to democracy, with its sliders to change policies that affect public opinion.

For example, a newspaper prints bad things about you, do you 1. censor the paper 2. kill the author, 3. do nothing?  Each of those choices will affect a segment of your country's population.

The Good:  I love its zany atmosphere, and the game's ability to describe real-world ""serious"" into ""funny.""  The game got me wanting to see what happnens next.

The Bad:  I want to see what happens next.  After a while, some of the animation gets repetitive.  There are ""dead"" turns where all you do is hit ""next turn.""  There is also an issue with balancing (I feel) where min/maxing stats leads to a pretty droll game.  For example, putting taxes to 50% without much repercussion (even on hard) is weird.  Maxing out policy decisions for ""good"" policies like police or courts seems like a no-brainer, especially when the reward vs the cost is lopsided.  It should have negative to positive sliders for policies.

Each year is divided into several turns.  Given the topical nature of the game and limited but repayable scenario I recommend it for those who want to experience a fairly standard government game with unique flavor.  The graphics and sound are functional and some of the touches, like having the U.S. ambassador answer the phone and meet you, are cute touches but one wonders if the time would have been better spent elsewhere.   
Rogue State occupies an incredible is the sense of place and time.  The setup is that you’re managing a newly formed country after an Arab Spring style uprising and must appoint your more popular younger brother to the cabinet.  You must balance the wants of multiple factions (Capitalists, Liberals, the religious community, etc.), security concerns, economic growth, and foreign policy with three neighbors.  Overlooking all of this is the United States.  The Role of the U.S. is similar to the cold war powers in the Tropico franchise.  While able to be used as a boon too much negativity could lead to an unacceptable outcome.
To a gamer that has managed elf kingdoms, star empires, defeated the Allies and communist scum in WWII what Rogue State provides is a truly unique sense of place and time.  That the events are closely modelled on recent events in our world are truly interesting and show a great care by the creators.
Rogue State is as much an “art” indie game like Gone Home, The Novelist, or Papers Please.  By playing on a gamer’s sense of min/maxing it creates interesting choices between doing the “Right” thing, roleplaying a certain style of government, and winning the game.  Enough options exist to survive several playthroughs even with a fairly linear story that you will lose at least once.
In many ways this game feels more suited towards being an IPad or Facebook game.  The turn based structure gives incremental returns and at least one choice per turn.  The game typically is spent making a choice, waiting for the impacts to be felt, and managing a request from a faction or foreign power.  Balancing limited resources creates several “Ah-ha” moments during the first few playthroughs but a limited A.I. ends up making other subsequent games more about experiencing different story branches.
I would recommend a purchase and play of Rouge State given the setting and interesting flavor.

The developers of this game truly have put in a lot of work towards creating an expereince which incorporates a variety of factors that must be fulfilled in order for one to be succesful, thus creating an equally interesting and challenging experience for the player. 
While the graphics are certainly up to a satisfactory standard the gameplay itself gets a little stale after a while - not necessarily because there aren't enough events occuring throughout the game but rather because of its very nature.
There is only that much that the developers can do with this particular type of Indie-game, but what bothers me at times is the limited speed of the characters movement, the events occuring in response to such, and the repetitve events in response to my actions.

To sum it up:

Pros;
- Detail-rich gameworld
- Interesting characters, each with their own unique personality
- A pleasing limit of resources (e.g. money) that create scenarios in which it is crucial to make a decisive choice
- The humour of the game itself (Chickenistan)
- Blend of politics, economics, and military strategy

Cons;
- Slow movement of the characters, thus prolonging the game unnecessarily
- Repetitive personalities despite the fact that the characters are frequently with every new game started.
- Trade with neighbouring states does not significantly impact the game itself, thus failing to create a wholesome economic simulation.

So at the end of the day this game is totaly worth buying.  If you are an Indie fan then I would definetely recommend this to you, though keep in mind that I personally do not feel as if it is worth the current 12.99 EUR they are charging for it - I bought it when it was on a 50% sale - in my opinion that is more apropriate of a price.

Please continue on making similar games, I will definetely buy them and can only re-iterate that this game is equally interesting and challenging.

A country controlling system enough good, have a lot of options, dialogues in game also good solved. Graphic not a beautiful but enough nice. Music and voices also solved good.

So my verdict

+good dialogues
+lot of random happening
+enough deep controlling system
+trading cards

-only for that who really love that style
- bit high price

I think if you like a same style game, like thinking and like a politic its game for you. Yes game have some bugs and not a perfect, but enough good and can be enjoyable. A price for game at the moment too high, but if its get around 75% discount or be in bundle its can be instant buy.

This is almost what I always wanted.

This game also has a sense of humour which works. Other political games attempt it and they fall flat. The only other political game that succeeds with this sort of humour is 'Papers, Please'.

The problem with this game is that it doesn't make you desperate to replay it once you've finished the story once.

Rogue State is a very strategized game, filled with a lot of confusing things..
You really need to get the feeling before you can play this game, in my video i will show you HOW TO NOT!
Play Rogue State, i'm not an expert myself in this game, because i'm not a fan of Strategic games, but hey.. its okay.



Overall my rating for this game is 8/10 for story wise, or gameplay wise, in terms of it being a Point & Click Game.
Still doesn't have a feeling like most point & click games do though.. its still good in any way if you enjoy strategic games.




TLDR: Do you like strategic games? 
Then this is the game for you!

[u] Summary: [/u]
It's type of game that solid in a lot of aspects, but doesn't stand out necessarily in any way. It does a good job of putting you into the shoes of a political leader as you have to balance the different factions and their loyalty while still attempting to keep your regime going and yourself in power. There's a lot of factors that play into that, as it creates a spider's web of different factors affecting your reign over the people. But I will admit that it may not be my cup of tea, as while the simulation factor has some good elements to it, it doesn't necessarily stand out in any single way. The visuals can be awkward at times, and the UI could be clunky and has scenes that are unnecessary. The randomization element does feel realistic, but at times can be horribly punishing as your house members ask you for things that are just not feasible. There are times where the game also is inconsistent in tone and goes one step too far, where it actually starts to effect gameplay. Rogue State is a solid game, but it's hard to sit here and say that it's going to stand out. It's a title I'd target in a sale, or for those who like geo-political games.

[*] The difficulty of balancing different factions and still being successful in your overall goals delivers on a strategy and simulation element. Makes you realize how hard it would be to be in an environment such as this.  
[*] Does a good job of hitting on core issues in the current media environment, without taking sides on the issue as well.
[*] Handles the subject manner well without offending any one. This isn't necessary (I don't think it's necessary to make a game that makes everyone happy), but special effort was made to show all sides of things, which I appreciated.
[*] Effects of decisions have consequences both seen and unseen, but you can figure out what the unseen has done in the background. Makes every decision that much more important. 
[*] Like the resource management of the game and how it affects your factions approval: smart use of export/import mechanisms. 
[*] The game can have it's humorous moments in small moments here and there, especially in the newspaper portion.

[b]-:[/b]
[list]
[*] Sometimes the game's humor works against itself. It's great that they went the humor route with a chicken leader, but being unable to know what he's actually saying and having to react hurts the game in the long run.
[*] Felt like the 4 items a turn system was unnecessary to the experience, as most of the time it didn't get used unless you called up all the other factions over and over again (which could hurt you).
[*] Sometimes the randomization element went too far, and asked for something that couldn't be possible for the time frame in question. While it adds challenge, it hurts the realistic portrayal of the game, as members of parliament asking for some of the ridiculous things they did after a regime was just toppled would get them laughed out of the real world. 
[*] The visuals, while not core to the experience, leave a lot to be desired. Certain animations and presentation elements work against the game from a time/simulation stand point.
[*] Never ended up using the military, it seemed way too hard to get it up and running over time due to costs. This is low on the list due to the fact that it may just be my incompetence.

PROS
+ Well designed political consequences
+ WELL-BALANCED randomization
+ Thematic voice-acting
+ Polished Perspective-Animation effects
+ Multi-Genre blended well (Strategy+PoliSci+Adventure)
+ Very engaged Dev!
+ Gameplay enriching unlockables
+ Engaging Diplomacy
+ Well designed characters
+ VERY High Replayability
+ BRILLIANT title

CONS
+ Some programs seem a bit far-fetched (they are optional, so... who cares)
+ One of the randomized (possible) neighbors is very ANTI-immersion to the game's theme
+ National crest is... NOT believable, distracting!
+ Diplomacy encounters is missing vital information, making Diplomacy feel like a luck of draw

My verdict:

Outstanding! The use of retro graphics (unlike many games) is not an excuse to use for poor graphics, the graphics are very well done, with a modern use of perspective-animation, good atmospheric voice acting (A rating sound and graphics).  The gameplay is engaging, the randomization is just enough to give you a great new play each time, while maintaining the integrity of a very well designed branching plot and poli-strategy.  The unlockables for new plays are well thought out.  It is not perfect, there are certainly very unusual characters/logos in the game, which scream indie developer forcing their own pet ideas.

Rogue State offers a nice balance of legitimately challenging and outlandishly bizarre. As the leader of a small nation, you’ll have to make tough decisions; either run your nation as a democratically elected official or as a selfish dictator. While I wish there had been a little more, there is a surprising amount of content to be enjoyed here. Choices you wouldn’t consider important might break your career between all the nations and citizens you have to keep happy. Plus, there’s a country of sentient chickens. The game gets a couple extra points for that alone.

I’m not sure I would make a good leader. This was my thoughts as I made trade deals with the glorious nation of ‘Chickenistan’ for their goats. It comes down to communication, and I don’t speak Chicken. As my economy tanked, and my approval ratings dropped like a rock, all I could think of what how those sneaky Chickens would use my missteps to their advantage. Now, that may sound racist- but it’s actually animalist.

Rogue State is obviously a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does provide a difficult challenge to those who want to take a stab at being the head of state. You’re elected supreme leader of Basenji (which I guess makes you a nation of dogs) after the nation has overthrown the previous government. You’re left to decide which way you take the developing land- from dictatorship to democracy. Sure, you may want to be a liberal bastion of pot smoking hippies- but what’s to stop the other nations from steamrolling over your little drum circle?

The game has a system that looks complex at first but becomes a breeze shortly after learning the ropes. You’re able to make policy changes, such as your rules on alcohol, minimum wages, and death penalties. The more you alter them, the more you’re bound to upset one group or the other. If you approve public executions, you’ll make the nation’s ‘Patriots’ happy, but the ‘Liberals’ will not be pleased. You might want to make them happy by enforcing a livable wage, but then the ‘Captialists’ will be on your bad side. Allow businesses to run on the Sabbath, and suddenly the ‘Fundamentalists’ start sharpening their knives. Obviously, making any group happy is a hard task, and the game quickly becomes a game of “who do I want to piss off less?”

Since the previous party left the hall a mess, you’ll have to take your modest income and rebuild your nation. You can do this by cranking up the taxes on individuals, or trading with other nations. No matter what you do though, you don’t want to end back up in a recession- otherwise you’ll start to see even more rioting in the streets. So, do you focus on rebuilding your commerce, your education or just slap a bunch of uniforms on loyalists?

Every day begins with an event, with you needing to make a decision. It might be an oil spill off your beautiful tourist-filled beaches or a dead cabinet member, but each time you’ll have to make a decision that may destroy your reputation. You may discover that you’re building that brand new hydroelectric dam on top of an endangered species of rodents. These decisions could negatively affect either of the four main big groups and might even look bad abroad; so choose wisely. Once you start sliding, it’s hard to recover from the political tailspin.

Once you’ve built your infrastructures, laid out your policies and settled all of your trade deals, then it’s time to build your defenses. You can invest your money into soldiers, or you can dream bigger by throwing a ton of it into developing weapons of mass destruction. These choices are well designed, and usually leave you debating your morals against your self-preservation. I’d like to think we’d all try to be as altruistic as possible, but it seems the game is played best with a dash of Martin Shkreli thrown in.

Allow me to explain a little about my first shot at the big chair and how it all horribly ended. See, I tried to be very liberal on my first playthrough. Mostly Democratic- maybe a little more left-leaning than I should’ve been. With every progressive choice I made, the Fundamentalists ate me alive. Soon came the capitalists, and the Patriots; I couldn’t do anything to win any group. Tough crowd this middle-east area, am I right!?

So, after they ousted me and sent me on a plane to my own private exile, I tried again. This time, I decided to start talking out of both sides of my mouth. This strategy worked well for a short time, but after awhile I found out that it really didn’t work any better. I told the other nations around me that I hated America (kinda weird that the USA is the only vilified outside nation), that I didn’t trust the United Nations and that we shouldn’t ignore the ‘Old Ways’. Then, when it came to policy, I simply voted down the middle of the road. I guess that made me a do-nothing president, because despite my excellent 90% approval rating, my army suddenly left me. I was quickly attacked by another nation, who wanted all of my money. I agree to the extortion, and shortly after a rebellion overthrew me. Those damn Chickens; I gave them a hell of a deal for our electronics, and they sat back and did nothing.

Outside of that, there’s not much more to this game than your main office and the war room. The game does do a great job of creating the impression that there’s a whole land outside of your little building, so it does feel larger than the three screens you’ll see. Every decision you would think you could make is here, and it should provide a nice distraction if the prospect interests you.

I guess in closing, I imagine it’s a good thing I’ve never thought about running for a political office because I’m awful at it. Simply awful. At least this game allowed me to have fun with that knowledge, and I learned a lot about my laurels in the face of trying to appease my voters. I enjoyed my experience with the game, and I would recommend it to anyone with illusions of grandeur. Rogue State requires a nice balance of loyalty and fabrication and an ability to balance several different groups; that is if you don’t want to end up like the last guy.",1445863116,1445863116,True,1,0,0.468483805656433105,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I guess it is somewhat supposed to be a ""rogue-like"" strategy game, but the game seems to randomly punish you, even in the first few turns, which can basically ruin a play through. A lot of the game's strategy seems to be based on guesswork, such as how other countries' leaders will respond to your talking points. Also, factions seem to randomly hate you or like you for no obvious reasons, even though you haven't changed policies whatsoever. Too many turns, I found myself with basically nothing to do and just skipping to the next turn. Maintaining even a half-way decent military is virtually impossible, and actually gaining enough intelligence to use that military well is equally impossible, as it takes huge amounts of money to do either.

Overall, this game basically presents you with an enormous mountain to climb, and gives you absolutely none of the tools necessary to even begin to remotely even consider climbing it.

It's a good mix between Sim Junta, Democracy 3 and Rulers of Nations.

The concept is simple, it is a turn-based geopolitical simulation game where you are the ruler of a newly established country called the People's Republic of Basenji and you must strive against unhappy citizens, a power-hungry brother, an imperialistic UN/USA and the desires of your neighbors. You will have events that pop up where you must make hard choices that will determine the fate of Basenji and affect your popularity with the 5 groups of citizens (Capitalists, Patriots, Fundamentalists, Liberals and Qariffi (I think that's spelled right). You also need to keep the loyalty of your own military or else your brother Farouk will swiftly eject you from power. You adjust policies that range from minimum wage requirements to your country's alcohol tolerance laws which will affect your standing amongst the various groups and will change from turn to turn. You also have the ability to maintain a military and invade your neighbors or garner the affections and attentions of the UN and US, either to your benefit or detriment. From the time I've spent with the game so far, I don't think you can win... you just do a little better each time and (like Plague Inc.) every time you complete a game, you're able to unlock more special modifiers to change up the experience. 
Artistically and musically, this game really excels. While neither are perfect, they really set the mood and help to immerse you in your new role as president of Basenji. I just love that everyone is voiced as well... it shows there is a lot of love and labor that has been put into the game.
All in all, I love this game. Simple yet addictive with a wealth of content for only 12.99, this is arguably one of the better low budget Geosims I've played in a long time. Highly recommended.

 The premise of the game is intriguing.  The implementation is obviously executed by a small development group.  However, there are both good and bad aspects of the current state of the game, by my experience, as follows:

Bad
  - when an event destroys a building that is required for a downstream building, rebuilding that building does not allow for the downstream building to be created... This is a game-breaking bug.  This bug disallows terrorist and nation conflict win conditions, and i can't belive that it made it into the release version
  -  the ""anti-american propoganda"" in the text choices is painful to play through, however, i grit my teeth and consider that it should be there because it is a realistic (though flawed) perception of people in the region

Good
  - this game presents a very intriguing and realistic scenario for our world, and it is intellectually stimulating to play through the concept, so props for someone coming up with this concept

I am going to give this game a thumbs up in the hopes that bugs a resolved, and assuming that the proceeds do not help a dubious goventment (ie Iran) sponsored propoganda program.  If it does, and i find out, i'm coming for you.

Its similar to FTL in that randomness plays a big role. Single events can either destroy or save you from a seemingly unescapable situation. I dont know whether this is a good or bad thing.

But on the other hand, playing 'correctly' is not enough to succeed, which might lead to frustration if you just want to get your hands on the nukes (which I never did ;_;).

[Game refunded: Review won't be updated]

[h1] Plot:[/h1] 
The revolution is over and King Salman is dead. You are the leader of the new government of Basenji: a fictive country of Middle East based on the name of a dog. It's up to you to restore the pride and power of your state and create a reign that last for thousand years... 

[h1] Graphics:[/h1] 
The intro is nice, based on pictures well drawn. The game takes place in your office and situation room. Every selections of menus makes your avatar ( a man or a women) move across the rooms and open/use appropriates elements related to menus. The game looks nice, only characters are a bit ""frozen"" and loose in realism. Something very nice is the presence of a newspaper. You can check some important info  and every headlines feature photographs depending of recent news. The only really problematic thing about newspaper is the color of text. When some white letters are on black and white photos it lacks in transparency!

[h1] Music:[/h1] 
Nice oriental tunes that stick to the atmosphere of the tile. Voice acting is correct but not impressive. Nothing special to say about this aspect of the game.


[h1] Controls:[/h1] 
Choosing the office of the character is a good and a bad idea. Especially if any menu selections forces you to wait for your avatar to move and activate the selected item related to it. Need to check relations and trade? Select the phone and wait your man or women to take it. Need to read newspapers... wait him or her to cross the room to open it. Ect... ect... ect... Very annoying especially about trading and diplomacy. But let's talk about gameplay would you.

[h1] Gameplay (the long part) :[/h1] 
You are the leader of a so called Rogue State. After having created your president/future dictator, you must appoint your ministers and your brother Farouk to vacant roles.
The first issue of the game is the presence of Farouk, a general famous in the revolution and loved by the people.
You can't trust him and sacrifice a part of your ministry for him. Considering he's a burden, you are forced to put him in the worst job: intelligence. Every other seat are important and quite early shows the limits of the game:
Lacks of information (funny when you think that intelligence is a dark and useless aspect of the game).

So you have 3 others politicians, randomly generated and members of 1 of the factions of the country: Patriots, Capitalists, Fundamentalists and Liberals.

The game acts around turns where you have to do actions and try to give the best of the time you have at disposal.  To manage factions you have to choose Policies and try to balance popularity between every faction. In general to please your people acts around reading the newspapers to see how much percent of factions compose your country and after you try to balance the most important ones and please them with buildings and ministry favors. Consider that policies can change from a turn to another without any drawbacks and you have a first clue of how simplistic the game is.

But this is not all because in Rogue State you can build things... 
At beginning you must rebuild the country and industries. Few choices with not much impact crosses your path, like amnesty for previous members of brought down government or not. This part sum up quite badly the reconstruction of a country after war. When done you can produce 2 resources and access to 3 panels: Army, Social, and Economic.

Very simple, a building rarely give permanent bonuses and quite often asks for a lot of funds to give a one-time bonus that might be spoiled by a random event. Because events are common in the game.

Indeed every turn has events, completely random that influence factions, popularity and loyalty.
Very often you have to sacrifice a faction and even pay lot of money to get rid of these unpleasant events. 40 % of your country is full of capitalists? Only focus on money and do not care of environmental events.
Many fundamentalists? Nevers authorize western corporations in your country. Ect… ect...
Extremely boring, it is amazing to see ridiculous events such as the Meteorite when if you have a space program... you can put a device on it and change its course... But if you don't it will blow one of you buildings.
Goodbye freshly built Stadium! Goodbye Sweetshop!
Ridiculous.

But that's not all. A building requires money. You can trade with the 3 neighbor country bordering your country.
You take your phone and give a call to each leader to find the best prices and sign contracts for export or import.
Resources are random and very often you won't have the one you need to please your factions.
Of course good relations gives better prices, also the market influences the prices.
But to know what kind of resource your neighbor needs depends of intelligence... and if you remember that intelligence is a completely unexplained element.
Add to that the fact that every phone calls uses one of the 4 segments of time that composes a turn... you bet that trades are horribly basic and falls into boredom very quickly.


Rogue State tries to play at war too. That's why the situation room is right next to your office...
You can buy troops, influenced by Army buildings in terms of price and deployment time. Each unit has attack and defense. And of course, the more powerful the more expensive.
There is a situation map where you can move your ""pawns"" and declare war but without any infos about attackers or how to manage fights.
You can also manage intelligence and secret projects that takes time and money but bring (apparently) very powerful effects... but you won't have time to see them finished.

Because: You remember of Farouk ? Your dear brother waits a moment of weakness to turn upside down your government.
And it's where the game fall into a waste of time because you are forced to mass tons of units and rally many favors to temporary slow the revolution prepared by Farouk (don't forget to click on the button on top right because the game doesn't even takes time to explain this...).

It is so empty and baffling that i never succeeded to survive this moment.
Even if i had 3 factions pleased and a nice popularity but not much money... i've lost the game.

Because in Rogue State you build, makes your country a safer place by building tons of institutions and nobody gives a @@@ about it. Even taxes are unexplained and you can tax 50 % of your income and know absolutely nothing about its effects of the population....

Ridiculous.


[h1] TO CONCLUDE:[/h1] 

Rogue State is a disappointment. Too simplistic, the game falls very quickly into boring text reading and random events that causes havoc into your miserable tries.
Even managing your ministry is a joke where ministers acts stupidly and asks for ridiculous actions.
[i]""Move units to this country border!»[/i] Even if there nothing wrong with them! [i]""Arrange a meeting with the President of The United States in few months""[/i]... and you don't know how to do it even if you invite dozens of time an ambassador with your lame speech...
Foreign diplomatic relationships where you have to wait for intelligence that never comes or so basic trade options that any decent management game wouldn't have dare to mix a camel/pony looking animal with a water bottle to create fast food that will make religious fundamentalists upset but Capitalists happy...

The most incredible thing in Rogue State are TV speech which are completely useless and empty.

Rogue State is a shame that shows peoples of middle-east as stupid and incoherent where random elements cripples a gameplay that could have been great.

With the way the graphics are (retro graphics from the 90's? kind of appealing) and the lack of content and its diversity i would put this game at mid to late beta stage. 

With some more work from the dev's this could become a real gem. I get the sense that dev's really liked this game but either had to much on their plate, or they wanted to rush this game out ""as is"" for some money. At a $9.74 pricetag i can say im not disappointed that i spent this much money, however i expect some more content, and a clearer set of instructions. (i could not find out how to sell military items instead of disbandment). This game is far to short to be considered more than a flash game.

Anytime you use the military system, you are essentialy blind. Morale is a huge part of combat, if my miltarys morale is high i expect them to fight far better then if their morale is Meh. Also, ive had situations where an enemy makes peace, then immediately after attacks. As a side note, if i have excellent relations with the U.S. i expect some major help from them, in addition to other nations with poor relations with the attacker.",1445158960,1446500827,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

At it's core it is a strategic political simulation game putting you in charge of a middle eastern country.  There are also strong emphasis on survival over crafting the your country as you see fit.  Surviving is difficult, and unlike other mangement survival games like Long Live the Queen there is some randomness, which can ruin the experience for some, but it also increases replayability. Many things threaten your survival, revolts from factions within your populace (patriots, liberals, captialists, and fundamentalists), your power hungry brother, your military, your own government's cabinet, your neigbors, democratic rebellions, disease, envnironment and financial crises, and even the meddling United States.  It may take several playthroughs to see all of these threats, and the most problematic threat to your power is almost never the same on back to back new games.

Though random, you do have hints to what you should focus on that are simple to miss, such as paying attention to random events, analyzing the breakdown of people who are in each faction or using information gained through your intelligence agency. However, that being said there are some good things that are always good -  keeping a large surplus of money around of diasters and investing into your economy and social programs with somewhat high taxes.   I also like how this game can be subtle.  You are actually a dictator and one of the scenarios confirms this when a group threatens your regime with a democratic revolution.  This is easy to overlook because the game rewards you for being a benevolent dictator, and the absence of elections during the whole game is easier to miss than you think when the game doesn't paint you as the stereotypical evil dictator.

 This game may turn off some with its unpolished retro graphics and empasis on strategy over a story, but I believe it targets a specific target demographic well.  If you are ready for challenege, can overlook a somewhat dated presentation, and are aware this is more of a survival/management game that rewards for you playing to the situation faced rather than roleplaying as you see fit, this is the game for you.",1445110636,1445111541,True,9,0,0.60279005765914917,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Rogue State is a game where you rule over a middle eastern country, as a democratic ruler.
[spoiler] Really? No ability to rule as a dictator/monarch? I understand what the game is generally going for, ruling a democratic nation in the middle east. Just feels dissapointing that you cannot rename/change your nation's name or flag. Or that you cannot change your government type. [/spoiler]

You must manage 4 classes, which represent your overall population.
[spoiler] These four classes will randomly become more important/bigger during certain times in the game, such as a rising number of capitalists, or patriots. This is sadly random, and you have NO way of influencing the population to becoming more loyal to your prefered population. [/spoiler]

As well, you must manage local diplomacy, negotians with the US, and the UN.
[spoiler] As unique as it is, having randomly picked nations to be your neighbors is intersting, your bound to enter war with one. You need a strong army, or your going to be crushed. Fast. [/spoiler]

You must rebuild your country's infanstructure (AKA, Tech tree.)
[spoiler] Though fun, it is quite basic, and it definently sometimes feels unuseful, or game changing. [/spoiler]

You must manage your country's policies to meet the expectations.
[spoiler] It is almost impossible for everyone to like you, and your going to end up having revolutions appearing. [/spoiler]

Unique 'wonder' projects, such as a great firewall, space program, nukes, Great Dam.
[spoiler] I call them wonders, because they are essentially the wonder buildings from Civilization. [/spoiler]

Protect your glorious nation against coups and civil wars!
[spoiler] Doesn't give you much in-depth on what is actually going on in the coup. Besides that, you just need lots of soldiers, and you are sort of REQUIRED to fill out these little bonuses which will aid in fighting back the rebels. (Such as, building a great Firewall, having high relations with the US.) [/spoiler]

Random Events every turn, constantly changing how your population reacts to certain policies, how much money you make/spend, and diplomatic changes.
[spoiler] These feels EXTREMELY random, and sometimes, being bombarded by certain similar events one after another, seem unfair. It's more of a luck game, then a strategy game. [/spoiler]

Overall, the game is good, a 7/10. It's a basic country ruling simulator, that is a bit unforgiving at times, as it can sometimes throw constant situations and events at you that make it impossible to stay alive for more then 20 turns. If your into roleplaying as a leader, go for it.

I've seen it grow into the immersive, challenging, and beautifully addictive simulation that it is now. I think that's a key point to make here - this may look like a game but it's more akin to a 'strategy simulation'. There is no 'easy win' path that, once discovered, works each time. 

Some of the other reviews here cover the main mechanics so I'll keep this short. The game is loaded with random events inspired by real life meaning that each play through is always different. You play with the hand you're dealt and see how the cards fall.  Certainly, the good decisions you make and the tools you implement along the way will help to swing things in your favour - be it a change in policies or a perfectly pitched national broadcast - but you can never please all of the people all of the time and the randomness of real life can quickly change your fortunes if you react wrongly. Then, of course there's your scheming brother Farouk to contend with. 

This is almost a survival simulator as much as it is a strategy title - the goal being to stay in power for as many turns as possible. Some times you'll win, most times you probably won't - but you'll have a darn good time trying... because once you get comfortable in the dictators chair you'll be itching for the next turn... and the next... and the next... which seems to me an accurate reflection of the life of a dictator, and the hallmark of a good game.

The game is a turn-based strategy simulator of a middle-eastern dictatorship with deep, interconnecting mechanics.  Each session of the game is very different: your neighbours, the distribution of goods, your ministers, and most importantly the events that will occur are randomized, and this has made each playthrough very different and interesting.  

The graphics in the game are, admittedly, retro, but the artwork is very well done and the animations are clean.  For a turn-based strategy game, it does the trick.

The writing of the game is often funny, and the voice acting is very good (and everything is voiced).  

Rogue State is admittedly very challenging, but I like a challenge.  Managing the support of the four factions in your country, managing your budget, and managing the production of infrastructure and special projects is a tricky balancing act, and early on, I lost often.  However, when I won, I felt like I really earned it!

[h1]What is Rogue State?[/h1]
Rogue State is a management game, where you play as the leader of a middle eastern country. The whole idea is that you led the rebellion, man or woman, that overthowed a previous tyrannical power, and the people look to you to rebuild, and propel the country into prosperity. It is procedurally generated, with new countries, ministers, and events each game -- but there is one major constant that is present in every single game; your brother Farouk. He will be trying to undermine everything you do, and if you let your popularity dwindle Farouk will make his move and take over leadership by force. In addition to this you might have to deal with war, environmental and social issues, terrorism, financial crises, debt and more, so there’s a lot to pay attention to.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
I’m gonna begin this review at rock bottom. This game is presented abhorrently. It looks and plays like it was made 20 years ago. I mean, I don’t think there is any aspect of this game that couldn’t have been done in the 90s. Maybe aside from the resolution. In addition to the aesthetic issues, it played in a 4:3 aspect ratio and 30 fps and I don’t think it’s possible to go any higher than that. To me this reeks of trying to be overly-ambitious with the visuals; personally I think a top down pixel approach definitely wouldn’t be anything special, but it would be a lot cleaner and palatable than this; just as an example. If I try and twist it into a positive, then maybe you’d like the presentation if you have nostalgia for 90s point and click games? That’s the kind of visual vibe I get from it.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
Presentation is important, but it can be completely overruled by solid mechanics. I thought about this for a while, but I think the best description of what this game is like, is Long Live the Queen but randomly generated. I feel like, at first, that seems appealing to Long Live the Queen fans (which I’m one of by the way, I loved that game) but actually that makes the game extremely challenging. I feel like if you knew everything in advance that was going to happen, you could maybe beat this game and reach the final turn 50. However, since you don’t know anything that’s going to happen, other than a few key events,  it becomes a game of luck rather than one of strategy. Everything can be going perfectly for you, but if suddenly you have a terrorist problem and you have to begin putting money into the intelligence agency, you can quickly find yourself in debt and you reach a point where, even if you stop the terrorists, your country hates you and Farouk takes over. This is compounded by the fact you are constantly pressured into spending money in the events that occur every turn. It’s very hard to deal with these situations when you are given such a tiny timeframe to combat them in. One of the more cool mechanics, though,  is that you have to make a speech every year and you pick what the leader says in the speech. Again, it’s cool, you have to make sure you don’t contradict yourself and stay relevant,  but even then it does get repetitive and eventually I just found it unreliable and clicked through it out of boredom. There are some fun ideas here, but ultimately everything is tainted by that unfair difficulty.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is really just furniture, but the theme is pretty interesting to me. I like that you have the opportunity to run the country in whatever way you please. It’s a pretty good role-play game I think. There’s some social commentary mixed in with the turn-by-turn events which is interesting, and there's some pretty funny writing here and there. There’s a potential neighbouring country you can have called Chickenstan, and you can unlock a perk which allows you to understand the ancient chickenstan language. I will say that there are a couple of groaners in there in terms of the writing, but I have a suspicion that was what they were going for in those situations.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Now it’s time for me to say whether I think it’s worth it or not. The game is $13 at launch. I’m just going to be blunt; for most people I wouldn't recommend this game. I was kind of joking about this earlier, but if there really are people who are nostalgic for this kind of look, and are really into the idea of role-playing as a middle-eastern leader then yeah sure I’d recommend it -- but I feel like that is an incredibly tiny subset of people. Frankly, you’re only really going to like this if you're big into management games, and even then there are better management games out there. Prison Architect is a great game that allows you to actually build the prison as well as set things like policies, prison schedules etc that offers everything that Rogue State does only better. Even smaller games like Game Dev Tycoon and Long Live the Queen get a bit of an edge over Rogue State. It’s a shame, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles. I'm excited to see more from this developer, but Rogue State is one you’ll probably want to give a miss.
