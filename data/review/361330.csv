The developer who initially posted Shrooms on Reddit has been innactive for 7 months (1 year if you only count information pertaining to Shrooms), and their main business page ( http://immersivedouro.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi ) appears to have been repossessed by the web host (HostGator.) The three devs I know about have been either innactive or just playing games on Steam, most likely with the money gained from Shrooms. I had hopes that the developers would suddenly return and prove me wrong, but it sucks to be proven right.

Update from the Devs themselves! Apparently they had been fired and their employer chose to leave this game up on Steam while (possibly) hiring new devs who may or may not continue work on this game.

[h1][b]Shrooms[/b][/h1] (Read on for the full review!)

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Shrooms is definitely an alpha, but a unique one with fun and potential! Give it a buy if you're hopeful, or maybe hold off and see where it goes for a while if you're unsure.

[h1]======================================[/h1]

[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]
+Gameplay: Unique and interesting, barebones but good survival elements.
+Graphics: Exotic level design, variable player model.
+Audio: Sparse, but functional, good ambience.

[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]
-Couldn't go above 25FPS on any setting.

[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1]

Hello and welcome to this review of Shrooms, a game where you...eat shrooms! Wait, wait, that's not all there is to this, you eat shrooms to alter your body which changes the way you interact with the world! There are critters, monsters, basic crafting, and survival elements brought into the mix!

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]

There's only so much to Shrooms right now, but what's there is good! So for every shroom you eat, it alters a part of you from the head, arms, legs, or your torso. This gives them different effects or passives such as but not limited to: invisibility, damage absorption, damage reflection, a high damage punch, longer underwater time, etc. This will allow you to interact with the world and its inhabitants in different ways. A refreshing and fun game concept!

The general gameplay will have you running around collecting ingredients so that you can make tools so that you can more efficiently gather ingredients (or better ones) so that you can fight, keep warm, or stock up on bow ammo. Basically, you're doing what you have to to survive and eating mushrooms to help along the way!

[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]

The graphics, while good, could use some improvement, especially given the FPS I get.
The environment design is exotic and unique, with a lot of glowing lights and unique land and rock formations, pretty water, and vegetation.

The UI is a bit large, but in terms of design seeks to be minimal, and currently could use a facelift. Getting around it is easy enough once you get used to it, though, with simple hotkeys, and everything spelled out conveniently in non-distracting places.

[h1][b]Audio[/b][/h1]

There isn't much there, but the ambience is nice, and the sounds your character makes sufficies with no crack or pop in the recording. For what they are, they're actually believable, too, which is nice.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]

All in all, in its current state, Shrooms is fairly barebones, but imaginative and unique, and it deserves credit for that. Unique player models for the mutations is a nice touch, which indicates not only time spent but love given. The survival elements are a nice touch, but lack commonalities to make them worthwhile, such as the ability to build a shelter. The world also feels a bit empty currently, with only two other critters to run into. An armadillo and panther. It's easy to envision this game becoming something great, however, and time will tell if the developers get it there!

[b]This review will be updated with every new patch that Immersive Douro introduces into the Alpha.[/b]

Shrooms looked interesting in the trailer, and I thought that the devs were just playing with a female avatar instead of a male one because they preferred the sexy booteh, but I was wrong. Devs are WORKING on a male avatar... right? D:

Anyway, I had a blast getting lost in the game and being immersed in a words filled with shrooms and where biomes seem to be condensed into one small area. That was confusing and I really did not understand what was happening, but it was fun regardless. Harvesting, crafting and inventory confused me alot, because my mind has been hardwired to using the left and right clicks, the E key, etc. This is rather fresh, but can be infuriating at times. Using an item is very time-consuming and sometimes even infuriating(I'm looking at you, items that don't stack).

While it may seem I dislike the game, surprisingly, I do not. I enjoyed it, despite the limited possibilities I had. If the devs continue to add more into the game and work on it, I'm pretty sure it'll become something more.

If you do not like Early Access games, this might not be the game for you.

[u]So far, I've only discovered a few bugs[/u]:
[list]
[*] That certain Shrooms, such as the Berserker Torso Shroom and Swimmer MainHand(?) Shrooms don't stack, making consuming them difficult.
[*] I run an i7 processor, GTX860M graphics cards, but I've been having issues with the gameplay, namely delays and whatnot. I have no idea if this is just my machine running crudely or if it's the Alpha stages of the gameplay(Everyone else seems to be running fine).
[*] Falling from high ground sometimes does not register fall damage, specially when you end up falling on a slope.
[*] Diving down to the river floor can sometimes cause you to be stuck. The Character treats the river floor as a contact surface and walks around normally, while the oxygen level continues to drop.[/list]

[u]My suggestions are:[/u]
[list]
[*] Add Male Gender to be available (I know you guys are working on that Immersive Douro!)
[*] Maybe Character Customization?
[*] The ability to instantly craft an item when you have all the components instead of tediously clicking on the item to add it into the crafting layout.
[*] Character's interaction with his/her surroundings and environment. I noticed that the character fans herself when in the desert, but she doesn't shiver in the cold. It would also be nice to see the character interact with his/her environment, such as using hands to balance when climbing up a mountain/ steep slope.
[*] A tutorial to explain certain aspects of the game, I was really confused by the Build Item minigame/mechanic.
[*] Retweak the animations to look more natural. Movements are exaggerated, especially both the character and the Panther's attacking animations. Panther seems to continue attacking even if the character is down.
[*] Remove the numbers above the character that indicates increases or decreases, etc. Or at least until it's been worked out properly. Sometimes the numbers are seen flipped, it could potentially confuse the players. And if numbers are added, coding it so that each number appears to their respective players, or else the server will crop up with number everywhere when players enter a full out PvP battle royale.
[*] Add armor/clothing crafting options, as well as maybe the ability to build settlements.
[*] Maybe a few NPCs?[/list]

Il coute moins de 15€ certes mais le contenu actuel ne les vaut pas. Pourtant, les devs sont honnêtes et explique que c’est une EARLY EARLY ALPHA. 

Le jeu est sorti hier soir et propose déjà une map sympa, un système de survie et craft de base, suffisant pour poser les bases d'un bon jeu. 

Acheté, testé, approuvé !!!


[h1]I-/ Le gameplay[/h1]

Rapidement explorée, la map présente tout de même 6 biomes différents, et les contours sont délimités par des montagnes (ou murs invisibles dans la mer ^^).
Les ressources à farm sont présentes et les monstres aussi la nuit venue. Un système de craft intuitif et efficace, cependant quand il s’agit de Moder son corps là vient la difficulté.

Le gros intérêt du jeu, réside dans les modifications possibles sur votre corps. Pour résumer, chaque biome à ses ressources que vous pourrez utiliser pour modifier votre corps. Chaque ressource, modifie une partie de votre corps (torse ou jambes…) avec un effet particulier (meilleur à la nage ou au sprint…).
Il faut tout de même prendre attention aux toxines liées à ces modifications afin de ne pas perdre de la vie… ;)

[h1]II-/ Graphismes et ambiance sonore.[/h1]

Franchement, le jeu est en early access, et pourtant il n’est pas moche contrairement à d’autres. L’univers coloré et la bande son vous mettent bien dans l’ambiance. Et lorsque la nuit venue, vous êtes surpris par une panthère affamée, courez loin vers la lumière.
Je vous invite à aller voir mes screens sur mon profil pour plus d’infos^^

[h1]III-/ Les bugs ou autre éléments temporaires gênants.[/h1]

Comme précisé sur la page du jeu, il n’y a à l’heure actuelle pas de possibilités de sauvegarder. Ainsi, tout arrêt d'une partie en cours (serveur distant ou local) vous vaudra de redémarrer entièrement.
Ce n’est pas vraiment un bug, mais prenez garde à votre endurance !!! Si elle tombe à 0 vous ne pouvez plus nager et du coup vous coulez… xD Le bugs réside dans le fait que votre endurance à un comportement bizarre tendant à se vider ou se remplir sans vraiment de raisons parfois.

[h1]IV-/ Et la suite ?[/h1]

Et bien par la suite, les devs vont en premier mettre en place un système de sauvegarde, puis augmenter les crafts et nombres de mutations possibles. Après ils vont voir pour le système de construction puis … je ne suis pas dans les confidences des devs, mais ça sera un bon vieux survie/craft/construct façon science-fiction.

[h1]V-/ Conclusion.[/h1]

Si vous voulez aider ce jeu, alors n’hésitez pas achetez le. 
Si vous vous sentez réticent pour le moment, attendez quelques maj pour gagner en contenu en espérant que le prix n’augmente pas entre temps^^
Enfin, n’ayant pas implémenté de tuto dans le jeu, les devs ont quand même pris le temps de créer un guide en anglais sur leur site disponible ici http://projectshrooms.com/guide/",1431186924,1431187026,True,12,2,0.617455899715423584,6,True,False,True,False,,,

[There is actually a guide to the game that the devloper helpfully linked to in the comments for this review, qhich certainly helps.] The game has a crafting system, but it's limited so far and there's a laggy minigame involved that doesn't really seem to affect the outcome. It's also very easy to die accidentally, whether by starving to death (there's a food meter under your health meter, and when that runs out you die instantly) or by the angry panthers that will chase you across the entire map.

[list]
[*]Interesting gameplay ideea, with the posiblity to become a nice Minecraft-type game for people that like doing shrooms
[*]Crafting with a nice mini-game twist
[/list]
[b]The not so good (take everything with a grain of salt, the game is in Alpha):  [/b]
[list]
[*]No tutorial. I just spawned in the map and got killed by 3 tigery-black-panthery things.
[*]The controls feel a little bit clunky, but I blame it on the Alpha.

[b]The conclusion: [/b]

If you get onto the early access, don't expect much, the game is still in the very early stages of development. Despite that, the idea of eating stuff to modify your body is pretty nice and it keeps you engaged for a while. Unfortunatelly, I wasn't able to check the multiplayer, but the single player was pretty interesting. This is a game that has a good potential of becoming a great game.
