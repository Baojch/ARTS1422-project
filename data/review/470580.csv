The game leaves you to search for the meaning of the story yourself. You don’t have to venture through every door but if you do then you’ll know what this game means to the developer. It’s a really beautiful little story that you don’t have to delve into but will encounter a much more meaningful experience if you do.

[b]Character[/b]
There’s not much to the boy we control beyond how he obviously is perceiving the world around him. Given we control him he appears to be without fear, easily dodging the shadow creatures without a care but at the same time we know these games are figments of his imagination and that he really is a scared little boy living through a confusing experience.

[b]Environment, Art & Design[/b]
The music is surprisingly beautiful for such a short game, it’s got a Fez-like, retro feel to it’s sound with synthesizers and jump noises. The pixel based backgrounds are simple yet make you want to just stop and look at them, especially the sun and moon levels.

[b]Mechanics[/b]
Very simple stuff for the boy which was enjoyable, lending itself to focusing on the logic puzzle rather than your abilities. The range of shadow creatures was good too and mixing their abilities throughout the levels felt natural and challenging.

[b]Tidbits[/b]
I was mildly enjoying the game before I started looking at how to enter the blocked off rooms and it was then that I really came to appreciate it. The puzzles on their own were good, the meaning and story added so much more to the experience. It became the sort of game that you want to thank the developer for sharing.

[b]Negatives (cause I’m picky)[/b]
The game had a few bugs towards the end. I think I got hardlocked in one level and couldn’t progress so ended up dragging boxes in piles across the platform to reach my goal XD The penultimate level too I’m positive I cheated but I also couldn’t find a working solution. It didn’t deter my enjoyment and to some extent excited some unexpected problem solving but it didn’t quite reach a perfect finished product.
Also, a bug with boxes and light source interaction where the box would clip through the floor when it entered a light source (particularly in the gravity levels) and then would destroy itself as a fix. The destruction was quite helpful to reset it but it would be better if it didn’t happen at all.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Puis cet aprem, j'ai enfin passé le premier monde, après 45mn de jeu environ. Et là, illumination! Dès le début du second monde, les niveaux sont bons, avec quelques phases de plateforme bienvenues. Les énigmes sont originales, pas compliquées mais elles demandent de bien comprendre les mécaniques de jeu et sont souvent renouvelées. L'histoire se dévoile petit à petit, malgré une narration toujours timide. Ça se laisse suivre, sans être bouleversant.

Pas d'attaque ici, pas de gameover, si on se fait toucher on recommence quelques pas plus tôt. Les énigmes consistent à observer différentes ombres bouger dans les tableaux, et de les éclairer afin de leur faire subir une transformation qui permet de progresser. Il faudra évidemment combiner ses transformations pour avancer dans le jeu, et parfois bien se casser la tête afin de récupérer toutes les étoiles des niveaux, sortes de bonus.

Given this it must also be noted that there are some issues which I am sure could have been polished with more time. The controls are less responsive than ideal (mainly the jumping), there were some glitches where I had to restart the level as my shadow no longer jumped, the respawn points were often off leaving you in an area that forced a level restart plus a few other minor bugs.

During my playthrough of this game, I encountered the same glitches over and over again. Sometimes it would be bad behavior of the NPCs, who started floating and then would completely freeze, forcing me to restart the level from the beginning. Sometimes I would just fall through the floor, forcing me to restart the level from the beginning. I must have encountered at least a dozen different instances where I could reliably say ""that shouldn't be happening"", and that's in a complete, start-to-finish, 4 hour playthrough. That's too many bugs, most of which were game breaking or forced me out of the atmosphere, or both.

Next is the general lack of polish on some game mechanics. Now, this is a puzzle game, so the game is supposed to be somewhat difficult of course, but sometimes the mechanics would screw you over, pushing boxes where they weren't supposed to go, forcing you to backtrack several minutes to get to where you wanted to be again. Sometimes it was behaving frustratingly where sometimes shadows would activate at a shorter distance than they deactivate, and other inconveniences that were either part of poor level design or poor game design.

There also seemed to be a story somewhere in the game, but it was impossible to figure out and overall distracted from the game than it added to the game. This could use a lot of fleshing out; I might even be able to forgive bugs and poorly implemented mechanics if the story was enjoyable.

The atmosphere and soundtrack were incredible, and the visuals tied it all together beautifully. The game is a great proof of concept; and there's a good game within the mechanics, but the level design and glitches make it more frustrating than it is a good game. On top of that, this game sports a $16 price tag; for that price, you could get games that are more polished and more fun with a better story. This game is not worth $16; it only has 4-5 hours worth of content, maybe up to 8 if you want to 100% it.

I really enjoyed the pixel art and animation in this puzzle game.
Clearly a lot of time and effort was put into the visual aesthetic and soundtrack and it makes for a very atmospheric experience.

Most puzzles are a joy to figure out, but I did run into 2 or 3 that required too specific a timing and execution to complete for my taste.
Overall however the levels never outstay their welcome, on top of that all of them are nicely varied and beautifully detailed.

I like how it leaves you the option as a player to play it just as a puzzle-platformer or dig a little deeper to see what secrets you may find.
For me personally the story really struck a note.

There’s not much bad to say about this game. There were a couple issues of the character clipping through the background or spawning in an odd place. The screen resolution seemed to reset every time I started the game. To be picky, I’d say the somewhat stereotypical pixel art game sound effects were a little hard to get used to and didn’t seem to fit in well with the environment at first.

[h1]In The Shadows is a fun, little and very atmospheric puzzle game.[/h1]

Having played only a few levels, the first game that immediately popped into my mind was Fez. In The Shadows is thick with atmosphere and tells a story, that you unlock by finding more secrets. The puzzles in the game have an appropriate range of difficulty, although some levels are rather short. And at times I wasn't sure if I solved the riddle or just happened to find a workaround. But I suppose that's also part of the charm in puzzle games.
At two points in the game I stumbled upon a bug, but you can always restart the levels, and since the levels are short - the bugs are by no means game breaking.

The game itself took me about 5 hours to complete, having found all the stars in all but one level. That's a bit too short for my taste at the current price, but if you're a fan of puzzle games - it's no excuse to miss out on this experience.

There's a handful of worlds, each stoked up with levels. Each world is well-crafted and offers a unique theme. In general the game was fun to play and I recommend fans of puzzle games to try it out for themselves!

Having followed the devlog and after backing ITS on Kickstarter, it was good to finally play it.  It took about four hours to complete, plus I spent some extra time on trying to collect all the stars with many rooms yet to be completed.  However, there are a few things that could've made it even better.

Pros:
-Beautiful visuals. My guess is that most people assume that the game uses pixel graphics but actually it's using [spoiler]voxels (i.e. 3d pixels). [/spoiler]  That's why casting shadows with lights looks so good.  Check out the Cubicle Constructor link in the description.
-Puzzles.  Having played lots of games over the decades, I still found many of the light/shadow mechanic puzzles interesting.  Collect all the stars on every level for extra challenge.
-Great soundtrack.  Both for the game and also for stand-alone listening.
-After completing a level, that level can be easily accessed.  So if you've already found all the stars on some levels then you can skip those if you wish to find all the stars on every level.

Cons:
-Puzzle variety.  Having followed the devlog, the developer's signature picture has 11 shadow creatures.  I assumed that all of those would be in the game, but ... I think you know where I'm going with this.
-Story.  There are certain things (memory sequences) that give the game a certain framework, but there are two things that would've been better. 
1) The beginning.  Having seen/read/heard many stories and being a puzzle fan, I guessed early on what the events were about.  That actually didn't bother me much.  Rather, it was the beginning where I felt that the intro cutscene could've explained a bit more.  Without that, you just have a sence that ""something is wrong"" and you're going on some kind of journey but not sure why.  Adding a few more details regarding what the situation is about would've given more connection to the character and could've helped with motivation.
2) I thought that there would be more to [spoiler]the shadow creatures other than their utility function.  Yes, there is a vague ""connection"" but there could've been more.  Perhaps each could've represented something.[/spoiler]
-There is one achivement called <b>I remember it all</b>.  Perhaps if you collect all the stars and watch the memory scenes, then some of issues mentioned above might be resolved.  However, it would've been nice to have a full closure after a normal play through without an NG+ or ""achievemnt-wall"".
-Sound effects.  The ""pixel game"" sounds.  I don't mind those for actual pixel games but the visuals of this game are much more detailed and I would prefer the sound effects to be ""high resolution"".  Especially, since the music isn't ""pixel style"" either.

Due to visuals and overall atmosphere, I'll play it again and try to find all the stars or sometimes a nice ""mini-vacation"". :)",1508645772,1508645852,True,4,1,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The developer's use of light and shadows in the game is amazing compared to other pixel-art platformers and is very refreshing!

So far I have played the first 10 levels or so, and I have got to say that the game is very reminiscent of FEZ on how the character's movement is paced. You don't run around like in other platformers e.g. meatboy. It's more of a fast-walking or jogging speed.

That being said the controls are fine and play into the core game really well. The only issue I have is there are a few clipping issues on some of the platforms, but honestly nothing I found to be game breaking or repetetively annoying.

Some segments are more challenging than others early on however you can always skip them and head straight for the door if you're feeling overwhelmed. The caveat to this is in later stages the door becomes harder and harder to reach and more obstacles get in your way. This isn't always the case but for certain stages it is.

Story wise, there isn't necessarily a ton of content there, however, the atmosphere the minor amount of story builds up is perfect for what the game offers. It's not exactly what you would call ""Story driven"". Like I said, again, it is very atmospheric.

Music isn't half bad either and I didn't find the background music to be repetetive, just fitting for the mood.

The enemies in the game consist of various shadow creatures that turn into utility objects when exposed to light. It's definitely something different, because in some circumstances you will have to avoid touching them but also quickly turn on a light to turn them into a usable object and it can get somewhat tense. The caveat to this is for some reason dying does not reset the level, it just places you on a nearby platform you recently were standing on. It removes some of the threat from the enemies in my opinion.

Overall the game is great, I'd give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend it if you're interested in the platformer genre. It has controller support so there's that as well.",1508610781,1508610781,True,19,0,0.695040345191955566,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I saw it at PAX East a couple years ago, got in on the kickstarter, and happy to see it's released!  The atmosphere, music, animations, and lighting are really well done, so it feels a lot more immersive than I would have expected for a puzzle game.  Plus it seems like there's a nice curve of new and surprising stuff as you go -- I've only got about an hour on it and it felt like it got even more fun as I progressed.

One small thing though is that despite saving and applying my changes several times, my gamepad control settings just didn't seem to stick at all.",1508550967,1508550967,True,27,0,0.750859498977661133,0,False,False,False,False,,,

除了解谜之外 也不乏一些横版过关的元素 比如第一个区域最后一关有一部分是要你照好时机从一堆阴影怪中间跳跳板过去 最为一个小插曲还是挺不错的
总体来说游戏性挺不错的 不过整体进程显得比较慢 第一个区域一个小时内可以通关 解谜游戏老手可能可以更快 我原本是以为只有这一个区域的 比较尴尬 因为元素不算多 难度也只有最后两关比较有意思 但后来发现第一个区域之后会解锁新世界 从墙上海报来看应该有四个区域 在第二个区域明显出现了不同元素 所以还是值得期待后续发展的
就目前（发售前两天）来看 还有一些细微的BUG 比如爬梯子总会在最高处抖一下 以及第一个区域最后一关有个地方不小心的话会进入死循环 但是作者在email里说一些已发现的BUG都会在发售当天的更新被修复 所以应该是没什么问题的
画面方面感觉是像素游戏里算精致的了 特别是光源阴影的效果 挺棒的 不过第一次打开游戏的话分辨率可能不是最佳设置 会导致字体模糊 比例不对有黑边等问题 可以自行切换一下分辨率（窗口模式的开关也有个BUG 不管你设置的是什么 只要再次改动分辨率就会切回全屏模式 所以你得多切换两次窗口模式 不过都是小问题 也就第一次的时候捣鼓一下就好）
不过话说回来其实我一开始在kickstarter上back的时候并没有仔细看游戏玩法……还以为是通过光线阴影让建筑物显示出明显的分割线给玩家踩 否则就没有碰撞体积呢……想想那种玩法估计也会很有意思呀【x",1508530598,1508530598,True,13,0,0.666868925094604492,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In the Shadows utiliza un concepto tan simple como el miedo a la oscuridad para elaborar situaciones lógicas muy bien definidas. Toda la aventura gira entorno a la idea de atrapar estrellas, y con su iluminación desbloquear el acceso a la siguiente área, eventualmente eso podría resultar en algo redundante. Por suerte, todos y cada uno de sus escenarios introducen nuevos elementos, tales como mecánicas o personajes que irán agregando nuevos comportamientos y variedad. Figuras monstruosas que se ven afectadas por un haz de luz y se convierten en cajas, escaleras, trampolines e incluso llaves para acceder a otros ambientes en un mismo Puzzle. Sin duda, es un detalle genial que ayuda a quitar la sensación de monotonía. 
En lo jugable, In the Shadows toma mucha inspiración de otras emblemáticas obras como Contrast, por su temática o FEZ por la escenografía y progresión. 

En conjunto es un juego excelente, tanto en lo jugable como en lo narrativo. A simple vista, la historia no es uno de sus principales atributos, es más, In the Shadows se presenta como una constante sucesión de Puzzles. Sin embargo, tras esa cortina de razonamiento se esconde una historia cautivadora, de tal modo, que con las palabras justas logra expresar un relato de amor y aceptación. 
Quizás la duración es algo escasa, In the Shadows cuenta con tan solo 4 mundos, y estos se abastecen con alrededor de 8-9 habitaciones. Una cifra algo baja, pero con un contenido admirable y un diseño de Puzzles meticuloso. La única contra son sus Bugs. Al contar con Puzzles milimétricamente calculados salirse de ese patrón puede conllevar a un error o un bloqueo definitivo  que solo se soluciona al reiniciar el capítulo. No es algo que suceda a menudo, pero cuando lo hace es tedioso, cuanto poco. 

En definitiva, In the Shadows es un acertado juego de plataformas y Puzzles con un preciso planteamiento jugable y una gloriosa dirección artística.
