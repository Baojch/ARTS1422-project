after finding myself deeply 
dissatisfied with both contemporary 
rpgs and the generally lesser 
(or unnecessarily convoluted) 
mechanics of more archaic rpgs.

admittedly, haven't played that long [yet]; 
but, so far it is enjoyable to some degree:

- left click (and hold) to move, right click to toggle attack on specified targets
- binary character customization through simplistic, branching skilltrees

my main gripes so far involve movement and combat, 
as they are  implemented in incredibly cumbersome ways: 

to [b]basic attack[/b], you must [b]click individual units directly[/b].

to [b]cast a single-target damaging ability[/b], you must [b]push the skill, then click individual units directly[/b].

it... just doesn't feel good at all.

wish the game implemented something like orb walking/attack move 
like in dota and league, respectively - additionally, a smart cast option 
for instant skill usage on cursor would be welcomed.

there are actually very few settings options available at all tbh - 
just resolution and sound (and as far as sound goes... there is actually only the error noise that dings when you cast a skill on cooldown with no other noises at all other than the looping soundtrack I turned off after 1 minute). the game could really use keybindings, but any development concerning this game has ceased.

from what I can tell, there is only a poorly implemented minimap for 
navigation, no waypoints or guiding arrows... you just move along 
until you happen upon your objective; but, I soon realized the levels are basically on-rails anyways, with only a few dead ends scattered about unnecessarily 

itemization consists of a single equippable weapon, 
progressing to ""runes"" a little later in the story that function as 
augments for base stats or resistances. the runes and skills you acquire absolutely trivialize combat and you basically become invincible by the 4th chapter or so.

anyways, game's okay and could be great with just a few changes; 
personally, I'd like to see classes added above all else for further 
customization (as it seems shallow to the naked eye) and more thought out skilltree synergies - nothing's going to be added, but keep an eye out for this developer because they seem to have a grasp on arpg elements that [i]could[/i] be entertaining, but miss the mark this time unfortunately.

will update as I play.

October 4th: finished with this game because it was bugged... got stuck in combat and couldn't save or swap to the next zone lol (also because it just became a walking simulator because of how trivial encounters became), but I will leave my recommendation as positive because I felt like I got at least $1 of entertainment; p chill game if you're poor like me and lack disposable income to purchase polished games regularly that pique your interest, I guess.

gonna arbitrarily give this a 2 out of 10 - this game is the aborted child of exiled kingdoms & diablo.",1570112628,1570234958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was like wow, this game is going to be amazing. But, it fell short. I found the gameplay very repetative and boring. No clear instructions on what exactly are you supposed to do.
