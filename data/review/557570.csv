It's not often that a game, especially one that's not much more than words on a screen, can elicit such an emotional response.  I found myself feeling like I was the main character, not just playing a game.  I felt the ups and downs on a very real level and I love it.

Thank-you, Skot, for making this game and I look forward to continuing to find the secrets it holds.  I also look forward to your next project, if any.  I am definitely going to be talking about Able Black with my friends and trying to share it with as many people as possible.

Able Black is a narrative game with puzzles that is currently free on the Apple store. 

I found the game surprisingly good. I thought at first that the game was just a series of puzzles. But in fact, it also tells a very intriguing and thrilling sci-fi story about the path to self-awareness of an android named Able Black. The story is mysterious and very well told and we just want to keep playing eager to know how it progresses. And so the game could easily be finished in one setting. But beware that there is actually a lot to read and not than many puzzles.

The game is not very long and one playthrough should take about 2 hours. The game in itself consists of series of moral choices questions and varied logic puzzles intertwined with story-telling. After completing the main game, there are also a few bonus clickable icons to unlock that add some extra elements to the story. 
Puzzles don't present too much difficulty but it depends on your experience with solving logic puzzles and riddles. 

In all, this is a very well designed narrative puzzle game that I wish had been longer. I am looking forward to play more games from this dev in the future.",1593874274,1593874274,True,1,0,0.526749014854431152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

비주얼 노벨 형식에 퍼즐이 합쳐진 형태의 게임으로, 텍스트를 통해 이야기를 풀어나가다가 시민권 시험을 볼 때는 퍼즐들을 직접 풀어나가는 방식으로 진행된다. 퍼즐들은 생각보다 만만하지는 않은 난이도지만, 다행히 게임 내 힌트를 제공하기 때문에 만약 막힌 것 같으면 게임 내 힌트를 보면서 풀어나갈 수 있다. (그래도 아래에 쓸 이유 때문에 힌트를 안 쓰는 걸 권장한다.) 퍼즐들을 풀지 않을 때는 텍스트를 읽어가면서 Able Black이 시민권 시험을 치지 않는 동안 무슨 활동을 했는지를 볼 수 있으며, 특정 시점을 읽다 보면 적절한 효과음이 들리면서 분위기 조성에 도움을 주기 때문에 꼭 소리를 들으면서 게임을 하는 걸 추천한다.

메인 스토리를 마치면 다양한 짧은 에필로그들을 해금할 수 있는데, 대부분은 특정 시간 또는 특정 날짜에만 해금할 수 있으니 컴퓨터 시간을 바꾸면서 해금하면 된다. 단, 에필로그 중 하나는 힌트를 안 쓰고 메인 스토리를 클리어해야 해금되기 때문에 만약 2회차를 하고 싶지 않으면 힌트를 안 쓰는 걸 권장한다.


결론적으로, 짧고 분위기 있는 텍스트 형식의 게임이다. 분량이 1시간 정도로 짧긴 하지만 애초에 가격 자체가 저렴해서 게임이 지나치게 짧다고 생각되지 않았기 때문에 추천.

This is the updated Steam version of the original mobile version of the game.  

The way the game is presented is by two parts - the Story part, and the Puzzle-solving part:
- The Story part consists of mainly text. You'll be presented with the story of Able Black and the overall circumstances that lead him to take the Citizenship Exam.
- Then there's the Puzzle part, which consists of stories, imagery and options that you shall pick depending on the question or objective that's being asked for you to do. After solving the Puzzles, the cycle starts over with another Story part and so on.

The Story is, without fail, pretty good. If you're into science fiction stories, where you're given enough space to form your own conjectures until the story proves you what the truth is, then you sure are going to enjoy this. Though it's mostly only text and very few visuals appear, I found myself highly interested in it, wanting more. The few turns and twists that were slowly presented to me, were enough to make me continue all the way to the end. On the other hand, there's the Puzzles.
The Puzzles the game includes are not particularly hard, but they sure are meant to be given a focused line of thinking. You will be given all the information you need, so there's no need to worry about obtuse puzzles. In any case, you will be given hints for each puzzle, so don't be afraid to use them if you get stuck.

Something I need to remark, without trying to give any kind of spoilers: if you do NOT like psychological tests or the feeling of being psychoanalized by the choices you make, then I'm afraid to say this isn't the game for you. The game will present you with moral dilemmas and choices related to the Story and the game will present you with a result/conclusion based on what you choose. If you feel not interested or annoyed by this kind of gameplay, be wary if you still decide to try this game.

I really enjoyed this game, it was a good experience and I highly recommend it. The overall design and presentation the game gives on both the Story and the Puzzles is very cool; even though ""simplistic/minimalistic"" looking, it works in favor of the game, making it enjoyable and giving it a more polished look, a detail that seems to be overlooked by several indie games.
Though the main story is a bit short (around 1.5 hrs, puzzles included) you still are presented with secrets that you can feel free to explore in the game if you so desire. 

This is a very cool little game, and I'm really glad I was able to enjoy as one of the last games of the year. Hopefully it will get more attention!",1482549808,1482549808,True,10,2,0.678487420082092285,1,True,False,False,False,,,

+表现形式新颖，纯文本与解谜结合
+黑色背景白色文本，简直读书利器
+剧本好，词汇不艰深，科幻控福利
-大量文本出没，考验玩家耐心
补充：自从大学毕业之后都没这么认真看过书了，而且剧情很不错，代入感很强，只是我真的很困（噗），所以英语好睡得好集中力够的同学可以试试。",1482461751,1482461751,True,14,1,0.581687808036804199,0,True,False,False,False,,,
