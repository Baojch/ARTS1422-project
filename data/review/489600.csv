I don't play golf in real life, but I've always enjoyed golf games for some slower-paced, relaxing fun. What better format for such a game than VR? Not quite as ""relaxing"" as sitting in a chair, swiping a mouse or flicking a thumbstick, but the added immersion is surely worth the extra effort.

As a pure simulation of playing a round of gold, The Golf Club VR (TGCVR) does a very good job. The graphics are pretty good (by current VR standards), and the audio is fine. As well as ambience which puts you on the golf course, you can clearly hear when you've hit your ball cleanly and when you've buggered up the shot. The swing mechanics work very well, giving you full control and leaving bad shots as pretty much your own fault. (Played on Oculus Rift S. Other HMDs may vary.) Ball physics also seem pretty good, with bounces and rolls you would expect, although some greens can feel a little too slick in my opinion. Of the various golf games I've tried in VR, TGCVR is easily the most realistic feeling of the bunch, which does it credit.

Another great feature is the number of courses. There are a good number of dev-made courses to get you started. Once you've mastered those there are literally hundreds (thousands?) of user-made courses to have a crack at. It's here that you can find just about any course you want, from your favourite real-life course to complete fantasy courses that see you hitting your ball from island to island.

Where the game falls down for me is it's complete lack of features. As it goes for realism over arcade action, it's understandable that there are no trick shot modes, mini-games, high score leaderboards, or anything like that. That's fine with me. However, there is also no career mode, no tournament mode, no AI to play against, very limited multiplayer, no equipment upgrades, and no progression of any kind. It's just you and a completely empty golf course, devoid of any atmosphere, every single time you play.

For golfing purists the above might not be an issue, but it is for me. I like at least some sense of progress, at least some reason to play. A simple tournament mode with spectators clapping and cheering and a proper leaderboard would have been enough, even without the AI competitors actually being visible. (ie, like HB's 2D golf games.) Just something to make you feel like a pro, rather than a Billy-no-mates playing alone on an empty course on a Monday afternoon.

Put simply, TGCVR nails the act of actually [i]playing[/i] golf in VR, yet completely lacks everything else that makes a [i]computer game[/i] interesting to play. With that said, I don't like arcade rubbish so it's still the best VR golf game I've played.

From my time playing the game (Oculus Rift S), I have experienced very few bugs, if any at all, although I cannot speak on other VR Hardware. The few ""bugs"" that I have experienced are quite trivial. The main ""bug"" is game crashes, however this only occurs when loading into a course, and happens very infrequently. As well, Since this also only happens when loading into the course it really has no affect on the game, as I can simply reload the game and load into it fine directly afterward. The only other bug I have noticed is that the drop zones after a hazard shot can be a bit ""iffy"" at points, outing you on the side of a cliff that is not playable, and forcing you to take the hole's shot limit. 

Outside of these two bugs, the game is fantastic. Almost any PGA course you could think of has been user created, from Pebble Beach to TPC Sawgrass, in pretty accurate detail. As well, the custom courses not based on ""real courses"" are incredibly creative and unique to play, hitting shots on and off of mountains and cliffs or from Island to Island. The game has so many created courses that you could end up playing a new course every day for a year and never run out!

As far as accuracy, that game may not be 1 to 1 of a real life swing, however consistency is still key. If you try and hit a shot, (and you are not on the beginning difficulty), accuracy is king, and getting your Iron and Driver's consistently down is a great feeling, from accuracy to speed. The putting and chipping is great as well, however I will say that it is hard to get the power of the chips down consistantley, especially from the different rough or sand traps as they can seem inconsistent at times. Putting however is great, though being a VR game, reading the greens is hard to do without the aided ""green reader"", similar to what you see in the 2kPGA games. You can take the time to walk the green and lay down on the ground to see the slops, however if you similar to me, we're playing in VR so we don't have to do all the tedious things like this.

As far as Online play, you can play online with others! You simply go to the course you want alongside your friends, and add them to your group, then press play. However, you cannot physically see them on the course. Alternatively, you can see their ball with a name above it, and their scores throughout the 18 holes alongside your own. You can also go head to head against friends or the leader-boards ""best scoring's"" on the course and see their shots as you take your's. The online is not perfect and probably doesn't equal alternative titles, but hopping into a discord and playing with friends is possible.

For me, Golf is a beautiful sport, however it's incredible hard to get into, from a difficulty point and price point. It's nice to be able to have the Golf itch and scratch it, without having to spend $30+ to go a course, and an additional 10+ to practice on a range before hand in real life. As well, after having a bad few holes I don't need to take the sad and slow grudge through the last part of the course, and can simply reset!

The game is not perfect, and from what I've seen the support from the game Developers seems to be long gone, but for the price and for what the game is, I believe its the best VR Golf experience you can get. I recommend trying it out, and if you don't like it or experience bugs with your hardware, simply refund it!

2. It was a huge hassle to get the controllers working (WMR, HP Reverb G2), had to define special controller settings for this game. Not sure how I got it working, kind of, but can play now with my controllers. Read of people who never got it working

I'm finding that sport-based games make an engaging use of these platforms.

I play on an Index, and I personally didn't see any issues.  The default control scheme is for the Vive, but this all translates well to the index.  The only issue the index controllers have (and the same can be said for other sports titles) is that their design has them fixed in your hand, so adjusting grip angle is awkward.  Also, this game is probably more immersive if you fix a sensor to a real golf club, but I would be afraid of hitting something in my office/game room.  To each their own.

Improvements I'd like to see:  Quality of life/convenience features!!  Why am I being asked to bend over and reach into my golf bag to pick up a ball?  Same goes for grabbing a club.  I should have the option to automatically pull a club or ball from the bag without needing to walk or teleport over to it.  Its a game.  Players who want to really live that simulation can be free to do so.  I'm just here for fun.  Real PRACTICE modes!!  Give me a fun driving range, or putting green to practice game swing mechanics as much as I want, and separate this out from other courses.  Sure, I could mulligan every shot I don't like on a course, but I would need the ABOVE convenience features in place to make this not laborious.  Eleven (ping pong game) does this excellently.

Starting from the teeing off. There are no tees so everything is off the deck meaning that the game is already off to a bad start for realism. Correct tee height is critical for doing the proper swing for each club so when your forced to use a driver off the deck every time it gets annoying as I can out hit the driver with the 5 wood most times.

Irons play stupidly short no matter the swing speed or shaft settings you choose. The shaft settings seem to make little to no difference to distance hit even when swinging in the desired swing speeds for the shaft. This is a real life customisation that actually makes a difference to flight path, trajectory and distance if paired correctly or incorrectly yet this game makes no distinction for anything when choosing this setting.

the penalty applied to the distance of a shot is again not realistic and seems to only take away from distance and not affect spin or direction at all which is just cringe when you.

Putting is far to fast with no feel for weighting given that there is a setting for this it is again disappointing. 

chipping is impossible as it has the same problems with irons only x2 for distance.

For a game that aimed for realism and a simulator approach with swing path analysis it is a total let down. As a real world golfer I would expect to have my real life skills at golf as a minimum on a game. This is not the case and I fear that anyone playing real golf that then puts the effort in to getting good on this game will only have ruined their actual golf swing due to this games lazy efforts.

only half accurate feed back is the swing analysis which tracks the path ok up until you get about 4 inches away from the ball and then you gain super powers to move the club head off of the swing path and back on to the same path on the other side of the ball. literally the most important part of the swing and it seems to guess what happens rather than track the movement. It is the fastest point of your swing so physically impossible for you to do what it says and flinch around the ball. since this is how the game calculates distance this is why it is unable to be played to any degree of enjoyment for some one who has actually played golf. It gives you 0% impact rating yet some how you hit the ball. 

Given that the game is using you hand in an unnatural position given the difference between a golf club grip and a VR controller it should have been coded in such a way that it smoothed out the swing path to take this into account. More effort required in the effects of rough, sand and tee height. Having also played their newest golf game I can safely say EA did a much better job 20 years ago with the tiger woods games for actual golf physics and that was before the days of GC Quad and other high tech trackers that these games could have used data from to enhance them. instead they seem to have their own version of physics and I doubt any one that worked on any of these golf games has played more than a round of mini golf.

I'm a relatively experienced golfer. Enough to actually play the game in real life with moderately good success. This game is very close to being awesome. I can tell that it may be limited by hardware at the time, or that the team should take another look at the swing evaluation. I'm using the valve index, and don't really notice any tracking problems. I have a swing speed of about 100-105 mph with a driver, but I refuse to swing that hard for this game. In real life my swing tends to come through with a bit of an open face with drivers and irons; in game its very heavily exaggerated. Though, can make adjustments for it and end up hitting a good ball. This applies to every club in the bag. 

I think the most accurate take on a golfer's ball spin in this game would have to be at the 2nd to easiest swing difficulty. This was disappointing, but necessary because of the club head tracking and calculating. This may be a result of using a single controller with 2 hands as compared to a real club, and I can deal with that. However, by far the largest problem is the distances in this game. A 4 iron only goes 140 yards? Seriously? I think this is because the game picks up that the club hits the ground on the way though. A huge weakness; you should at least be able to avoid it by resizing your clubs precisely. 4 standard presets would be fine if you didn't get punished for the dynamic resizing on the way through (The club will literally shrink in size to not go through the ground, but still results in ""chunking"" the ball). Not to mention, even with 100% clean contact, hitting off of anything but fairway results in 40-50% less power. They should take another look at that. Putting is not awful, but again it is different than real life because you are technically weightless, and the option to increase your ""putter weight"" only makes the logic worse. I feel that putting and short game around the green right now are the strengths of this game at this point in time; chipping especially feels real. 

I know that the game is early in development, and being a golfer, there's always that edge to hit a better shot. I just wish it was more rewarding! There's gotta be another way to handle the ground contact. However, this game is only $10.... Far, FAR worth it in my opinion, just to give another VR experience. The weaknesses right now do not take away from it's potential, whatsoever. It's still playable, just annoying at times to someone who actually golfs. Still an awesome idea, and I look forward to (hopefully) continued development and evaluation.",1621303941,1621303941,True,2,0,0.538745403289794922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This time I set my two sensors up at right angles to me and angled to capture the full range of swing, as I thought maybe losing tracking at the top of the swing was the problem.

It seems to have solved the problem as I can get a decent swing out of it, I think the real issue here is that it's hard to know whether your swings are bad because of a tracking error or your bad skills, for me I'd say my absolutely pathetic golf skills are accurately represented here and for just £7, you can't complain really.

The light rough is ridiculously unbelievable to swing out of and most of the swings don't register correctly.  We set up 4 sensors and had excellent coverage, but it was still too slow to pick up our normal swings.  Which meant you had to experiment with your swing until it actually worked, which probably isn't how you swing normally.

So fun yes, realistic no, and definitely will hurt your game if you don't go to a driving range before you hit the course.  My first game of the season was 8 strokes higher than my last game from last season... and several mulligans and some water balls.

I've heard it is not playable on Index either so....enjoy, Vive owners I guess?

Here are a few issues I encountered on Rift/Quest:

1. Centering yourself near the ball by holding the home button rarely works.  Often you are placed anywhere from 10-30yds away from the ball and you must manually teleport back with one of the worst teleport systems I've seen in any VR game.

2. Holding the controller up to your face for the rangefinder does not work consistently.  During the tutorial I was stuck at this step for a while until it randomly worked.  I have not been able to replicate that functionality so I'm not sure how you're meant to do it, but it obviously does not work properly for Oculus users.

3. The biggest/worst issue, and the reason I only have one hour in the game, is that tracking is completely broken.  The ONLY way to hit the ball with a Quest controller is to swing incredibly slowly.  If you swing as if it were a real golf club, you will miss the ball 100% of the time because the game CANNOT track the controllers properly.  On every attempt to hit a proper golf shot, the game would make a ""whoosh"" sound indicating that I had missed the ball, even if it appears that the club passes directly through the ball.  I tried several techniques, but in the end it seems you just have to swing too slowly for the ball to go anywhere.....So you're only capable of chipping on golf courses that require you to hit the ball much further than the measly 120yds of my longest shot after about 40 minutes of attempts.

I'm not sure how this game has positive reviews but I can only assume they're all from Vive owners.

There is absolutely no way to stop or back up a ball, if you get within 10 ft on an approach shot, consider it the luck of the golf gods as you wont do that again in the round.

Anything higher and club swing becomes a stuttering mess. For a game made in 2017 I would have thought newer hardware could handle it no problem.  Mechanics are good. BUT, swinging a single controller with two hands (I have the Index controllers) results in a hook or slice every time. (I play golf IRL and this is not a problem I have) Yet, swinging with one hand yields a straight drive every time.  I think if the game performance were better this would not be as much of an issue. I can run games such as Half Life Alyx at 90FPS all day long with no issues.  This game on Medium settings barely runs at 25fps.

Nach dem Lesen der Rezensionen habe ich gezweifelt, ob ich mir dieses Spiel kaufen soll. Bei dem Preis, hab ich mir gedacht, ich probiere es einfach aus und mache mir mein eigenes Bild.
Es hat sich gelohnt!
Für alle die noch Zweifeln, jedoch Golf lieben und eine Oculus Quest 2 besitzen gibt es von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung.
Ich spiele über Virtuell Desktop (ohne Link Kabel), habe eine GTX 1060 (6GB) und nutze einen Honor 3 (Wifi 6) Router. Prozessor i7 mit 12 GB Ram. Das Spiel läuft absolut flüssig und ist sogar überwiegend in Deutsch gehalten. Hier gibt es noch ein wenig Vermischung mit dem Englischen aber das sind Quest User ja ohnehin gewohnt. Immerhin kann das Tutorial auf Deutsch angewendet werden.
Das Spiel ist nicht ganz einfach zu meistern. Ich habe 2 Saison lang echtes Golf gespielt und kenne die Grundlagen. Die Weiten der Schläge in diesem Spiel sind schwer zu erreichen. Nun habe ich aber auch erst einen kurzen Test gemacht. Alles reibungslos und super Grafik und Sound.
Ich freue mich auf viele schöne Plätze und ein schönes Golferlebnis.
Wirklich sehr nahe an der Realität. Meinen großen Respekt für die Entwickler.
Also Quest 2 User, ihr könnt es unbedenklich kaufen und Spaß haben.

Man steht mitten im Baum wenn man die Range nutzen will. Das ist ein klarer Fehler im Spiel, trübt aber das Spielerlebnis auf den Plätzen nicht.",1611921576,1611921576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- no waiting or walking to ball
- no more waiting for the beverage cart, you pour em as you go!
- nobody to watch you shank it into the weeds
- User friendly and fairly accurate (accuracy may be a con too...)
- putter weight adjustable for more lifelike experience 

Cons:
- still didn't fix my swing, leading to shanking into the weeds

I have all of The Golf Club programs and have created several course for TGC, TGC2 and 2019. You can imagine my excitement when I found TGC-VR! I spent $300 on an Oculus Quest 2 and $10 for TGC-VR. Unfortunately it wouldn't run. Screen came up with gray background and ground at the bottom. I was running an Nvidia GTX 960 graphics card (2GB), but I thought I would at least get something. So, I spent another $270 to upgrade my card to a GTX 1060 (6 GB) and from 8 GB of ram to 16GB. I ran the VR test and it said my rig was well in the green! Finally, $570 later I was ready to rock! I launched TGCVR and got a blue background with ground at the bottom, a lighthouse on an island and the sound of waves and birds. No drop-down menus, no left right screen movement with mouse, arrow keys or Quest 2 controllers. It just sits there. Needless to say, I one frustrated person!! Why would you sell a product that doesn't work? How many other games/products does Steam sell that doesn't work? If you meet the software requirements listed on the product, it should work! If it doesn't why are you selling it??? For support they refer you to the TGC-VR posting boards or offer you a refund. Refund? The $10 isn't the issue. The $270 I spent to meet or exceed the published requirements and the frustration of trying to figure out what I was doing wrong... that's the issue! So, should I request a $280 refund?

Not like, out on the course of the driving range, I mean where the player stands. Look it up if you don't believe me (why would you, its absurd). It renders the entire practice mode (driving range, putting practice, etc.) unusable. There is literally (in the original sense), no way to use a major feature of the game.

Lots of other issues, for instance, it really only works on HTC Vive, it doesn't work on Index really at all. As in the game loads and whatnot but you can't get past the tutorial because they are Vive controller specific. Good luck pressing that button that isn't on your controller. 

These and others are well documented issues,. The devs themselves made a post 2 years ago about how they were ""working on"" removing the tree. I'm not a developer so maybe I don't know but I'm pretty sure of 2 things. 1. Trees don't usually just appear places as a bug. 2. If they did, deleting them would not take over 2 years of working on.

This game is sometimes good, most of the time it's alright.  It is as close to playing real golf as you can get in VR. It is not an arcade style game. If you are looking for something similar to the Tiger Woods series where you can shoot -15 every round, this is not your game. I shoot generally worse than what I would in real life. Mainly because some parts are just maddening. 

The ProTee simulator is currently in a tree and unusable. The lack of a driving range. The inability to recenter yourself (plz comment if you know how to do this) and the INCONSISTENT IRON DISTANCES sometimes lead me to quitting before my round is over. - I swear I can hit my 7 iron full strength 160 yards but then it will go 105 when I need to clear a hazard. 

My best round on 18 is an 89 and everything was working smooth (irons were consistent, ball set-up was in the center of my play area, hitting putts, etc) 

Also, like other reviews mention: real multiplayer would SELL VR headsets to the golf community. 

I wish the dev would continue to update and support this game as it truly is an amazing experience if you enjoy golf.  I've found myself chipping on the tutorial green over and over to practice. The short game is by far the most stand-out part of this game when it comes to realism.

I suppose I could invest 45 minutes remapping every single control myself, but that's quite fiddly and annoying.

Other bugs have lasted for some time and have never been fixed.  Using the ProTee simulator spawns a giant tree inside the tee box making it totally unusable.  There are also no useable driving range or chipping/putting practice areas.  It is very useful to have an area where you can just hit the same shot repeatedly without fiddling with menus or teleporting and that does not happen here.

Others mention it but the driving range is blocked by a tree which is the dumbest thing ever. It's a video game, just delete the tree.

Many inconsistencies have cropped up. I've moved on to Golf+. Far superior in physics and features if not in VR graphics.


I like the game. It's challenging and, because I'm retired, it's something to do on those cold winter days when I have no interest in going outside for exercise. Not to mention that it's a whole lot cheaper than going out for a real round.

There are a couple of pros:
It's beautiful.

The swing mechanics are pretty realistic. Especially after I realized that a major problem I was having was because I wasn't keeping my left elbow straight. After I figured that out the frustration level went way down.

There are a lot of courses available to play so you likely won't get bored quickly.

But, it has a number of cons:
There are inconsistencies with how some of the clubs play. For example I can easily hit a 3 iron 200 yards but I'm lucky if I can get 150 yards out of a 4 iron. And the 3 and 5 woods seem to be reversed.

There is no multi-player so you can't share a round with a friend.

There's a huge bushy tree in the middle of the Pro Tee Simulator. This doesn't detract from the regular game play but a major feature of the game is totally unusable.

It took a long while, using a Rift 2, to figure out that the center of the play area depends on how you draw your Guardian area. I started out with no Guardian area and found that the game would often try to put me in a wall. Also the only way to set your facing direction is in the tutorial area. It cannot be done in any area of the game. The Rift reset view does not work.

Lastly, that game seems to be abandoned by the developer.  That's sad as this game would have an unending future if the dev's so chose.",1580876203,1645267133,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I'll start with the positives and things I enjoyed and then follow this my concerns.
*Disclaimer*
It seems this was designed for the HTC Vive and I have the Rift S, so this may be the biggest reason for my issues 

Positives:
1) PRETTY courses 
- It is a GREAT looking game. The courses and scenery are quite nice in most places. I know it's not completely realistic, but it's realistic enough.

2) LOADS of courses
- Seriously, I haven't counted them all, but there's got to be hundreds of them.

3) A GREAT workout
- Playing this game leaves me feeling like I just played a real round of 18 holes.

Negatives:
1) INCONSISTENCY
- This is one of the MOST INCONSISTENT games I've played. 
- DRIVER: I do play golf on occasions and on average I can drive 250-275 yards but in this game I can barely get over 230? So I tried a little experiment where I did 3 swings with the driver and kept my club speed as close as I could and got a completely different result each time. The first drive when 200 yards, second drive went 50 yards and the last drive went....302 yards? Again, I kept my swing strength as close as I could and the contact for each drive was the same so why such a big differential?

- IRONS: They are either SUPER fat or SUPER long. When your 3 iron goes exactly the same distance as your pitching wedge, there's something wrong. lol

 -PUTTING: Ever wonder what it would be like putting on sheets of glass? Most of the greens are WAY too fast and with just the slightest tab, you'll send your ball across the entire green. Also, the ""practice putt"" you get before each one doesn't accurately show how the putt is going to travel. There's been multiple times where the actual putt goes a lot farther than the practice putt even after hitting it softer.  

2) CHANGING club settings does NOTHING
- You can change the club length and stiffness but none of these seem to matter. I've noticed that my average swing speeds were in the 80-90 mph range so I changed the shaft stiffness to the one it said was correct and nothing changed.

3) Difficult to aim
- Maybe this is just a personal issue, but it seems like the ball ALWAYS either goes way right or way left of where I'm aiming. When looking at the contact, the face isn't open or closed so I don't know why I'm pulling/pushing the ball. The flight path doesn't even match up to the swing path.

4) The Pro Tee Lighthouse Thing
- This shouldn't even exist. It's a golf simulator so what's the point of having a lighthouse to walk through with nothing inside to do? There is a dinosaur at the top, but no way of reaching it. It seems like this was something they added to practice developing with and forgot to remove. 

Now deciding whether or not to recommend this game is a bit more tricky. Since I don't have the HTC Vive, I don't feel like I can not recommend it because I'm not getting the intended experience from it, but in my personal experience, I can't recommend it. It's fun to play the first couple of swing and after that the frustration sets in. So, I'm not recommending it for now, but if things change, I will easily change my mind.",1577222164,1577222164,False,6,0,0.601449251174926758,0,True,False,False,False,,,

you only need one controller and im not using full room scale. you set everything up in tutorial and it knows the direction you need to hit, so can stay in same position. you use 1 button to teleport where you want and one to teleport to ball. you use trigger to pick club and everything is explained clearly in tutorial for different levels. 

a must have game just to chill out for some golf.

THE 2D VERSION YOU GET ELSEWHERE IS STILL UPDATED AND IS ACTUALLY FUN!

Now that that is out of the way, lets get to some of the worst issues this game has.

1. Its been completely abandoned by the developers. No updates, no responses, no anything. Dont expect to ever get real support for this game.

2. The height tracking is awful. It doesnt have any settings AT ALL to adjust this stuff, and its all done during initial tutorial. This means that only one player can ever play this game per Steam account that owns it, but it also means that if anything gets off by even a little you must either deal with it (impossible) or delete all your saves and start over.

3. The ProTee option is completely unusable. There is a tree planted in front of you so you cant hit anything. The developers said this would be fixed in an update that never came. Rumor is that this happened due to licensing issues with ProTee, but nothing is confirmed. One more feature you can kiss goodbye if buying now.

4. The club swing tracking is AMAZING when it works. Youll find yourself really feeling like you are there and it even includes some nifty stuff on the hand controls. This is all thrown away the second your height gets thrown off, which WILL happen before you finish a single round of golf. After that, the swing is off by however many inches your height is off and youll never make a good swing again. This was with an Oculus, which only got support later in this games life so that may be attributed to that.

All in all, most features of this game are either broken or intentionally removed and thus makes the game not worth the value. If you just want to hit a few balls on Pebble Beach, then this game is perfect for you.",1562172194,1562172194,False,8,0,0.598373711109161377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I finally bought it today and I wish I hadn't waited. It's even better than I expected.

There are a couple of small issues like the broken golf simulator that mysteriously has a tree in the middle of it, but who wants to use a golf simulator and hit a virtual ball into a virtual screen in VR anyway? I also wish I could change which way is forward for me, because I swing left and my PC is on the left side of my PC, so I have the wires wrapped around me which can cause problems if you're trying to get a powerful swing. I hadn't even made it through my first course before almost ripping the cables out of the back of my computer.

A few people seem to be confused and they think all games on Steam are perpetually in Early Access and should be updated monthly. This game was fully released a couple of years ago, and if you don't know the difference between an Early Access game and a fully released game, you may be disappointed that this was ""abandoned"" as some people have said. But it hasn't. It's just a complete game with a couple of minor issues, but nothing game breaking.

Other than that, it's exactly what you want in a VR golf game. As soon as you finish the tutorial, there's no hand holding. It's just you, your clubs, and the course. It's about as close to swinging a real club as you're going to get in a VR golf game.

When I started, the game took me to a tutorial.   I slowly figured out how to keep proceeding, until I got to a screen that asked me to look at my cyber ""watch"" -- an in-game tool.   I couldn't figure out how to simply look at it, and so I couldn't keep moving through the tutorial.   I'd ""press"" (using the Vive wand to shoot a red line, then hit the trigger) on the ""Advance"" button that showed up in virtual reality.  But nothing would happen.

I became concerned, and then nearly convinced, that the game was broken.  I decided to refund.    But a bit of time passed, and I tried again.   Somehow, I randomly did something to look at my ""watch"" (I think I just rolled my wrist while holding the wand!), and was suddenly able to see it and then advance.   Finally, I got into the ""game"" proper, where I could pick from many courses.

So I started to play.   And again met with frustration.    Dropping clubs.   Knocking over the golf bag repeatedly.  Bending down to pick up the dropped clubs.   Oh, I was about to refund again.

But I stuck with it.  And after playing awhile, I managed to get to a settings screen and turn on ""sticky clubs.""   From that point forward, I slowly figured out how to move -- and how to pick up dropped clubs effortlessly, and all at once, if I knocked over the bag.  Which I continued to do.  

 I found that the best way to ""move"" is to depress the right side of the wand's track pad, then trigger on the point where I wanted to stand.  After some practice, I learned to move effortlessly to the correct place to stand for each shot.   

And if I knocked over the bag of clubs?  I just depressed the LEFT side of the track pad, and the bag reassembled its compliment of clubs, stood up, and moved close to where the ball was sitting.   Then I did one more small adjustment with the right side of the track pad and trigger, to stand where I wanted.

And after hitting the ball?   Depressed on the LEFT side of the track pad, and automatically moved close to the ball and brought the clubs with.  Then one more right-press and trigger could refine slightly where I was standing, as needed.

I don't know if ""sticky clubs"" was necessary to make the track-pad work so easily now, but, whatever I did to make this work -- it has ended up working.

Slowly, I've gotten the hang of it.   And at least on my rig -- a Vive runnng from a pretty strong gaming computer -- the actual game play feels, to me, remarkably realistic.    I think I'm no better (or worse) with the game than I am in real life.   And the putting and short game feel controllable, and amenable to practice.

The visuals are not as wonderful as they would be on a monitor -- but for VR I find them perfectly acceptable.  Of course, demands vary with individual taste.

Botton line?  I'm really glad I bought this, and stuck with it through the initial frustrations.    I've got to be careful not to swing and hit furniture in the room -- but that's something I will simply be careful with.  And I can keep learning, and slowly, slowly try to pull my scores down as I play a course over and over, even in the winter.

Computers vary in strength, and not everybody wants to practice a lot of patience -- but I am really happy with this game at the moment on my current computer.   I easily give it two thumbs up.  Some of the complaints about the game -- like knocking over the clubs -- I think I've found a suitable way to deal with that isn't hard or frustrating.   It just took patience and exploration.    Incidentally, I'm running windows 10 on an  8-core (I think) machine with a good graphics card.   I don't have any idea if such a rig is really necessary for the game.   But in my case, it was at least sufficient.  

After some of the negative reviews, I am surprised to find myself writing this positive review.   But I can't do anything else, fairly.  I don't see any easy way to do multi-player, but I don't really care.  Others may feel differently, and I can see why they might.  But, aside from a tutorial that could take a bit more care making sure one doesn't have unintended frustrations, I give this game 5 stars out of 5.  It and X-plane 11 (?) are now my ""go to"" virtual reality games.   And I suspect they will be for quite some time into the future.  They both seem to me  like reasonably good simulations, and they both take patience to figure out, but ultimately feel rewarding to me.

However, I caution that I am not a good golfer -- I won't be breaking 100 any time soon, either  with this game or in real life.   Since individual skill varies so much, I can only speak to how realistic the game seems to ME -- people of different skill, or perhaps better or worse judgment, might come away with a different opinion.  I'd be interested to know the opinion of this game held by a really good golfer.",1557092505,1557093927,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The sheer number of courses is pretty incredible, but for an amateur it's a little too focused on realism (like always having to get a club out of a bag) and not enough to make the VR experience enjoyable... you have no idea where your ball went (you can't watch it once you've hit it), there's no pin indicator, etc. The ability to aim a shot and lock it in is great, but good luck swinging hard enough to make the ball go as far as you want.

Ich habe zwar nur eine Stunde gespielt und habe auch die zweitleichteste Stufe gewählt aber es ist mir schlichtweg nicht möglich den Ball regelmäßig zu treffen! Teilweise bis zu 20 Schwünge bis der Ball sich bewegt. Und dann mal nur 45 Meter mit einem 7er Eisen.

Kurz zum Vergleich:
Im echten Leben bin ich HCP 5 Spieler, habe einige Runden unter Par gespielt und habe eine Driving Distance von circa 230-250 Metern vom Tee.
Dieses ""Spiel"" ist nicht mehr und nicht weniger als ein ""Spiel"".
Hat mit Golf aber nur den Namen gemeinsam. Sonst nichts.",1548954151,1548954151,False,2,3,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I appreciate HB taking it's incredible Golf Club games and making a VR version that truly sets itself apart, not only from other golf games, but other VR games. Most VR games at this point, especially sports games, are small, prototypical, one-off, proof-of-concept games, like that 2 minute drill football game and a few baseball ones that give you three innings or less. this game, on the other hand, is a by comparison, complete and rich with features and game modes and the user-created mods take it to another level.

The swing mechanics are as real as possible, considering players are holding a controller instead of a real, weighted club, and adhere to key components such as club rotation and swing path and contact etc. Striking the ball correctly affects a shot in this game as much as it does in real life and that keeps me coming back.

The courses are beautiful, the experience in enjoyable and the replaybility far exceeds most VR games across the board. I hope HB continues to develop this game and add to it, but it's an incredible game at this point regardless. Worth noting, HB devs have been very responsive and helpful in forums.

I've played nearly all the non-VR golf games released in the last 20 years. None of them comes close to the experience of this simulation. VR golf has ruined all non-VR golf games for me. There is no going back.

Playing with a Vive wand, two-handed for the required accuracy on the highest difficulty level, provides a very close approximation to real golf. So close, in fact, that I find myself needing to watch real golf instructional videos to improve my virtual swing. When I do hit a bad shot, 9 times out of 10 I can contribute it to what I did wrong and correct it in future swings.

The biggest problem I have with this simulation is that the performance is very course-dependent. While motion smoothing has helped considerably, courses with lots of trees require reduced graphics settings to have playable frame rates.

Also, while the lack of true multiplayer (the game only allows playing against shot-by-shot player-less replays of others' games) hasn't stopped me from playing hundreds of hours, having others out there on the course would be amazing.

I almost can't belive how much fun it is at times. To start with, there is Incredible immersion from the moment you see the first menu, almost nothing looks better visually in VR than a golf course. You've got loads of courses, fast undulating greens, etc. Whoever the lead designer is for this game, congratulations. 

However, in my view the game is desperately lacking three things which I believe would make it not simply the best VR golf game, but the best Oculus game, PERIOD:

1. For me, it's just a bit too awkward taking full shots and having to concentrate on getting the clubface to hit the ball, getting the speed right AND the direction of the shot. This makes the whole thing feel more difficult than real golf. There should be a simplified version in one of the easy modes in which a. the direction is first chosen and locked for the shot, b. the club impact positioning is much more forgiveable in that the club hits the ball if the clubhead gets fairly close and c. the main aspect of the shot is then simply concentrating on the strength of the shot. I was actually expecting that with 4 difficulty modes, surely one of them would give you this kind of 'party' setup. As it is, in the easiest mode, you already get that green angle 'ribbon' when lining up the shot, so it's already almost there. 

2. On greens, there should either be a similar 'easy' option in which either the ball gets 'grabbed' by the hole if it goes close, or you can literally make the hole bigger! This may sound ridiculous, but the whole reason I don't play golf for real is that putting is just too difficult on fast, sloping greens, and it just kiils the fun because I don't have hours to spend on a practise putting green.

3, There should be a practise green and practise range in which a given shot can be taken over and over once chosen without having to grab a ball from the bag or do any kind of setup each time.
  
Even in real golf, clubs have been designed with bigger heads, sweet spots and so on, to make things easier and more consistent, so in a game this can be taken to any extreme the designers want.

I feel that the developers are trying to create the ultimate VR golf simulator and have almost succeeded. But, for me, this is first and foremost a game, and for any sports game to be truly addictive it has to make a few compromises away from simulation and towards fun. With some truly 'gamey' options to go with all the sim stuff, everyone would want to play this game, not just golf enthusiasts. It would become the ultimate party game. 

Plus, I notice that many of the issues and requests you've already received relate to sensors, attachments, club length, and so on. With a truly gamey shot selection/taking like I suggest, many of these issues would disappear because people just want to feel they can hit enjoyable shots consistently and they're constantly trying to achieve this in various ways by tweaking stuff and asking you for updates.

Go on. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease. This could be better than real golf.

As expected, it is by far the best golf game imaginable with current VR technology. The tracking implementation allows you to play exactly as you would in reality in terms of stance and swing, although it is worth strapping a heavy stub shaft to the touch controller for a full feeling of grip and club weight.
The only issue I have with the game is that the rendering doesn't seem to have been fully adapted to VR head tracking or to use efficient stereoscopic rendering (rendering both eyes simultaneously using stereoscopic scanline rendering rather than rendering each eye separately), which means that even on hardware well above the minimum requirements for the headset - I'm on a Core i5-8500 3Ghz with GTX 1060 3GB - the graphics settings have to be turned down to avoid severe frame rate drops and double-vision motion ""blur"". It still looks nice and is fully playable, but unless you have a 1080 or better you won't get shadows or good MSAA.
This is a common problem with games ported directly from desktop to VR - the Truck Simulators for example - so it's not unexpected and I'm not disappointed, I just hope the devs will keep working on the VR version to make it more efficient for the platform.

It took me a few rounds, and a few changes to the default setup to get it dialed to where it feels and plays great. 

The trailers seem a bit goofy to me, which turned me off of the game at first.  Wish listed, then bought on special.  Very happy that I gave it a chance.  I'm a very average rw golfer, and to me this feels like playing the real thing.   I now look forward to coming home from work and playing a quick 9 to relax.  

At first, I expected a VR golf GAME, but instead it seems the devs have gone for more of a golf SIM.  You can't zoom to an overhead map, or follow your ball through the air,... or expect to chip in 50% of your shots from just off the green.  If you want to see exactly where the fairway is over that hill, then you can either reach into your back pocket for the static hole card, or (as I figured out, after a while) 'walk' (ie. teleport) a take a look for yourself.   Basically your choices are the same as they would be in real life.  

My personal play suggestions:
1. move your bag to where's convenient for you.  It stays where you put it, so within arm's reach, just out of sight when swinging is perfect.
2. turn off the green grid.   soooo, much better without it.  It's VR... read the green for yourself, don't really on flat screen game mechanics.
3. Quickly tap the 'test putt' to give a few extra clues regarding the green, but don't try to make a perfect test.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Otherwise it feels almost like you are getting two changes.
4. After your hit, teleport down the course to watch the ball flight from a better view.  Par 3, then why not quickly switch to view from the green... works great (note: you do need to teleport yourself there, there is no 'green view' button). 
5. Be sure to tweak the putter weight.  It plays much better when your put goes a far/hard as you expect, otherwise it feels like you're trying to learn the game instead of simply playing golf. 
6. Turn off wall chaparone, and only have floor chaparone.  I'm not sure if this is SteamVR or only through Advanced plugin.  Eitherway, floor outline is imporant to you know where you are, but walls can interfere with the experience.  

Really enjoying it, but there is room for improvement:
1. Career mode?  Tournaments?  Right now it very much feels like having access to play golf courses anytime you want... which, while great, could use some 'challenge' elements.
2.  Being able to view your drive distance would be nice.  Not realistic, but nice to have. 
3. The abilty to reset room setup.  Maybe I just haven't found this yet.  Instead of aiming straight into my vr space, it always feels like it's placed me looking 50 yards to the left of where I need to aim.

Amazing, but a bit dry, VR golf.  Really enjoying it, but wishing the game had some challenges instead of me simply trying to beat my own best rounds.",1531624563,1531674406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're looking for a straightforward, laid back game of golf, you came to the wrong game. I bought this game on sale, but it is nooooot worth $30. if you're looking to try it out, then you should, but be aware you have to refund it before 2 hours of gameplay if you don't like it. 

Controls in the game are a bit difficult to use, tracking is not precise enough to work well with the concept of the game itself. Not to mention the lack of free locomotion and the consistent ability to get you set up where you want to be next to the ball, it makes it frustrating that you have to teleport over to your bag every time you want to switch your club, then readjust your setup again. Far too complicated and limiting for what I was expecting. 

Using the trigger to readjust yourself yielded nothing but more inconsistent movements that made it harder to hit the ball. Moving more like in Eleven Table Tennis would have been much easier to adjust how you wanted to hit the ball. You should be able to pick a club by pointing at it, not going over to the bag every time. I actually would have appreciated NOT having a bag, and just using controls to select a club like any other golf game. 

Yes, as someone who has played a lot of golf IRL, I enjoyed the feel of the swing and the trajectory of the ball, but for something that tried to be a bit more of a simulation, the ball flies incredibly straight whereas I have a slice IRL. 
I can't expect a video game to get it exactly right obviously, but, EVERY hit going perfectly straight wherever you hit it? As a game that is praised as a simulation, I was a bit disappointed by this. NOT the reason I'm not recommending it, though.

All in all, the gameplay itself is good, but the locomotion controls and adjustment for hitting the ball are uninuitive and you can tell they slapped basic locomotion on to an already complete desktop game. The interesting mechanics they put into the game, like tracking your swing and trajectory and analyzing how you hit the ball, is hindered by the horrible controls and general club/ball management. 

""you only played the game for a little bit!"", to which you are right. 
It doesn't take long to realize the controls are bad in any game, but it's much more aparent in VR titles. 

Again, the biggest reason I am rating negatively is because of the limiting and annoying movement. My other nitpicks are either issues BECAUSE of the movement, or just a little something I wasn't expecting.

Swing works perfect 
Putting is sensational 
Graphics breathtaking 
Amount  of courses limitless . 

I play this game nearly everyday and that’s saying something considering I have a job and a family ,a quick half hour loading up your personal best score and a few online ghosts and away you go .

Learning the clubs  is hard but fair . It’s very similar to real golf as in hard 4 iron or soft 3 , when you get it wrong it’s horrible , when you get it right your buzzing . 

Points I will make to help people get the best out of it .

1- oculus needs 3 sensors and I don’t  care what any one says the tracking on the back swing with 2 kills the shot sometimes . 3 s perfect , changed the game for me from being good to almost perfect . 
2- consistent stance just like real golf you have to hit every shot with the same stance. 
3-pick a course and play it over and over again till you feel you can’t get another stoke out it , why ? Because once you learn the course and have been all over it you start to understand what you want to do and when you pull it off it feels great . 

I will still be playing this game in 5 years time unless they make a new one  it’s that good . 

I don’t own a super pc and on low this game is still great 

i5 7400
16g DDR4 
GTX 1060 3gb
500gb SSD

So the game is in reach of the mere mortals of this world (no idea how people can afford 1080ti) or as I call it the family holiday 

Only Games I play are this , driving games  AC and project cars eleven table tennis and pavlor . 

And this game is outstanding .

The physics are trying to be to real.  We don't have a real golf club in our hands so the inertia that helps make a smooth steady swing is not there. So prepare for frustration and club throwing.

The way you get your clubs is cool, but a huge pain in the ass. There is golf bag with clubs, that you have to physically go to to get your clubs. And that's fine if your playing in a stadium but most of us have a small space. There needs to be a club menu.

This game looks and feels about like Xplane 11 in VR.  It's a perfect sim with a less perfect performance.

I've played most of the golf games and the only other one that has satisfying physics to me is Tee Time Golf.  The main thing I look for is when you mess up it feels like it's your fault.  This game delivers.
The hit strength feels normal too and is about the same strength I use in Tee Time even though that game will register weaker swings as full power.

The interface and club selection process is polished and feels good (very important).   I like that you can teleport along with your bag right to the ball position very easily.

Unfortunately, I can't leave a positive reivew. If I could leave an inbetween review, I would probably do that. I love golf games so naturally I wanted a nice one for VR - this just isn't quite it.

Pros:

Excellent simulation - it feels very realistic as far as the mechanics and physics of things go. The putting is totally on point, I loved that part. The golf bag and being able to pull clubs out of it is cool. The range finder is a cool feature. There are a ton of courses. You can change the length of your clubs - I like this feature as it's missing from the other golf game (Everyday Golf VR) that I actually settled on as my go-to golf game instead of this one. Although unfortunately for this game, the other golf game does not suffer from most of the cons below for this game, but also feels very realistic which makes it the clear winner here.

Cons:

It's not very pretty and stays pretty blurry, unlike almost every other VR game I've played. There isn't much difference between the high and low graphics settings, and both seem to run somewhat poorly with dips in framerates. I run an i7-4770k with a GTX 1080 and 16GB RAM, which is enough to run pretty much anything out there right now with fairly high settings and good framerates. The blurry ugly graphics along with framerate drops totally breaks the immersion for me.

There isn't much of a game element - you just play courses. This is fine, but it does leave something to be desired - some goals, some feedback, even some commentary can be fun in a golf game. This game has none of those things. Aside from the initial tutorial, it's just you, the coarse, and some really subpar graphics with bad framerates.

The swing physics seem to be fairly accurate. I don't play real golf much, so I'm not a very good player in real life. However, in real life, I can generally hit a ball much farther than I can in this game, even on the 'casual' setting which supposedly gives you a boost. Seeing the path of your swing after you do it is pretty cool but doesn't make up for the extremely long holes of double and tripple bogies due to not being able to hit the ball as far as you probably should be able to.

You can teleport around, which is  a nice feature, but it's still pretty difficult to line up a different shot other than one that's automatically aimed towards the whole. You almost need a really big play area so you can just walk up to the ball and swing at a different angle - like all the way 360 degrees around it, preferably. My play area is about 2m by 3m or so, and to me it was on the cusp of not being enough. This statement holds true for the other golf game I mentioned earlier too btw - and that one you can't teleport in, but I seem to have less need for it in that game for some reason.

The background ambience is not quite convincing, and it just adds to the game not being immersive in it's other ways.

I requested a refund on this one - it's just not satisfying enough for me to spend hours in golfing. It was cool at first, but it's downfalls got to me very quickly - the biggest being the bad graphics and poor performance.",1512345060,1512345060,False,3,0,0.549896836280822754,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I must agree that the game could use some optimization. I'm on a water & o/c'd 6600k/Rx Vega 56 and am able to run high with SS @ 1.0 and no AA smoothly. This is on the Samsung Odyssey HMD and the windows steamvr preview. I have noticed that my cpu utilization will still stop around 50% in this game which I believe is holding me back (even with yesterday's update). Upping the SS and AA levels helps smooth out distanct foliage and shadows considerably, which unfortunately have a pixelated effect that sparkles and gets annoying. 

Gameplay is good although I find the club reaching outwards on downswing. I also play with senior flex because swinging at my normal speed with something so light as a controller hurts my elbow/bicep. Putting is also finicky but eh it's ok.

Much fun, hope his will get another update or TGC 2 comes out with VR and better multiplayer and optimization.",1510809143,1510809143,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Then comes the confusing club selection (a 5 wood shoots further than a driver apparently). Talking of drivers, good luck reliably connecting with the ball using that thing. On the plus side, you can at least throw your clubs around in frustration - it simulates that aspect of golf very well.

The courses are excellent and immersion is good enough that I feel like what I'm doing in game could be similar to a real life experience. My problem is I am terrible at golf but I'm sure this will help me improve my game. I do like this game very much it's one of the best VR  games out at the moment. It won't appeal to you unless you have an interest in sports or golf, I'm not a golf fan but I don't mind watching it and would have a go in real life. If you just want to mess around and have a laugh I would say save your money and go from a non VR golf game.

You will need quite a bit room to play as you'll be swing your VIVE controller around like a proper club.

As someone who has never played full sized 18 hole golf in real life just PC games and smaller scale golf I did expect this game to have an easy mode or a newbie mode but as much as you can set newbie levels for the clubs, courses and swings you still need to be able to play golf in real life to get anywhere near par. I've spent most of my time trying to get onto the green and near to the hole. Once I do I find that the putting is quite easy and responsive. I think in order to improve I will need practice and Youtube advise videos so I am in theory learning to play golf with this game.

Since I've only been on a driving range a few times in my life and mostly played pitch and putt or crazy golf this has been a big steep learning curve.

Golf Club VR is defiantly trying to be a hardcore golf sim and for people with a good level of golfing skill they would do well in this game and most would enjoy it. Of course its no substitute for a real golf course but it's pretty near. As for the new player this game does have options to tweak the game such as changing club length, giving you shot data such as swing angle and telling you which club to use but you'll need to practice to get good at it. My main problem is I just cannot hit the ball hard enough.

Multiplayer is available along with online stats and leaders boards. However there is no way I'm attempting multiplayer until I'm much better. Available from the main menu and online there are hundreds upon hundreds of 9 hole, 18 hole and putting range golf courses. Content wise if you like golf it will satisfy you. I would advise anyone playing to make sure your VIVE sensors are mounted high and a decent distance apart, in a small apartment or flat you may have issues.

PROS
+ Drowning in content and courses
+ Semi real/very good immersion
+ Tutorial is fairly decent
+ Lots of options to tweak controls and golf style

CONS
- Hardcore difficulty
- Optimization....On my GFX 1080 and AMD 8350, 2.0 super-sampling not possible on some courses due to FPS drop
- Not really a con but needs a lot of room in your home to play due to swinging action

So I just want to add a little to my review. I wasn't very good and getting frustrated at only being able to hit the ball short distances. So I watched some real golf videos on Youtube, adjusted my swing, changed grip and how changed I use the clubs... BANG! tee off improving much more distance and height and now my shots with the irons much much better. This just goes to show how much of a simulator this game really is that real golf advise improved my game. I am finally getting better and even got a couple of pars today.

It might be good for the devs to include some ingame help or videos for newbies who have never played proper golf before to help them learn the game.

Really enjoying the experience I cannot wait until VR resolutions improve in the future this game runs and looks decent enough but when VR goes HR wow time.

I was a little apprehensive when I bought this but I shouldn't have been as this game (simulator) is very, very impressive.

Jan 19 Update

Up until August last year I was quite enjoying The Golf Club VR 

Then quite a few of us had an issue with the in-game ProTee simulator, which had a tree problem which prevented use of the simulator. 

The devs promised it would be fixed in late August, 2018. 

In January, 2019 the issue was still there, so I tried to contact the developers using their facebook page https://www.facebook.com/TheGolfClubHB/, as they were ignoring the steam pages, to say there was an issue with a tree in the ProTee sim in Golf Club VR.

I was met with a fairly blunt response to say The Golf Club 2019 (er wrong game) was feature complete and to contact ProTee as they were the support contact. When I pulled them up on their response and corrected them on the game, they apologised, which is fine and said, ""we are very proud of the 19 games we have produced and to contact ProTee for support"". 

OK!

So I contacted ProTee and they pretty much laughed (in a polite way), which I suspected they would, and said, no, they only support the physical machines.

I have gone back to https://www.facebook.com/TheGolfClubHB/ but I am not holding much hope. They only seem to be interested in blowing their own trumpet and wasting your time by sending you off on a wild goose chase.

Finally, this is one of only two negative reviews I have given as I would generally prefer to try and sort out any issues but when a developer just doesn't want to listen then I feel I have no choice but to revert to this (and avoiding their games in future), which is a shame as I know how hard it is to develop a game and a community.",1494768955,1548462098,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Swing - fresh air.
Swing - fresh air.
Swing - fresh air.
Swing - I finally hit the damn ball!
Repeat.

My first few rounds with this game were fine, hardly any air swings but lately I'm having air swings on every other shot even though the haptic feedback of the club hitting the ground occurs right behind the ball. The swing mechanics don't seem very realistic, relying more on swinging with your arms rather than your shoulders and hips. In fact I've swung wildly just using my arms and have hit longer and more accurate shots than when I try to swing normally. Short game shots tend to go much further than real life so you find yourself having to hit the ball unrealistically lightly if you're around the green and are only 30m or less from the hole.
The graphics don't match the screenshots either, screenshots look impressive, good detail and lighting but in the VR environment it's like playing a golf game from the 1990s (even with detail settings maxed out). Kind of feels like false advertising.
It's not a bad game, when it works it feels almost like you're out on the course but it's still too buggy at this stage of development.........a few more courses wouldn't go astray either.
--EDIT--
I didn't give this game the chance it deserved, many of the issues above have been resolved mainly through practice and getting a better feel for the game.

I have a couple of caveats, though. First, current-gen VR hardware doesn't have the resolution necessary for a realistic golf game.

Having already played many hours in the original game The Golf Club, I knew what to expect - for the most part - but the VR aspect was exciting, particularly as an avid RL golfer myself.

So far, the game hasn't disappointed at all.

[b]TL&DR[/b] - For a quick rundown, the VR game places just like (well, for the most part) the original non-VR TGC.  In addition, the game links up with the main TGC game as well, so all of the courses available in the original TGC you can find, and play, in TGCVR.  The immersion is really good, the gameplay is very good, and it's just all around fun.  What's more, like others have said below, if you play golf IRL, those skills do transfer over - and not just the good skills, but also the bad (I still... STILL... hook the ball off the tee with the driver...).

[b]In-Depth Review[/b] - For those of you who enjoy golf and have a Vive or Oculus, you simply cannot beat this.  To be able to play a round whenever you like without having to leave the house is great (naturally, however, I'd still prefer to be out playing IRL when possible - but this is such a close second).

Graphics - the graphics for the Oculus are really good; I have mine cranked to maximum (2x normal) and it looks really smooth and plays great (I have a rig that can handle that however).

Gameplay - I could get very detailed here, but I'm going to focus instead on the VR mechanics specifically.  The interface is a lot different from the original TGC... there is no ""hud,"" etc.  Most of the menu items are there, you just have to navigate to them differently.  When selecting a course to play, it's not quite as easy to find courses as in the original TGC, mostly because the menu doesn't show a ""list"" like the original - instead it shows a picture of the course and it's name (which means there's fewer courses in view).  You can search for a course just like normal, but it's a bit clunky as you use an in-game keypad to type your search criteria.  What I've done is simply favorite all the course I play that I like - easy to find them again.

In regard to the standard ""hud"" information, like distance to the pin, the winds, elevation, etc., that can be found on your ""wristwatch.""  You simply hold up your wrist a turn it like you're looking at a watch and the data shows up.  In addition, once you've struck a ball, you can hold up your wrist and click the button on the handle of the Touch to see the distance your shot went - it even grades you on your shot (the grade consists of several factors - impact, distance, and the lie once the ball stops).  It will also show you the speed of your swing, which is nice (apparently my swings hover between the 72-78 mph range).

If you hold down the handle button on the Touch while you swing, it will ""record"" your swing so you can turn and see a graphical indication of how the club head traveled on the takeaway all the way through to impact, and it will show you the angle and location of the club at impact as well.  This is really, really helpful, particularly to newer players.

Picking clubs is actually rather cool.  To pick up a club, you simply teleport to your bag (or walk, if you're play area is big enough), reach into your bag, hold the Touch over the club you want, and click the trigger.  Options exist to allow you to have to hold the trigger to keep the club in your hand, or just press the trigger once to grab it, and later a second time to drop it.  As an amusing afterthought, you can hit the club bag with what ever club you have in your hand to knock it over, spilling your clubs everywhere if you're on a slope.

Taking a shot is just like taking one IRL.  Address the ball, line up and aim, and swing.  The swing mechanics are very touchy, and if you don't swing correctly, you're ball will hook, slice, skip across the grass (if you top the ball), etc. - just like with real golf.

After a shot, you use one of the Touch's buttons (B) to teleport to your ball (your clubs automatically follow you).  You can alternatively use A to teleport where ever you want (literally - you can't teleport into water though).  A note on the greens - again, if you have a play area that is big enough, you can walk completely around your putting area and look closely at the path to the cup... it really helps when putting.

In addition, you can get a bird's eye view of the hole by reaching behind you in-game and grabbing the yardarge booklet, which will show you a top down view of the hole with yardage notations of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yards from the pin.  This is really handy, particularly with holes where the pin is obscured either by trees or a hill in the fairway - unlike TGC, there is no ""zoom"" feature that allows a flyover of the hole out to the distance of the selected club.

All these mechanics work very good with the Oculus Touch; as I said above, it's a great experience and a lot of fun to play.

[b]Cons[/b] - The only cons are what other's have said - just a couple of which I'll reiterate here, touching specifically upon Oculus and the Oculus Touch.

The first is the setup of your play area.  For me I had to set my default view 90 degrees to the left (my computer is on the right of my desk) because if I didn't the wire that connects the Oculus to the system got in the way every time I swung.  I don't know if this is the cause of my issues or not (in my case, it means one of my sensors is pointing at my right rear instead of in front of me).  But occasionally when I swing the club simply won't strike the ball - or, it'll strike it ""off"" - for example, occasionally my shots will shoot off about 20 degrees to the left, not with a hook, but straight and clean, as if I was aiming that direction.  To be clear, I don't know if this is a tracking issue or an issue with my setup - so keep that in mind.

However, as another user has said, when using the Protee Simulator to practice your swings, the tracking itself does seem off.  I couldn't even get the driver to make contact with the ball... all the other clubs worked okay though, but still suffered occasionally from the same issue I described above.

For Oculus users specifically, the Touch is a hit / miss when it comes to ""gripping the club.""  I imagine that Vive users have it better because the Vive controller is longer and it looks like the player can grip it at least somewhat like a club with both hands.  With the Oculus Touch, however, the controller is so small there is no room to grip it with your off-hand.  As a result I end up gripping my right wrist with my left hand (I'm right handed) - which I'm sure contributes some to my off shots.  If there was a controller add-on that could add some length to the Touch for this it would help a lot.

Those things being said though, these are not game changers (unless you take your golf REALLY seriously), and annoyances at best in what is still an excellent, fun game.

Overall, again, for anyone interested in golf that has a Vive or Oculus, you cannot go wrong with The Golf Club VR.",1489203946,1489203970,True,4,0,0.500624239444732666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game hits the balance of fun vs realism nearly perfectly and is so good I am taking the time to write a review for it which is very rare for me to do on any game.

[b]PROS:[/b]
-Overall feel is excellent
-Simple controls that allow you to focus on the round of golf
-club and ball characteristics are way more realistic than I ever thought possible at this early stage of VR.
-FUN!  It is enjoyable like real golf, it is frustrating like real golf and it is replayable.
-Courses are nearly infinite and there are so many good ones from user created that you cannot get bored.
-Sound is exceptional
-Developers care and reply to messages in discussion and reviews to help make the experience better. 

[b]WISHLIST: [/b]
-Of course having something that feels more like a club in your hand would be amazing...the Vive handset is a little to thick to make a normal 2 handed swing so you need to do 1 handed.  With that being said, the devs did a phenomenal job of taking what is available and making it as good as possible.

-commentary could have been fun

-ability to create own courses

-ability to set some targets on the range (distance, bullseyes, etc...)

-ability to change out the 3i and 4i in favor of hybrids

-ability to change the putter style.  The traditional blade has always stunk for me in real life and is true to form here!

Honestly, I can't call anything a true con, just the wishlist above.

Topping, slicing, shanking, numerous air-hits, followed by that manic, overbalanced clubbing which so often results in one being corkscrewed into the ground. Oh, and let's not forget sand-fly fever, contracted from spending so much time in bunkers. It's all here, your lack of skill, indolent posture and flaky swing, all writ large, validated in code and preserved for posterity in your scorecard hall of shame...

HOWEVER, in other news, what a game! What a bloody-minded, niggardly, haughty, flirty, discourteous fish-wife of a game. Those of you with the same dogged persistence and catalogue of ruined Sunday afternoons behind you will know what I mean. The course is there to be beaten of course, it never dangles too far out of reach, it merely requires a better class of player than you will ever be. But, on the right day, with the right club and sufficiently garish flannels, with that crushed drive soaring, arrow-straight, climbing, climbing, climbing into the azure sky... You are familiar, dear aspirant golfer, with the same trouser-tickle of achievement, the same dopamine hit that rivals any amount of luck at the roulette wheel. And, with the same unfailing regularity, the next spin will be a dud and the house wins. But this time it was different and - who knows? - next time may be different too.

In other words, this is not a golfing simulacrum that permits one to attain, by a nurturing of benevolent algorithms and digital hand-holding, the handicap of your dreams. It *is* of course possible to choose the easy settings and take the shortcut to wish-fulfilment, but if you are one of those people who can do that and still look at yourself in the clubhouse mirror afterwards, by all means go for it. Be aware though that it will be implicitly understood by the rest of the golfing fraternity that you number among those few laughable, Quixotic golfing mountebanks who routinely drop zeros from their scorecards and kick Titleists from the undergrowth with nary a pang of conscience. Enjoy your victory, Pyrrhic as it may be...

For the rest of us, keep the faith and understand the nature of the word 'addiction' in its truest sense, as your correspondent, at this very moment, prepares to slather deep heat on a pulled shoulder and cinch a lumbar support to its tightest setting in order to play another round. Pain is relative, while handicap is absolute. But one thing I know, when stepping up to the tee, full of codeine and misplaced optimism, this time, it's gonna be different...

This game lets me play amongst palm trees in March in my Colorado basement in slippers and shirt sleeves. I have no idea if this is going to help my real life golf game, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.

I found the mechanics of the game intuitive and simple to master. I love the swing evaluator, course selection, scenery, sounds and physics of the game. Chipping feels like chipping. The driver is hard to use because drivers are hard to use. I played 36 holes yesterday and am a little stiff this morning like I played 36 holes of golf yesterday. It just FEELS real.

User submitted courses make the course selection awesome and full of rich, diverse places to play, each with their own weather conditions and challenges. I played one round in winter and I was given yellow golf balls for the snow to add to the realism.

Multiplayer might make the game more fun for people who like to play in groups. A golf 'pro' to explain why my swing score was an 'F' on that last swing and of course a 'babe' in a beer cart might add value to the game.

On high resolutions I found it best to restart my PC between 18 hole games to prevent graphics glitches and to ensure smooth gameplay in later games. I also found it best to have a play space where the paddles cannot be masked from the sensors by your body and where you have enough room for a real life, full golf swing.

What I didn't bank on was that this game so accurately depicts your swing that it can be used as a training aid for the real game. 
My real game isn't the greatest, in fact I cannot use drivers or woods because I always hook or slice the ball quite badly. Using the shot analysis in game, I found that my back swing and transition into the forward swing was much too fast and I was losing the club quite a lot resulting in my hooks and slices.
I slowed down my back swing considerably and BINGO, I was hitting those drivers down the middle of the fairway.
Now, I havn't has a chance to practice the slower backswing on a real golf course yet but when I do I will let you know if it has solved my problem.

But, had to for this. If (like me) you feel like you are lacking long lasting experiences in VR, get this! It will help if you enjoy Golf of course. If you've played IRL, skills actually transfer. But, it really needs a golf grip/vive tracker controller as the standard controllers are obviously the wrong shape and induce club head control issue simply because you can't get your hands where you would normally. But, it doesn't take long to adapt your grip to work around this.

I've had this from Early Access, and found myself playing this for several hours each time I loaded it up.

And now, with full release, performance issues are not a problem any more (note I'm on a GXT1080 and run steamvr at 2.0 ss, with in game detail at high), swing tracking is definitely better as well.

Minor suggestion/gripe:
Although I haven't fully inspected the full release, so this may be in there, I would like to be able to choose a ball type to ""tune"" backspin. At one point during the early access changes, backspin was too pronounced and a real pain to keep the ball on the green as it would accelrate back off the surface everytime. Now, I don't seem to be able to induce any backspin at all.

You will get your £23 worth out of this if you enjoy golf.

Obviously, ensure you have space to make swings, you will hit things in your room hard if you do not and USE THE WRIST STRAP!

The only thing I would really like to see is a local player-versus-player option. Hopefully set up like Cloudlands where each player can finish the hole before switching the headset.

Just teleporting around the landscape is tons of fun. They could probably build an RPG or FPS using the environment and it would be incredible.

The physics and UI are also done very top notch. I'm not a golfer so setting it to easy mode is just like a premium arcade golf simulator. Setting it to a higher difficulty makes it much more realistic though.

This game is hands down the best VR game I have played, with Audioshield currently in second. If you are a golf fan like I am, you would absolutely love this and play it for hours and hours. I will admit, I struggled at first to make solid contact with the ball (as have my friends that have played), but once you get the hang of it you will find that you cannot stop playing.

The big con on here, however, is green speeds. The greens are just insanely fast on this game for some reason. Approach shots, chipping, and putting can be very frustrating. A perfect approach shot that lands on the front of the green will manage to roll all the way off the back end of the green. The difference in speed from the fringe and green is also unbalanced. Normally, putting from the fringe is the common route in real life. However, I've found that chipping with a loft wedge from the fringe (which most would never do in real life) is the best way to go in this. 

With that said though, those are the only cons I've experienced in this game. The developers are great on updating the game and improving it. So hopefully green speeds (which I can't imagine being difficult to change) will be reduced at some point.

That was my primary concern when I was researching this game.  I had played Cloudland Mini Golf and found that at least when it comes to putting the use of the Vive controller is sufficiently convincing.  But how would that translate to a full golf swing without the use of a full club?  As it turns out quite well.  Granted the feel of the weight of the club isn't there but the mechanics of the swing are still the same.
  It's extremely enjoyable to be able to play a round of golf without needing to leave my house and without the annoyance of searching for my ball every time it leaves the fairway.  This is especially useful during an Ohio winter when the cold makes golfing outside a bit miserable.
  I'm very excited to see how the upcoming Vive Tracker adds to this experience.  Using an actual club will certainly enhance the experience.
  The only problem I've run into so far is when I hit the ball off a cliff on the insanely challenging Pacific Jewel course.  The drop zone ended up being the side of a nearly vertical cliff face.  This left me in a bit of a dilemma as no matter where I dropped the ball it would simply fall into the water.

——说到手柄的握感，未来说不定会有专门的外设，不过重量什么的和真杆也肯定有很大差别。毕竟室内挥杆还是挺危险的。
系统操作的引导很细致，每个细节都照顾到位了。而且增加了很多辅助功能，比如手伸向球杆，会出现一个虚拟屏幕来提示球杆信息。转动手腕可以看到一个智能手表提示风速和距离。最赞的是有挥杆轨迹分析和对比，包括击球点的分析等，这个是现实里很难享受到的了。
可能唯一的不足就是对高尔夫本身并没有太多的指导。对于完全零基础的新人来说可能会比较困难。
当然游戏也提供了纯属娱乐的初学者模式，系统会给出预判的飞行轨迹和落点，锁定以后只需要挥杆就可以百分百落到预判的位置。为了体验高尔夫本身的玩家肯定不会选择这个模式，但是对于不会打的玩家还是挺有娱乐性的。（我自己还没玩过这个模式，只是看说明是这个意思）
话说回来，要想在这么高还原度的模拟游戏里保证精确性，还是要求玩家本身经过教练的现场训练才可以。光靠游戏里的引导要想把动作做到位我看不太现实。所以干脆直接跳过了高尔夫本身的指导部分，也就还是可以理解了。
游戏风景做得不错，因为脱离了现实的束缚，很多场景可以做到很有想象力。比如一个人在大海中的一座孤岛上打球，洞在几百码外的另一个孤岛上什么的。时不时还会有巨型鲸鱼来到海面。现实里要玩儿这个场地怕是困难多多。
总得来说很有诚意的游戏，是目前玩过的最好的高尔夫模拟。推荐有一定基础的玩家入手。
BTW，用习惯的握球杆的方式握手柄真的很痛苦，因为还得按住扳机保证球杆不掉。但要是不用习惯的握法挥杆的时候又觉得别扭。希望这个点可以修改一下，做到拿起球杆后可以自动锁定什么的，要不按扳机真的累。",1485692279,1485692487,True,3,0,0.526944577693939209,0,True,False,True,False,,,

In the most recent version of the game, I frequently get a studder on my club animation while swinging which radically effects the resulting shot - most noticable on finesse chips and putts that will be (again radically) short or long.  With my competative mind set, I feel cheated every time this happens, and makes it very difficult to finish rounds without quitting the game in disgust.  Worth noting I've tried some changes with my VR setup for better results, nothing yet.  Other VR games are running flawlessly.

edit: In earlier versions of the game I occasionally ran into this performance issue, but now it happens multiple times per round.  The effect on putts and chips makes this game umplayable for me.

Golf Grades (again - my experience - it seems like different people really have different experiences with the motion tracking and club success in this game).

Driver:  F- , Yes, F minus - Driver to me is one of the easiest shots in golf (real golf).  not THE easiest, but one of.  It is a single repeatable swing, with a huge faced club, on a ball teed way up.  For the life of my, I can't hit driver in this game.  Half the time I see the club head go right through the ball, the other half I get wildly inconsistent results.  It is a worthless club to me in this game.  I use 3I as my driving club.  How in the world can 3i be so easy to hit off the tee an driver is not?

Fairway Woods:  F   I can hit these just slightly better than driver, and so?  though I've tried, and tried, and tried... again, not useful clubs for me to use.

Irons:  C   For me, a full swing iron can end up 30 yards short, 20 yards long, sometimes correct... but I have no idea why shots are ending up where they do after 100's (probably 1000's) of swings.

Chipping:  D   Ultimatly I ask, does this game provide the finesse around the green with wedges that the pros play with?  The answer is a resounding: NO!  Not even close - and the greens in this game require incredible finesse in order to score.  Chipping (in this game) has this kind of robotic land and predictable release that is unnatural.  Combine this with percentage ranges based on bad lies (like a 60-80% contact in deep rough)?  The result of a chip may have very little to do with your skill, and more to do with a lucky (or unlucky) contact%, and an unnatural rollout.  Can a good chip be hit?  Yes, especially with a good lie - and with the short roll out you always have a chance for a chip to roll in the hole (if your on the correct line).  But I would Way rather have more control of spin options, so that with practice I could roll out, stop the ball, or backspin.  This is the type of control needed to score on some of the very challenging greens in this game.  Chipping has been further harmed (for me) with occasional chips that go way further or way shorter than expected.

Putting:  A, when it works.   Occasional random results can have a short putt getting bashed through the hole and 10+ feet on your next putt...  this type of result in a golf game is beyond frustrating - its a game killer.  I feel the hole edge is a bit unforgiving (you really have to get a lot of the hole, and at correct speed to make putts), and putting certain hole locations on fast greens can be unfair (3 and 4 putts with good attepts is not uncommon). 

Video Game Grades
Graphics  C  - while it is impressive how the entire golf course is there in real time, the actual visuals are average.
Sound C  - I feel sound could have been a real benefit to this game in terms of building the environment and letting the player know about wind/ wind direction.  Sound is very average, and really adds very little to the overall presentation beyond the necessary swing noises and such.
Control  D  -   I'm running into a lot of issues, and have to mark this down accordingly.
Fun Factor  F  - Until I can play a clean game with consistency - playing this game is more a test of patience than fun.

edit:  my review has done a 180 since early access - because it plays a worse game of golf than it did in earlier versions.  Clubs like driver and fairway woods did not improve in how they are balanced.  My consistency with irons, wedges and putter have gotten worse with extended play.  This is not a ringing endorcement for a game where you  want the ability to find a groove and have fun playing golf.

Pros:  
 
- The closest thing to real golf that I have ever experienced in a video game.

- Interface is smart and unobtrusive.  Pull the course map out of your back pocket, look at your wrist to see distance to hole, elevation change, wind direction.

- Simulation feel:  Feels like the PC version of The Golf Club only now in virtual reality.  My first couple holes I was swinging very hard and robotic( a problem I have in real life golf) and my shots were all over the place.  Once I slowed down my tempo and started a relax swing I started getting closer to par.

- Sinking a ten foot put in the game is just as satisfying as in real life.  

-  Really fun to play if you like real life golf.

Cons:

- performance is a little bad on a 970, but there are so many technologies implemented and cross talking that I am not sure who to blame.  It is hard to judge how all the different technologies will work together, between OculusSDK, ASW, ATW, OpenVR, SteamVR, SteamVR reprojection there are bound to be some issues.  It is playable but it gets a little choppy.

- a few minor bugs:  Sometimes the drop zone is too close to the water.  Sometimes the ball is too close to an obstruction to get a swing off(might be user error).  The map bugged after the 6 hole, every hole after that only showed the 6th hole map.

- Controls work pretty well but could use some optimization for the rift.  Specifically the button that selects.  In the rift the capacitive button that is mapped to ""select"" picks up a button touch when it should probably only pick up a button push.


Overall:

If you have a Rift of Vive and like golf, this is a must buy.

This is my first review ever. I'll make it short and sweet....

Takes a little getting used to, but man is it compelling. I played a round of real golf earlier today, and although its not true to life golf, it's the next best thing. 

The Oculus Touch controllers are a litte wonky, due to it being otpimized for Vive, but it's not horrible. The menus and the sensitivity of the buttons on the Touch controllers take some finess. You also have to swing much harder than in real golf. I can drive 280-315 yards IRL, but in game I have to swing my ass off to hit 250. Putting and chipping feels satisifying.

Can't wait to get more practice.... This will be a daily game for me.

It's basically the best VR golf experience you're going to get at this point. When they first released it, I loved it.

I do like the improvements they've made since its initial pre-release. I wish the course map had your distance to the hole listed on it. As it is, you have to hold down on the d-pad and bring up the watch to see your distance remaining. The game really needs to add DRIVING RANGE and not that island you hit out to during the tutorial.

I've played 18 holes twice, both a little rushed as I had other things to do, but this is an undeniably impressive experience so far.  It's super satisfying to finally hit a decent drive or sink a long putt, just like the rare occasions I do so IRL.

If you have any interest in the game of golf, you have to at least give it a whirl.  It's not the real thing, but it's a heck of a lot closer than I ever expected it to be, even in EA.  

The one gripe is the performance.  I have a beefy system with a core i7, 16gb ram, and a gtx1080 and can't bump up from the lowest settings without stutter.

to start, I was dabbling in this game the night I got home from some drinks downtown. 
I couldnt believe I was about to finally have my wish of vr realistic golf. from the start it was mind blowing. I was a little tipsy so I played off the extremely fast pga speed greens for my inebriation. Then poof, an update comes out that fixes the insane green speed almost a week later. Poof! an update comes out that gives you more customization of your club and the stiffness you prefer. 
(hmmm I wonder if they would take a request for some sort of zoom or distance increase to see the approach shot a little better, POOF A GOD DAMN RANGE FINDER! 

The support from the devs from day one to Feb 23rd was absolutely world class. they not only responded to almost every single question asked (if it hadnt already been answerd by one of us)
but they addedrequested features sometimes almost bi weekly. I watched a very good start of a golf vr sim turn into a full fleged polished simulator in the matter of months, not years. along the way the devs have asked for feedback and even played rounds with you if the time was available. 

at first optimization was a little rough but it was such an ambitious game that I didnt bat an eye to it. at the time of this review, high end systems are basking in maxed out pure links heaven. My rig can run low with most sliders cranked up (msaa, AA) with no problem. this is the only game I own thats made me want to upgrade to a 1080 just to enjoy at full potential.

The developers have stuck with it and polished this into a very playable state. My main original complaint was of a purely technical nature, but now running on a 1070, there's the occasional slight judder, but nothing that makes it unplayable.

Super Pros:

Club Throwing simulator with no real world consequences 3000

Pros:

Essentially this is a really well thought out and playable golf sim in VR, exactly the game you want to use to show your dad VR. Lots of good courses, well thought out mechanics and UI for VR gameplay, and developers that are dedicated to making sure it works well.

Cons:

Very few at this point. Some graphical glitches can be frustrating (flickering, especially with swing playback), and bringing up swing playback sometimes fail for no obvious reason. Additionally, the greens are made of ice covered with whatever made hover cars go faster in F-Zero, which can make putting something of an exercise in frustration (hey just like real golf!).

Original Review:

Could be a lot of fun if it was remotely playable. GTX 1070

Pros:
Lots of attention to details in room scale interaction, feels like a well thought out effort.
A real golf game, not just some VR cash in

Cons:
Performance is absolutely abysmal, rendering the game completely unplayable. I'm seeing some of the worst ghosting I've ever seen if I even move my head a fraction, borderline nausua inducing.

Bottom line, I'd love to give this game a shot, and feel like I'd enjoy it, but as things stand it's unplayable.",1479169593,1486691579,True,0,0,0.484652668237686157,6,True,False,True,False,,,

First of all - this game is fantastic.  In general, I'm blown away by how well it is done even in it's very early state.  As best I can tell, there's no detail that the dev team hasn't already thought about and most of these are already implemented into the game.  I think this is a game change and it fills a void for sim lovers who either don't have the space or the desire to do a full simulator setup.  Unfortunately this has likely ruined 2D golf for me.  I'm sure I'll still play 2D titles but this has far exceeded my expectations.

The game was just recently updated to include ""sticky clubs"" so that you no longer have to hold the trigger in order to hold the club in your hand.  So my thoughts below will be based on this new update since it has improved several things that were causing me some minor issues before.

Graphically - I guess it's better than expected given all the warnings I received about how VR graphics aren't great at the moment.  I think there's still some optimization to do but the fact that it's so immersive kinda overcomes any shortfalls on graphical fidelity.  This isn't an HBS issue though - it's more of the current state of this newer technology.

Immersion - this is where it's at with this game.  I can't say enough great things about it.  From the watch (which tells you the direction to the pin, wind direction, distance to the pin, stroke count, etc) to the course map in your back pocket to the golf bag it's just SO immersive.  A few cool things here:

1 - stepping over to your bag to grab your club is awesome.  There's just something cool about this that never gets old.
2 - when you find yourself at the bottom of a hill and you need to see what's up ahead so you can plan your shot, you just teleport ahead (or walk if it's a short enough distance) and take a look around.  Pick out a reference point in the distance as your aiming point, go back to your ball and take your shot.  Very realistic and very well implemented.
3 - hills, slopes, etc all work as expected.  If the ball is above my feet I have to adjust my swing both in terms of aim and in terms of club length.
4 - overall depth perception and changes in elevation are great.
5 - reaching into your bag for a ball when you need to take a drop.  Awesome.  They could've just made this a menu item but I'm glad they went the route that they did.
6 - gridless putting is WAY better than you'd think and better than anything in TGC or JNPG.  More on this later.

The swing.  The bad news on the swing is that it DOES require some adjustment from your normal real life golf swing.  I'm 98% certain that this is due to the total lack of weight (and proper distribution of weight in particular) when using the controller as your ""club.""  If you've played a lot of golf in real life then it will be an adjustment.  For some it seems to be a pretty wild adjustment and for others not so much.  If you don't play much real life golf then it probably won't matter.  I will say that with the latest update where you are no longer required to hold the trigger to hold your club, it makes for a MUCH more natural swing and has alleviated most of my issues with the swing interface.  Prior to this update I had to address the ball with a massively closed club face in order to ensure that my club face was square on impact.  Now I do not have to do this.  I also had to address the ball with the ball lined up on the toe of the club in order to hit it in the center of the club on my downswing.  This is no longer required.  I think now that I can hold the controller with a normal golf grip things are falling more into line with my normal swing.

The act of swinging the club in this game is fantastic!!  Just like in real life I know when I hit a bad shot without even looking at the result.  And just like in real life I have to concentrate to execute a good shot.  I've also learned that, just like in real life, if I take a practice swing (even a shortened version to ensure that my takeaway motion and follow through motions are clean) that I have much better success.  In other words - this is NOT some hokey arcade VR swing.  It's a true swing and it tracks VERY accurately.

There is no shot shaper.  You ARE the shot shaper and it works wonderfully.  I can hit any sort of shot that I can hit in real life.  

Short game - awesome.  Can't say enough good things here.  From off the green I can use my 7 iron to hit a bump and run or I can use my lob wedge or sand wedge to chip the ball.  On Casual mode (next to easiest difficulty) there is a power boost that's built into the game (this reduces in amateur mode and it goes away all together on Pro mode) and it will be obvious if you try to bump and run with a 7 iron.  But the mechanics are there and it's done VERY well.  The only issue currently is that there is too much spin on the lob wedge.  They know this and are fixing it.  But I can either close the face down a bit and hit a sharp little pitch at the pin or I can open up the face a bit and hit a loftier shot that carries further but bites harder.

Putting - awesome.  I think they have NAILED putting.  It can feel odd to putt with little to no weight and this can also cause your club head to move around a bit more (harder to control a straight motion) but once you get used to it, it's awesome.  But where putting REALLY shines is when you turn the grids off.  Holy moly!  The greens are every bit as readable as they are in real life.  I simply teleport to about 3-4 feet behind my ball, crouch down and start reading the greens.  Then, while still squatting down, I teleport up a little to read other areas as needed.  I plan my putt, teleport back to the ball and execute.  And, for me... it's spot on, dead accurate.  Playing without grids in TGC VR is the most immersive thing I've ever experience in a video game.  Drain a 20 footer for par (or better) and you'll be fist pumping like a mofo.

Things that aren't so great.

1 - Fairway bunkers.  EVERY single time you land in a fairway bunker you are penalized by roughly 50%.  So the best you can do is blast out into the fairway and drop a shot.  The devs are aware and are addressing this.
2 - Graphics but this isn't an HBS issue as much as it is a limitation of the hardware.  Although I think there is still some optimization left to be done and I know they are looking into this constantly.
3 - The setup.  VR with today's technology simply requires you to jump through a few hoops.  You've got to get your base stations mounted, you've got this huge contraption on your head with a long bundle of chords leading to your PC, etc.  It takes me about 5 minutes to setup and about 5 minutes to clean up afterwards.  With 2D golf, I just grab my controller and take off - no real setup time at all.

Things that have blown me away:
1 - The dev interaction on the steam forums.  Superb and professional
2 - The immersion of the game and the attention to details by the dev team in producing this product
3 - Putting and short game accuracy
4 - Game interface.  It could've been clunky and awkward.  Nope.  Everything flows and before you hit your 3rd hole of your first ever round you'll be comfortably navigating around without giving it a second thought.
5 - The difficulty and the clear fact that this is a sim and not an arcade game.  I haven't broken 90 yet and I'm still on casual level.  I'm a 13 handicap IRL.  Some may say that the game is harder than real life and in some aspects it's true but the more I play the better I'm getting and I expect to see more parity between my real life golf scores and TGC VR scores over time.

In general - I couldn't be more pleased.  This is probably the single best video game experience I've ever had and it's just the beginning.  BUY THIS GAME!!",1478280053,1478280053,True,50,3,0.837123751640319824,2,True,False,True,False,,,

If you have never tried Golf, but would like to actually do so, I'm not sure this here is the best idea, as no one will help you, there is no real golf trainer explaining everything to you, so you will get frustrating results, because ""swing mechanics"" and ""physics"" are quite close to reality from my point of view. 

So  you should already know, which club to play when, how to consider wind and most of all to keep that perfect swing. 
The Graphics are nice on ""middle setting"", it all looks ok. On ""high settings"" they look fairly good but my 780Ti creates some stuttering then. Mid level is still good enough to absolutely enjoy this game. 
Whoever owns a 1080 may certainly go to highest settings.

I love this game, I was really blown away by the presence feeling it creates. Once my back is not aching anymore, I will definitely be on those VR courses again to hunt the eagles and birdies.

Pros:
- Imersive environment
- decent physics (ball distance is short)
- realistic golf feel
- putting is very nice
- huge growth potential

Cons:
- must hold trigger to hold club - makes for akward grip
- graphics performance is poor (1060, 16gb, i7)
- shot distance is about 50% of real life. 
- accidental ball hits at adress (need on your honor muligans)
- no multiplayer support
- bag is easily knocked over


Suggestions for added features:

- multiplayer
- various club sets to include hybrids, different putters, etc. 
- more detailed swing analysis
- add driving range and practice area
- enter actual club length and player height 
- a golf cart would actually be really cool!

If there was a way to integrate this into a launch monitor like the GC2, Trackman, SkyTrak, etc then the ball flight physics would be improved and this could be more of a simulator quality. adding some hardware options for clubs would be great to increase the feel of the game.

Kudos to the developers.  This game came a surprise to me as I have been intently looking for new Vive games since picking up the Vive a couplpe of months ago.  Announcing.. then three days later.. BAM  The best damn golf game on the Vive yet and more than likely for a long time.

After playing TGC on 'Flat' Screen, I never expected to see this in VR.

PROS...  IMHO
Accurate depiction of what it feels like to be 'on the course'
ball flight and physics are great
Being able to pull a club from your bag wonderful!
Course design of the three available EA courses, are fun to play and well thought out.
Free roam Via Teleport...  Brilliant idea!  Love it!
Gives you the same frustrations of hitting a bad shot as in RL

CONS
Sometimes it is hard to hit the ball if it is in a crevice or lip of a mound or something...
Could do with a little better sound design...  to immerse the player in the VR environment a little better (More SFX or variation therof)
only three courses so far, though it is only the first week and I am looking forward to more courses being available next week and into the future...
No multiplayer..   I give this game 5 stars because sit is simply fantastic and by far my best sport sim experience I have ever had, but if I could wish for one thing, it would be the ability to join a lobby and play with other golfers.  The course feels hella lonely when your trying to play a solid round..  80% of golf is the socialization, and I think to really give the game the potential it deserves would be to bring in MP..

Just my opinions...

If you like golf, this game is a MUST have if you own the Vive...  and.. I believe the price is the best value out of any game yet on the Vive..

Kudos Devs!

Had many holy **** moments, feeling like I was on a course. Even bent my knees in anguish on a few missed putts. Super imersive and the locomotion system is crisp and very functional. I love racing my shot to the green, then watching it drop from the sky with some backspin. Nice.

The amount of time the ball is in the air makes it feel like you crushed the shot, and often you do. Controling your aim and your distance are very challenging but that's good. You want there to be room for improvement and tweaks to your technique. I tried one-handed and two-handed grips. Each seems to have their place. One-handed on full shots, two handed on chips and putts. Would love to see how people grip their controller and would love to see a some small club accessories that hold the Vive controller. 

For the devs: Great work, thank you. Here are a few of my wishes:

-Driving range, chipping green and putting green so you can learn your distances and practice different swing styles.
-A line on the putter head. Would help with alignment.
-A camera option that teleports you to the spot where your ball will end up. Watching a shot land never gets old.
-Save game feature. Don't always have time for 18.
-Online, computer opponent, etc.  Not the highest priority but expected eventually. 
-Option to not have to hold the trigger while you swing. It got tiresome and limited the ways I could grip the controller.
-Show shot distance after each shot, maybe on yardage book, so you can learn your distances better.  

Looking forward to the updates. Keep up the great work!

I’ve played on a fair number of tour courses and to be honest the greens in this game are faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  Still, it looks great. I can run the game effectively on Medium Detail with a 1070, and it looks even better maxxed out, but I get the judder some others have mentioned. Hopefully there are some improvements in the efficiency department, but if not it still is very playable. As a video game it’s pretty darn good, but I think they should bring a club pro, or two, onboard to work with the feel of the game. It’s still early in the development of the game, so I believe this stuff will eventually get worked out.

Some really cool things:
The scoreboard behind the tee lets you see your progress after each hole
The ""watch"" that comes up when you twist your wrist to give you lots of cool info like distance to hole, direction, and even real time and battery of controller.
Pad you can pull out to show you the map of the hole you're on and distances to it.
Teleport around anywhere you want to go to see different views of the hole or just look around.  Then one click to return to the ball in perfect position to take your shot.
Your bag appears right by the ball to pick your club with pop ups of the type and distance you last hit using it.

Performance is fine on Low with my GTX970, jaggies on lots of stuff, but it kind of disappears after a while once you're immersed.  Hopefully they'll be able to optimize more in EA.

Definitely recommend picking up.

It's fun, satisfying, and gives you a good sense of the balance between frustration and fun that makes golf such a great game.

First of all, the sounds and haptic feedback are absolutely great. There are lots of little sounds I didn't even know I wanted in a golf VR game before now. The sounds of the grass as you skim it or pat it with your club are really immersive. The watch on your wrist and the distance book are well designed and actually very useful. The swing mechanics seem very accurate, and seem to reflect real life shot styles well. The putting feel is especially well done. I've done a few full rounds now, and my scores are pretty close to my scores in real life. Just put in a few minutes at the tutorial driving range first, and you'll get a good handle on the swing physics pretty quick.

Honestly, the only negative in this game so far is the poor performance. I have a GTX1070 and I still have to play it on the lowest graphics setting, but I expect that to change as development continues.

I simply cannot wait to play all 130,000+ courses. I'm going to play these 3 courses to death. So, hopefully those come soon.

Excellent tutorial, really polished system overall. I play golf regularly, and taking a swing in game felt so natural. The ball flew exactly as far as I suspected it to based on swing speed and club choice. I attempted a slight slice off the tee with great success. I knocked one into the sand and you really get that feel of having to put a little extra into it to chunk it out of there. Putting was nothing short of majestic, and the short game felt like the real thing. Being able to throw the clubs/bag is a nice touch because just like in real golf you'll constantly feel the need to chuck those things into the nearest lake. 

That being said, the only complaint that I have is the performance of the game. Since we're talking golf, my computer is more the John Daly of the PGA tour as opposed to Tiger Woods, however I've not experienced jutter or frame drops in any game/demo up to this point on my Vive.  Upon firing the game up for the first time the jutter was so bad it would have had lesser men seizing on the floor and vomiting blood. I promptly exited the game, and bumped the setting down to low, and still experienced a pretty significant amount of jutter. At this point it's pretty unplayable for me on my i5 6500 and GTX 1060 even on the low setting, so if you have specs similar to mine you may want to hold off till the frame rate gets lined out.

Also as mentioned in some other reviews this is ""tailor made"" for multiplayer, and would be an amazing experience to get a group together and go out and play on the course.

Overall if the performance is fixed, this is an absolute must have. Physics are spot on, and it's everything you'd want out of a golf game. It's a surreal feeling to swing in VR and see the ball go exactly as you wanted it, likewise knowing you absolutely duffed one and for that to be reflected as well.

The tutorial gets you off to a good start and the controls are intuitive.

Your golf bag is standing just in front of you and you hover your hand over the clubs to make your selection. Initially, the yardage for a club is blank, but once the game knows how far you personally hit that club, it's remembered for next time. One thing I might like to see added in this aspect of the game is the ability to choose to toggle holding the club or map as opposed to having to hold the trigger the whole time.

The map in your back pocket is good for seeing the overall hole and checking distances (the dots are 50 yards apart as a guide). Your watch has handy info, too. Haptic feedback is well-done; you know if you're in the right spot to grab your map and you can feel the ground with the clubhead before you swing.

The teleporting system is nice. You can zip straight to a stance in front of your ball, or choose to walk along the course and take in the scenery. Reviewing your swing in 3D afterwards is pretty cool. It's like it draws your swing with TiltBrush and you can see how smooth you were and how far back the backswing was.

Played just over 2 hours so thought I would share my 2 cents.

Pro's:
They have got the swing and clubs down to a tee. The swing mechanic feels really good and there is a swing review after your shot so you can see your back and forward swing.
The menu system works great, good tutorial and set of options.
Added lots of nice touches such as watch to show you the direction and distance to the flag. You can pick the club bag up and move it, animals (strange animations), sounds the club makes against the ball tells you if its a good shot or not.

Cons:
Performance, performance, performance. I am running it on 1080 with i7 4790K and 16Gb and it needs rear projection on low settings. It seems to be course dependant as played all the courses and the third one was able to play on high settings with no stutter (but rear projection was on all the time)
The greens are like glass and are far too fast. The first course is really bad for this.
The ball physics on the crazy golf section are well off. 
Difficult to make out objects in the distance such as flag, ball in flight. Should have a different indication system.
When the game launches it has a windows menu to select several settings. Means you need to go to desktop each time to set it before the game begins in vr.

Improvements:
Need to see how far you have hit the ball.
Really needs a driving range so you can practice.
Multiplayer is a must!! And not the crap they put in the desktop version.
Graphics need an improvement. Would prefer not to have trees as the antialising just makes everything shimmer.

Final thoughts:
The best golf VR experince you can have at the moment.  It is a dream for golfers, it is like the real thing, nothing more kothing less.Very impressed with the vive integration.

So...FORE!!!!... I played two rounds on two different courses before writing this review and can report that I am about as bad at this as I am at real golf, but I bloody loved every single second of it, for me it is as addictively difficult as the real thing...and I am pretty sure that is a good thing.

Am running a 980Ti and found the highest quality setting produced a laggy framerate, but all looked good for me on the medium setting.

Am really looking forward to continuing to play on other courses and seeing all the tweaks and improvements planned by the developer, I encourage you to support this game and join the community, I think this is a VR keeper you will want to play time and time again.

日本語未対応と書かれていますが一部文字は日本語対応がされています(右利きとかドライバーとか)
当方リアルでゴルフはしないのでリアルに近いかどうかの評価はできませんが非常に爽快感のあるゲームです。
これまでやってきたゴルフゲーによくある力ゲージやら打つ方向の調整やら自動でクラブ変更してくれたりとかありません
パター一つにしてもとても難しいがそれが楽しい(空振りが多発するとちょっとイライラする)
移動はワープ方式とリセットでボール前に移動
不満点を挙げるとするならば
・リセット時のボールとの距離の調整が欲しい
・クラブを持つ場合はトリガーをずっと引いとかないと落としてしまう
・カップの位置がわかりずらい(のろしとか上がってるとわかりやすいかも)
もしかしたら設定できるところがあるけど見つけられてないのかもしれません
まずはクラブの使い分けから覚えていく必要がありそうですね・・・

The graphics are good for VR, I got a 980Ti and use Medium to get stable 45fps retroprojection framerate. I am sure it will improve over time.

I play golf in real life too and I have to say the physics is pretty cool at the moment. My biggest complain is the need to keep the grip button pressed to hit the ball. This is a very poor choice in my opinion as it brings alot of tension in your fingers.
I struggle to make powerful shots so far, I just hit a 200 yards drive compared to what I can hit in real life (around 250 yards, I play stiff Titleist irons). The feeling to ""be there"" on the course is very cool!!
Now, we just need multiplayer in real time like Pool Nation VR does and it will be a great social experience for sure!

So far, this looks promising... let's give these guys a chance :)

To summ it up:

PROS:
-Immersion and the ""be on the course"" feeling
-The bag where you can pick your clubs up
-Physics seems on the good rails
-Seems like we will get a huge library of courses to play on

CONS:
-No ""social"" multiplayer planned ?! Really ?!
-Keeping the grip button pressed to swing is plain horrible
-Quite hard to hit powerful shots (I might get used to it)
-Bag is too close when you teleport to the ball, I feel like I don't have enough space to hit my ball :)
-Performance which will improve I hope",1476892808,1476892966,True,11,1,0.583407342433929443,3,True,False,True,False,,,
