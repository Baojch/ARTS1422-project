Starting over from the beginning of the bounty each time too

And while it certainly has potential for good Co-op play, i would suspect that splitting the scarce resources for upgrades between two or more people, AND having a random upgrade system would result in very unbalanced combat in the confined rooms that they put you in

The game is fun for the first few bounties because its introducing their mechanics and things and you learn how best each class functions, but, once you have literally 30+ enemies in one room against 1 player... you're kinda doomed just to start over - So, it becomes a waste of time IMO

I can't remember how much I paid for this, but I played it a little while before and got bored, returned to play it again some years later, got about an hour of play out of it before I got bored and couldn't be bothered with the slow, clunky combat that has poor hit-boxes and balancing issues. So, whatever i paid for it at the time, I honestly don't think i got my money worth.

Confusingly this is a console game that was accidentally launched on PC instead of consoles.  KB+M controls don't work great because it's not really the kind of game format that suits it, being a console kind of game format.  I wonder how much trouble the marketing/sales guy got in when they asked him how much money it made from the console launch he forgot to do. 

Anyway, while the gameplay looks and feels kind of okay, if a bit clunky and sluggish, the kind of thing console peasants like, they forgot one other thing... content.  The developer was unable to come up with decent level design or game/story flow/plot, so they opted to try to use samey repetitive procgen as a substitute for adding content to the game.  As a result, the game doesn't actually have any content worth mentioning.  Developers must learn that procgen is not content.

I really do. There's two major problems though: co-op is non-existent, and ANY boss with the shield ability is an absolute slog. The difficulty progression is decent, the four player classes have good diversity and each feel fun to play while still holding a specific roll in a hypothetical team. 

Multiplayer doesn't really work, I'm not sure it ever worked. Even on solo, the main gameplay is a delight, if fairly shallow. 

The second and bigger problem, Shield, is an enemy power that gives all enemies one hit of invulnerability against everything except large area stuns. The first introduction to the ""shield"" ability is from an enemy who only spawns once per room instance, and you can hunt the enemy down with extreme prejudice, and no more shields for that room. 

Bosses with the ability can spam it the entire fight while additional enemies spawn about once per 2-3 seconds. Without Shield, the fight is great because you can kill enemies to charge your ultimate, making the fight manageable. With Shield, if you're not focusing directly on the boss, you will be overwhelmed with a hoard of enemies that will ignore your attacks. If the boss ALSO has ""Reflect Damage"" then you're punished for both going after the boss directly, and for waiting for Reflect Damage to fade so that you don't kill your player with their own damage. It absolutely ruins any fun to make it so far only to have the bosses be the least fun part of the game. 

Also, the last 3 Story Mode bosses are guarantied to have Shield, and the last two also have Reflect Damage.",1617910545,1617910637,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

è un roguelike dal carattere molto deciso, sin dal primo istante si avverte la forte componente cyberpunk.
Carino in singleplayer a volte frustrante per la sua difficoltà ma il meglio di se lo da in multiplayer...

Ragazzi organizzatevi con un paio di amici e vedrete che le risate non mancheranno, questo titolo è molto particolare, dovrete superare dei livelli suddivisi in stanze generate casualmente. I nemici sono vari ed ogni uno ha le proprie abilità con punti di forza e punti deboli.
Ogni livello si compone di 4 piani ed ogni piano ha una serie di stanze, completata una stanza si passa a quella successiva (una sorta di mini arena), sono presenti anche stanze speciali che permettono di raccogliere crediti extra.
A fine piano si accede ad una stanza dove si possono acquistare armi, far salire le proprie abilità (solo per lo stage attuale) tutto a suon di crediti e chip. Insomma più uccidi e sei audace, più crediti fai e credetemi servono come il pane.

Bellissima l'idea che il personaggio non si evolve permanentemente, ma ad ogni nuovo stage aumenta la difficoltà. Quindi ogni volta che si affronta un nuovo stage, si fa affidamento alla propria esperienza e bravura.

Nota negativa (ma non necessariamente), per tutte le persone che non amano la sfida, o che non sono in grado di gestire la frustrazione, non consiglio questo gioco. 
Insomma se si muore si ricomincia lo stage da capo, i compagni possono resuscitarti, ma si ritorna a 1 punto vita e se tutta la squadra muore... game over!

Io amo questo stile di gioco mi riporta ai vecchi arcade dove se perdi... perdi.
Quindi devi essere bravo e basta.

Unless you have a solid group of veteran friends (3+ players) you're going to really struggle. That's fine, but I certainly cannot recommend this game to 90% of players. My most successful playthroughs were when I played very conservatively - I don't know about you, but that is not enjoyable in a hack-and-slash genre game. There was no real room for finesse, because the gameplay mechanics were visually confusing and inconsistent with each other.

I feel it's only fair to complain about this game -- please see complaints below :)

My biggest gripe with this game is the visual representation of what the game thinks is happening. In other words, what you see on screen doesn't always show what is truly happening. This is a massive problem when a single mistake or misjudged action can have big consequences. For example:
- you can get hit by a swinging axe that doesn't actually collide with your character model (only the circle on the floor around your character);
- enemies' melee swings don't hit other enemies (which is confusing since projectiles do);
- you take huge damage from explosive projectiles that hit the other side of walls (and impenetrable objects);
- many of the ranged enemies' shoot animations seem to fire slightly ""too soon;"" and
- gun-totting enemies' melee-swings can hit you well after any forward momentum has stopped.

These things are visually confusing, yet in a game where a single mistake can kill you it is vital that I can rely on what I see on my screen, and a consistent AI logic.

Another big issue for me is that the game mechanics are not intuitive and often are not consistent with each other. Since so much of the game is spent waiting for an opportunity to hit an enemy, I want to be able to rely on the combat logic. For example;
- melee swings don't do friendly-fire, but projectiles do;
- you can trigger a landmine while incapacitated on the ground;
- grabbing a cliff-edge cancels your Ultimate ability;
- bazooka enemies can suddenly appear and fire 1-2 seconds later (there is no object permanence here);
- the interface doesn't show how many more spawns are in a room (yet it does for a boss room);
- the boss rooms seem completely out of pace with the rest of the game;
- explosives hit you from the other side of a wall, yet armor-peircing sniper projectiles don't.

A few more quick things that made the gameplay worse are:
- The 'quick restart' option doesn't give me my starting items loadout:
- you can get stuck on walls very easily; and
- every enemy attack animation is painfully long, which means that half the game is spent standing out of melee range, waiting to keep fighting.

It started good and enjoyed it, but after a few hours is really boring and with a lot of issues at the end.
First of all on single player it's sooo hard even on Easy. After so many tries and tries and tries, the levels and all the game is the same thing again and again. The truth is I didn't expect something different than that, but if you think that you can complete all the achievements then you have to complete all the levels with all the characters. And that's not the bad thing. The bad thing is that the achievements are not stackable which means that you have to complete the game with all the characters on normal to get those chivos, and for the hard difficulty to play AGAIN the game. Really devs? Really??? For what? To make a game that needs triple the time to complete it and makes you think is a big game? I don't think so! After so many hours trying to finish on hard and realizing that I need to play it again on normal, it was a real pain in the a$$!!!
But that's not all... There are problems on achievement tracking system and also the save becomes glitchy so many times. I went till level 7 with a character and started from the beginning again, because the chivo track system, was stuck on level 3, TWICE! And I could't just repeat the level on the same save because in my save file it looks that I complete the achievement proccess till level 7! That made me keep a backup of my save every time I finish a bounty level from the fear that my save will become glitchy again.
But still that's not all. The chivos and the ingame unlocks are glitchy too!
I unlocked the achievement who needs to electrocute 6 enemies with one grenade and at the same time I got notification that I unlocked the golden electro-grenade ingame. Nope! Inside the stats, it's still locked because it ask to electrify 7(!) enemies at the same time! Tried to start a new save to get it, but seems that the save files are depending also to the achievements you unlocked already. So after a new save game, it start to show unlocked... locked weapons and skins, LMAO. I got the achievement but not the unlockable and I'll never will because that stupid mechanics the game has to save your progress.

Some positives for this game is the soundtrack. I loved it!
NewRetro tracks from Daniel Deluxe, Zombie Hyperdrive, Tokyo Rose and Dynatron. After a while it was repeatable and kinda boring to listen to it again and again the same tracks for hours but still, the soundtrack is TOP for this title.
Another plus is the couch co-op which makes the game so fun. If you're playing alone, find something better to do. If you have another friend and play on the same screen, is so fun!

The enemy design does start to break and become unfun and frustrating towards the end, especially with every boss encounter being a dps race before you've overrun by mobs with shields. That said, in my 3-man we found surmounting that challenge fun and wished there was more to do after we beat the game and its various game-modes.

Make sure you try Warzone (the revamped Free Hunt), it's much more fun and engaging than the campaign (albeit, little semblance of progression in Warzone, so you'll likely spend less time there overall).

I can also second that game does perform slightly poorer than you'd expect, with lower frames and memory leak issues not found in much more demanding games. Crashes only happened if we played for a few hours straight.

This game is skill based, fast paced and based on trying to learn enemy patterns. Fun for about an hour but then you see that: 

- You need to play with other people so that they can revive you. On single player you can not use the respawn feature which makes the game almost impossible since you need to get to the end of the floors without dying and you only have a bit of life and rare chances to restock on health. 
- Enemies get heavily recycled and you mostly get the same enemies with color variations just popping in. Remember Dragon Age 2? Yes, that kind of popping in from nowhere.
- No progression system/ useful unlockables. Basically between floors you just get some rank (nicknames basically) but you don't get new skills, abilities, objects, anything. This coupled with the fact that you have only 4 characters with the same abilities means that you will always be using the same ones without any variation from start to finish.

If you want a good single player Rogue-Like with tones of variation, try Hand of Fate 1 and 2 or Ziggurat.

但從結論來說不算很推這遊戲，幾個問題點如下

1.角色特性不夠明顯，但強弱差距太大：
相較於胖子散彈射程較長、特殊攻擊有放倒效果且有護盾擋傷害效果、自帶護盾背包還可以把人撞下洞裡；
電棒人普攻超慢、依賴的大絕機槍塔AI低落血量又少傷害低射速又差；
拳擊手就更是慘上加慘，起手血量角色中最少，攻速雖然可以快(要自己狂點超蠢)，攻擊力非常之弱，重點是射程超級短，特殊攻擊沒有放倒效果、降防也只有一次攻擊有用，雖然衝刺效果是瞬移(可穿越障礙物)，但能使用的次數及恢復速度沒比別隻角色快，然後廢到笑的大絕，距離短到爆炸、傷害低落、持續時間短就算了，如果開了大絕掛牆壁會瞬間讓大絕消失，廢物中的廢物。

2.多人遊玩不能選同角色、若有網路異常時無法重新連回；多人模式隊友死亡可以救助，但救助有時間限制過於不合理，且救人時受到攻擊就會中斷救助非常的蠢。

3.多人遊玩難度不合理：一隻怪單獨出現100次和10隻怪同時出現10次的強度是完全不能比的，但這遊戲多人的時候怪的數量會呈倍數成長、王的血量也呈倍數成長，但在關卡內能獲得的資源卻沒有成長，然後隊友互相會卡位，造成多人遊玩比單人遊玩還要難上數倍。

4.資源取得/使用 設計太差：額外能取得的武器效果差、數量少、大多數還會害到自己和隊友；遊戲中的普通錢(Tech)除了買血以外沒有太大的用途，就算有多也無法轉換成食物；遊戲內的食物取得不易，但商店購買被動效果竟然是用隨機2選1的方式抽買，被動效果無法累積至下個關卡、且售價非常不合理，有些廢物被動對遊戲沒什麼幫助但價格卻很貴(像加增金錢(Tech)收入的被動)，加上各種東西都需要用購買的(包含可撿取物堆疊上限、額外武器可使用次數...等等)，很明顯這系統設計的非常差，更不用說還有那種有Bug沒效果的被動(降買血量上限的花費沒效果)

Too Short; Write More:

I like hard games, but they have to be hard for good reasons, and that is just not the case here. It starts out fun enough for the first three or four chapters. They can be done on normal with some effort, the difficulty scaling feels good here. But later, the difficulty snorts a line and cranks it up to eleven. With the exact same group we started with, ""normal"" became impossible and ""easy"" was still too difficult to be enjoyable. This is just bad design which leads to a very inconsistent and frustrating experience. My expectation of ""easy"" is a mode that allows the user to experience the game content using a casual, arcade-style approach. Later, the boss difficulty is very cheaply increased by simply spawning more adds (which spawn infinitely). The problem with this is that it makes the boss levels binary; either you rush in and kill the boss in the 30 seconds before the adds get too big to deal with, or you die and try again. Most later bosses teleport, so the game then becomes a dice-roll on if you get the right items on the upper floors. Personal shields are a massive problem too. Every one of the later bosses constantly refreshes a personal shield on every single enemy and as a mechanic, I could find it very interesting on ONE boss encounter, not every single boss and half of the trash rooms. Movement is fine until you try to play with other people. These levels are just too small to not allow passage by one-another. You can't even walk over your downed allies which sometimes lead to the living being trapped behind them and dying. Aiming is another problem because no matter how you click, your attack always snaps to the closest nearby target. This is fine when the enemies are sparse, but leads to huge problems later. You could have the enemy-piercing rail gun sighted on a faraway enemy which would hit 5 or 6 enemies, but at the last moment the gun snaps to a closer target to your side causing the bullet to miss them. Lastly, what would truly fix this game is any sense of character progression whatsoever. The unlockables are truly disappointing and I didn't look forward to any of them. If after a boss encounter you could rely on being able to start with a better gun or upgrade your own weapon to know that eventually, if you beat your face against the wall long enough, you'll be strong enough to brute-force it, then it would be a lot easier to sink hours into it. Right now, after 4 or 5 times doing the exact same level and trying to overcome the same bad mechanics, it just leaves nothing to want to come back to.

I have a hard time calling this a bad game, but it did leave a foul taste in my mouth in the end. The game was worth the $2 I spent on it, but it was not worth the 8 hours I sunk into it.",1568005540,1568005540,False,21,0,0.694751203060150146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 Not a 'perfect' game by any means but about time somebody got top-down melee action combat right!!

Then the boss Mantega shows up. And the games hits the ceiling for a huge category of players I'm part of.

Game isn't particularly difficult, it's just absurdly designed. 
More than once the hitbox of player and mobs felt off. There is input delay for some attack or escape move. The weapons dropped in map are a friendlyfire fest. And the bosses are wandering sponges with no special pattern. They even are granted some passive attributes, and supported by infinite spawning minions. That is the bottom of gamedesign.
- ""How to make the difficulty curve progress through levels?""
- ""Multiply enemies, give them more health, and annoying powers""

And I'm not talking about the interesting, yet tight leveldesign. If you are not killed because you are bad, you probly got stuck in a prop, or against a wall because the rooms are as big as my bedroom. At least a Zoom-out key could have helped.

Eventually, I was thinking ""maybe I'm just too hard on that game"" until I realized me and my friends only played the EASY difficulty so far. Than the salt kicked back. Yup, it was the easiest parameters the game could offer? Ooook.

I mean it has good music, the art is fine, the gameplay feels nice, and the overall floor+rooms+shops idea is ok. 
But for its price, a demo would be more than welcomed, because it's advertised like a feelgood co-op kind of game while it's hardcore af.
So if you are casual, want to play occasionally, and haven't at least one friend for co-op, stay the fck back off that game.

オフラインでの協力プレイモードが追加され
一層イイ感じのゲームになりました。

賞金稼ぎが依頼を受けて悪党を成敗する
SF、ランダムダンジョン、一度死ぬと始めからの
見下ろし型アクションゲームです。

しっかりしたクオリティーのインディーゲームで
作りの拙さとか危うさなどは感じられません。

特にキャラクターモーションは洗練されていて
滑らかさとカッコ良さがあり目を引きます。
加えて敵の体がバラバラになる表現があったり
倒した敵の動きに物理挙動が働くこと
また死体が消えないことなどもあり
華麗に立ち回って敵を全滅させたときは
オレのキャラ強くてイカすなぁ…と
思えてしまいます。

大量の敵を一気になぎ倒して大暴れする
ようなゲームに見えて、実は一回の攻撃ミスや
ちょっとしたムダな動きが死に直結する
緊張感の高い、スキル重視のアクション
となってます。ここが大きな特徴です。

そのため自分の判断を正確に実行できる
一人でのプレイにもよく合うゲームで
メインはマルチ、シングルで遊ぶとつまらない
というゲームではありません。

ただ、サポートタイプのキャラだと
一人では厳しい感じになるとか
グレネードが使いづらくなる
（投げる前に敵に接近されてしまう為）
といったマルチを前提に作られている
部分はあると思います。

成長要素もあるのですが
メイン武器以外の初期装備品の組み合わせが
増えるのと、キャラのカラーリングが増える
といったところが主で
そこはかなりそっけないという印象です。

初期装備品もゲーム内で敵から拾ったり
店で購入しても入れ替え可能なので
それほど大きな影響は感じません。
あくまでメインは戦闘、というゲーム
だと思います。

グラフィックスはカラフルで
ACゲームっぽさがあり本当に楽しげです。
BGMも80年代風のネオンな
シンセサイザーな感じでしびれます。
SEもキレが良く爽快な音を鳴らしてます。

もう一つ魅力なのが
キャラデザや世界観などのアートワークです。
何か海外ゲームというよりも
以前の日本のベルトスクロールアクションなどで
見たような雰囲気があり、馴染みやすいのです。
日本人には懐かしい感じがあると思います。

有名ではなさそうなインディーズゲームで
オンでしかマルチプレイが出来ないという仕様は
実質マルチは無い、というのと一緒でしたし
それにやはりこういったゲームは
ACゲームのようにオフでのマルチプレイが
あってほしかったのです。

その声に応えてくれた開発者の皆様の
良い作品を見捨てない愛と努力に感謝したいです。",1497967471,1541410717,True,6,0,0.547198951244354248,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I did pick the game up on sale for half off but would have been happy if I had paid the full 9.99. My main gripe with the game is that it doesn't employ typical ""twin stick shooter"" mechanics with a controller seen in so many other top-down shooter games, and rather than aiming with the right stick lining up shots as you move / strafe with the left stick, the right stick instead only pans the camera around the room, so instead you're  left to run back and forth from enemies (while using a dodge/roll/teleport button for each character to evade their attacks..) So rather than the more fluid / user-friendly approach seen in many other top-down shooters, as you clear the rooms you kind of bait enemies along by running away, turning to face them, shoot, run away, turn to face them again, etc... 

That aside what is here still works reliably and you get into a rhythm as you evade enemies and blast away at them, dodging laser blasts from robots, explosions, pneumatic drills, and mohawk punks with large scythes. You get a good variety of pickups (incendiary grenades, proximity mines, medkits, etc...) to mix up the action. There are also boss fights at the end of each ""bounty"" when you reach the last floor of the level you are on. Each character however is limited to their 4 main attacks (which can be upgraded at various kiosks as you complete levels), so the gameplay is pretty simplistic. There are also only 4 characters to pick from, but each is unique/cool and have several skins to unlock.  

The soundtrack inparticular and the colorful graphics and cool character designs are what I enjoy about the game the most. I would recommend this game to fans of the top-down shooter genre, or people that are into neon, somewhat sci fi graphics and especially those that are into synthy electronic / new wave music or aesthetics.",1497824761,1497824761,True,0,0,0.488498955965042114,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So an ex-gang member, a raver, an ex-security officer and a engineer walk into a dark alley...

Kill to Collect is a top-down hack-n-slash roguelike with a bright neon-cyberpunk aesthetic similar to Neon Chrome, and surprisingly fair difficulty for the genre. You can tell when a rogue game wants you dead and KtC is not one of those, at least from what I've seen thus far. The player takes the role of one of four deadly hunters, the only law in the scummy and villainous lower levels of Geocenter Alpha, the last city on Earth. Each has a different weapon, secondary power attack, ultimate, and movement ability. Combat is largely melee-based, and since you are always outnumbered, conservation of health, the number one concern in these sorts of games, is a question of learning how to time your attacks and dodges with the predictable attack patterns of the enemies. Each character's secondary attack inflicts some form of crowd control, which you will need to use often. Ultimate attacks must be charged first by dealing damage and are best used against a crowd of enemies, as in most games.

Kate Katana uses a sword, and can knock down enemies in a small cone or all around her using her ultimate, or by using her dodge roll. Ivan Ironfist has large cybernetic fists that can inflict rapid, but less damaging attacks then the other charcters- only half a pip per punch. He can knock back enemeis and cause a vulnerability effect that makes them take more damage from subsequent punches. He has lower health but can instantly teleport around, including behind enemies. His ultimate damages everything near him constantly for the duration. Riot Ray uses a shotgun, which technically gives him the most reach of any character- but its so short ranged that it's essentially a melee weapon anyway. However, it deals more damage based on Ray's distance to an enemy, and at point blank does four pips of damage, enough to one-shot some enemies. His secondary attack knocks enemies back and a shield over his back can protect him from back attacks. His ultimate sees him charge around, knocking down and heavily damaging enemies. His dodge is a simple hop with no other effects. Lastly, Shocking Shelly uses an electrified staff with good reach, her secondary attack stuns enemies and she can drop turrets that fire stunning shots.

Shelly can use her ultimate much more often then the other characters, and its possible to have multiple turrets active at once. Combined with her reach and stuns, I feel like she is the most effective solo character as a result. The least so is probably Ivan, who has very short reach and limited health, and doesn't have any attacks that disable enemies completely. Kate also has some problems against robotic enemies, as they are unaffected by her knockdowns.

Regardless, each character can even the odds by using a secondary weapon and consumable items. The sub-weapons have very limited ammo but offer much needed ranged attacks, and include a handgun, various types of grenades, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, a hookshot that pulls enemies towards you, and a ""chain-cutter"", a weapon that creates an energy tether between you and the target point, which constantly damages enemies it touches. Items include medkits, proximity mines, temporarily increased movement speed or damage, temporarily infinite dodging, damage reflection, and the rare ""ultimate power"" item that gives you infinite uses of your ultimate ability for its duration, a good way of quickly ending a boss fight. 

Gameplay is split up into individual missions, or ""Bounties"", consisting of three or more floors, with the final floor consisting entirely of a boss fight. These bosses can use similar attacks and sub-weapons to the player, and often have additional perks, such as a teleporting around the arena. Completing a bounty rewards you with credits, which act as experience towards unlocks. These unlocks include new starting loadouts, character skins, gold weapons and titles.

The game recently added two-player local coop, a much-requested addition, and of course it has four-player online coop.

It has the makings of a good drop-in-and-drop-out multiplayer experience, but the RPG elements just aren't there.  There's hardly any loot in this game, so the title is a little misleading.  What are we collecting exactly?  I feel like the currencies in the game are very temporary and fleeting.  Loot amounts to health vials and speed boosts.

The couch coop is currently broken in a few ways.  First, only player one can interact with the main menu and some other menu elements.  Second, even though I was controller #1, it assigned me to player #2, and my player assignment was switched after the first level, effectively confusing us for a grand total of 20 seconds, so my friend and I were clever and swapped controllers until we beat the current level.  The upgrades were lackluster because nothing is actually worked toward.  The only redeeming aspect of the game is it's easy to get into.  You'll effectively figure the entire game out in less than 5 minutes.  There are some aspects of the game's battle system which will take some experimentation, like character abilities and boss battle mechanics, but as long as you can back away from enemies after hitting them 1-2 times, you'll mostly be fine.  There are difficulty modes, mind you, and I only tried easy and normal modes before deciding I was bored of the game's character upgrade/customization system.",1497652279,1497652608,False,31,3,0.665382862091064453,0,True,False,False,False,,,

KtC is a rogue like game like Isaac and other more ""well-known"" games which are basicly the same. You go down the last corners of streets, killing bad guys, collecting stuff and more.

[h1]So...should i kill them or they me?[/h1]
Tbh, KtC is a hard game, a very hard game - even on ""easy mode"". Its not only that the game is hard, its also the game plays so dang hard too: Nearly every character feels very slow. They attack maybe ones per second (the fastest one sure attacks faster but makes nearly no damage and has nearly no health...) that it actually makes nearly no fun to play this game alone, i tried to play with all 4 characters and only found for me the...""engigirl"" (i duno the name now) pretty good since i can build small turrets, avoid enemys and stun them.

Still even her main attack is so fucking slooooooowwwww. I mean, a normal guy/girl would swing a staff but in this game she swings it -only- vertical (so you can only hit things close infront of you...) ones per attack which means no combos or like, also the delay between you actually hit the attack button and the damage output is also kinda ""castlevania"" like. You press the attack button and maybe 0.5 seconds later, you actually hit a enemy.

That actually makes it again hard to attack and avoid attacks since after a attack, your character needs a short time to recover. I mostly ended up in a ""cat and mice"" play, if i had the room for - which simply means i poked the enemy ones, avoided, poked again, avoid, and again the loop. Fun? Not really, since some enemys can lay mines and others can stun you, giving them the advantage of actually crowd controll...

[h1]Again, for what do we ""collect""?[/h1]
If you win or lose a mission, you get... or earn some credits. Sadly, you actually cant buy stuff with them, you only unlock stuff like, titles, skins & some basic start gear. No new characters, no new weapons, no new power ups, no new levels, nothing like. So it makes nearly no sense to ""go collecting"" stuff anyways.

[h1]The end of the story[/h1]
[b]I actually refund it[/b]. Its to hard and makes no fun playing it alone. In Multiplayer its even more hell since more bullets and more things to avoid and taking care off. The difficult is way to high that the game ""could"" actually make some kind of fun. The characters feel way to slow somehow and the delays feeling like youre all the time in the disadvantage and not even close to be in the ""same levels with the enemys"". Avoid it if you think it is a good rogue-like game and look better for another one, this game might looks great on display but it feels like you go boxing against Mohammed Ali...",1487395685,1491090436,False,10,0,0.566804468631744385,4,True,False,False,False,,,

As the finest chocolate this game isn't something new, or elaborate, but [b]it's sooooo sweet[/b]... I coud never call this a [i]masterpiece[/i], a [i]work of art[/i], or stuff like that, becuse this game is something... both small and, as I already said, not really new, but also perfect in what it is.
First thing, there's basically no plot, but that isn't a big deal, the setting is well put and straight to the point: It's a cyberpunk world, you are a mercenary, a runner, call it as you like, we want some crooks killed, here's your target, this will be your reward, [b]go get them![/b]. And [b]BAM![/b] You are in this map, killing things to open the way to your wanted criminal, no wasting of time, just [b]fun[/b].
It's a top-down shooter with a skill-based gameplay which reminds MOBA games, and it is hard. Marvelously [b]hard[/b]. When someone says [i]It's hard[/i] about a top-down shooter you imagine a bullet hell, but this is not the case, the gameplay isn't erratic, everything is clean, solid, and accurate, if you play it at [i]Hard[/i] difficulty as an enemy hit you, you are basically dead. If you smash the buttons you die, if you don't take care of your positioning you die, if you don't notice a threat you die, if your mom screams something at you, you die. You can use a lot of different tactics to clean a room but when you do a mistake you lose. This will change if you play at [i]Normal[/i] difficulty, of course, you will have more health and there'll be room for mistakes, so the game allow you to chose the kind of experience you want.
Everytime you'll die, you'll have the feeling ""I did that mistake"" and you'll get better, the game is clean, it's not chaotic, there's no fate involved, no RNG mechanics, the game never cheats, it just requires skill and this makes it such a rewarding experience.
This is a roguelite kind of game, when you die you restart, but it's based on short missions, as I said, so you unlock the new mission after completing the previous one, then you can select the mission you want even if you die. Anyway the maps are randomly generated, so it never feels too repetitive to restart a mission. Anyway, it's hard, and after you die, and die, and die multiple times in a row, no matter how hard you tried, it drains your energies, so, speaking about how I feel after some playing, I could want to stop after 2, 3, 4 hours I'm playing... uhm... but maybe it's not strange in any case? By the way, I could want to stop playing this game after some time, but that doesn't last long, this game is something you'll want to come back to.

Quick Rundown:
------------------------
The good: Gameplay mechanics are solid, if a bit simplistic.
The bad: Exceptionally difficult to find others to play with.

Verdict: A hopeful 6/10 in its current state. Fun for a quick romp but disappointed about not having enough friends to play with. Interface, matchmaking, and netcode need a few tweaks.

Potential: 8/10 with a solid-buy recommendation if matchmaking gets an overhaul. Once the multiplayer community gets up and running,

Built on the Unity engine, Kill to Collect is a 1-4 player skill based top-down brawler of sorts with an 80's neon/cyberpunk theme and music to match. KTC is an action-oriented tactical brawler with a good degree of challenge and a high skill ceiling, button-mashing wont serve you well here. The basic premise of the game is that you (and a group of friends if lucky) delve into futuristic / dystopian slums with the goal of hunting a bounty (boss) and clearing the place of its riff-raff. Along the way you will find one-time use heals, shields, powerups, deployables (such as mines), and even swappable ammo-based weapons as you make your way through the floor. At the end of each section you are allowed to take a break in the rec-room and spend some of the chips you've accumulated to buy yourself permanent upgrades, replenish your health and ammo, stock up on items, or purchase a different secondary weapon.

There are 4 character classes in Kill to Collect, and while they all feel fairly similar, they do each have their own strengths and weaknesses from being a slow-ish and tanky shotgun brawler with a Juggernaut-like ultimate ability to a crazy shock-staffed, jetpack-wearing, turret deploying crowd control character. Each of the four different classes has their own set of abilities that work better or worse against certain enemy types in a Gauntlet-esq manner, but are still similar enough so as to not become obsolete when used in solo play. Due to the nature of these differences, the game really shines in multiplayer when you can combine these with allied abilities, but thanks to a small playerbase, finding a multiplayer game can be quite difficult.

The brawler-esq 3rd person top-down combat in KTC is broken down into an exceptionally simple set of attacks and moves; A basic attack, a special knock-down attack on a cooldown, an ultimate ability on a kill-based cooldown, and a limited ammo-based interchangeable weapon. Additionally each character has their own dodge ability from a steerable and fast moving jetpack that can be used to knock enemies aside, to a short ranged blink which can teleport to the other side of an enemy (admittedly a bit fiddly), and of course a fairly plain-jane dodgeroll too. The special attacks for each character feel similar, but do impart different effects on the enemy from armor breaking debuffs which make an enemy take more damage on their next hit to stuns and knockdowns which in some cases are only effective against certain types of enemies.

An upgrade/unlock system of sorts is in place, but its incredibly simple and very linear. Basically, as you collect bounties (score) from playing and beating levels, you unlock skins and new loadouts which allow you to change the two starting items that you begin the game with. Loadouts are a fairly minor thing overall, but do influence the early-game. Unlocks for golden weapon skins are attained by completing objectives based around using those weapons, but these golden weapons dont appear to have any gameplay impact, nor can these skins be disabled.. so any uniqueness of each weapon's texture/color is basically lost after you've completed its associated task. Pieces Interactive definitely could have done a bit more with this system while maintaining balance and keeping power-creep at bay. In its current state these systems feel a little under-developed and disappointing. Collected bounty is basically just a measurement of how much you've played.. a global score of sorts; you dont use it to buy unlocks, loadouts, or skins, they just get unlocked when you reach a totally linear and arbitrary amount.

Ultimately the crippling factor for Kill to Collect at the moment is that its missing its multiplayer community. Its a solid game which needs more players. They've done a really good job with core fighting mechanics and balancing, and aside from a bit of peer-to-peer lag, the multiplayer mechanics feel pretty good. Revive systems are in place to keep the flow of the game going and reward players who are good by keeping them revived or bringing them back after locating or beating special rooms. The increased number of enemies in multiplayer offer additional challenge, and there is plenty of chaos and opportunity to work together to make some fun and exciting things happen based on the game's various knock-back mechanics and ragdoll-physics. If there was a stronger multiplayer community that allowed you to find games whenever you wanted, I feel that this game would offer a significantly higher value for its cost. As it stands, I cannot recommend Kill to Collect at its full price unless you absolutely love this type of game, or have a group of friends to play with. If you enjoyed games like Spiral Knights, then this will probably be something you will find familiar and appealing. Though due to the simple combat mechanics and lack of complex interactions in single player the game can feel a tad samey after awhile, having a friend or two to play with may make all the difference.

Final thoughts: Pieces Interactive needs to step up their marketing department and get people playing their game. Its a good title that gets put down all too quickly due to the lack of community to engage with. Single player delivers a couple of hours of good challenge while multiplayer offers some exciting, funny, and tensely rewarding moments. Sadly unless your friends own the game, theres almost no chance of finding a random multiplayer pick-up game to join at this time. Kill to Collect is a good game that Id enjoy playing with friends and with random people, sadly it will be difficult to convince friends to buy without an active multiplayer community and with such a flawed matchmaking system in place.

Pros:
- Good visceral core combat mechanics.
- Decent player character and enemy variety.
- Has single player modes, offers a good challenge.
- The kind of game that truly shines when played with friends.

Cons:
- No multiplayer community as of 2016-07-03. Finding a random MP game is impossible.
- Cant do anything but sit at the host screen while you wait for someone to join.
- Host-side hit detection means that players will feel some lag / sluggish feedback.
- Cannot disable autoaim for keyboard and mouse controls.
- Maxes out GPU clocks, even when minimized and vsynced. (Radeon 7850)

Su jugabilidad es sencilla, contando con 4 personajes a elegir, diferenciados entre ellos. El ataque principal es cuerpo a cuerpo siendo una katana, una almadena, unos puños roboticos o una escopeta de corto alcance las armas principales de cada personaje. Despues hay una habilidad especial que aturde o tumba a los enemigos, y que se tiene que recargar para volver a usarse. Disponemos de una ranura para las armas secundarias (normalmente a distancia) con una munición muy limitada, y por último un ataque definitivo, que este tarda bastante en cargarse según el personaje. A eso añadele los ""dashes"" o impulsos o volteretas para poder esquivar. Esto es todo lo que pueden hacer nuestros personajes.
Pese a esta sencillez de control, yo creo que tiene una jugabilidad buena, sin ser una pasada. El juego entretiene bastante y cada piso es aleatorio. Consigues vales de comida por pasarte habitaciones ""desafios"" y por llegar al final del piso, y con esos vales te compras mejoras como mas municion secundaria, más vida o reducir un 30% el número de muertes necesarias para recargar el ataque definitivo. Por supuesto, tambien consigues dinero para objetos utilizables, munición o armas secundarias.
A todo esto le acompaña una banda sonora ""retro wave"" que le da carácter al juego, y que tambien me gusta mucho.
Gráficamente no es nada del otro mundo, pero yo no me fijo mucho en esas cosas.

La pega más significativa que le veo es la fuerte orientación multijugador cooperativo que tiene, que pese a poder disfrutarlo en solitario, se nota. No es una pega en si... soy yo, que soy rarito.

Мы купили игру ему и приготовились зарубиться вместе! Саундтрэк он тут же оценил и мы сидели в меню минут 30-40, наслаждались... классно, короче,было. А потом пошли играть.

Kill to collect is a co-op multiplayer (or singleplayer) experience with cyberpunk attributes and some rather interesting and unique level design implemented into each mission of the game. The game is rather fast paced, and focuses upon combat more than anything else in the game.

[h1]Quick Note[/h1]
Apparently the game is tagged as Rogue-lite/like which I don't 100% agree with. The game has some elements of this sort of genre but I wouldn't tag it as that, I know that the tags are made from the most popular by steam users but it's just something I had to say.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Kill to collect is a fast paced, cyberpunk themed addicting game that concentrates solely on the combat but does well with presenting everything else as well. The combat is elegantly designed which has had a lot of thought and process gone through how every move works.  The combat combines fast paced with quick thinking and strategic play in order to outsmart your enemies and kill them easier, the game doesn't rely on how fast you can spam the attack button which is a very good think to have in a game like this. Because who really likes mashing a button to attack with bare minimum combat system? The environment of the game itself is well thought out and presented, you can actually use this to your advantage to kill your enemies easier and quicker.

With this sort of combat system, it won't be easy. The game seems to take a lot of skill (especially in single player as all the enemies will walk towards you) which definitely would require you to be able to talk to your other teammates in order to get good at the game and be more strategic with your attacks.

The difficulty of this game comes from the enemies that you encounter throughout each of the rooms that you go in before you get to the main bounty. Some of the enemies are plain and simple, but as you get further into the game the enemies start to develop a more interesting and challenging mechanics that will make the game a bit more harder for you. But the way that they do this isn't like other games similar to this, they are not given tons of health, damage or defense boosts in order to make it difficult. Both you and the enemies die in a couple of hits, this makes the combat system more difficult and makes you focus more upon timing, dodging and careful positioning of each of your attacks in order to make them the fullest and most effective that they can be. You will know when you have made a mistake, because you will be punished harshly with either death or low health.

The progression with each of the characters that you play as needs a bit more work. It does feel a bit meh and doesn't really feel like you are progressing in the sort of way that you would expect to do throughout the game. I feel like even though there are only 4 characters in the game, that they could of expanded a bit more on the sort of characters that you could of played as. For me, the first hour of the game was me testing out the characters and what sort of combat style there was, and for me personally they all just felt dull and not really that interesting all together. A few more characters in this game would add to a bit more variety to the game I think.

The game's graphics are so bright and vibrant, I feel like it brings the game to life and really helps with the fast paced that the game is going for. With the cyberpunk theme it really hits the nail on the head for the game all together. With all the characters being fairly bright and colourful, as well as the walls and everything else in the game it really sets a high standard for the game if you're just watching the trailer to see if you like this game or not.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Elegant combat system
+ Fast paced and strategic thinking
+ Nice difficulty throughout the game
+ Very colourful and vibrant colours
+ Steam achievements and trading cards

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Needs more characters to vary it a bit
- Smallest combat mistake could lead to quick death
- For the asking price, it's a little steep in my opinion

[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]
Kill to collect is well worth your time, even though the game itself may be a bit steep for the current asking price it still does well when it comes to the interesting combat and gameplay. The graphics are superbly presented and done, along with the characters. If you can get past the fact that small mistakes could lead up to death or low health, and that the game will require skill then

Bom, o jogo tem um estilo de Roguelike, baseado em ação e um rpg, lembra muito jogos de console, também é bem compátivel com diversos modelos de controles o que me deixou feliz para os amantes da praticidade!
Existem no momento 4 personagem totalmente diferentes com habilidades exclusivas, eles tem um ataque padrão, uma habilidade de movimento, uma habilidade especial e uma habilidade SUPREMA na qual ela pega carga conforme você enfrenta os monstros dos níveis.
Este jogo foi feito principalmente para se divertir em Multiplayer pois é mais legal e interativo, sem contar que ele é muito fácil de morrer, os NPCs tem uma mecânica absurdamente rápida em termos de te matar.
Recomendo o jogo bastante, ficou muito divertido, principalmente pra jogar com amigos ou se você é competitivo nele se tem um sistema de rankeamento de quem zerou todas os níveis e quantas vezes, o rank é meio que diário. Pelo preço ele parece não ser tão acessível mas quando comprado percebemos que ele valeu muito a pena. 
Bom, eu também fiz uma análise do JOGO em vídeo em meu canal e Convido você a conhecer o JOGO junto comigo antes mesmo de obte-lô e tirar todas suas dúvidas/conclusões. Obrigado por lêr minha análise e um grande abraço da Ovelha! Se vemos por aí.

is an incredible thing on its own in this times because I am such a lazy person right now.

But the Gameplay of Kill to Collect evoked the urge to express myself, besides grinning like a maniac 
once i cleared a particularly nasty room. (Ask my girlfiriend... it's a creepy sight to witness). 

I realy enjoy playing throw the roguelike and twinstickshooter genre alike and love games like
[b]Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon and hyper light drifter[/b], which are great games, so when I realized 
this has been able to up the gameplay even more it came as quite a surprise to me.

[b]Highpoints:[/b]
the controls are slick meaning you have no useless keys to use, just 3 for standard attack, one cc ability and your Ultimate, 1 dodge and 4 consumable slots and they are spot on in the responsivity department.

the AI in this is so darn fitting, caster avoid you making it hard to get rid of them first, Ranged units kite you, all of them avoid area dmg from environmental hazards. The different enemies have such a distinguished set of behaviours making every room a unique challenge.

You can use the rooms against the enemies and feel smart about yourself, 
the first time a purposefully threw myself into a pit, hanging onto the ledge to avoid a bounty bosses spinning attack, then jumping back up and cutting him to pieces... I felt great.

the sound is great, ability and impact sounds are well done.
giving you exelent feedback, when an attack is coming etc.

and the graphic and physics in this nail the feeling of beeing a skilled contractor doing incredible stuff, into place.

[b]The only room for improvement i see is,[/b]
in the worldbuilding, the feel of the world so to speak could be stronger. 
maybe add the ability to walk around in the bounty bar and talk to ppl in there for some banter ( stay awhile and listen ).
to make everything more coherent. 

and little things, like a toggle for aimassist.

I shall finish this with a big thank you to Pieces Interactive for making this Game and thus making me 
very happy , so thx guys!

Objective: Rogue like collecting mulitplayer game.... Well you don't really collect, everything is a limited use, the rogue like character builds are almost non exitistant. It's really hard to make fun builds with only 2 random choices per upgrade. The multiplayer match making is really bad, I couldn't get a single player to join my game.

- trochę za wysoka cena (startowe promo 14.99€, ale później rośnie do 19.99€)
- powolna rozgrywka
- w pojedynkę może się troche nudzić

Jeżeli masz znajomych, który mogą z Tobą zakupić grę to się nie zastanawiaj. Będziecie się świetnie bawić. 
Natomiast jako gracz single player chciałbym przestrzec, że gra w pojedynkę jest trudniejsza i wolniejsza niż we 4kę.
8/10 jako ocena ostateczna mówi o tym, że gra się dobrze, ale pewne elementy powinny zostać poprawione,
chociażby szybkość poruszania się bohaterów. Wtedy będzie dynamicznie, szybko i mega przyjemnie.

The art, audio, and general idea behind the game are fantastic.  I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes, but I found myself feeling like 80% of the game was missing beyond that.  The lack of character progression is a major flaw that I feel like takes away from the game.  

The combat is incredibly unforgiving, and even on easy with two veteran gamers we were struggling to make it through the first two levels.  You don't feel like you are accomplishing anything, and you're not rewarded for moving on.  It's like the game may strive to be something that is difficult, but there isn't any real challenge - you're just prohibited from getting hit more than a couple of times each level - which really prohibits the ability to run around and have fun and causes the game to be mostly centered around dodging minor ranged attacks beacuse only a few hits and you'll be starting the level over.

The medkits restore 1 health point, out of the 8 or so that you have.  Taking damage is pretty much something you can just not avoid to do. 

The first bounty ended with a boss fight stating she had the ""Super Teleport"" ability, which meant she just hopped around the room.  It wasn't any different than any of the standard rooms had been before, and left me feeling totally underwhlelmed.

Una vez terminada la misión te recompensaran con dinero, upgrades, y la posibilidad de ir de compras al tío del almacen. Que dispone de mejoras adicionales para tu personaje. Mas vida, mas potencia de fuego. etc.

El juego también dispone de un reto diario online que solo puedes intentar hacerlo durante ese día en concreto. Asi haras la envidia de tus compis online.

Este juego brilla en todo su explendor si consigues un par de amigos que quieran unirse a tu partida. O unirte a una partida creada en internet.

Juego totalmente recomendable para jugar con colegas. Y echar unas risas.

Das Spielprinzip ist an The Binding of Isaac angelehnt: Man steuert einen von vier Charakteren durch zufällig generierte Dungeons und versucht, an das Ende zu kommen. Jeder Charakter verfügt über einen schwachen, aber schnellen Angriff ohne Cooldown (LMB), einen starken Angriff mit Cooldown (RMB), eine Ausweichmöglichkeit mit geringer Cooldown und Aufladungen (Space) und einer Ultimativen Fähigkeit, die sich durch das Töten von Gegnern auflädt. Zusätzlich kann ein Charakter Power-Ups (doppelter Schaden, Schadensschild, erhöhte Geschwindigkeit uvm.) und Zweitwaffen (Pistolen, Flammenwerfer, Laserpeitschen uvm.) finden, um sich das Leben etwas einfacher zu machen.

Am Ende einer jeden Ebene findet man einen Shop, wo man sich mit seinen erworbenen Währungen Power-Ups, Zweitwaffen oder Verbesserungen kaufen kann, welche für den Rest des Levels aktiv sind. Ein Level besteht aus mehreren Ebenen, wovon die letzte einen Endboss enthält.

Das einzige, was dem Spiel fehlt, ist Content. Grundsätzlich ist das Spiel gut, allerdings gibt es kaum etwas freizuschalten oder zu bekommen. Freischaltbare Power-Ups, Waffen, Charaktere oder ähnliches würdem dem Spiel immens mit diesem Contentproblem helfen. Eventuell wäre auch ein Skillbaum, wie es z.B. bei Torchlight der Fall ist, eine Unterstützung, wobei ich glaube, dass bewusst auf dieses Element verzichtet wurde.

Zu guter letzt muss man noch den Schwierigkeitsgrad hervorheben. Die Gegner sind allesamt unterschiedlich mit eigenen Angriffsmustern, und auf Hard überlebt man meistens keinen Treffer. Insofern - du wirst sterben. Sehr oft sterben. Leider gehöre ich zu der Art, die sich gerne durch so etwas foltern. Und wenn ich mit The Lost noch vor dem Holy Mantle Startitem Mega-Satan gekillt habe, schaffe ich auch dieses Spiel!

Der Soundtrack ist großartig, und die allgemeine musikalische Untermalung ist sehr stimmig und erinnert mich immer an die 80er. Es passt allerdings sehr gut in das Spiel hinein.

Wenn man - im Gegensatz zu mir - Freunde hat (I CRI EVRITIM Q.Q), kann man sich auch auf einen Co-Op freuen. Diesen habe ich leider nicht testen können, da keiner meiner Freundesliste das Spiel hat, insofern kann ich nichts zur Qualität sagen.

---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]

Kill to Collect is a single- and multi-player 'rogue-lite' action game in a dystopian cyberpunk setting.

You play one of four bounty hunters who spend their time delving into the deeper floors of Earth's last city, Geoshelter Alpha, in search of their prey. And when they find them? Well, they kill to collect, obviously!

[h1]==========================================================
----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Graphics - The graphics all have a great cyberpunk-like feel to them, with dark backgrounds combined with bright neon and flashy weapon effects, and the character outfits, while mostly looking a little silly, fit the atmosphere well. Enemies are a little bit boring and samey across some levels, and are basically made up from two groups: robots and humans. 

The graphics are a little small, though, and with no zooming available to focus in on the action, I found it difficult with some enemy models to see the animations clearly enough to predict their attack timings.

Graphics options include the usual detail level, full screen / window mode, and resolution settings, as well as a number of advanced features like SSAO, bloom, and antialiasing. I played in full HD with everything set to maximum and experienced no problems on an aging gaming laptop (485m video card), but others have reported some issues on much newer hardware. The developer is looking into it, but from my point of view, it runs like a dream!

Sound - Music is nice enough: a sort of heavy rock-type beat with electronic melodies. In any case, it fits the game well and doesn't get in the way. Sound effects are similarly good.

Gameplay - The game has three different gameplay options, each able to be played in single player mode or cooperatively with up to three other people: Story Mode (a campaign, including a minimal tutorial), Challenge (fight your way through eight levels as quickly as possible), and Free Hunt (do any bounty, without the story mode's extra story bits). Ultimately, though, each mode boils down to the same thing for each level: descend to a lower floor of the city and fight your way through room after room of bad guys until you come to the boss: your target. Then collect your bounty.

The game structure within each bounty takes a room-by-room approach that is similar to other games such as the Binding of Isaac, although with none of the unique encounters of that game. Each floor consists of a number of isolated rooms, and enemies from one room can't travel to another. You progress by wiping out all the enemies in a room, after which you can unlock the door to a connecting room and do it all again. You're rewarded on completion of each room with 'tech', one of the game's two currencies, and you receive a bonus if you complete a room without getting hit by an enemy. When you reach the final room of the level you're awarded some food stamps, the other currency, and can then spend your tech and food stamps on random items that only last until the end of the current bounty.

Occasionally you'll find chests in some of the battle rooms, which can be opened to reveal random one-use items or temporary weapons. These are fairly few and far between though, and are usually (always) found in 'challenge rooms': rooms with a much higher number of enemies than normal rooms. Upon completing one of these rooms you can open the chest and grab the loot inside.

When you complete a bounty -- and also if you fail at it -- you receive a reward for the number of kills you made through the level, with a bonus for killing the bounty target. This then adds to your progress in various 'loadouts' (equipment with which you can begin a level), titles (simply a name), and outfits for your hunters. There is thus some limited customisation and progression available, but it's a hard slog for what seems like not quite enough of a reward.

It's fun to play, although it is more frustrating than it should be, as dying in single-player mode seems to take you all the way back to the start of the first floor of the bounty, even if you've reached one of the end-floor rooms that is supposed to respawn you there. Because of this it took me over an hour of play just to finish the first proper bounty after the tutorial, because I had to do the whole thing about seven times.

A few niggly issues brought the game down a bit, though. For starters, the game is essentially a twin-stick shooter using left hand on the keyboard for movement and right hand on mouse for aiming and shooting. But the default keyboard and mouse controls just don't work in a frantic situation, as they make it impossible to use items like medkits. Unfortunately it's not very easy to make it better with the choices available for keyboard configuration, either; I've only managed to improve it slightly by mapping the middle mouse button. The game does claim to have full controller support, which would probably work much better. I haven't had a chance to test that yet, though. The mouse aiming also sometimes doesn't work quite right, leaving your character swinging off at some weird angle well away from the direction of the mouse pointer. The lobby and menu interface is also a little quirky, with a bit of searching required in order to work out how to activate or use any rewards you win.

The story in the game is enjoyable, if a little derivative, but the text really needs a bit more attention. There are some very awkwardly worded sentences that just don't flow well, and numerous grammatical errors as well. The four characters all have different background stories and in-game abilities, but without extra characters to open up or more customisation and progression available, it feels like it's not quite enough.

I say Kill to Collect is a 'rogue-lite' game as it includes random dungeon generation, and some degree of random drops (although in this case they're not enemy drops, but rather sporadic chests and end-of-floor shops with random equipment), but it doesn't include any of the mega-loot options like a true rogue-like game. There is only very limited character modification available, and mostly only temporary progression.

[h1]==========================================================
-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Pros:
+ A great atmosphere; a good cyberpunk feel
+ It's great fun most of the time
+ Single player and cooperative multiplayer
+ Achievements
+ Trading cards

Cons:
- Keyboard and mouse controls don't work well in frantic situations, which are common
- It's very frustrating sometimes
- Most character upgrades are only temporary; a permanent upgrade tree would be a fantastic addition
- No one in multiplayer yet

[h1]==========================================================
--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Re-reading this review it looks as though I'm being a bit down on Kill to Collect, but that's just because it's almost fantastic; it just misses out due to those little niggles I mentioned.

But it is still a very good fun game. I highly recommend it.

  Before I start I want to say that Kill to Collect is easily one of the best games I've played in years.
It has some flaws, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I'll shortly list those before I do an in depth review.

  As an aside, I'm not sure if I have to clarify that I was given a review code for this game because I was given one of four from a friend who needed to test out the co-op aspect. So, I did that.

Pros: Game in absurdly fun.
         Music is great.
         The enemies are varied and creative.
         Very nostalgic.

Cons: Difficulty is dodgy.
          Level design can be confusing.
          Occasional bugs and wonky hitbox detection.


  I'll do the Pros first since this game deserves that much. First I'll give a quick rundown of the basic idea.
 
  Kill to Collect is in essence a dungeon crawler. You splatter your enemies across the wall and floors until you find an elevator to the next floor and do the same process. Don't let that trick you into thinking the game has no depth. It has an passable cyberpunk storyline but the gameplay is honestly why we're all here.
  At the end of each floor you can spend two types of currency you gained from that floor. Credits are awarded for performing well in the rooms and are used to purchase consumables like personal shields or more secondary weapon ammo. Food stamps are an oh so delicious reward for completing the various challenge rooms through the floors and are used to buy semi-permanent upgrades for your character. Anything you don't spend is saved for the next floor, and after clearing every floor in an area you're thrown into either a boss fight or a few waves of enemies. Once you clear that, it's on to the next area in the story.

  The game is absurdly fun: It's absurdly fun! I have 14 ish hours by the time of this review and about 12 of those are in 
co-op. The characters are all interesting with different movesets for varying playstyles. Each one has a Basic Attack, a Special Attack, an Ultimate, and a Mobility move. On top of that, they each have a unique trait incorporated in their moveset to further cement their 'role' in the party.

  Music is great: The music very well done and atmospheric. Atmospheric may not be the correct word but it helps me personally get in the cyberpunk mood. Although it isn't something you'll (likely) be whistling at work like Zelda or Final Fantasy, the music is appropriate and on point with some bumping techno music for one level, and crunchy guitar music on the next.

  The enemies are varied: Every area you enter has it's own flavor of baddies, with some levels catering specifically to a certain type like a robotics uprising having only robotic enemies in that area. Outside of those special occasions you'll encounter a pretty range of enemies from punks with axes and laser pistols, to robotic drones and large mantis like robots with claws. You may notice a few palette swaps to indicate enemies with AI but more never hurt anyone.

  Very nostalgic: This is the point I most wanted to emphasize because I haven't seen any other reviewers mention this specifically. The game is almost over the top nostalgic for oldschool dungeon crawlers like Gauntlet or most prominently for me, the Loaded and Reloaded series. I see the word Roguelite being tossed around but I feel that's doing a disservice to this game based on the amount of trash 'roguelike' games being pushed out lately.

  And now the cons. I'll reiterate that I played this game when it was technically in beta, but I've continued to play it after the full release and these are the problems I see still persist.

  Dodgy Difficulty: There are currently three difficulty modes while I write this review. Easy, Normal, and Hard.
The difference between easy and normal was literally imperceptible to me outside of beginning with slightly more HP.
The difference between Normal and Hard however is like night and day and may deter anyone from ever trying it out.
On hard mode you have 1 health point to begin with, and close to everything will kill you in one hit. Learning to use your weapons effectively is paramount and is what I consider to be the way the devs intended KtC to be played.

  Confusing Level Design: This one is tricky because it could very well be just the group I played with.
The literal level design is very simple and straight forwad with every floor being comprised of a series of rooms, roughly square shaped with different floor hazards like pitfalls or robotic turrets and vats of acid.
  The real problem stems from the questionable color choice on some the floors and enemies. Very frequently my friends and I would find ourselves in a situation where the enemies and floor would be so similar in color that you couldn't tell anyone was even there until they killed you. In particular, it's the red flooring and red enemies that caused issues for us.

  Bugs and hitboxes: This is easily the most frustrating part of this game for me. The hitbox detection felt so on point for many of the bad guys I encountered, but a couple in particular seemed to be wildly innacurate. In particular the little robotic probes and the sword and shield guys. There are times when you can easily be outside their range and still be hit by their attacks. It's especially frustrating on hard mode since that death can feel very cheap.
  The occasional bugs weren't terrible but should be mentioned. On the loading screens, we would occasionally lock up and have to Alt+F4 out and restart the game. 
  There is another bug where your characters will seem to magnetize to one another and go launching off at breakneck speeds wildly. It caused a few deaths and can lead to you trying to avoid working together and just clear a little corner of the room each so you don't get too close to one another.

  I know I said I'd try and keep this short, but honestly Kill to Collect is firmly one of my favorite games to play now and I had a hard time not rambling about how great it is. If you liked Loaded or Reloaded, give it a shot.

Tactics and timing is absolutely necessary to succeed and this is where the fun is. 

The four different playable characters allow interesting combos with each other to kill enemies faster which is necessary on harder difficulties and levels. Kill to Collect combines this with randomly generated elements and and a credits reward system even when you fail which makes it all that more addicting.

""Kill to Collect"" is an isometric beat-em-up.  The four different characters play very differently. Each mission is procedurally generated.

Playing on Hard difficulty level, I cleared the first mission. The second mission has different adverseries. Hard difficulty is super hardcore because you start off with 1 hp, so perfection or near-perfection is required. I found myself swearing at the screen many times.

In addition to Story Mode, there are procedurally generated, daily challenges, which you can take part in, to see if you can make it to the top of the Leaderboard.

You need to use a controller, since it is very difficult to hit diagonals on a keyboard.

I love the music, I just wish that there were more music tracks. The dialogue made me laugh a few times.

Game itself can be played either in co-op mode or as a single player mode and both includes three difficulties and three modes to choose from. 4 Different classes who all have their own unique skills and playstyle. 

The gametitle might already be a bit revealing, but yeah, your objective is get the bounty done, which means you have x- amount of floors to clear before
the bossbattle, and thanks to the roguelite-aspect, if you die at any point of the game, you're forced to start from the first floor and there's variety
of different enemies that wants you dead at any cost. For the daring there's even added Challenge rooms which yields extra number of rations that you can
use on the saferooms to upgrade your skills before venturing forward. These are levelbased and will reset if you either die or complete the contract.

The game's mechanics are fairly simple to learn, you have 2 basic attacks that you will be using, ability to dodge and 4 slots where you can collect any drops that will boost up your chances of making it out alive. That said it's still fairly easy to make fatal errors.

The detailed steampunk world and perfected soundtrack/audio are topnotch and i enjoyed both, (Especially the soundtrack) tremendously.


But i would say that this game as fun as it is, relies heavily on co-op, and thats how it should be played. For it's price it can provide fun for you and anyone you're playing with for a long period of time. Kill to Collect is just that addictive.",1460127757,1460134162,True,23,2,0.583724021911621094,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You control a hero through arena like rooms against a group of enemies, clear one room go to the next, until you find the exit to the next floor. There are challenge rooms with more difficult groups for more rewards, at the level exit you can buy upgrades for your heroe, more attack power, speed, faster skill reload you know the drill. The controls are very smooth, if you learn the enemies attack patterns you can go on and on without loosing a bit of your health bar. Your heroes have 1 direct attack skill, a special skill like stun and an ultimate. All 4 available heroes play different. The grafics look nice, more comic style, the music is excellent. Your level upgrades are not persistent, they are lost when you start a new mission. You can get permanent perks for credits earned by the missions. Those are starter kits, like more medipacks or some power ups when you start.

You can play online with up to 4 players. No local coop.

If you like twin stick arena shooter like smash tv, this is a very good addition to your collection.

First of all the music and the title screen are amazing and set the tone of the game imidiately. This is a colorful yet violent game with an interesting world that takes you deeper and deeper below ground. 

The good stuff is focused on the core gameplay: It feels nice to shoot robots in the face with a shotgun, to dodgeroll out of danger and use all the abilites at your disposal to Kill each boss on your hitlist. The soundeffects also help sell the core feel of the game.

The things that could be improved on are things like the tutorial which feels uninspired and disconnected from the rest of the experience. I also thing that the enemydesign and upgrades could use some work, since they feel like they have been mostly copied from other titles instead of going in the same direction as the rest of the game. Having a dystoption setting with lots of color is really cool, I wish that there was a better synergy between that and the upgrades etc.

游戏要玩家清完一个房间才可以到下一个房间里，每关会有好几层每层都有一个商店里面的道具技能升级也都是随机的,重复可玩性很高。游戏有四个人物每个都比较有特色但是技能就两个再加上一个特殊道具而且角色没有等级，也就是说每次完成任务获得的能力升级都没了，但是会获得点数解锁很多有意思的东西，道具、特殊道具、皮肤等等。任务开始可以装备两个道具随着点数增加会解锁越来越多的选择。游戏模式有三个，故事模式、挑战模式（有每日挑战）、自由狩猎模式（自由选择目标敌人来挑战）

游戏画面看看截图也就那样，但是画风挺酷（毕竟赛博朋克），敌人死了会有断肢效果打击感很棒技能特效也还行。有时候会掉几帧，优化还有点问题。
现在游戏问题不多，难度挺高的要做好被虐的准备，hard难度下角色只有一滴血........什么你是抖M？那还不赶快买买买！！！

You might be able to get away with calling this a roguelike-lite, or saying it has some roguelike elements I guess, but it sure ain't Nethack or anything close.

The four playable characters are all a little different, and each have a standard attack, a special attack, and a movement ability. You also have an ultimate power that charges up as you kill things. There's only one of the four that I really don't like, which is fine with me.

There isn't any leveling up, or long standing character progression. You can earn a currency that you spend to upgrade your character, but the abilities you can pick from are randomly selected and only offer you a pair at a time. These upgrades only last for the current bounty mission you are on, so your character restarts back at square one each time you play. This isn't really an issue, just thought I'd clarify that.

You can unlock certain kits, which let you give small customization bonuses to your heroes, though. For instance, the medic kit starts you with two medkits. Some kits might start you with a secondary weapon, or various other power ups.

Each bounty you clear earns you points that go toward unlocking these kits, titles, skins, and various things like that. The overall progress is account wide, not per character, which is nice.

The game is pretty fun, but I can't speak as to how good the co-op is, because I don't have any friends oh god whats wrong with me.

I should also say that for whatever reason, this game runs pretty bad on my system. A lot worse than I'd expect. I have everything on the lowest setting, including res and the framerate is pretty awful. I don't know what the deal is, but it might be something on my end.

-awesome soundtrack
-NOT PIXEL GRAPHICS
-super smooth controls
-fun combat
-great art style
-addictive gameplay
-NOT PIXEL GRAPHICS
-co-op
-online multiplayer lobby

CONS
-online multiplayer lobby only worked to put me in a group once, and i suspect its because not many people were queued up. If this feature actually worked and grouped you when you didnt have friends online it would be awesome because:
-the game gets difficult fast, and it would be super beneficial to have easy access to a better player pool.

[b]Disclaimer[/b]: The copy of this game was provided by the developer for review purposes, yet it doesn't affect my review in any way.

[b]Few words about the game[/b]
Kill to Collect is an amazingly addictive rouge-like game, placed in cyberpunk universe. You're in control one of four Hunters and your goal is to clear out multiple levels out of any enemies you'll encounter. Invite your friends, create a team, think of some good strategy and... Kill To Collect!

[b]Advantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - Big variety of enemies
[*] - Layout of levels is randomly generated
[*] - Awesome soundtrack, perfectly fit to the theme of the game
[*] - Great replay value thanks to all unlockables and customization options
[*] - 4 characters to choose from, each with their own unique set of skills and play style
[*] - The difficulty is hard and it makes the game more rewarding than it looks like
[*] - Up to 4 players co-op mode is well made and lets players think of some nice strategies to pass the levels
[/list]

[b]Disadvantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - The story is really not clear or even visible and doesn't bring too much into the game
[*] - In story mode, game can be too challeging, which might lead to being stuck
[*] - Edit: When one of your co-op friends disconnects / looses connection with game, he automatically leaves the game with no possibility to join back until the game
[*]Edit: Chat window only appear after opening it, it doesn't show up after new message
[/list]

[b]Summary[/b]
I'm really into this game right now. Yeah, it is a bit repetitive if you're dying over and over again on the same level, but it's quite rewarding when you're finally able to get to the next lever. The main theme of this game, along with music, totally bought me - cyberpunk to me is the most amazing thing that could ever happen to games. Thanks to big amount of ways to combine all boosts, upgrades and weapons, ensures us that we won't get bored of it too quickly. The only thing that I wish to be upgraded, is an amount of playable characters or at least some additional skills to use. But except that one thing, it's a really good, I could even say, a great game, I heavily recommend it, even if it's for single player only. So yeah, now I'm going back to finish another bounty and hope one day I'll finally git gud and stop dying.
