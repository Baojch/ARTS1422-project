점프 게임입니다.
점프점프하면서 오브젝트 위를 넘어가고
목표 지점으로 이동해야하는 게임이죠.

오브젝트와의 사이에 맞춰서 점프 타이밍을 맞추면 되고,
벽을 차서 약간 2단 점프 느낌을 주기도 하는데....
뭔가 만들다가 중단된 느낌이 드는 게임입니다.

게임 모드 중 하나는 활성화 날짜가 적혀있는데 이미 그 날짜는 지나있는 상태이고,
메인 모드는 순서대로만 플레이할 수 있고 중간에 클리어한 스테이지를 이용할 수 없더군요.

Is 8 dollars a little too much for what it is currently offering? I would say so. My general rule is at least 1 dollar an hour. This game probably takes about 2 hour to get a platinum medal on every single leve.

But here's the thing, actually cannot get every achievement. Why is this? Well, its the same reason that I want to give it a negative review. The game used to have MORE LEVELS and rocket jumping. I don't really know why but they decided to remove this content alltogether.

Seitdem dieses Spiel in meiner Bibliothek liegt, habe ich es bisher einmal angefasst. Um es nach 6 Minuten wieder dezuinstallieren. Doch warum? Das erzähle ich euch in dieser Review.

[h1]Review[/h1]
Nach dem Start des Spiels werden wir von einem wunderbaren Dubstep-Soundtrack begrüßt. Dubstep, yeeeeeey.
Im Hauptmenü können wir zwischen den normalen Leveln und einen Speedrun-Modus entscheiden. Eine Story o. ä. besitzt das Spiel nicht. Also, fangen wir doch direkt mit dem Ersten der neun Leveln an. Nach ungefähr 6 Sekunden ist das Level auch schon vorbei. Man läuft eine Rampe hoch und springt über eine Säule: Ende. Nachdem wir in jedem Ziel 2 Sekunden warten müssen, und das Spiel schon fast so aussieht, als wäre es abgestürzt, weil das Menü nicht lädt, können wir direkt ins nächste Level, aufgebaut nach dem selben Schema: Lauf' die Rampe hoch und spring über ein paar Säulen. Nur das diesmal die Map größer ist, was durch die schwammige Steuerung, die teilweise unkontrollierbar ist, da der Charakter zu schnell läuft, und sobald man aufhört zu laufen sofort stoppt, dazu führt, dass man öfters herunterfällt, wodurch man entweder mühselig in das Pausemenü gehen muss, um das Level neuzustarten, oder wieder zum Anfang laufen muss, was eher eine schlechte Idee für ein Spiel, dass eigentlich auf dem Prinzip des Speedruns basiert, ist. Oh, und das Spiel hat auch Sounds, wobei ich die Soundeffekte hier keine nennen würde, da diese sich, genauso wie die Steuerung, falsch anfühlen. Selbst auf der niedrigsten Lautstärke sind diese viel zu laut (1/10). Da hilft nur noch eins: Stummschalten. Nachdem wir also ein weiteres Manko dieses Spiels eliminiert haben, geht es weiter ins nächste Level. Diesmal bin ich kurz davor ins Hauptmenü gegangen und wollte durch die Levelauswahl das Level wieder erreichen, doch ich konnte, obwohl beide Level bereits geschafft waren, nicht direkt eins davon auswählen, nur das Erste war möglich, da ich darauf keine Lust hatte, wollte ich mir den am Anfang genannten Speedrun-Modus anschauen. Oh: Coming 11/21/2017. Ehm. Das hätte ich jetzt nicht erwartet. Also mal eben auf die Steam-Seite gegangen, und geschaut, ob sich darüber schon jemand beschwert hat. Oh. ""Presently in Early Access with an anticipated exit from EA on January 17th."" Und das ist der Haken. Der Entwickler ist inaktiv und das Spiel wird seit Ewigkeiten nicht mehr weiterentwickelt. Kommen wir also zum Fazit.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]
Trotz einer schönen Optik, kann ich das Spiel aufgrund der schlecht umgesetzen Spielmechanik und dem fehlenden Inhalt nicht weiterempfehlen. Wer ein gutes Speedrun-Spiel sucht ist bei SEUM oder Clustertruck sicher besser aufgehoben.

[h1]Brief Rating and description about this game[/h1]
VThree is a SP and MP parkour race game where you must get to the objective at all costs. This game tests your reaction skills, speed and button mashing. It is important that you know that concentration is key. This game is very difficult on singleplayer when you’re against a clock but when against a real life person, this game can become insanely intense. This game is amazing and cannot wait for full launch. I rate it 7/10 for its current content. 

[h1]Highlights[/h1]
Beautiful concept
Simple but detailed graphics
Nice variety of different maps
Very optimised
Fast working developers

[h1]Dislikes[/h1]
Insanely difficult
Some Server Lag

Overall, this is a fun game. Completing levels is a bit of a challenge at first, but getting a platinum rating (or at least trying to) is really fun, albeit sometimes a little frustrating. (You may rage quit.) The concept is a fairly basic bunny hop game, with a little less speed than I've seen in some others. However, getting top ratings is not purely skill, but also involves some puzzle solving as well, as you usually have to bypass some part of the main course to get it. That being said, if you like skill-based/precision-based challenges, you should be happy.

The art style is to my own personal liking. Low-poly objects with no textures works for me. The music is good, not repetitive at all to me, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. The beginning levels are relatively simple and ease you into the core game at a good pace, but the challenge definitely scales up as you move on to other areas.

I will note that there are some areas/obstacles in which I found myself getting stuck (literally, stuck on the wall - not 'I can't beat') and in one instance, my power-up wouldn't stop firing. These are minor bugs and are not game breaking, but that can make it more time consuming to progress.

-gorgeous graphics

As it currently stands, the jump physics are driving me crazy. It's early access, so maybe that will change.

I found out about this game because I was playing Seum, which is more or less the same idea, except Seum has Super Meat Boy style traps. I have 600+ deaths on Seum in 2 hours of play. It's pretty difficult (though probably easier than SMB to be fair). Both games have you jumping platform to platform at fairly high speeds and have a variety of power ups.

So why do I not like VThree?

Simple: jump distance. It just doesn't feel right in VThree. In Seum, I can jump over numerous platforms, having to aim and lob grenades while I do it. I miss platforms all the time and die, but more often than not, I make individual jumps, just not a string of 12 when that happens.

In VThree, by the second TUTORIAL level, I was already frustrated enough with the jumping that I exited the game. 

You can never just hit forward and jump at the right time, because the platforms aren't spaced relative to your jump distances. The next platform seems to be some awkward distance that's not even close.

So if you're imagining rapid forward movement where you hold the W key and just hit space at the right time... this game isn't it. You have to not only jump at the right time, but also finesse exactly how far forward you're going. It's fiddly and it's frustrating. I'm failing jumps not because the jump itself looks difficult or because you're moving quickly and need to string a bunch of jumps together. Even basic jumps in this game are infuriating to me.

I'm all for difficult games, but something is wrong if even the tutorial is frustratingly difficult.

Now, it's early access, and one of the things they're going to change between now and release is ""Finalized Controls."" If they tweak the player's move speed / jump distance a little, with the same levels, I think I'd really like this game. But for now, having to nudge backwards while mid-air (or frequently let go of forward in an attempt to slow down so that you don't vastly overshoot the next platform) is a common sort of thing, and it's just not fun for me because of that. Almost all of these sorts of games have you more or less keep a constant move speed and relatively consistent jump distances.",1490664184,1490664184,False,3,0,0.468457639217376709,12,True,False,True,False,,,

          2nd. None of the settings in which I could change actually did something. My FOV never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. My sensitivity never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. The very little graphics options available never had any effect on playability. I couldn't even change my keybindings. Nothing would save after being changed. Even after relaunching the game and reinstalling.

So this game is about jumping, running and occasional rocket jumping. You can load up different maps and try to get the best time possible. This can also be done in multiplayers. This kinda reminds me of Trackmania, just without the cars.

At first, it takes some time to get used to the engine. In fact, it does feel kinda clunky in the beginning. But once you get the hang of it the gameplay will feel pretty smooth and rewarding which is a ton of fun. 

You basically sprint most of the time while you bunnyhop from obstacle to obstacle. Bunnyhopping works by repressing jump mid-air and holding it (like in Reflex). Strafing works by just moving the mouse. Though, you can strafe extremely tight curves while keeping your speed which allows for some crazy movement (unlike in source engine where too tight curves cancel your air-strafe). Rocketjumping works like default arena shooters, but you can't use it to gain speed at the moment. Also, there's wall-jumping. All this makes speeding through the maps pretty fun already.

The game offers great replayability value. First, it's about finishing a map. After that, it's about finding new skips and shorter routes and trying to finish those.

Since it's early access and the Steam release was just yesterday, you can except a few bugs, like a clunky game-menu or keybindings not saving after a game restart (I remember even Overwatch having this same problem though lol). Though, there aren't any gameplay impairing bugs at the moment. You can also take a look at the public roadmap or the discord server to see when these bugs are getting fixed!

So, if you like jumping/bunnyhopping mods/maps from other games you'll probably like this game too.

---------------------------

VThree est un jeu de plate-forme 3D aux graphismes dits ""Low Poly"" plutôt minimaliste fait sous Unity avec l'extension Probuilder.
Inspirer en partie par Quake 3 et surtout du mod DeFRaG qui est orienté pour la compétition de courses.
Le jeu et relativement simple à comprendre bien qu'il faut avoir une certaine maitrise de saut similaire aux bunnyhop/strafe.

Ma contribution
-----------------

J'ai essayé et testé la version Alpha au tout début du lancement.
Vu la communauté grandir de plus en plus rapidement via Discord.
Contribuer à la recherche de bugs et fait des suggestions/propositions.

Le gameplay
-------------

Le but est simple:

Trouver le chemin le plus court de n'importe quelle façon.
Une fois arriver sur le carré aux particules bleues, vous gagnez une médaille selon votre temps. (Argent, Or et/ou Platine)
Des armes sont mises à disposition comme un Plasma Gun ou encore un Gravity Gun.
Des techniques sont utilisées pour aller plus vite comme par exemple tirer avec l'arme au sol.

-Un mode solo et disponible pour l'entrainement.
-Un mode multijoueur en ligne pour faire de la compétition.
-Un éditeur de niveaux sera prochainement inclus !

Les atouts
-----------

Je pense vraiment qu'il a tout pour plaire aux fans de speedrunning/parcours.
Le jeu et plutôt jolie graphiquement.
Le design et épurer et bien fichus dans l'ensemble !
Et l'éditeur apportera une bonne durée de vie.

Autres remarques
-------------------

Une bonne écoute du développeur qui est attentif aux remarques.
Encore pleins de choses sont prévus, le jeu et peut-être en Early Access mais je confirme qu'il est en constante évolution.
N'hésitez pas à venir sur Discord si vous avez des questions et/ou suggestions !

This means:
 * You will probably fail on your first run of a level.
 * You will fail after that a lot as well till you figured out how to do all the jumps to get to the goal!
 * You will need to figure out where you have to go.
 * There will be always a shorter path than you know of.
 * Every round/run will help you to become better and faster in the current level.
 * Be ready to press that restart button of the parcour a lot of times! ('r' for restart, 't' for last checkpoint)


What I like:
 + Challenging Levels
 + A button to quickly restart the level
 + different jumping mechanisms (wall jumps, rocket jumps, change speed while jumping, ...)
 + you actually have to spend some time in the level and figure out how to solve it as quickly as possible
 + there are different ways to solve a level
 + worldwide Leaderboard in Multiplayer
 + the goal is to solve a level as quickly as possible, but the game also allows you to do the level on your own speed. That means you can also take all the time you need and do it really slow, what might help to find a good way to solve a level.

What can be improved: 
 - At this moment only 7 levels (Will probably get better as soon as the Level Editor is implemented)
 - In some levels you have to look at the ground a lot, because of the rocket jumps. I know there is probably no different way to do this, but I don't really enjoy looking at the ground that much. But that might be also just me XD


The random talk:
This game reminded me a little bit of Clustertruck when I first discovered it and I loved Clustertruck. And I have to say I wasn't wrong. I really enjoy playing the game and I really love the challenge that the game gives you. There is always a way to complete a level even faster than your last run!

The only downside is currently, that there aren't too many levels (7 levels). But as soon as the Level Editor will be implemented I'm sure there will be a huge variety of levels to choose from, since everyone will be able to create their own levels then.

The Multiplayer has a worldwide leaderboard by the way :) So it's made for all the speedrunners out there that wan't to show off their record time ;)",1488324003,1491687872,True,6,0,0.537511646747589111,2,False,True,True,False,,,

It's early access, but it has great platforming and gameplay, along with support across all OSes and relatively low PC requirements. But there is one thing I think should be added to the game:

Splitscreen/Couch Multiplayer. Useful for parties and stuff. Preferably, splitscreen games could be online games and have other players join.

I haven't seen anyone alse mention that, but I think it would be a great addition to the game. But obviously the main game and its levels should be worked on first.
