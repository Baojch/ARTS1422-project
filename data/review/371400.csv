My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1709665880,1709665880,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Repeat over and over, killing one more enemy each time. 11/10 hardcore survival indeed.[/b]

A friend gave this game to me and I was excited to play it because I enjoy base management and survival gameplay. I had a pretty mediocre experience, which is why I am not recommending this game.

[b]Pros:[/b]

-very challenging gameplay; emphasis on bullet dodging 
-encourages advanced techniques (ex: bunnyhopping on your shield to propel you to or away from enemies)
-interesting HUD concept (zoom in to player character to see all relevant details like health bar, resources, etc)
-no hand-holding - brief tutorial, most interactions in the game you must find out for yourself
-good amount of base management elements - every action requires some type of resource
-decent sounds and music
-not demanding on the hardware at all
-has Steam trading cards

[b]Cons:[/b]

-brutal difficulty means you will die often while you get your bearings, potentially turning people off
-understanding what to do inside the base can sometimes be unintuitive, prompting use of more trial-and-error 
-a bit lacking in aesthetics; simple designs 
-better base management survival games available as alternatives
-current price - $5.49 CAD - is a bit too steep in my opinion, better to wait for it to be in a bundle deal or discounted more

Do not recommend.

With this last update, the game is now 100% playable for me!! So, while I stand by my first-review statements that it looks great and that I think it's a great concept, I can now wholeheartedly recommend you play this...well, except for the slight hitch that I have no damn clue what I'm doing most of the time...but I'll get the hang of it soon I reckon, I'll just keep plugging away until I figure it out because that's part of the fun of this game for me ;)

I realize this game is for a specific type of gamer. I've only just put a bit of time in but the game is solid. Definitely an unusual artistic style, simplistic, but I think it fits the game. Play this game on fantastic, and it looks pretty great on a 1080p screen. I like how the screen kind of rotates to give a more 3d  I think the art style emphasizes solid clear lines, and a lot of white, because fighting outside can be pretty hectic. Having a white/grey background really helps enemies stand out.
Game play wise is where I think this game shines. The combat is responsive, and I haven't played a game where you can hover with a shield and use it to block bullets. It is definitely unique, and the developer has nailed a good feeling with it.

The whole resource system is pretty neat, with you starting with few resources at the beginning. How well you fight the initial monsters sets the tone for how well you'll do. It can be pretty easy for the generators to lose power quickly at the beginning, and then the doors are forced open, allowing enemies to attach antenna. Combat is hard, but can be learned quickly and after a few try's I was lasting much longer.

Only gripes  I have:

If you reach negative level 10, you fail and get sent to the main screen. Starting a new game is fast, but having to go through tutorial is a small drag. Thankfully you can skip pretty quikcly, but having the option to start in a new game right away would've been nice.

Some advice:
I think the game is vague on purpose on some mechanics like saving, and being able to teleport to the top of the base. But to save basically generator needs to have enough power, and when you do save it takes a lot of power so be strategic when saving. To teleport I will let you guys figure that out on your own.

Playing I reliazed how long it would take to escape just staying at base. It would take hours! Then I realized I could venture out to collect antenna boxes. Collecting one adds 5 percent to total antenna progress. Not sure what happens when reaching 100% but I can't wait!

Overall I'd highly recommend this game. It is really challenging game, and innovative how and indie should be. Don't think this is a roguelike or any other genres you've played, it's been an awesome mixture of many it seems. The price was worth it to me.
