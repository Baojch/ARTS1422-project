In many such games, the choices are largely cosmetic, leading down a generally same plot path. For example, one could put points into skill A rather than B, and in another play through the reverse, and you'd end up with largely the same story, just with some changes in how events unfolded. Nothing truly wrong with that if the story is well written, but the illusion of choice is broken once you reach the second or third playthroughs.

Not so with Choice of Robots. Here, small changes and conscious choices lead your character's story and the world state down wildly divergent paths. This makes the game truly an RPG, with many new things to explore even after several play through (as of this this writing, I've completed about 10 already).

There are a couple of other small things that I appreciate. First is how you can select what kind of dream your character has. These dreams set the stage and mood for the game world in that playthrough, whether it's one of a robot utopia, apocalyptic warscapes, or a love story. It doesn't set your path in stone, but it's nice that you can set up what kind of story you wish to read today.

Second is how the story wraps itself up nicely at the end. There have been some good choose your own adventure stories that I've read before, but some of them end on a cliffhanger, awaiting a sequel that that may never come. This leaves a slight feeling of dissatisfaction for me because I want to know the outcome of my choices in the story, an outcome that (1) I likely won't ever get to read, or (2) having played the first part a few times, forget what character I'm actually playing when moving on to the next part. It's nice that in Choice of Robots, each playthrough is self-contained and concludes itesilf well, lending itself to multiple satisfying playthoughs.

❤ Une écriture simple et détaillée ce qui embarque très rapidement dans l'histoire
❤ Beaucoup d'embranchements différents pour une très bonne rejouabilité, et qui ont un impact sur chaque aspect de l'histoire (moral, politique, social..)
❤ Des succès assez divertissants à débloquer

✖ Autant le jeu n'a pas besoin d'illustrations car le texte suffit à laisser place à l'imagination. Par contre, je trouve que le support est assez fade, et ça manque d'ambiance musicale à mon goût (j'ai ouvert Spotify à côté xD)

So you must take decision of how you will build your robot, what decisions will you make in the different scenarios that the book proposes and read what happens.

At the moment of this review i have readed the book two times (took me around 2.5-3 hours each one). I enjoyed the stories that I did get and I am tempted to do a third try.

Of the things I didn’t like is the profile of the characters which you can “interact”, the information about them is too vague so they are practically unknow but the stories treat them like acquaintances. In my opinion this game needs a biography for these characters (the ones that you are supposed to know from your past), so when they appear on the stage you can check if you must trust then or not with some decisions.

Regardless, this game offers many possibilities and routes that I found myself willingly replaying to try and reach certain outcomes. There's something magical about empowering your imagination in this way that I really can't describe. 

However, this is just an observation, but it seems most of the love options blend together near the end of the narrative with sentences being repeated with name changes. At least, this was how the narrative was presented with Bastian in my first run and Silas in my second. I can't keep Elly around long enough to comment on her romance but I imagine it is quite similar. Each romance seems to be different in the beginning and middle of the narrative, although. 

Beware though, like most or all Choice of Games games, there is no save option. You must deal with your choices and their consequences; I mean, it would take away from the narrative otherwise. You can't reload a save in real life, now can you? 

Highly recommend this experience and get ready to replay multiple times.

〇 You pass on it. Wayyy too much reading. I mean, a game without pictures? Really? Snooze.

You add the game to your cart and checkout (- Wealth), then go to get something to drink while it installs. You get your favorite (a chocolate coffee porter... Mmm), sit down at your computer, and open up the game. It opens windowed. The formatting is simple, just a big block of text. You push up your glasses and get to reading.

As you read, the story draws you in more and more. You're charmed by the contemporary writing style. It's easy to digest, but descriptive enough that you really feel immersed in the world.

If I give my robot child a gun for an arm, will it backfire on me?

There was a lot to like about this game (so far). The author clearly knew his stuff and the technical details to the subject matter, not choosing to skimp out on such details despite the incredibly fast pace. Also the stats bar gave the story a helpful ""game feel"" without being excessive. Another positive point to the game (some would say the focal point) is that the choices really do matter so the game title isn't clickbait at all. I was pretty shocked at how frequent the choices were and how judging by how many more achievements I have left, the impact of damn near every choice. It gives me a lot of motivation to explore the story as much as I can. There is also a great scale in the game with the story spanning 30 years and due to this, the game succeeds in touching on the jingoistic reality of war and change quite well in a broad sense. For example, it is jarring (in a good way) to see the world's change from showing your robot to elementary school children on a regular day and a bloody global robot war with prison and death.

As for what I thought could have been improved on, I felt the relationships (excluding the one with your robot) were rather fleeting. My main side characters were Elly and Mark with brief appearances (appropriately due to my rejections) from Josh, Juliet, and Tammy.  My main side characters would make appearances and have dialogue but the sheer breakneck speed of the story often didn't jive with their static characterizations. Ironically, the human characters felt like vaguely defined robots while the robot felt like a human in my playthrough. This plays into my previous praise of the visceral change of the world as the characters felt like NPCs in an otherwise alive world. The exception to his (besides the Robot) would be the mother to me. She felt extremely human and warm particularly in her words of wisdom. The fact that she wasn't a character listed in the Relationships portion of the stats was the right call.

Another thing was that in my playthrough, the positive innovative businessman portion of the story turned out to be far less important and relevant than the war and invasion part of the story. I was rather inspired by the former so to see the switch was bittersweet. This is not a criticism by any means because it's likely that my choices caused all this.  I just felt I should mention it since this is a review.

Overall, the game is great. The choices are frequent and weighty, the scale and events of the game are compelling, and I was left quite gripped. The misgivings I have are largely due to the breakneck speed of the story as that breakneck speed was the cause of the somewhat under-characterized human characters and seemingly the decreased relevance of the first half to he story. However, if you're used to such pacing (think of a 2 hour movie that aims to cover decades of someone's life with several timeskips), this shouldn't really be a problem. A movie-length story covering 30 years of someone's life and a 100 episode series doing the same are just two different writing beasts. Hopefully, I'll like Josh and Juliet and whatever other side character I haven't seen yet to a greater degree in my replays. The achievement descriptions just seem so different and varied which gets me really excited. A CYOA game that is actually choosing your own adventure!

До этой игры мне казалось что над фильмами/играми ТАК плакать могут только дети, но теперь я понимаю, что всё подругому.

I'm a fast reader, so I enjoy these text-based games usually as a way to get a great story I get to take part in telling that slowly develops over time. But here, I found myself completely underwhelmed and just about finishing two playthroughs in less than two hours. 

I was hoping for nuance, complicated characters that I'd grow to come close to, stuff that Choice of Games usually excells in, but here every choice was incredibly obvious. Make your robot more human, good ending, make it less attached from humanity, bad ending, war, etc etc. I was hoping there'd be a twist of some sort where your actions would change, but the stats are literally built against you in this game. If you don't have enough military, your robot can't fight- if you don't have enough humanity, your robot isn't compassionate, you get the deal. There's barely any middle ground where you're able to design the robot you want while also allowing them to have heart, which I feel like misses the message that they can be human just like us- humans aren't always gentle, we have rough edges too.

This is more of a challenge than I think many would assume, since reading page after page on a screen can be quite tiresome and have your attention shift compared to a physical book. It's easy to overwhelm the reader and for sentences to bleed together. And yet, keeping yourself concise can also rob your story of emotion, tension and drive, making it too dry to truly engage with. Striking that balance is the sign of a great writer and it's a great accomplishment of this game.

The writing in this game is more of a subtle guide than an overbearing presence, but still manages to have a lot of striking imagery, a smart structure and moving interactions between characters. I love the conversations in this game, they are thoughtful and fulfilling and heartbreaking in just the right ways. Playing this game is like walking a tightrope, capturing the struggle of the robotics engineer designing the robot of the future vividly as you, and they, do your best to make the world better instead of worse. It's a very human struggle, aiming for perfection and hitting something less-than but also unexpected and interesting. 

If there is anything to criticise it might be the lack of surprises in following playthroughs. The game can have very different outcomes, but it also follows the same tracks and storybeats every time. It means that your relationship with different characters might be different but it doesn't change the meetings and obstacles you encounter that much, at least in my experience. I might have just been unlucky, but where my first playthrough felt like an absolute marvel my second playthrough fell a bit flat in comparison.

However, there is no doubt in my mind that Choice of Robots is worth playing. I think this game is good enough to be entertaining to pretty much everyone, even the people who might not like CYOA games normally.

If you want to try an interactive novel, Choice of Robots is a good start. It's well worth the asking prize and belongs in the library of all, who love a good story.  

[h1] Writing [/h1] 
Choice of Robots is the gold standard for interactive text based games. Here your decisions matter. The story has been tailored so well to the player choices, it sometimes feels like you experience it yourself. Contributing to this are the believable and sometimes unexpected outcomes and the well written characters. All characters have believable motivations and take comprehensible actions. To sum it up: The writing is good, even by novel standards. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
There is little gameplay to be found in this interactive novel. The player has frequent opportunities to make a choice, but that's about it. If you are okay with that, you will not be disappointed, because the story is great. 

[h1] Recommendation [/h1] 
Choice of Robots is more than worth the asking prize. In fact this interactive novel is a true gem of the genre. I recommend this game to everyone, who likes to read. Even people, which usually don't play games, should have a good time with it. That's how good this game is.

2) Хикка-геймер создает себе секс-робота, храня его в секрете от других людей, а потом сам переносит свое сознание в робота, чтобы вечно жить со своей робо-подругой.

3) Миллиардер жертвует все свое состояние на благотворительность и создает новую религию - робославие.

4) Доктор роботехнических наук создает фабрику по производству собственных роботов, но делает их слишком независимыми, и они захватывают страну.

I noted the lack of gender-neutral pronouns as the most prominent problem to me. I feel like this game would be more user-friendly if there was a they/them or gender-nonconforming option. Not just for the player, but for the robots as well.
Additionally, the game repeatedly tries to engage the player in romance, giving neutral to bad reactions when romance was declined. This isn't very friendly to aromantic people. I understand that actions have consequences, but I feel like the consequences shouldn't be so harsh. It dampened my experience to read that a creation of mine ran away, mostly because I didn't love them romantically and therefore couldn't form that bond that was crucial for later in the story.
The writing also got a bit bland, with some problems being drawn out and the same problems becoming overly reoccurring. With my choices, I found myself being driven repeatedly into dead ends, furthering the negative experience. There is also one spelling mistake near the beginning, but it didn't affect me. Just an observation.

Overall, with the lack of openness about character customization and the other problems mentioned above, it affected my experience greatly. The story was great in itself, but the lack of inclusion ruined part of it for me. I won't play again very much, but in the end, it was an okay game.

And laugh. And curse. And shake my head.

The following details of one of my playthroughs contain spoilers. STOP READING HERE.
Or don't: there's a lot more outcomes than this, and a lot more tragic or semi-tragic things possible to happen along the way.

Reaching singularity with a well balanced robot was quite amazing: my best playthrough so far: I even managed to stay on friendly terms with everyone (even the Prof and Captain Rogers who I joined in crimefighting Superhero costumes (that part was almost a bit too ridiculous for me)). Earlier when I was sent to prison for warning my chinese friend I got a little worried, but after a while President Irons pardonned me, and later I was able to reunited with Emmy after moving to Hope, Canada where we went on to laying down flowers at the site of an internation camp from the Sino-American war. - The times when I really cried was, when I gave control over everything to my robot, and he was just perfect for it. - That part where he told me how he was caring about the dead sparrow sent shivers down my spine... - it felt like the best possible outcome.

The way this game determines a plethora of possible outcomes by simple skill-checks and presenting lots of dilemmas reminded me of Age of Decadence. But Age of Decadence is a RPG where one playthrough takes 15-30h, and you have to do all the usual RPG stuff. - Whereas here it's purely the story / decisions, and you can do multiple playthroughs in one evening. And here the things happening can be of a much grander scale, as the world and decisions only exists in text and don't have to be modeled in a traditional RPG form.",1607619384,1607619589,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

前面还算正常，等到中国出场时整个剧情彻底失控，疯狂夹带私货。另一个中文差评里总结的很好了，这里我贴一下原文，感受一下：

第一段：
[i]""This Chinese company stole my designs—I have no idea how! But now they're undercutting my prices with their cheap labor and cheap raw materials."" 
""Can you testify before Congress that the designs are stolen?"" Josh queries anxiously. ""If you do, they might embargo the robots, and that will keep U.S. Robots afloat. They said I need an expert witness who isn't in my company, and I've hired everybody else who's good."" [/i]
....（这里选择作证）
[i]Based on your testimony, Congress passes a law banning the import of all Chinese robots. 
In retaliation, China cuts off all exports of rare earths and the batteries derived from them. [/i]

在2020年的当下，有没有感觉这个剧情很眼熟？

第二段：
[i]""This must be the parade for the Prime Minister of China. Can we go see, Master?"" [/i]
在这里我开始疑惑，为什么在美国会有为中国主席进行的游行？
[i]""Sure,"" you say. ""Why not?"" Now that L mentions it, you think you saw something about this on Reddit: the Chinese Prime Minister is visiting San Francisco to discuss trade issues with President Irons. [/i]
这里正常人都会理解为，首相在会见美国总统对吧？
[i]You emerge from your apartment into the crowd of red-shirted, flag-waving supporters, mostly Chinese. You have the sense this kind of groundswell of support for a politician outside of his home country isn't normal, like maybe these supporters were paid. But that could just be an American point of view; you're not sure.  [/i]
作者自己带偏见写的剧情，还要辩解一下。

[b]重头戏来了[/b]

[i]Further down the street, you see the vanguard of the parade: dancers dressed as gods of the ancient Chinese pantheon. They wear Chinese opera masks, bear banners with river dragons on their backs, and twirl bared swords. 
Behind the sword dancer vanguard, you see a troupe of men wearing the Chinese tunic suits sometimes called ""Mao suits"" and carrying little, red books. They are the ones singing the song, now growing more insistent as the parade draws closer. Behind them, you see a legion of men in modern Chinese military dress uniforms. With the ancient past, more recent past, and the present covered, you surmise whoever comes next will be meant to symbolize China's future. 
At the end of the parade, a Chinese man in a suit stands in an all-red, winged convertible, waving at the crowd. It is one of the sleek, new, Chinese-made flying cars, the Tian Eight, a symbol of China's rise.  [/i]
.....(中国主席被抗议者枪杀)
[i]The Chinese contingent is massacred, and the Chinese government vows vengeance. The first shots of the Robot War have been fired. 
A year into the war, China attacks Taiwan. Chinese drones harry the nearby American carriers, keeping American bombers and fighters at bay while their transports bring wave upon wave of robot warriors to the shores. There is a bloodbath in the streets which the United States is powerless to prevent; the Chinese robots kill soldiers and civilians alike. 
Taiwan is taken, and the headlines that appear across the world the next day are changed by Chinese hackers to read ""China Finally Unified.""  [/i]

我已经无力吐槽了，这个诡异的游行，“gods of the ancient Chinese pantheon”，“Chinese opera”， ""Mao suits"" 。一开始我还以为被枪杀的只是个主席的cosplay，看到后面才发现居然是本人？？？他妈的一国首相去另一个国家大街上领导游行？？？作者有中二病吗？然后就是非常草率的明目张胆的他杀，再然后就开始战争了？？？然后中国进军台湾，在你们美国保护不到的地方，屠杀台湾人？？？？Are you fucking serious?

在这里我就弃游了。还有，别以为只是涉及政治的剧情有问题，这游戏主打的有AI，30万字，横跨30年，剧情丰富。可事实上里面科研过程极其幼稚，剧情以一种十分荒谬的速度发展，明明前后感觉时间没过多久，你点开统计信息才发现过了2年，词汇量要求也不高。真想玩文字游戏的推荐去玩sunless sea，150万单词，世界观合理自洽，比这个垃圾好多了。

Baue ich für das Militär eine unbesiegbare Kampfmaschine? Wird sie zweckentfremdet? Durch das Militär? Durch mich? Geht die Welt daran zugrunde?

Oder baue ich einen Helfer für die Menschheit? Welchen Teil davon? Welche Schichten? Welche Nationen? Für mich und den Ruhm? Oder nur für den Reichtum? Gar einen weisen Herrscher? Und darf man ihm vertrauen?

Oder lasse ich meinen empfindungsfähigen Roboter autark werden, also zu einem echten Individuum? Brenne ich mit ihm durch? Stelle ich mich denjenigen, die ihn haben wollen? Verliebe ich mich in ihn? Was geschieht, wenn unsere Liebe durch meinen Tod enden muss? Muss sie das?

I also love scifi and robots and stuff. So I might be a bit biased when it comes to anything robot/android/etc related, because I love this game.

It has an interesting setting (maybe a bit cliché?), and I like that everyone can shape the 'playable character' as they want. It's something that's often lacking in games. In text-based, and otherwise. So that's a great thing to have. You don't have to be the 'straight white guy' anymore, and that is something that I desperately needed when I was younger. And, well, still do I suppose.

The game makes you think, and that's awesome! Making choices, and seeing how they play out is the reason I loved CYOA books as a kid. I would read them over and over again, and they were such an inspiration to me. Hence I wanted to buy this game.

I found the science behind robot-making pretty vague, but it didn't bother me as such. Too much detail would've made this game a bit too heavy for some people. It's just an observation, and it really didn't affect my opinion of the story, or the execution.

But, although the premise is amazing, and the characters are likable, I feel that the game lacks... something. It needs something more. This game barely scratched the surface of what could've been, and I can't help but feel that this game is incomplete regarding that area. The relationships with other characters (especially romantic ones) feel hollow, and rushed. Everything seems a  bit glossed-over, and I just hope that they would've given you more insight as to what kind of people/robots the other characters are. Because all you see are glimpses. And for me, it's not enough. I would've loved to be able to read more about how different relationships play out, and have more control over them. 

In three hours I played this game twice. So... It's not that long. ""A 300,000-word epic interactive sci-fi novel"" feels like it's a bit of an oversell. Sure, the total word count is probably 300K, I'm not saying it ain't. It's a short game, with a lot of possibilities and different scenarios. I laughed, and I cried while playing this. Especially when something bad happened. It it 'epic'? Well, Merriam-Webster would disagree, but I think it's just that. It is epic. In the urban dictionary way.

I'll buy more of these games, though. And I highly recommend this game. Every single game, book etc. has its weaknesses. It's not a bad thing, but I just wanted to point out the things that bothered me. Maybe I was bothered by the lack of substance, and descriptions, because my taste in literature, and my own style of writing is completely different. But, all in all, a great game and an amazing experience. I'm going to return to this game again, and again. Why?

Because it gives me choices, and it gives me power to change the things that will be. It's fun seeing how time is not linear, and how you can affect the future with your own actions.

10/10 would recommend to someone with ADHD. It's easier to concentrate on reading when you gotta make decisions. Just sayin'.",1588505449,1588505449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's very well written, things happen to the PC, and (for better or worse) you choose (usually from several choices) how to respond to what is happening.

Your choices matter in Choice of Robots, because every choice you make has the potential to either impact yourself, others, or the world.  It's usually made clear (roughly) how your choices will impact the story, but the game is very good at delivering surprises, and throwing a curve ball at you from time to time.

While the story is largely very colourful and vibrant at times, there a few roads that you can stumble down that lead the story down a very bleak and sometimes narrow pathway.  Although it is quite possible to jump off the slippery slope, it's normally a very slow tumble, and the game can be ""somewhat"" forgiving, especially if you catch yourself slipping early on.

When it comes to building your robot, I found the experience very nostalgic, though through a somewhat poignant lens, as it reminded me of younger happier days that have since passed away like leaves in the wind.  Days spent playing with K-nex, Legos, and Machano, days that have come and gone.

I'm not really used to writing reviews of things that have no graphics or music whatsoever, so consider this just a random bundle of my comments and observations after finishing a single playthrough. Thus far, I could say ""Choice of Robots"" is:

*An extremely solid and impressive piece of 'hard' science - fiction

* a glorified, three times the ""Hobbit"" or  nearly ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and a half long personality quiz 

* Astonishingly well written by someone with a vast knowledge regarding the subject he is writing about and also having a great taste in science-fiction classics

* giving you an insane amount of replayability and freedom of choice (my complete playthrough has earned me 5 out of 72 achievements which gives me a rather clear idea of just how many different paths wait to be discovered)

* best read around midnight, with some  whisky and Solar Fields playing in the background (although Carbon Based Lifeforms would also do )

* giving your character a rating of '44% liked' from someone you have just killed

* fully deserving its Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam

Nigdy dotąd nie pisałem recenzji czegoś co nie posiada żadnej warstwy audiowizualnej, więc potraktujcie proszę tą wypowiedź raczej jako luźny zwitek wrażeń po pierwszym ‘przejściu’ tej ‘gry’. Niniejszym, „Choice of Robots” jest:

* niezwykle solidnym kawałkiem twardej, spekulatywnej fikcji naukowej

* długim jak trzy Hobbity albo prawie Drużyna Pierścienia i pół quizem pt. „Jakim Robotem Jestem?”

* zadziwiająco dobrze napisany, przez osobę która posiada rozległą wiedzę na temat który wybrała a do tego posiada bardzo dobry gust dotyczący klasyki science-fiction

* czymś co można przechodzić znowu i znowu. Po pierwszym ukończeniu odblokowałem 5 z 72 osiągnięć co daje dość jasny obraz tego jak wiele różnych ścieżek czeka na odkrycie

* najlepiej czytany w okolicach północy, ze szklaneczką whisky i Solar Fields’ami grającymi po cichu w słuchawkach ( chociaż Carbon Based Lifeforms też daje radę... )

* grą która ocenia postać głównego bohatera jako „ w 44% lubianą” przez osobę którą właśnie zabiłem

* niedostępny po polsku

这两天玩了一下以Choice of Robots为代表的互动小说（不是视觉小说，是纯文本choose your own adventure），突然意识到这个类型其实是不可替代的，因为它有着独立于小说与游戏以外的复合表达属性：舍弃了一切视听要素，互动小说试图用语言来描述一切，会在每个选项分歧中写出“你”的动机与该选项的性质（有时甚至会暗示部分后果，虽然有时候也会被用来欺诈），比如以下案例：

（“你”创造出了一个人工智能小生命）
你把她放在了房间中央，让她随意探索。但起初，她看起来好像被过多的可能性淹没了。

你决定教她形容这一情绪：

· “困惑。”然后我给她下达了一个更可靠的、直白的指令。
· “好奇。”我允许她自行决定如何行动。
· “孤独。”我站远了一点，以强化这一例证。

我选择了第二个选项，但第一个选项让我能想象到重生以前（在游戏开局时，我选择的出生点是在机械阿努比斯面前忏悔，因为在创造机械生命时过度重视其思考能力、忽略了共情，最终导致了机器人革命。阿努比斯让我看见高度智能化的机器人已经学会优先攻打医院、杀死人类婴儿的画面，让我重来一次，好好想想这回该干什么）人类会被毁灭的原因，第三项则让我产生了强烈的共鸣，但我不希望、尤其是在知道原本的未来以后尤其不希望我的“孩子”是在这样的意识下长大。第二选项未必就是健康的，但我希望不论是未来的自己、还是初生的这个孩子，都能拥有好奇的自由。
尽管我要做的只是三选一，但这三个选项分别用不同的方式对我的理解和情感产生了影响，也都加深了我在扮演文中角色时的代入感。

互动小说强调的，并不仅仅是“你选择了什么”，还有“你本可以选择什么其他的”，或者说在每一次选择中“你失去了什么”。
这在小说或游戏（顺带一提，我倾向于认为互动小说就是互动小说，带有游戏性质但不是狭义游戏）里偶有发生，但绝对不会是常态，因为完整列出每一种可能性、其动因、性质、结果……在小说中是累赘的，次数过多必然会破坏行文结构的流畅性；而在游戏中，视听要素的参与分散了文字的表达功能，使得文字描述从一开始就无法跟其他表现形式绝对对等，往往退居二线不说，玩家的注意力也不会长期集中在大片的文字上。

现在的互动小说之所以会衰落，仅存的相对流行的大多都改头换面以所谓视觉小说的形式掺杂部分视听要素来拓展受众，主因正是创作者们抛开了互动小说的特性，没有去放大这种复合的多线并行的传达属性，只跟小说比文字剧情、跟游戏比交互模式视听质量，可谓扬短避长了，实在可惜。
不过当然了，也有外因，这类游戏的多语言化成本高得离谱，市场原本就日益小众，还很分散，赚钱实在困难，也就更难吸引优秀的创作者，进入恶性循环了。",1581042022,1581042022,True,19,0,0.710984289646148682,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played several times just trying to increase those skills alone to see the differences in those numbers (""Internationally Famous and Mentioned in History Text Books for example"").  

The game allows you to explore your feelings about war, unemployment, wealth, and other things all through your robots.  For instance, will your company and robots participate in a war?  Perhaps as non-combatants?  Will you replace human workers?  Do robots deserve wages?  Rights?  Feelings?  If they do demand wages, do you interject code to lower their autonomy?

Choice of Robots is a choice-based novel focusing on you creating artificially intelligent robots, where your choices influence the entire world in many different ways. Because there's literally no gameplay, music, or graphics, this allowed for the developers to create a game where every single choice matters to the main story. Even down to dialogue options, your choices can shape the world, ranging from you doing absolutely nothing and being a loser to taking over Alaska. The main story is technically a conflict between China and the US, which you can entirely circumvent, as well as how much sentience a robot should have. As your progress to the game, your ""stats"" will change based on choices which unlock new options and different branches, resulting in many different endings. The writing itself is mostly well-done, although at times you'll wish you could say or do certain things, but are obviously limited in the choices you can actually make.

It should be reiterated that this is a choose-your-own adventure novel and could barely be classified as a game. The only ""gamey"" parts are the progression and RPG mechanics as your stats go up and down. The sheer amount of possibilities and scenarios you optionally deal with makes this something you will want to play over and over again. However, since there's so much replay value, it'd be nice if there was a mechanic where if you already did a choice it will tell you what stats that choice effects, so you don't have to reread everything. Overall, this is the best of these types of ""games"" I played on here.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Excellent story
[*]Many, many choices to experiment with
[*]Unexpected outcomes, as well as choices you hoped for that actually appear
[*]Romantic options are fun
[*]You can take over Alaska
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]This is not a game
[*]Yet still a lot of it can be ""cheesed"" once you play through more than once
[*]It's annoying to go through the more minor sections over and over again sometimes
[*]Your choices can be limited by extremely strict requirements
[*]No mention of if water is a weakness of the robots

I am currently receiving my postgraduate education in London. I really enjoy my life here in London, especially all the museums and galleries that we lack, but I don't think London, or any other metropolises are far better than Shanghai in terms of modernization. So please stop portraying Shanghai as a clumsy duplicate of an 'advanced western city'. We do not have any fake castles as the author imagined, but we do have a real one in our Disney Resort.
There are also a lot of outdated details about China. Unfortunately the author's knowledge of China is only limited to the old times, and most probably to what presented by the western media (as they wish).

L'aventure est courte mais les embranchements sont nombreux, les personnages sont marquants et l'écriture, sans être incroyable non plus, à son petit charme qui fait qu'on y plonge sans regard en arrière : à la manière d'un bon bouquin, finalement ! 

Le principe est simple, vous êtes à l'origine d'avancées technologies importantes : votre personnage est un concepteur de robots qui a ensuite une liberté de choix très éclectiques, allant de la volonté de dominer le monde à celle de donner naissance à une nouvelle entité intelligente. C'est un jeu qui s'adresse avant tout à tous les fous de transhumanisme, de technologies futuristes et de sciences fictions philosophiques (Ray Bradbury, Aldous Huxley, Isaac Asmimov, Philip K.

I had no recommendations for me to play this game, nor was I aware of any of its content prior to playing. My first playthrough was completely blind, and after finishing, I thought I had the game figured out. Subsequent playthroughs were attempts to circumvent catastrophes I had experienced previously, and every time, I was caught by surprise with something new. Immense replay value, although there are segments, especially near the beginning, where the reading material will essentially be the same no matter what choices are made. I appreciate being able to copy text directly out of the game to save for later, as some of the content is interesting to me either philosophically or just in general relative to the narrative. I believe the title would benefit from at least a sort of map branch or indicator of everything you've done in a visual format, though. The pacing is not problematic, the concepts did not seem hamfisted, and all variants I experienced of the story felt unique and engaging. There's more to it, but I think that itself should be enough.

-Replayable/greatly varied playthroughs
-Thematic exploration
-Plot twists
-Notable stat mechanic

-Slightly repetitive
-No visual branching indicators/charts

First of all, building a robot described as such in the story can’t be a one-man job. Author made it sound like so simple and throw in some buzz words like “Natural language processing”, “Go programming language”, “machine learning”. Are those words supposed to make dumb people to feel good about themselves? Anyone has decent knowledge on any of the computer science topic presented in this book would just laugh their ass off at this brainless plot. Then there is lack of options to just have a passage to a good ending. There are plenty of opportunities for player could just exit with a good fortune but no such option was ever offered by the game. What a f****** shame!

As an advid reader with an interest in artifical intellegence I found this game to be quite interesting a fun. Below are the things I liked and disliked most about my experience with it.

Pros:
- It has many different endings.
- It still plays somewhat like a game due to a stat system that determines what choices you can make. 
- It has plently of choices in every chapter that feel like they actually matter. 

Cons:
- This game is almost entirely made of words. If you don't like reading or games about AI then I don't recommend this.
- Despite having tons of choices the game doesn't give you a choice tree to reference.
- Getting achievements is pretty much up to chance unless you have a guide because of all of the branching paths.
- Saving makes you save in that exact spot. You cannot jump back to the middle of a previous chapter unless that point was the last time you saved. That means you can't jump around in the story much. 

Despite these cons however, I still found the game extremely enjoyable. The lack of a choice tree and teh ability to jump around on it was not annoying to me while I played. After all, nobody jumps around in a book or it wouldn't make sense.

In summary, this ""game"" (more of a long, interactive fiction novel) is essentially about humanity, the kind of person you are, your willingness to sacrifice work for your social relationships and vice versa. There's really something for everyone in this game. There's engineering to it and design, you can build a robot. There's financial decisions such as managing company treasuries, selling shares and taking out loans. There's politics if you get involved with the military and/or war. There's social aspects and even romance if you so choose to get involved with one of the many bachelors and bachelorettes, which excellently portrays the commonly shared struggle of juggling your relationships and friendships with your desire to pursue your passion. Ultimately, you can't maintain a good relationship with everyone, and the guilt and sadness the game causes you to feel over this feels lifelike, as if you're going through everything in real life. The game isn't perfect; there are some plot holes here and there but ultimately, amazing purchase, highly worth playing through again and again. As for endings, there's a gigantic plethora of them. Unlike many story choice games, literally every one of your choices matter and so much thought and effort was put into all of the writing. To sum up how different the endings can get;
First Play through: I built a humanoid robot who knew how to love and I married a girl who was a designer and I bought an artsy looking factory in silicon valley. America won the war and I moved with my wife and two robots (one of which fell in love with me) to Hope, Canada where I survived until the end of the game surrounded by loved ones in a lakeside cottage.
Second play through: I was a money hungry jerk who bought a dirt cheap factory in a sketchy neighborhood in Detroit and paid human workers minimum wage to do hard labor. I angered the president because I wouldn't fund her campaign and my factory went bankrupt and I died broke and alone because my robot felt I didn't understand him and ran away.

If I had one criticism it would be about the romance. In one of my games I was seperated from my wife, Elly, and when it skipped forward years later and I found out she was in a concentration camp. I would have loved to have an arc where I look for Elly after getting out of prison. Not only would it be a compelling mytery, but it would build onto relationship development and ultimately lead to a satisfying reunion where the reader could see a more on screen demonstration of their feelings for each other and how grateful they are to see each other as opposed to their love having to be left to the reader's imagination. (I am not talking about sex btw, I realize it kinda sounds like that) Also, towards the end, it feels as though whoever your romantic partner is is kind of...unempathetic?? Like when they find oout the mc is dying, they don't show a ton of concern. Theres just one night where you have a tender moment and then have sex. I just wish there was a bit more emotion, as in real like finding out a loved one is dying would take a much bigger emotional toll on someone. For instance, what if each romance option had a different flaw that would come out of repression when you become sick? Perhaps one deals with self esteem issues that they can't do more, maybe one deals with abandonment issues because they don't want to lose you like they did somebody else important in their life. Maybe one becomes overly clingy and protective, scared that you're a ticking time bomb. It would really help individualize the characters and it would make the intimate relationship the character shares with them not only more flawed and realistic, but tender and enjoyable to play through.

Great game though, give it 30 minutes and try not to get absolutely hooked.",1534259018,1534259696,True,3,0,0.554253339767456055,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My only gripes are that the text is still text.

The game demands nothing of your PC, which is a huge plus. At the very least there should be a backtrack option that you unlock after finishing a certain amount of achievements or something. It gets annoying when you want to really explore the story. I'd also like to see an ending recap, like in Fallout, so that I can see how my actions influenced history.

Now, that aside, Choice of Robots is easily one of the best introductions to Choice of Game’s stories. In Choice of Robots, you play as the creator of the first artificial intelligence, and how you treat and raise your AI will influence the story as well as the ending. The game operates on a choice/stat based system, where some choices will affect your wealth, relationship with your robot or friends, your own humanity, or your robot’s skills. It is one of the best of its class as it’s endings can vary wildly based on your choices, unlike most games, creating a choose your own adventure gameplay that easily surpasses Mass Effect, Fallout New Vegas, and The Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt. 

	I would whole heartedly recommend this game/novel to almost anyone looking for an interesting story of how your AI changes the world, with more depth than other games like Detroit: Become Human or Talos Principles “Are robots human?” heard-far-too-often philosophical question with a greater focus on the experience of the first AI and how they could shape the future.",1529700446,1535310994,True,1,0,0.530726253986358643,0,True,False,False,False,,,

故事主要内容是主角与自己做的机器人的养成，然而两者之间的互动极为贫瘠，这机器人简直比街边五十块的电子狗还蠢。个人觉得这游戏的写作者根本没有能力驾驭AI这么高的话题，就像不懂富人的diao丝在描写上层社会的生活时，写不出精英阶级的贵族感，只会像《小时代》一样不停堆砌名牌衣包。

整个世界观的设定非常奇葩，我一开始确实被“中美机器人大战”的主线剧情吸睛了，真正玩到这部分才知道有多傻吊。在战争前一年，美国U.S. Robot公司研发出了具有AI的自主机器人，但是因为价格贵而无法普及；然后中国完全copy了U.S. Robot的design [spoiler]我没有夸张，原文就是这么写的[/spoiler]，用cheap labor做出了更便宜的机器人，并反过来占据了一大块美国机器人市场。作为公司老板的朋友，主角帮助U.S. Robot打赢了官司，某龙傲天的国际组织就完全封掉了中国机器人的出口。作为报复，中国不再出口廉价的电池，使得美国各种电子设备的造价大幅度提升，人民的生活水平每况愈下。

接着本作最流弊的地方来了：中国的Prime Minister来到圣弗朗西斯科，希望通过友好交谈打破贸易僵局；然而我朝的王怎么可能空手而来呢，我们的Prime Minister居然带去了，一整只的，Parade，在人家，市中心，搞游行！！！Parade的打头阵是古代军兵，中间是现代军，压轴的是机器人大军。跑到灯塔国心脏里，阅兵游行，请问还有哪个国家做得到！！！

接着比“本作最流弊的地方”更流弊的地方来了：灯塔国的Protester勇敢地站出来螳臂当车，其中一个人忍不住开了枪，一枪就击毙了，我方的，Prime Minister！！！然后，中美大战，就这么，爆发了！！！


接着比“本作最流弊的地方更流弊的地方”还流弊的地方又™来了：天朝一上来，就bloodbath了Taiwan！！！杀掉了全部American soldier和civilian！！！！而美国，not surprisingly地非常淡定，居然完全没动出兵念头，也就是开始逮捕国内的天朝人而已 .......

读到这里，我觉得为了珍惜我仅有一次的宝贵生命，真的不能再继续下去了。

-has birthday party for my son.

There are those who simply believe science is only about man exploring the nature of the universe, yet science is also a collective legacy of these explorers’ discoveries. From the historical remembrance of the drama between Edison vs Tesla; from the familial legacy of Irène Curie who tested the structure of the atom her parents began to explore, dying from her own research; and from the names that forever shaped the world, better or worse, such as Einstein and Fritz Haber—science is a history about people, whether of minor or major feats, making choices from their newfound knowledge that may lead to their own ruin, bring them fame, or haunt them in the future to come.  This is the essence of what makes Choice of Robots an amazing piece of interactive fiction.

Choice of Robots is the type of game I always wanted to become real, a choice-based adventure around the ambitions of science. What the Civilization games recreate in terms of history as a strategy game is what CoR conveys as a choice-based interactive fiction. It may not have the same scale or freedom, but what CoR does do exceptionally well is create a piece of interactive fiction about the accumulation of your choices. There are simply too many variables, decisions, different outcomes to explore that one playthrough is not enough to experience the whole narrative. While I may be unfamiliar to other “Choice of…” titles, if you were ever curious about their merits, then Choice of Robots would be the best place to start. 

[h1]Choices We Make Are Not Always Perfect, Though They Are the Journey[/h1]

Something that was largely apparent when playing Welcome to Moreytown alongside Choice of Robots was the overall value of every decision. There is a great difference in quality offered that not only impacts the lasting consequence and ending but the overall story you build. CoR is simply a piece of fiction made greater by its interactivity to drive its narrative than something arbitrary with no impact on every decision. This is the quality of excellence that separates novels written into a game format and stories created to be their own game. 

While the narrative is largely linear with some branching paths, the meaning you create each time is due to the sum total of your decisions around the robot you create. CoR largely takes inspirations from old CRPGs by applying stats to an interactive fiction, and the story (and game) is better because of these inclusions. Flavor-text isn’t simply arbitrary side-notes or meaningless jokes as every decision is based around four major stats that affect your creation: Empathy, Autonomy, Military and Grace. Other stats influence the narrative such as the player’s own stats of Fame, Wealth and relationships with other characters that further add value to each decision. Sometimes the game will put you and your creation at odds with one another’s future goals; sometimes the story will choose different scenes or introduce fail-states to add more variety to the story. From beginning to end, no moment feels forgotten even if the plot does not draw attention to it because the mechanics already are enough of a reminder.

All these dynamic elements, thanks largely to the smart usage of stats, create tangible value to each new playthrough, and the moments that they create such as learning empathy by playing video-games or becoming autonomous from a mistake the creator made are the memories you can recall when the journey comes to its end.

[h1]It’s Not a Question of “How?” or “When?”; It’s the Readiness for the Future[/h1]

It would be an accomplishment for Choice of Robots to simply tell a narrative in a game-format that plays to its strengths to tell its own narrative for players. The genius element behind CoR is the narrative across multiple playthroughs reaffirms what the linear structure reminds you: You cannot prevent the future from arriving, but you can shape how the future will play out.

The game largely hints at this with the idea of the Singularity of robotics where the rising development of robots becoming more human presents the outcome that robots will possess greater intelligence than their creators. Whether that is the result of superpower countries waging war, economic crises due to the robotics industry, robots becoming more than simply human, and other possibilities the game presents, the outcome always results to that conclusion. Similar to Groundhog Day, it’s the inevitability of tomorrow that makes you realize it doesn’t matter who or how that day will come to pass. The truth that you learn to accept is that it would have happened to another scientist other than yourself, and it’s how you decide to handle the situation that will determine the lasting consequences on the world. Whether you wish to accept them or not, that decision to choose or to abstain are two possibilities that are always within your control. 

This attitude is what many great scientists come to accept with the pursuit of science, even when it may be a mark of shame. As Einstein wrote before his death, “I made one great mistake in my life […] when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that the atom bombs be made; but there was some justification – the danger that the Germans would make them.” Like the atomic bomb, Choice of Robots allows you to stand on that same precipice all great scientists must face when they must choose the one future out of the many possibilities they are more comfortable to accept.    

[h1]The Closest 10/10 Recommendation I Will Ever Give[/h1]

It’s honestly difficult to think of any legitimate issues with Choice of Robots unless the thought of reading makes you want to turn away—or if you don’t find any merit behind these “Choice of…” games. No aspect of the plot, decisions or aspects you must consider feel frivolous to the narrative. The writing is remarkably charismatic in quality and the ability to connect with these characters, even if they are somewhat simple archetypes. As much as I detest review scores, it would be difficult to rate this game anything short of perfection because it manages to tell a simple story in a well-executed manner beyond the expectations of what I had of these games. There may not be anything noteworthy in its narrative or revolutionary as a piece of interactive fiction, but if execution on an idea is not the most important quality than the future should be given to robotic overlords who have more humanity than us.",1515012180,1515037034,True,14,0,0.680720508098602295,2,False,True,False,False,,,

-started out trying to create a robot that was aware it was a robot but was capable of emotion and companionship, in the hopes of travelling the world with it as a best friend.

-accidentally started a major, violent war between China and the United States in which one of the characters was bombed to death on an aircraft carrier.

1) Choice matters. Every CYOA game try to claim that choice matter but in most of them, the text is nearly identical no matter what choices you pick. There are broad difference in story flow base on dialog choice and success or fail of events base on stats but that is it. CoR is different, at least for the first part up to the end of the war. I see attention to details everywhere, text and event flow subtlety different based not only on different dialog choices but also on the stats of your robot.

For example, a broad story decision of getting funded or not and by which department depend on whether you are willing to compromise on meeting the military's requirement (dialog choice) and 20 pts in a single stats (stats). It is not the result of just selecting a dialog option, but the accumulation of all the decisions you made previously. It not only make the result feel natural, but also make the choices affecting the stats feel relevant. Choice mattered indeed.

2) Subtle changes in text that show the attention in details the author put in. For example, the night after your robot is activated, if the autonomy is high, the robot will explore on its own, otherwise (if empathy is high?) it will stay and watch you sleep. There are many more examples like this and whenever I notice them, I really appreciate the effort the author put in. It is what make the robot come alive for me. I do not see the same level of details for other CYOA games and unfortunately, only the first few chapters of CoR have this level of detail.

3) Small decisions at the start have large impact much later down the road. For example using the cellphone battery will screw you up when war with China start and it is the straw on camel back that bankrupt me on my first play through. This is a really brilliant cascading mechanics that make CoR much better than other CYOA games.

4) Feedback. The one thing I hate about CYOA games is when the game present me with bland choice A, B and C. I look at them and wonder why I should choose one over another and suspect that none of the choice have any impact. One factor that make the first part of CoR so amazing is that nearly every decision I make at the first part of the game, I can see how it affect the stats of my robot. I get feedback that let me know I am indeed making a difference.

5) List possible endings/Set a goal at the start. If your game have multiple different endings, you better let me know so I have incentives to replay the game. I also need some hints on which decisions I should make differently to get those endings because I am sure as heck not going to have the time to try every permutation of dialog choice in the hope that you have hidden an ending there. A few hidden endings are fine, but don't leave me in the dark completely. The starting dream of CoR is an excellent mechanics although the singularity hint is perhaps a bit too explicit.

CoR is of course not perfect. The story start to fall flat after the war. The attention to details is gone and I hardly feel any attachment to the companion bot I built. The most memorable part is when I taught my robot about death and even that part could have been stronger if it have connection to the first lesson on death when the father dies.

Lastly I want to add a general criticism I have for CYOA games in general. Language is imprecise. It is impossible for an author to communicate his/her intention via description and dialog options to the reader perfectly. And indeed, sometimes it is better for the communication to be intentionally vague as it allow the reader space for his/her own imagination.

However, I personally hate it when dialog options are vague on its consequences or which skill check it is trying to make. I dislike having to deduce or guess the intention of the author behind each of the dialog choice to make a decision. It is inevitable that misunderstanding occurs, or that the author's interpretation of event/choice does not match with the mine and when it happens it ruins the play through. This is especially frustrating towards the end of the game because there is no save option.",1514822758,1514822758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played the demo and immediately bought the full version to continue. I'm just wrapping up Chapter 3 at the time of writing. (Update: I have finished the game now, so continue reading for extra thoughts.)

As a security researcher with a massive passion for technology, this is so far one of the most interesting, endearing, and believable stories I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Nothing feels very forced or vague. I don't have to suspend my disbelief very much, and the more specific references to technology and security are jarringly realistic.

This is less of an ""I, Robot"" type of universe, and more of a heavy, introspective look into what the real world could be looking like in the not-so-distant future. The choices are very fulfilling, and none of them feel like they are designed to trick me or force me down any specific path.

(Update: This game can tell many stories in the same setting, and I was able to guide the narrative away from any tropes that I wasn't too fond of -- but I saw the options there, ready to be picked by anybody who might enjoy them.)

Edit: I just finished the whole thing in one session. The updated points above have some new thoughts from this perspective. I got a really touching ending. It's clear that my ending could have been more touching, or less touching, depending on what choices I made earlier. I also got an achivement for surviving until the end of the story.

Where was I? Oh, the review.

It's a great game, and if you enter your actual name as the protagonist's, it feels more real. There are funny moments (""Why am I dreaming in political cartoons?"") and serious ones (Such as choosing whether or not to get surgery to remove a genetic desease, at the cost of the Charcter's emotions) but it all flows together very well. There's a stats screen as well, and some stats influence later decisions. There's the fame stat (which is how well known you are), Wealth (which influences several decisions) and a way to see who your character is married to (or seeing) with the Romance stat. The robot you build has stats too, such as Autonomy (how well it can move), Military (how weaponized it is), Empathy (emotions) and Grace. There's achivements as well, but you can't get them all in one playthough, which is fitting; a person can't do everything in their lifetime. It also has a few moments that makes you ask yourself questions, but I'll let you figure those out.

Overall, it's an amazing game. If nothing else, use your actual name as the protagonist's and give it a blind run. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1506824623,1509133626,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Upon starting, it seemed to be just a big wall of uniteresting text. However, once I went beyond it, I realized I had discovered a gem of a game. In my first game I created a robot similar to that of a synth, started an international corporation, sold robots to the American military to fight in a war, became a war hero, then started a rebellion in Alaska, only to die fighting rather than fleeing. The next game I created a robot nearly identical to that of a child, worked with my friend in a robot toy business, converted my child robots into military robots, developed extremely realistic human looking soldiers, and made companion bots that were nearly indistinguishable from humans, marrying one in the process and starting a family with her raising a human child and my original robot child. The game is written like a sort of fanfiction which really isn't a problem in my opinion. 

It tells like a story and I love it. I have played through this game about 4-5 times trying to min-max my decisions to achieve the most success and get different endings.

Holy

Shit


I started out the game attempting to create a hyper intelligent robot that could lead humanity to greatness. I ended up creating a robot that started an AI revolution that stopped a massive war, fucked over our corrupt government, and worked with me to make a world were man and machine live together in a libertarian North America. My brainchild went through multiple stages during my time with her. She went from niave, to rebellious, to suicidally depressed, and finally building a child. To say that this game is an emotional rollercoaster is an understatement. You will go through multiple stages of your character's life, balancing relationships and teaching your robot your values. My character led a lonely life, having only a few friends and family to accompany him on his journey. He gave up on romance early on to focus on his creation and career. He sacrificed his chance at a normal life to make the world better, will you do the same? Or will you focus on another aspect of life? What will your creation look and act like? The only answer is to try the game. My experience will stick with me for years to come. My only major criticism is that I couldn't spent more time with my little Materia.

I've played interactive fiction before, and both seasons of The Walking Dead. Although I enjoyed them, and The Walking Dead was super polished, they did not provide the same experience as Choice of Robots.

You see, in the other games, I felt like there was only so much freedom allowed, and that certain outcomes were absolute. Of course I know that there aren't limitless choices in any game of this kind. Still, I felt like each of the decisions made in Choice of Robots contributed to an end that I influenced.

This could mean that there is a lot of plot branching in Choice of Robots, or it could simply be that the game doesn't allow multiple saves, so you don't get to easily see the illusion. It's essentially a rogue-like. You can start over, but other than that, your decisions stand.

I'm torn about whether or not I should play this again. Another play through is just me trying to get a glimpse into the game's inner workings. That could ruin the experience for me. If I do play it again, I will update this review.

There are so many routes and options that you can choose in this story (with major plot points unraveling and rejoining in a different manner) that I played this through about 4 times so far. With that said, I NEVER replay games or reread stories, but this here, i did 4 times, simply because it feels like a different story each and every time. 

I highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys fiddling with the idea of a future that heavily involves AI and robotics and the repercussions of the events that lead to this future. Not to mention the suprisingly emotional connection you have with what is in essence your own imagination. It is stunning. Even the killer you may imagine up will draw you into a connection with it, again, amazing.

I played this without a soundtrack, but it would be very much welcomed to play one while enjoying the story. I found I did not require a soundtrack simply because my mind was able to create all of the setting and what it would sound like through what was written for my first read through I now figure that an outside disturbance(?) may have ultimately taken away from my experience. I may have even been able to smell some described smells at the time.

Needless to say, I will be checking out more of these from this particular author(?)/developer and I highily recommend this title in specific. The price also makes this a no-brainer!

This game is very well written and exectuted.  The world and characters are believable, and the humour adds a lightness that balances some of the heavier moments.  

I haven't played many Interactive fictions (though I highly reccommend Steve Jackson's Sorcery), but this was a great experience, and one I'm sure I'll return to soon.",1487606268,1501604093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

怎么说呢，通关了以后我的心情很复杂

一方面我推荐代入感很强的人慎重游玩，因为玩完了以后很难再忘掉里面的情节（至少对我来说），很难摆脱它的影响。
一方面它真的很不错。它真正的体现了互动艺术的魅力。

如果这只是一本书，只能说它的质量中上，情节较俗套，设定上也没什么很出彩的地方。
然而它是一个游戏（互动小说），
不管这些事情多么俗套好像从各处重复了千万遍，
你的决定带来的影响真正发生的是在你的身上。真正影响了故事线（或者说是在你脑中想象出来的人生），加入进来的体验总是比作为局外人印象深刻。
所以这是我非常纠结的地方，对代入感强的人就像是苦乐交织。

个人认为对于这种只有文字纯靠想象的游戏，比剧情炫酷场面火爆的游戏代入感更强，你在想象中根据文字构建出的世界，都是你可以理解接受的东西，这是真正的幻想乌托邦。当然对于想象力不是那么丰富的同学，这种文字avg在情感上的表达就弱了许多。

I chose the path where I tried pulling a ""Chappie"" and released a robot child unto the world. My goal was to try and establish rights for sentient robots.

I loved, by the way, that this was even a possible path in the game. The vast majority of philosophical explorations into AI seem to always be like ""LOL TURMINAYTUR AIN'T DIS SO SCARYYYY?? LOL FEAR TECHNOLOGY"".

But, (and I won't give spoilers) I chose a very...science fiction ending. Aaaaand loyal to the story, this game was like ""congrats, you've reached the end!"" and I swear I almost threw something. If you put yourself in a situation where you wouldn't know the outcome, the storyteller doesn't suddenly become omniscient and tell you the result. You're limited to what your character could realistically discover.

So now I'm actually emotionally recovering from a major Schroedinger's decision that hangs my character investment in the balance.

Also: I don't think you realize how hard it is to keep robot slavery and a terminator military from becomming a thing. Like, I passionately fought against those, and it is REALLY HARD. Humans are so damn power-hungry!!!

Maybe I the other's were lacking autonomy...

Biggest dissapointment? No signularity. Singularity is explained fairly well in the first few pages - when robots reach human intelligence, nothing will stop them from going beyond it. If humans can design something that can surpass them, then so can robots. But my robots never designed anything that did that. There was no explosion of artificial intelligence. They were able to lead the world in some cases, but nothing changed. The dreams were just dreams. I don't know if I was doing it wrong, but at this point I sort of doubt the game allows for true singularity to happen in one lifetime, as it theoretically could.

I am now about to go through my second play through just because I am excited to see what this game must offer. Truly an experience that makes you think and is enjoyable in all aspects.

The reason I won't play through Choice of Robots a second time isn't because it's bad – quite the contrary. It's just that this one playthrough did everything that I wanted it to. 

My choices felt like they had real weight. My AI evolved in a manner consistent with my play style. At times, the options presented by the dialogue tree system felt a bit ambiguous (what does it mean for my character to refuse to shake someone's hand?), but the author of the game and I seemed to be in complete agreement about the implication of each choice, which is amazing now that I think about it. I got 2 hours of stellar entertainment for $ 3.75 – I'm a happy customer.

Of course there's another reason I shy away from a second runthrough: Immersion. I completely identified with my character. In a weird way, I felt like I really had no choice at all – I NEEDED to follow my own moral compass. To do anything else would have been... uncomfortable. Sure, I'd be interested to find out how a total gung-ho military playthrough would have turned out, but I know it couldn't possibly grip me in quite the same way – they just wouldn't be MY choices.

In the end I didn't destroy the world, nor did I save it. But the game always made me believe that either outcome was possible. That's just good writing, folks.

I only went through one story line in which I played as if I would make the choices in real life. The game seems to be created by a computer-science phd that actually worked on learning and robotics. The game includes many aspects of the robotics domain, design considerations, ethics as well as real world trade-offs. The game seems to be very detailed and grows in deep. Yet I enjoyed the first half of the story more and felt that the story somehow pushes your choices. Also the events felt a bit jumpy and unrelated. For example, a war between US and China has started in my story out of nowhere and at some step it ended just like that and everybody continued their lives. Yet overall I really liked the game and willing to play it with many other choices.

Pros:

- Realistic features and terminology, it is not like shitty sci-fi story with made up random scientific words

- Nice emphasize on robotics domain and its possible effects on ethics, human interaction, law regulation...

- Detailed storyline with rich and realistic components such as politics and its effects on market, bussiness management

- Game being biased on US politics

A genre of online novel all but abandoned. One without pretty pictures for the minors to look at. Choice of Games is a bastion, the rebuilders of a crumpling art. And Choice of Robots is a good example of their contributions.

Story:
I was drawn into the world, as a story properly ought to. I kept reading, flowing with the river of words that i saw. The characters had meaning, were not merely static figures of humanity. The trials and tribulations of building your robot, raising it as you saw fit, eneamored me. Some endings fall flat, a few concepts feel rushed, but what story dosen't have those flaws? I give this segment a 9/10.

Gameplay: 
There is no gameplay in the traditional sense. No guns to shoot, no swordighting to be had, no mystical magic. Instead, you make a variety of choices, which, despite all games with this mechanic failing to make it so, actually matter. The characteristics of your robot that you build over time; Autonomy, Grace, Military, and Empathy, directly impact the story, the choices you make, and the lifes of the characters. Its barely has gameplay, but it makes the few things it has work.
10/10

Sound:
 There is no sound. Some may complain about this, but when you read a book, do you really expect it to make a noise? To belt out some fresh tunes? No, you do not. Except audiobooks, perhaps. This game does not need a sound; the words provide all the stimulation you need. I remain neutral on this aspect of the game.

Replayability:
The game enagles you. It draws you in with its story, an amalgamate of choices. Each one has an impact, each one leads down a different path. There are trials, multiple endings, moments of small pleasure among the characters, and a seemingly infinite number of ways to play. There are multiple endings to strive for, and a chievment hunters will find plenty to do. I rate this aspect 9/10.

I have to slog through the whole thing again to get back to that point, and try again. You can't just go back one step and continue the story.

It's maddening, it's frustrating, and in my opinion it just makes the game not fun to play. I don't want to have to click through dozens of pages, carefully re-selecting my exact choices, just to get back to my original point and try again because I was blind-sided and died.

CoR certainly has the text based spirit of its earlier predecessors but is more specifically a decedent of the Choose Your Own Adventure style of game books that also stole much of my youth. Even though the linage is obvious the result is something much deeper and more beautifully crafted than any of its ancestors could have hoped for. 
Its claims of 300,000+ words would not mean a dime if the story itself was rubbish and thankfully CoR is far from a lame story. Each word and paragraph that leads to detailed and well-structured choices is expertly transposed to the screen. That these choices then have real consequence makes for an even greater experience. Real choices are often trumpeted by modern AAA games as the headline banner, few could hope to accomplish the impact that the choices in CoR provide.

If it was a book, it would be a helluva great one. From the beautifully crafted story, to the intelligence behind it. The characters are constructed with such complexity, and truthfulness, that you feel immersed as if you were in the story. Every moment feels like it matters, like you are crafting this beautiful story.

The best part? You choose what story you want. Essentially, there are routes to go within the story, autonomy, grace, empathy, and military. You build a robot choosing to go down any of these four routs, and anything inbetween. So essentially, you have [i]theoretically,[/i] endless stories. Now obviously you don't have as much as I just said, but it is certainly enough to satisfy, being that each route can be somewhere between 1-3 hours. 3 being a take-your-time kind of feel, and 1 being rush through the dialouge, i've already seen this. 

Each of the stories are so radically different that you can truly choose the type of story you want. From creating robots of mass destruction to bend the world to your will. To creating a peaceful movement that preaches robot equality, you can do it all. All of the routes you choose are all made with serious depth, so that, no matter which path you choose, you will almost certainly enjoy it. It all follows a baseline of how things go, so that most opportunities are available throughout most playthoughs, but each playthrough has it's own special traits that the others do not.

To summarize: This game is essentially the perfected version of a choose-your-own-path adventure game. It has the depth and charm of a short book, yet it keeps the individuality of choosing your story. I encourage you to get this game, wether you plan on playing one singular story, or all.

后来的事情大家也都知道了，电子游戏的画面不断发展、繁复，华丽。文字冒险早已是冷门的不能再冷门，没有人忆起，更别提想不想玩了。

文字寄托了我们的想象——同画面、音频不一样。文字可不让人偷懒，文字引导着读者，将他们的想象具象化，勾勒出一个私人的存在——我小时因为怕黑睡不着，便整夜整夜的读书，脑中勾勒着书中清纯的少女、勇猛的英雄和只属于自己的冒险故事。

想象力是最大的宝藏——世间最美的女子，绝味的珍馐，只存在我们的脑中。当我们看到美丽的少女、垂涎的佳肴，它们也不过只是我们脑中想象的拼凑。试想一下：一位喜欢平胸女子的男性，若非生活中出了什么巨大的变数，绝不会娶一位D罩杯的女郎。照这样说来，人类永远活在自己的想象中——把现实塑造得类似自己的想象；或是把想象挤压得如同自己的现实。

很难讲玩游戏究竟是为了什么——但不可否认的是，游戏中的场景，或多或少的与我们脑中的想象相似：沾血的剑，上膛的枪。电影、游戏不断地省略着我们思考的过程，粗暴地将想象抹杀，搬到台前让疲劳的观众审阅。成年人恐怕已经没什么机会做梦了吧？通宵换来的只是疲惫。年轻时的热情、精力大多已经烟消云散了。

文字冒险游戏给了我们一个发挥想象力的机会——这可比在夏日整宿读书、构思要轻松多了。沿着游戏的剧情，想象能一步步地具象，最终形成令人惊喜的画面。能在这个令人疲惫的世间还能有些许的英雄梦想，兴许周围还陪伴着几位美丽的女郎，实在是再好不过了。

题外话：App Store里有这款游戏，手机上的体验比电脑更好，只是要贵一些。

But this game is really about choices that matter, endings being different in every way (my brother is playing and went down a crazy path while I just finished my first playthrough and got a different outcome).

This is a beautifully constructed story that almost made me sit back and really think about what I was choosing, almost regretting my decisions at points and really wondering if this could happen in the real world. It has a very realistic feel to it and as a writer and someone who loves to read perhaps i'm bias in a sense that i'm in favor of this game, however it's just fun and has some really funny moments as well as some moments that really kind of hit me in the feels. 

It's a nice change of pace, not being bombarded by graphics and instead being able to imagine it as you see fit - which to me is just as great if it were animated. 

I genuinly became attatched to the characters and really questioned the motives at points... 

But is this game worth $4.99 (what the game was when I purchased it)? I suppose that really depends on the person. Through the detailed story and choices and customization of certain things, people or someone had to really think through all of this so in my opinion I feel it is worth the price however I am sure it'll be on sale in the future so just keep an eye out. The replay value will be crazy on this.

Choice of Robots has had the best replayability, because the choices veer off in so many different directions - some of the other games in the genre will drive you into the same path no matter what, but here, each playthrough can result in wildly different branches.

I didn't quiet know what would expect me since I didn't do any research whatsoever on the game. I wanted to be absolutly neutral on my first attempt. But lets break it down to the game, what it does good, what it fails to deliver and not my story behind the decison of playing it, because no one cares for my part in the Story.
The premise is interesting. You play a brilliant charakter (self determined Gender/Sex) who wants to build a robot, because that's what he/she wants to do. From that onward you can make an insane ammount of decisons (what elde did I expect from a text adventure?) that influence the way the story will play out and the attributes of your robot. The attributes being: Autonomy, Military, Empathy and Grace. There is a bunch of important characters of which I found none really interesting, safe for my robot, which I named 死の天使 (Japanese for Angel of Death) and myself whom I named Futanari Oppai Paizuri. Don't ask. During my playthrough of the Game I createt a robot that became incredibly empathic and graceful and didn't want to be military in any way while being very autonomic. I pissed of the presidental canidate that I funded, baught my best friends company that I acciedentaly ruined, acciedently sparked a war between China and the US, ended that war, created a mathamatic formula for everlasting peace and took over the world behind the facade of a mostly robotic authority. 

Pros: 
-Many decions that influence your journy and its end
-Nice writing Style (I admit, this one is urly subjective)
-Choices feel important (yes, in my opinion that is as important as the actual consequences)
-The Robot that you create is the most important aspect of the Game and adapts to your way of playing

Neutral:
-The Majority of the side characters are forgettable but still did their job

Cons:
-No soundtrack whatsoever
-Choices sometimes result in a way that goes so far beyond my in-Game influence (for example I sparked a war between the USA and China, when I refused to fight against both of them, because they were spying on me)
-Not all attribute changes made sense to me

While this is merely a text-based game in a similar style as the old Choose Your Own Adventure books it is an extremely extensive one which has a lot more to say and a lot of lessons to potentially teach. Most of the endings are interesting and meaningful and the ideas presented and the choices you get (on almost every page) are very interesting. It is a shame that more games with actual, visual graphics could not have the amazing freedom of choice and the sheer number of possible endings which this game allows. Though it is a mere text-based game, I ended up playing through about 6 or 7 times and I am certain this story has many other potential endings I have not yet discovered.

 However, this game does have some serious weaknesses beyond the fact that it has no graphics. The writing seems more like an outline of a story rather than an actual story with very few visceral or sensory details though this does allow the reader to skim through sections which have already been read very, very easily. The characters seem a little 2 dimensional or slightly shallow at times as it's far too easy to classify or figure out the different characters and their motivations, underlying emotional conflicts and agendas.

Indeed, emotion is not described very well in this book/game at all as the text often seems to have a very egocentric focus on whatever you, the player/reader-character might be feeling at any given moment instead (when emotion is described much at all). Still, despite this shortcoming, just from the situations which are described, the story can still manage to feel very touching anyhow.

This story was particularly touching when I played through the game trying to be the worse, most selfish, scheming asshole I could possibly try to be. This game will let you know you are being an asshole in some very touching ways and will give you results that would logically spring from being that way. Does that mean that the story will kill you off if you act badly? Not necessarily. But you will get realistically punished. You may even become a zillionaire captain of industry which no one loves or wants to be around, for example. If you act in an apathetic way to your created robots they will in turn become more apathetic towards everyone. In this game, your robots are an nth degree reflection of your actions and inactions. Unfortunately the narration feels cold apathetic regardless. It is good that it does not push you in one direction or another but it is unbiased to the extent that it is cold and clinical. Robotic even.

And while it is excellent that this story/game will let you make truly stupid, rash and irrational decisions too with seemingly realistic results, the bare-bones writing style does feel like it often falls short and that every single passage could have been even better with more detail. Visceral and emotional details are the ""graphics"" of a text-based experience and this experience doesn't have anywhere near as much of it as it should. As in an outline of a story, there is probably too much left to the imagination causing every situation to not be quite as fleshed out as it should be. With more detail this story/game could have been more funny, felt more tragic or felt more awe-inspiring with just the addition of a few more details; The good experience that it is could have easily been a great one, a masterpiece of multiple-ending choice-based fiction. Perhaps a newer, enhanced version could still be written to achieve this.

English literary details aside, perhaps the most glaring problem with this story/book/game is how there is no back button which allows you to undo any choice you just made. Indeed, you cannot even flip back to an earlier page. As a result, unlike the Choose Your Own Adventure books of old you cannot easily figure out how the story/plot/game is structured and learn all the different options and endings which exist. While this maintains the sense of the book's mystery and forces you to live with any mistakes you made (which is more realistic) it more often seems frustrating and nonsensical that you, as a reader of a story, cannot turn back to a previous page. While this frustrating lack of a feature allows for massive amounts of replayability (or re-readability), it also means that much of that replayability will inevitably consist of carefully skimming through increasingly repetitive passages to get back to some critical choice or another which may lead you on to a different ending. The game should give you an option of being able to go back to a previous page or not and should have put that option in a menu somewhere.

Despite its weaknesses this story/game will give a sci-fi robot fiction fan many hours of enjoyment. Indeed I found that I was often captivated by the plot and adventure of trying to find out what would happen next. I read this on a computer which has a GTX 780 graphics card installed in it and is capable of easily running Far Cry 3 with all of its graphics settings turned to maximum. It's not like I don't have a choice of which games I want to play and so I read this instead. No. Truly, this game was interesting and for me, and at least initially was able compete on an even playing field with the most graphically intense games on the market.

With a choice on nearly every page the old young adult choose your own adventure stories of the 1980s and early 90's cannot hold a candle to the number of possibilities which this game presents. Indeed, most other adventure games, (most of which have just one to three possible endings) can barely keep up with the amazing variation of possible endings which this story gives you. A character who is your chief love interest in one play-through of Choice of Robots may end up being your archenemy in another play-through. In many ways this game further realizes the potential of the ideas in that old movie Butterfly Effect while at once being set in a I-Robot, Isaac Asimov science fiction situation dealing with the moral pitfalls and potentials of the advent of robotic AI sentience. The number of different potential messages and meanings which this kind of interactive fiction can hold in store for any given reader is truly staggering.

Despite its literary flaws and the absence of a back button, this is a work of art worthy of being discussed and studied in any forward-thinking university (or high-school rather due to the relatively simplistic language) English department in the nation due to its amazing potential and amazing re-readibility.

Choice of Robots is a great book and choose your own adventure.  It made reading actually fun (coming from someone who doesn't read any books outside of school).

I was really immersed into Choice of Robots because of the simple text-based format it is in.  My immagination truly brought me to a satisfying experience.  The game did truly play with the feels.  Need I to mention that I was completely silent the entire ride, simply playing/reading this game?

- great hook
- each desicion feels vital (and that is EVERY SINGLE PAGE)
- actually fun to read
- immense amount of replayabillity
- never fails to surprise me
- fantastically written by Kevin Gold
- superb immersion

I'm not sure if I would want the story of this game in an RPG or if it would be too long, not emotional enough or too emotional, but I can say for sure, that in the ""Choose your own adventure"" style it is entertaining beyond belief.
Here your choices really do matter, and the best intentions certainly pave a good way to hell.

So far I've played through this game twice and I'm planning on at least another go-around, more likely two.

The first time I've played like all the decisions that were asked in the game, would be asked to make in real life. And just like real life, I messed up some things big time, while others worked out in the end.

On my second play-through I had the advantage of learning from previous mistakes and almost created the Utopia I envisioned, but only almost. Some sacrifices were necessary to achieve other goals I deemed more important.

The third time around I intend to take no crap from anyone... I'm really interested how soon this will cause havok.

And if you're curious what I plan for my fourth time: evil overlord, of course!

Point by point:
+ great story
+ very well written
+ choices you make really matter
+ almost no eays, simple choices
+ one play-through takes about an hour and a half (I've alt-tabbed)
- can't undo a decision without having to start from the beginning
+ can't undo a decision (would be rather boring otherwise if you could learn the consequences and then change your mind)

For anyone old enough to remember adventure book games, Choice of Robots is a must. I would also recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs or who is looking for a great story.  

There is so much more depth to this game than many of the 'your choices matter' type of games. One review I read before buying CoR, recommended playing it exactly as you really would if it was real life. This was great advice as once you reach the end (well before that actually), the RPG mechanics become clear and it is a great experiment to see where you would end up. In further playthroughs you can try to shape the story depending on what ending you want to achieve and see if you can make it happen. 

The story is immersive and interesting but I don't want to discuss it in any detail as I honestly think knowing too much beforehand will spoil the experience, especially in light of what I said above. What I will say instead is this:

By the end of CoR you will believe in the power you and your robot have to change the world. You will believe in your own autonomy as every decision you make ultimately shapes the kind of person you are to become. By the end you will like yourself more or less than you did before you started playing.  

+ Great story
+ Fantastic RPG elements
+ You get to design and build your own robot
+ Interesting experiment to see whether you use your power for good or evil
+ Value for money. It's easily worth the £4 price tag and is an absolute bargain when on sale

Pros: 
- guter Schreibstil
- eine umfangreiche Geschichte
- ein interessanter Hintergrund
- das Spiel merkt sich ""Werte"", also Entscheidungen summieren sich zusammen, um später besondere Ereignisse auslösen zu können

Aber die schlechten Seiten überwiegen bei mir, leider... hatte mir wesentlich mehr erwartet:

Cons:
- Langweilig; die Geschichte packt mich überhaupt nicht
- ""leer""; das Spiel/Buch kommt mir zwischenzeitlich wie eine wissenschaftliche Lektüre vor, es fehlt eine ""echte emotionale Tiefe"" - imho
- Moralaspekt; das Spiel/Buch möchte zeitweise gesellschaftskritisch sein... bäh, doch nicht in (m)einem Computerspiel ;)

Umsetzung: 8/10
Story (Art): 6/10
Inhalt: 4/10

Gesamt: 6/10

I don't really like reading books but this felt like a book to me.
In a nice way because making choices and shaping the story to your wished makes for a truly engaging experience.
The story is so deep, like, really really deep. 
You care for the characters, and from my experience, the characters change based on your choices. My best friend turned out to be a manga artist while my friend who also played the game didn't even have said person in her story at all. 

I do feel like the story is too short, mainly because I was so invested that I felt empty and sad when it ended. 
However, that does not mean it's bad. It's the opposite honestly, it made me, a person that does not really read, wanting more and more until the end. 
And seeing as every choice seems to affect the story, it warrants many playthroughs. And replayability only means a good thing. Certainly when you're looking at +-3 hour long interactive story for only 5 euros.

Choice of Robots is definitely something I will recommend to people. The fact that it is interactive allows the reader to take a greater part in the story and feel that their own presence is present in the story; you are there, you are the protagonist. The choices you make create the story.

*Update*
The questions of morality and philosophy of science remains provocative, lofty and challenging. Since I bought this back in 2016, I've played it over the course of those six years countless times (now 2022), oftentimes optimizing a single run instead of branching out as much as possible. This and scrolling through possible achievements has kept me coming back, as they suggest wildly different story lines. In equal measure, this game encourages you to become attached to characters and yet try new permutations. Fitting, a story written from the heart a programmer (with a PhD!). The runs don't sacrifice length for the many unique variations; the time it takes to beat and the many strands of story lead from a single premise is balanced. I've played many titles from the publisher Choice of Games, since. This remains the most careful product, it's author like a cautious director in control of everything. Few other titles from them go in the rank with this one. It remains the best example of what its game engine, ChoiceScript, has to offer. Perhaps the prose could be more beautiful, and with that the psychology of characters richer, and with that a greater number of branched plots. But this all suggests wanting more of what's already here in good measure. Because of this I can say: nothing major should added or removed. All the pieces are where they should be. Room for improvement exists only for what's already here.

Perhaps it's the fact that I'm not that quite interested in futuristic robots even though I'm a huge sci-fi fan, but I really didn't feel connected to the characters besides the robot that you first create, I did not want to build emotionless weapons for armies, etc.

Choice of Robots is probably the most intriguing narrative experience I've found in choice / graphic novel genre games. Unlike most games, it does everything well. It would be difficult to say what it does best, but the storyline is definitely an incredible selling point. I like to spin out every scenario in a choice game, seeing what different routes exist, and never rush through. But, honestly, after 73 hours in the game I am sure I still haven't seen every possible twist in this script. 

I definitely got my money's worth from time in game and enjoyment with the game. But, more than that... I found myself deeply interested in the subject matter. I've researched robotics some when I was a teacher, got my students involved in designing robots, and of course was really excited to learn about Honda's Asimo back at the turn of the Century. Now, robotics is the frontier of Science. 

This narrative takes every single idea you might have thought about the Science of robotics and weaves it in to the many scenarios. There are defenses of the ""value of humanity,"" robotics, as well as many other social constructs. And, there are many poignant comments on immigration, America's role in the world, and Capitalism. I got the feeling of seeing America through the eyes of an immigrant. 

But, one of the intriguing things about the layout of the storylines is the very first choice. You start with choosing what dream you will be having at the first of the story. The four choices are all incredible perspectives on the topic of robotics. Though each one lends itself to particular endings, most of the achievements can be achieved through either of these starting points. I just finished my last achievement today with the help of an ""Achievement Hunting"" friend. Thanks Vance!

The game all revolves around the stats you are building with your choices in each of 4 main traits: grace, empathy, military, and autonomy. These take you into the psychology of robotics. Other factors play into your stats screen as well, such as humanity, wealth, fame, and relationships. But, these are just like tools to help you in achieving your goals with either a robot that thinks, loves, is willful, or militarily useful. You don't feel forced towards any value judgement in your choices, unless you are trying for an achievie that requires high humanity in the end. So, you get to really play with the experience of having the robot hunt down your enemies, or become your greatest friend. 

Whatever you choose, it's all there in the game. Btw, I haven't found another choice game I like as much as this one. Tin Star had a passable story, but it had flaws in the achievement setup, for example and lacked replay value. But, I recently got The Daring Mermaid Expedition, and want to start that next. I only hope it provides as much fun as Choice of Robots.",1456022590,1456022989,True,49,2,0.804057002067565918,4,True,False,False,False,,,

There's no visuals or even music in this game, but trust me, it doesn't need it. The text alone perfectly manages to create its own universe. Though, it's only in English (it isn't my first langage, so I needed to search for vocabulary at some times) and you'll still need a good level to understand the game.  

Through the whole game you've got plenty of choices, which leads to plenty of various endings. The choices you make really matters and have consequences, sometimes large-scale consequences. Several times I made decisions that I almost immediately regretted, but most of times I ended up with an ok (and even interesting) situation after all.  

A nice thing is the different choices you make for your robot. You can choose how it will look, how it will call you, if you want your robot to be considered as male, female or something else, how you want to educate it ; and your decisions through the game will influence your robot's personality and relationship towards you. You can decide it will be a killing machine that'll obey your orders, or a nice and friendly robot which can even become your husband/wife/soul mate. 
Absolutely amazing.

Anyway, this game is definitely worth a try.

It was entertaining, suprising and I thought about game's decisions in off-gaming time. COR was even good for some loud loughings. Right after the first (around 4.5 to 5 hours) playthrough I started a second one. Imho one of the greatest compliments one can make about a game.

COR was my first interactive novel game ... others will follow, but they will have to meet a high standard. Thank you, Kevin Gold.

[i]An deutsche Steam-Nutzer, die vor der Entscheidung stehen ... Ihr habt's gelesen - mit alten Schulenglisch (und das war noch nicht mal besonders gut) kommt man hier sehr gut aus. Es ist (wie Vorposter schon sagten) kein Shakespeare, doch m.E. sehr gut geschrieben. Gebrauchsliteratur im besten Sinne. Die Wendungen kamen für mich teilweise unerwartet, die Geschichte eines Lebens als ganzes (von Anfang 20 bis ca. 70) war höchst spannend. Klare Kaufempfehlung.[/i]

If you want graphics and sound, look elsewhere, but if you have the attention span to read and participate in a story, try this one. The style focuses on scenes and chapters rather than rooms, so expect to read about a series of events and choose one of several scripted actions rather than selecting ""go north"" or ""get flask"".

I've now played through this twice and had very different outcomes and scenes along the way. It looks as though your very first choice selects one of four overall plots, but they overlap. Your decisions affect a set of robot stats, your own ""humanity"", your wealth and fame, several relationships, and a spoilery thing, but there are also specific details that get worked into the text like your robot's exact appearance -- which in turn affect stat growth. I think I stopped a robot uprising at one point because I'd put effort into the Empathy stat for instance. (The text implied I'd barely had enough in that playthrough.) The feedback, eg. ""++Military"", is helpful for understanding the effects of my actions.

Noticed one apparent bug: I'm pretty sure Silas tried to kill me for unclear reasons, died, then was back and in a good relationship status in the last chapter. I also found it odd that another character got shot but wasn't marked as dead, and saving another, obviously important character had no noticeable effect. Would also have been nice to see the final tally of the wealth and fame stats have some acknowledgment beyond the stats screen. The game has no ""Undo"" button like some text adventures, and I have mixed feelings about that. It adds weight to your choices but is a little like the ""Fallout 4"" experience where you select a speech option only to find your character does something you didn't quite intend.

20 декабря 2014 года в Steam вышла интерактивная книга Choice of Robots. Да, ребят, книга. Где чёрные буквы на белом фоне, много текста, а ещё это всё нужно читать. Книга. И, как можно понять из названия, в ней есть выбор. И роботы. Нам предстоит сделать много выборов и повстречать очень много роботов. Создать первый в истории механизм, способный испытывать эмоции и любить. Уничтожить к чертям Америку при помощи армии безжалостных терминаторов.

Здесь можно стать практически кем угодно, хоть вы и все равно останетесь молодым учёным-гиком, который создал робота.

You play as a talented student in college studying robotics. 

The game offers a few good story strands, multiple choices, and so on. It has about two or three opportunities to die (two before the story truly ends), three ""proper"" endings, good use of text input, and relatively good variety of choices. That being said, as far as I could tell, there are only two real world states, which are basically ""good"" and ""bad"" although both were satisfying to me. 
That being said, I played this four times and found enough new content to keep me interested, and there is a large variety of romance options that contain a modest amount of side content.

The opening offers the most basic character customization with you choosing a first and last name, pronouns, and you're off. This isn't bad, it works. Your robot, however, you also build, and you get plenty of freedom with customization. You can choose how many limbs it has, face, voice tune, power source, tool customization (even a rocket hand). Admittedly, a few of these things have very little story impact, but it makes up with you and your robot's attributes.

The game has a rudimentary point system which keeps track of you and your robots stats, empathy, grace, humanity, etc. These are used every so often as a sort of skill-check for specific dialogue options. A similar system in the game, relationship, also shares this sort or skill-check for each character. If you've played Fallout: New Vegas, it's similar to that.

While there are certainly things to be praised about this game, there is a rather large problem. The writing is bland. That is to say it's not awful, it's passable, but don't expect anything like a run of the mill novel. At best it's probably above the average persons writing ability if they had an editor.

Overall, there is quality content here, and the price is well justified in my opinion, especially as it's usually on sale for about $5.00. Oh, and you can electrify a pickle. How romantic...",1454307604,1710211141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Or will you focus on strength and military, making your robot more suitable to the army?

Of course, the choices you make for your robot also affect which companies or people are likely to back or fund your project, and it can have influence on your romantic relationships as well... depending on the fact if you're going down the love bot route or not. Work your way through (robot) wars, ruined friendships, deaths, and try to answer the looming question what will happen to artifical intelligence as it transcends a certain level.

-super addicting, binged played it for 6 hours

-really makes you wish there were other great choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) titles available (for other solid ones, check out the Heroes Rise trilogy (Choice Games) and Tin Star (""Hosted"" on Choice Games)

[b]Pros:[/b]

-quite easily the best available CYOA text-based game on Steam

-300,000 word count - extensive amount of content and scenes, multiple endings to explore

-employs the ""discovery"" system - main characters are not revealed in the stats menu until you meet them

-your stats (ex: humanity, wealth) and your robot's (ex: military, empathy) directly impact the story and available choices

-every decision you make will affect the game and your unique story - the different paths are very different 

-amazing story that remains engaging with every path you decide to walk

-dynamic characters that will react to everything you do

-longer than most other CYOA titles in the Choice Games franchise

Of every CYOA I've played on Steam, none have come close to the quality of Choice of Robots. I explored the game for ~6 hours and still have not discovered every possible ending. There are many achievements and scenes to encounter, and the different story paths are all extremely interesting and well-written. I hope to see more Choice titles of this calibre. A must-buy if you enjoy CYOA games and robot themes.

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!

Any robot fanatic should try this out, you get to put yourself in that dream situation that seems almost so impossible to reach. As an aspiring sci-fi writer, I found this to be a very inspriational and satisfying experience. 

[h1]Possible spoilers below[/h1]

There are many paths, but I've only taken one, and it was an emotional rollercoaster. I feel like I would spoil the experience by going with choices that would go against my true morals. Everyone's path will be different, and I mean [b]everyone's[/b].

The paths last around 2 - 3 hours each, so make sure you have some free time ready as there are no save options.

It's very well written and very much engaging. At no point did I really feel like I was being restricted by the author. Hell, I went into this hoping I could live a gay robot fantasy, and you bet I was able to live a gay robot fantasy. There aren't many experiences out there that let you do that. The really fun thing about this is that the author doesn't ask personal questions, it just rolls with your choices and your identity without berating you or questioning you. It's not intrusive, either: at no point did it ask about my orientation or preferences (aside from asking for my gender), it just let me do what felt right for me, which in this case was fall in love with a male robot. ++ for that haha

Overall it's a very good buy for robot fanatics, but I'm afraid that may really be the only audience this can appeal to. I can't see myself suggesting this to anyone outside of that niche. So if you like them bots [strike](AND IF YOU ARE A DIRTY ROBOT FRICKER LIKE ME)[/strike], this is a great experience.",1452589683,1452590603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Although Beast had been excited about the prospect of your becoming more machine-like at first, the possibility of your death during surgery seems to have sunk in. 

The idea that you may not always be around seems to have put Beast in a somewhat melancholy mood. ""I'm not young anymore, either, Creator,"" Beast says. ""You might not think of me as aging, but technology ages even faster than people. I look just old and clunky compared to the robots around us. When you built me, people would throw away their computers after just four years. Their phones, after two."" 

""Nobody's going to throw you away,"" you assure Beast. 

""Without you, I'll probably stop working. Someday."" Beast looks off into the distance. ""If I die, Creator, do you think I will continue to exist after death in some form?"" 

(Assuring him that he will live on through the impacts he's made on people.)

Beast looks troubled. ""But the person whose life I changed the most was yours, Creator!"" 

When you are gone, I will destory myself. Beast exclaims.


Pros: 
+ Branching storylines (Unlikely to get the same story/ending each time you run through.)
+ Can be the Hero, or the Villain. No forced direction.
+ Can bend your robots emotions and actions to your will, (Teach them Love, Hate, or how to be bloodthirsty killers.)
+ Take over Alaska
+ Building relationships in this game feels important, and how you say or act towards people affects how things play out.
+ Found myself thinking, well what I'm going to want to do probably wont be an option, but 100% of the time it was.
+Become Rich and Famous

Cons: 
- You haven't bought it already.


Overall: All I can say is WOW. Coming into this game I couldn't have imagined what I was heading into. This game has so much character and is very well made. This is my first text based choose your own adventure game that I've enjoyed this much. Who knew that a text based game, could make you feel anger, sadness, love, happiness and power about the decisions you made in it without having actually seen it...? Well this game corrected my ignorance. You will not be ready for it, I can assure you.

It contains beuatiful, emotional stories, and stories of war and destruction. You an be a hero or a villain. You can make so many choices that change how the world will be when (if) you leave it.

This game is my most replayed game. a Playthrough takes some hours the first time, and a bit less after that, as some of the choice screens are resued - but with different outcomes.
It is a very fun game to simply play through and see what happens, but also to go about with a  goal in mind - things don't always work out as you think they will, and some choices, while furthering your goal shortterm may harm you long term, and vice versa.
The game encourages deep thought and raises existential questions if you choose to play ""as yourself"", as well as if you choose to head for a goal.
You get to know the characters more and more on each successive playthrough - not all characters will be in every game, and some you may not meet at all.

This ""interactive novel"" is a work of art and love... I recommend its reading for everybody and especially so for sci-fi minded people and for all who're interested in artificial intelligence and robotics.

I was interested in the theme of this game / interactive book from the start but I postponed its reading with false arguments (which basically boiled down to this one : ""why read a game that may not be so well-written when there are so many sci-fi books around, books which probably have better characters, plot and structure? i.e. : if I want a book, I should take a book."") And I was wrong. Because the writing of this game is much better than most books I've read. The plot has surprises and several turning points. The characters are interesting and/or endearing. The main theme is very well addressed, and there are lots of secondary themes that are well developed as well. In fact this isn't just good, this is great.

In addition to all these qualities, the author seems to be very erudite in many fields (or has good counselors and took the time to listen to them). In addition to computer science and robotics, this book consistently makes reference to both popular sci-fi culture (Isaac Asimov, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others, ...) ; and to the classical culture (Shakespeare, Marc Aurelius' meditations, Buddhist tales, and many others, ...). There are even a few fun references to popular videogames and their subculture that are well timed and well phrased as well...

Political issues and strategic outcomes seems to be thought out with lots of intelligence and a surprising finesse. I'm truly impressed by this work, now!

The endings seems to be widely divergent (though I've not explored them all yet), and this book seems to have been written with love and lots of attention to detail. I've finished the story a first time, then a second time with a very similar path with just a few variations, now I'm trying to test a different approach to see what happens...

This choose-your-own-adventure text game starts with an interesting setting and gives you some interesting options for a psychological subplot while you go through the main storyline. You have a decent amount of control about the type of robot(s) you will build, and what kind of business or other ventures you will engage in. However, the interactions with other characters are somewhat limited, and become increasingly detached as the story leaps ahead years from page to page. If you've traded your humanity for success, that's a plausible enough story mechanism, but if you're doing a more ""humane"" run-through, it takes away from the immersion. Overall the last half or one-third of the story feels rushed, and even though the scope of the story is usually quite grand by that point, I found myself uninterested in it.

The writing in this story is tolerable, but not particularly good. What breaks the game for me, however, are the continiuty errors. For example, in one play-through, your lover ends up disappearing, causing you great emotional distress. Then, a few sections later, in a passing line, the story notes that this same lover has left you because of a particular political choice you made. Nowhere was it mentioned that the lost love returned safely, so it makes zero sense for them to have reappeared without explanation only to leave you again.

EDIT (19.3 hours of total gameplay time later):

Lol, what did I just write up there.

So I spent around another 15+ hours or so on the game trying to get all the achievements and possible endings for it and I've seen a lot of more great story-paths aside from the get-all-close-and-emotional-with-your-robot-daughter plot.

One of my personal favorite story-paths when (and if) you get your robot to prevent the Sino-American War from happening and the events that eventally leads to, one of the many, many stories you can come up with in this game, like forging your own robot empire, marrying a robot, and even going to the moon.

The fact that this game has no visuals whatsoever does not bother me at all and it shouldn't bother you either. With whatever route you take for the story, the writing is excellent and there is always that subtle taste of humor somewhere mixed splendidly well with some moving moments. This aspect of the game is what makes Choice of Robots what Choice of Robots is. The game need not any visuals because the writing provides you what you have to see in your head.

The only real complaint I have with this game (and with most text-based CYOA games on Steam for that matter) is the user interface. Playing 7 hours straight on a game with a completely white background does not at all give you painful feelings that nearly make you believe your eyes are gonna blow up from their sockets Michael Bay-style (sarcasm intended). The developers should add the option to invert the colors if the user wishes to (from a white background with black text to a black background with white text).

  2) Кaчество выбора. Тут нет бинарной борьбы добра со злом. Развилки, предлагаемые нам, ведут к разным последствиям, но их нельзя интерпретировать как ""хорошие"" или ""плохие"". Они послужат интересам разных людей или групп влияния и по-разному изменят Вашу судьбу (или судьбу сразу всей планеты), но простого ответа Вы не получите. 
  3) Равноправные финалы. Прежде всего, возможных развязок тут целая уйма. Но, что важнее: правите Вы миром железным кулаком или тихо живёте в съёмной квартире со своей робо-женой, не остаётся ощущения, что Вы выбрали не ""настоящий"" конец. Каждому завершению истории разработчики уделили внимание и развили его так, что он чувствуется полноценным. Не останется впечатления будто Вам не хватило очков на по-настоящему крутую развязку, на разработку которой ушли силы и время команды. Каждый финал - настоящий финал.

You feel lucky that robot technology has never been hotter, thanks to the ramp-up in robot technology in the last war. You're able to provide for both of your robots, thanks to the money you make from working for Josh. 

Puppet, the more adventurous of the two robots, appears to have tried more tastes than Springtrap already. Like siblings, they seem to have settled into niches in competing for your attention: Springtrap now tries to be more humanlike, while Puppet occasionally flaunts his freedom to be strange. 

""Did you try dirt?"" Puppet asks Springtrap. He walks behind the younger robot, who is putting out plates. ""Dirt tastes very interesting!"" 

""I don't think people are supposed to eat dirt,"" Springtrap says uncertainly. 

""Sure they do!"" Puppet says. ""It's called 'pica,' and it helps people get essential vitamins and minerals. I read about it on the Internet."" 

Springtrap gives you a worried look. ""We're not going to eat dirt tonight, are we?""

It's a branching path story game that decides what story to give you based on your alignment of a couple sliders. The choices are obvious as to which alignment they affect (building a metallic robot increases its military, and decreases its grace; giving it wings gives it grace and reduces its military usefulness). But, the story has to keep prompting you to interact with different parts of the decision tree, so you get weird things like being a multi-millionaire and choosing to employ humans in your factories in Detroit, but then you go to war with China, and now you're sorry you ever let the Chinese get near these things. What? When did the Chinese gain the ability to rip off my robots and make them militaristic? Oh, because I used cheap chinese lithium ion batteries? That's ridiculous. If my company is successful, and there's design changes happening, and materials are getting upgraded, let me source better batteries from somewhere else. Don't make me pick a motorcycle battery when my company is supremely profitable.

It's not open to be whatever you want it to be. You're allowed to type only on fields that don't matter: your name, your robot's name, your robots pronouns. You can't affect the story, you can affect the flavor text. If you choose one of the built in options you will rarely have a tie in back to the originator (Isaac Asimov names are one of the built in options, so you can get references back to those books in later dialogue if you themed correctly). But if you manually type in a name, Suddenly the game has nothing pithy to say about how your name and your situation relate back to the book.

It's not a very visually delighting game. Black text on a white background. Only one button is styled. The Next button. All other buttons are your OS' default look and feel. It's lazy design, and it hurts that it's not free.

I'm wanting an experience that thrusts me into a story and forces me to make decisions based on my reactions to the unfolding plot. Unfortunately, this game is not properly delivering.

I have two main gripes:

1) Too many of the choices read like quiz answers in fashion magazines, where instead of the answers just containing my possible actions, they also impute motivation into my character that may not reflect how I'm interpreting the situation. Made-up example: instead of the choices being ""Cautiously open the door"" or ""Kick the door in"", they are ""Cautiously open the door, hoping nothing scary jumps out and eats my face,"" and ""Kick the door in. I am a superhero, afraid of nothing!"". (I may open the door cautiously because I'm a practical person, or kick it in hoping to surprise what is on the other side. A game should not tell me my emotional state; it should offer me simple, basic choices and allow me to feel my own emotions).

2) Some of the questions are not based on how I am reacting to the situation, but are asking me to make fundamental decisions about the nature of the story universe. While this is fine as a replayability device at the start of an interactive fiction game (e.g. ""will you be a GOOD WITCH or a BAD WITCH""?), it's poor storytelling to force such decisions on the reader when they're already well into the plot. The question that I am quitting on is asking me who it was that just called my cell phone while I was speaking with a professor. Instead of the call being from a specific person and giving me a choice of actions (answer it, send to voicemail, etc) I'm supposed to decide who the call is from, choosing between three people I know.

I have mixed feelings about not being able to change any choices at all. for instance, choosing something that cut down Empathy, which i was trying to build. But at the same time, I really like the reality that it added to the game. That if I messed up, I friggin messed up and there was no fixing it unless I started over from the beginning. Though I believe that a chapter based savng system could have been nice, (i.e: if you mess up you can restart from the beginning of X chapter instead of the beginning) overall it was a nice change of pace from other games i've played where you have the option to fix things and stuff.

Choice of Robots is by far the best one of the lot. Detail. Reactivity. Replayability. Maturity. Heart. Robots is superior to every other interactive novel out there in every way, and I don't feel that is an exaggeration.

In Choice of Robots, you make a robot. Surprise. You determine its appearance, materials, power source, and ultimately influence its personality (though not entirely). As you guide your ""young"" robot through the strange customs and idiosynchrasies of modern human life, the manner in which you teach your robot about the world and its place within it will have repercussions in future events.

I have played through this a total of four times, and each time, the ending I received was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

In all of my playthroughs, I felt nothing less than total satisfaction with the ending. And in one, special playthrough, I came within a diode's width of choking up from the feels.

The game has a healthy amount of differing statistics, and these are CONSTANTLY increasing, decreasing and being tested depending on the choices you make. There is an excellent balance of player-determined and statistic-determined story changes, giving you enough autonomy to guide the story in the direction you want it to go, but not so much that it breaks the fourth wall and makes you feel like a bored author.

Below is the summary of my entire first game which took me 4 hours. The entire thing is a giant spoiler if you have not played yet! But I figured I'd post it for those of you who have :)

[spoiler]Summary of Completed Chapters 

Chapter 1 

On the day you first built Ariel, you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make Ariel more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a wooden winged robot with a humanlike head and humanoid hands. 

Then you went back to your place to teach Ariel some words. 

Chapter 2 

The next day, you hooked up Ariel's biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then took Ariel to see Josh, who was impressed and agreed to fund your education if you would work for him after you graduated. Josh told you that evening about how he'd once been a juvenile delinquent, essentially, but turned around because he was inspired by Asmiov's book I, Robot to make a robot company called ""U.S. Robots."" 

As months passed, you became busy teaching Ariel about the world through the Internet and taking her to the park. Your funding from U.S. Robots kept you in Professor Ziegler's good graces during this time. 

In time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about Ariel and asked for an interview. You agreed. 

Chapter 3 

You gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview Ariel. 

Mark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and Ariel. When Professor Ziegler found out about the article, he was very displeased, and finally kicked you out of his lab. 

Mark's article also attracted the attention of one ""robotObsession1987,"" known in real life as Silas Cooper. When you met up over coffee, he told you that he used to do classified robotics work for a government lab, but left because he couldn't tell what nefarious purpose the technology would be used for. 

Shortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well. 

You joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. 

Chapter 4 

Your first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. But they were unimpressed with Ariel. You couldn't find any other interested companies, either, and you eventually went bankrupt. Unemployment seemed to be common in the United States, and it seemed people tended to blame either robots or China. Riding on both of these sentiments, Jacqueline Irons won the presidency. After President Irons enacted a series of protectionist tariffs to keep out Chinese robots, Sino-American relations steadily worsened. 

The tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. 

Chapter 5 

Captain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. But you refused. 

Silas was worried that he was being targeted by the government's anti-spy measures, and asked you to help him. But you weren't very helpful. 

An agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. Elly was captured and incarcerated as a result. 

You found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of Ariel V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot. 

In the end, America muddled its way through the war relatively unscathed. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. 

Chapter 6B 

You created a humanoid companion robot named Galatea, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed Galatea was interested romantically in you. When Ariel and Galatea were attacked in the street, Galatea accidentally killed someone. Galatea was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences. 

In a last-minute attempt to find a life partner, you proposed to Galatea. And, what do you know -- it worked! 

Chapter 7 

In 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to surprise your mother with a gift for the holidays. You learned it was your surgical technology that had kept her alive this long. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. 

You chose to replace the malfunctioning part of your brain with an artificial neural network. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Ariel 2, Ariel's artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.

I don't play too many extremely narrative-heavy games, as I really prefer emergent gameplay sandboxes, but the concepts of robot ethics in this game drew me in, and had me seriously weighing the choices, asking me which of three or four things I valued most highly.  

There are four major robot attributes, and four general paths for robots based upon them, from robot revolution to lovebots.  

On the negative, however, the writing vacillates between clever and overly sparse.  Some of the romances in particular feel overly rushed to ""get to the good parts"", and involve little more than direct options of ""make this person boy/girlfriend?"" ""yes"" ""YOU ARE NOW DATING!"" Maintaining it is mainly a matter of ""I will dislike you if you make choices related to specific topic I am focused upon"", such as Elly's humanitarianism, or Tammy's paranoia about the government.  

The character that is overwhelmingly the most focused-upon, besides your own, however, is the one character you can't date, your prototype robot.  You can get her to love you and spend forever with her, but even making love-bots mainly means creating a new character to be a ""younger sibling"" that has far less development.  

Likewise, in spite of the fact that your romantic interest could be there at ""birth"" for your robot, your robot considering you ""father""/""mother"", and your romantic interest actively being involved in remodeling your robot, there is almost no interaction between your robot and your romantic interest.  (I.E. If I'm ""father"", why is Elly not ""mother""? Why doesn't Elly try to impress some of her humanitarianism upon the robot? She instead chooses to just sit back and judge the way you raise the robot all by yourself.)

That said, however, it's dirt cheap, and I seriously stayed up all night just mulling over what it was telling me, trying to puzzle out the right answers, or else trying to find some way to wiggle through the requirements, and find a way to get everything (or at least, a greater share of what) I wanted.",1444304036,1444334355,True,4,0,0.519830703735351563,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Every choice we make has unforseen consequences. Some good. Others bad. But then I guess it's just a matter of perspective. One person's ""good"" is another person's ""bad"". Many people died because of my actions. Or was it my inactions? But still, others profited from those deaths.

I lost my freedom while covering for a friend... all because she was into jazz music and gave me the one thing I looked forward to beyond my work in robotics.

And of course the robots. They were thrust into a world where many were not ready for them, while others sought to exploit them. In truth, I think I just wanted a friend. Someone to talk to. Someone to experience things with. Someone to be in awe with when something new is discovered. First it was one robot. Then I built another. I was not prepared for the responsibility that would be required, but I'd try to adapt. Later in life, I would learn that the responsibility for bringing robots into the world was very similar to raising your own biological children. The same rules applied, one choice at a time.

I've wined and dined with robots. I've danced with robots... I even broke a robot's heart.

Sometimes, I look back to earlier in life, and actually feel regret for hooking up those very first wires to control the gears and servos. But then I quickly find myself disgusted that I would even have that thought because of what good came out of those unfortunate events. Besides, why imagine possible paths to descisions I've already made? There are still secrets yet to be answered. (And some I'm not sure I want the answers to.)

No. I will move forward and be free. Despite the pain and uncertainty our choices may bring... what matters now is moving forward in the present, learning from the mistakes of the past, and plan for a future filled with peace and kindness.

I personally hold Choice of Robots up as the gold standard of comparison for most ChoiceScript games, for a number of reasons.

1. Player agency. You'd be surprised how many ""choose your own adventure"" games suffer from a serious lack of player agency. You can choose how to say things, you can choose how to do things, but you can't really choose *what* to say or *what* to do; in other ChoiceScript games, the rails of the story are there, and all you can do is choose the color of the train you're on.

To continue with our train analogy, Choice of Robots offers you not only several different destinations to choose from, and it offers you not only choice in terms of the color of your train, but it also offers you several different paths to your destination (that can meet up and merge with one another, at times), several different models of train to ride, and even a choice in passengers for the train.

...okay, the train analogy is a bit silly, but the ultimate point is this: While no game can offer you absolute, ultimate freedom to do whatever you want to do, Choice of Robots offers you as much freedom as it possibly can within the confines of the ChoiceScript engine.

2. Consequence. Even in ChoiceScript games that *do* offer you a meaningful choice in the path(s) you take, very few of them come close to the way that Choice of Robots also offers *consequence* for the paths you take. For example, if you choose to make war robots for the United States during the Sino-American War, the Chinese government will send an assassin after you. Sometimes, these consequences can affect the entire scenario. If you stop a gunman from assassinating a politician, you'll have stopped the aforementioned Sino-American War in its tracks, causing Chapter 5 to be completely different than it would have been otherwise. You decided to form a cult around your robot in Chapter 4? In Chapter 7 they're still around, and you can choose to fund churches for them. You make a bad impression in a news story about your robot? A lunatic might try to bomb your house because he's afraid of what you might create in the future. Don't take this lunatic out after he bombs your house? Now he's bombing your robot factory, a chapter or two later.

The decisions you make *matter* in a fashion beyond just sort of having your way with the story; actions in Choice of Robots provoke reaction, and these reactions might not always be in your favor. 

3. Conciseness. Some ChoiceScript games will burden you with a dozen (or more!) skills, abilities, or other such categories to keep track of and attempt to balance with improvements over the course of the game. Some times, you won't even know what a particular skill is even good for until it shows up at one crucial point in the story. After all, how was I supposed to know I needed 100 points in paleoarchaeology to get the good ending?!

...okay, that's a bit of hyperbole, but the point still stands: In some ChoiceScript games, you spend more time mapping out the choices you need to get a specific balance of skill/ability points than you spend actually playing and enjoying the game. Some people might like that, I suppose, but I'm not one of them.

Choice of Robots, though, has exactly 5 stats to keep track of:

Military - Your robot's ability to fight.
Autonomy - Your robot's ability to self-manage.
Empathy - Your robot's ability to feel emotions and sympathize with others.
Grace - Your robot's manual dexterity/agility as well as their computational ability.
Humanity - How (dis)connected you are to other human being.

The first four are self-explanatory, and whenever your robot fails a check because it's lacking in a stat, the game describes it in such a way that you know exactly what you should improve upon if you want to succeed next time. Humanity is a bit less obvious, but it's also used in only a few places and, depending on the route you choose, can be completely disregarded altogether.

4. Speaking of the humanity stat, let's talk about a lack of judgmentality. Is that a word? It is now, I suppose.

As Dream-Robot Anubis says, the only one capable of judging you is yourself, and the game takes this idea to heart. Aside from a few snide quips here and there, the game virtually never offers moral judgment on you or your character. Other ChoiceScript games, of course, have five or ten different morality meters to tell you exactly what kind of person your character is. Aside from humanity, though, Choice of Robots has none. Want to commit cold-blooded murder against someone who sent you an insulting e-mail? Go right ahead. Want to talk to him over coffee and try to convince him you're a good person? That's okay, too. Want to conquer Alaska and commit mass war crimes in the process? Sure, the game is fine with that. Want to crush the early seeds of robot autonomy and keep them all as subservient drones? Yeah, let's do it!

Of course, performing these actions may or may not adjust your humanity stat - but, again, this isn't a *morality* stat so much as it's something of an *ability* stat, your ability to continue relating to other humans beings even as you dive head long into creating robots. Aside from that, you will never receive overt praise for doing the ""right"" thing, and you will never receive overt condemnation for doing the ""wrong"" thing; the game lets you play it as you want to play it, and never wags its finger at you.

Of course, Choice of Robots isn't an absolutely perfect game. It has a few things here and there that needle at me whenever I play it, but they are of little to no consequence up against how *fun* this game is to play. If you like ChoiceScript games, or if you simply like robots, AI, and similar things, then I highly recommend it.

You are [pick a name], a robotic engineer destined for tough times, greatness, and death. So apply your imagination, and you will experience a wild and engaging life.

And though some characters may appear despicable during the first playthrough (I forced one, Mark, to commit suicide), each one's unique personality and background will emerge as you experiment with different options (As of my fifth playthrough, Mark has risen to be my favorite character). This game will make you second-guess yourself if you commit your emotions to it.

You may experience academic success or expulsion, career success or bankruptcy, triumph in war or defeat, friendship, romance, total control or love for a child, betrayal, several opportunities for vengeance, the death of a loved one, your own impending death, immortality, among other values. And by the end of the game, you may reflect on all that you sacrificed and be forced to re-evaluate each one's importance in your life.

 Jak už název prozrazuje, je to i případ hry [i]Choice of Robots[/i], jejíž příběh tato témata hluboce rozebírá.

 Hra je ve stylu klasických gamebooků, interaktivních příběhů, na kterých někteří z nás vyrůstali. V dnešní době to není nijak vzácný koncept, ale ve formě počítačových her je běžné, že autoři text obohatí i nějakou (ne nutně animovanou) grafikou či ilustracemi. Toto není ten případ, zde jde o opravdu defacto knihu v elektronické podobě s minimálním uživatelským rozhraním. Tady bych zmínil mou jedinou výtku k této hře a totiž, že jste odkázání pouze na bílé pozadí a černé písmo. Věřím, že pro někoho to může být problém, několikahodinové čtení za těchto podmínek na PC pro mě osobně nebylo ideální, samozřejmě není problém si třeba jas monitoru snížit, ale stejně mi příjde, že by neměl být pro vývojáře problém tam přidat i tmavější variantu.

Co se týče hry samotné, příběh pro vaši postavu začíná v roce 2019 na Stanfordské univerzitě, vašim oborem je (nepřekvapivě) robotika a blíží se moment, kdy započnete práci na vašem prvním prototypu robota s umělou inteligencí. Stejně jako vaši postavu, i robota si můžete pojmenovat a bude taky jen na vás, jak bude vypadat, jaký mu zvolíte hlavní účel a jakým směrem budete utvářet jeho osobnost. Budete chtít vytvořit robota, jehož mysl bude stejně chladná jako ocel, z které bude vyroben a který bude užitečný armádě (a vaší peněžence) a nebo snad postavu z ekologického dřeva, empatickou, co nejvíce podobnou člověku tělem i myslí, ze kterého může být výborný společník? Prvotní rozhodnutí při tvorbě prototypu budou důležité, nikoliv však definitivní. Robotovu osobnost a schopnosti můžete ovlivnit dalším vývojem, tréninkem, způsobem, jak s ním (či s ní) budete jednat a zacházet. 
 Příběh hry pokrývá až 40+ let, dle rozhodnutí, které během svého života uděláte. Tato rozhodnutí budou samozřejmě ovlivňovat i vztahy s lidmi kolem vás, z některých budou třeba vaši kolegové, kteří vám pomůžou ve vaší vlastní společnosti, kterou si později můžete založít, z jiných se mohou stát vaši rivalové nebo klidně životní partneři, pokud však nějaké lidské vztahy budou mít ve vašem životě vůbec místo. Jako průkopník ve svém oboru brzy zjistíte, že vaše výtvory mají vliv na celou lidskou společnost a dění ve světě. Co se stane pokud vyvinete dokonalé robotické dělníky, kteří vytlačí lidskou pracovní sílu? Jak ovlivní světový mír skutečnost, že se armádě dostanou do rukou vaše vraždící stroje? Jak se lidská společnost zachová ke skutečnosti, že se začnou množit případy, kdy lidé preferují za své společníky syntetiky namísto lidí?

 Nebudu zacházet dál a do nějakých podrobností, ať vám případně nezkazím překvapení. Každopádně vězte, že hra nabízí opravdu obrovské množství různých variací příběhu, důsledky vašich rozhodnutí se mohou projevit hned, někdy později či třeba až na konci hry.
 Pro jednodušší představu výše zmíněného si můžete povšimnout, že hra obsahuje 72 achievementů, každý z nich reprezentuje jakousi důležitou událost či vážný důsledek vašich rozhodnutí. A já jich při mé první hře získal 9, herní doba byla něco mezi 3 - 4 hodinami. Vždy to samozřejmě záleží na tom, jak si povedete, každopádně znovuhratelnost je u této hry obrovská.
 Vývoj vaší postavy (např. sláva, bohatství), stejně jako vývoj vašeho robota (autonomie, empatie) a vztahy s důležitými postavami, které jste ve svém příběhu potkali, pak můžete neustále sledovat na oddělené kartě se statistikami.
 Na závěr bych ještě dodal, že hra se ukládá automaticky po každé volbě, kterou uděláte. Nelze to tedy nijak ošidit, jak to bylo kdysi možné v papírových verzích :-) Se svými případnými špatnými rozhodnutími se musíte vypořádat, i to k životu patří a tento životní příběh člověka a robota je rozhodně zajímavý a hodný k prozkoumání.

The writing is great, the story is thought through so that the story after your actions (the choices you pick) always is plausible and in tune with the character you decide to play as. The different choices really make the story change significantly and doesn't end in the same spot as after one of the other choices, so you will often discover something new as you make your way through the novel.

Granted the lack of anything ""gamelike"", illustrate, sound, only plain text and checkboxes. Can be a hurdle to decide if you want to spend your cash on it, but for me the story is fully worth getting this engaging and well written novel.

There are some interesting ideas about what it is to be human, have a soul and about what life really is. There's plenty of food for thought and after this first read through I find myself questioning what I really would have done in the situations the author presented me.

Something that bugged me is how although the game itself is fully thought out and realized, the actual writing isn't. Much of the early game was simply presenting you with choices and didn't tell much of a story. It lacked character and meaning. However (at least in my ending) the later stages of the game are far more concise and this more than makes up for the early game. Now that the author knew for sure which direction my story was going I noticed a distinct change in not only pace, but tone in the writing. It was much more drawn out, presented me with far fewer choices and was just working towards the finale, which was really something.

Some of the writing wouldn't up as a book, but the pros more than outweigh the cons. Replayability is off the charts, with at least four completely different directions the story can go, all of which have a couple of other off shoots. As long as you play it for the great philosophy and science-fiction, rather than the writing itself, you'll have a great time",1439527579,1439527626,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The most major thing in this for me: your choices matter, sometimes extremely significantly...like, changing whole chapters significantly.
(Spoilers)=== You could be stupid and attack the FBI with 0 military stat...and be thrown in jail, and that's the rest of the chapter compltetely changed. In my Technocratic, pacifistic utopia, the ENTIRE chapter 6 was rewritten. ===(end of spoilers)
I don't want to overhype this, but it's pretty damned compelling, and the connections between choices are made simultaneously clear...yet blurred, if that makes sense. You feel like something you did influenced it, but at the same time, it could pass for generic material, which I think is very intriguing.
Not to mention, when I chose one of the endings, at the beginning, I noticed stuff...missing. Particularly stuff that included...like...i dunno...the statue of freaking liberty! It wasn't there in my second play through. Like, that was actually a good chunk of the story in my first play through.

In it you play a brilliant Robotics engineer--think Hiro from Big Hero 6--who kickstarts the age of robotics. From the off it is full of choices your character can make, besides being very well written by the author. The robot I first built, Ariel,--the game lets you choose practically every aspect of them--was a daughter of sorts, having chose to activate the tiny winged humanoid while looking at me and naming myself as 'Father' to her. As she discovered the world around her and slowly, sometimes awkwardly, grew into a young adult under my care, I grew incredibly attached to her and it actually moved me to tears on more than one occasion. It is the most powerful game I have played in a very long time and some of the most powerful story telling I have encountered in a very long time.

Imagine a Asimov classic only you are the main character. My first story depicted a relationship akin to that of Doctor Lanning and Sonny from the film I, Robot mixed up with a reversal of the plot to Bicentennial Man for the protagonist. I brought about a golden age where man and a new species of mechanical people coexist in peace in the wake of a violent Sino-American war.

You literally can follow many paths through the way you design your first robot and raise them and your relationships with the story's many side characters. Will you achieve world domination? End man as we know him/her or live the high life as a Tony Stark type character? So many routes you can go down. Will you become an American hero or a backer of the Chinese? I have heard that you and your first robot can even become a crime-fighting vigilante duo!--but don't hold me to that.

Such an amazing game which, in relation to all others, I can only describe as a Bethesda RPG in text format... but with far better plot and writing.

Et un jeu par texte entièrement en anglais est-il accessible pour un Français non-bilingue?

Mes craintes ont été entièrement balayées dès le premier chapitre : est-ce prenant? Totalement. Malgré l'absence de graphismes, l'écriture très imagée et les situations intéressantes provoquent des images mentales très puissantes et notre imagination tourne à plein régime. Ce jeu est le pur successeur des ""Livres dont vous êtes le héros"", avec l'interractivité et une écriture adulte en plus. L'histoire, quant à elle, est intéressante, variée, non sans rebondissements, mais surtout elle fait la part belle à vos choix : on sent réellement que le jeu, l'aventure, l'histoire peuvent basculer à tout choix (il est d'ailleurs parfois un peu cruel de ne pas pouvoir revenir en arrière, ou de ne jamais ou presque pouvoir réviser ses choix, car les conséquences se payent cash. Mais c'est le jeu, ma pauvre Lucette). L'histoire monte en plus crescendo et a la vertu, malgré son thème majeur sur les robots, de nous faire passer par des phases de ""jeu"" très variées, bouleversant d'un chapitre sur l'autre tant les lieux, le contexte que les enjeux. Il y a en plus une vraie gestion du temps, et on se prend à vieillir avec son héros. Enfin, cerise sur le gâteau pour un jeu de choix, j'ai trouvé que les ficelles scénaristiques pour remettre votre histoire dans les ""rails"" du scénario étaient très rares ou discrètes, à l'inverse de certains jeux Telltale par exemple, on a très rarement l'impression que nos choix comptent peu : l'absence de travail graphique permet ainsi de complexifier le scénario et le jeu s'adapte un maximum à vos choix, les ""étapes obligées"" sont rares.
Quant au fait que le jeu soit tout en anglais, malgré la présence d'un vocabulaire varié et très littéraire, je pense qu'un niveau moyen en anglais suffit au minimum pour y jouer. L'aide d'un dictionnaire pour certains termes (pour aussi quelques références culturelles très américaines ou scientifiques) reste néanmoins presque indispensable.

Au final, un jeu que je recommande pour tous les joueurs pour qui une aventure vidéoludique peut se jouer tout autant voire plus dans la tête et l'imagination, surtout que le prix est abordable (moins cher qu'un vrai ""Livre dont vous êtes le héros"", en plus pratique, aventure de 4h environ mais forte rejouabilité).

[spoiler]Chapter 1 

On the day you first built F.R.Y., you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make F.R.Y. more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a metal bipedal robot with a masked head and humanoid hands. 

Then you went back to your place to teach F.R.Y. some words. 

Chapter 2 

The next day, you hooked up F.R.Y.'s biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then spent the afternoon perfecting F.R.Y.'s motor control and parts. 

As months passed, you became busy teaching F.R.Y. about the world through movies and taking it to the park. 

One day, however, Professor Ziegler claimed that F.R.Y. was not appealing enough to the military, and demanded you change it. You refused, and Professor Ziegler kicked you out of his lab. 

In time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about F.R.Y. and asked for an interview. You agreed. 

Chapter 3 

You gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview F.R.Y.. 

Mark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and F.R.Y.. 

Mark's article attracted the attention of one ""robotObsession1987,"" known in real life as Tammy Cooper. 

Shortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well. 

You joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. 

Chapter 4 

Your first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Alaska. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered. 

Your business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy. 

You were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. Despite your unhelpfulness, Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths. 

The tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. 

Chapter 5 

Captain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. But when your robots held a protest, you decided it wasn't worth it, and you backed out. 

But you soon realized that you were not happy working for the government and quit. 

An agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. 

You found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of F.R.Y. V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot. 

In the end, America lost the war, and the Chinese took over Alaska. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. 

Chapter 6B 

You created a humanoid companion robot named LEELA, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed LEELA was interested romantically in you. When F.R.Y. and LEELA were attacked in the street, LEELA accidentally killed Tammy. LEELA was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences. 

Chapter 7 

In 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to handle your mother's estate, since she had passed away recently. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. 

You chose to undergo surgery to remove the damaged tissue in your brain. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Dusa, F.R.Y.'s artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.[/spoiler]",1439353184,1439353184,True,0,0,0.466893017292022705,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Date simulator(To remind you that you suck at dating not only in real life. P/s: That's Exactly what happened to me)
-Life lessons(Like if you didn't have enough already)
-Decision making(Games like 'Life is Strange','The Wolf Among Us'(Highly recomend, as well as the comic series related the second game) are great for those who seek this kind of experience and 'Choice of Robots' is just at the level(=over 9000) not reachebable for mentioned games(maybe a few decades later, but not now))

I started this game new to robot games, and create your own adventure games. This is my experience so far. 
I started out with attoning  for sins, Sin was creating robots with no empathy. 
I then get pulled back to present. so I started creating robots. I then realised I was poor, so I got rich off my robot. I didn't mean to use the robot, but it was that or being homeless. So then, after becoming rich I started a business. Everything was so great, I was swimming in the green. Then suddenly China hacks into my businesses files and steals all of my blueprints. I thought everything would be okay if I cleared all my information before they could swipe it all but I was too late. Then before I know it, the Chinese were invading America with the robots built from my blueprints. That was a big uh-oh. From there I was ambushed by the FBI and thrown into prison. The Chinese secretly contacted me and helped me flee the country.

This game is the best $5 I've ever spent on something. Choice of robots is a sci-fi choose your own adventure novel with a huge scale. It's hard to describe just how emotionally attatched I became to the story. 

As a student at MIT pursueing his or her doctorate, you will decide just how you want to make your robot... your passion project. Throughout the story, your decisions will escelate to change the world. After playing through the game for a first time, it became clear to me that the plot about robotics is really just a path to a story about life.

This is a story about love, loss, power, weakness, friendship, trust, betrayal, and much more.

I recommend this playable story to everyone who likes a story based game and dosn't mind an almost graphicless game!

Jako konstruktor robotów podejmujemy teoretycznie dobre, czy nic nie znaczące decyzje, ale to onE mogą poprowadzić nie tylko nas, ale i cały świat do katastrofy.

I don't normally enjoy things enough to review them, so bare with me here.

My first 'playthrough', if I could call it that, it was much more of a readthrough, of 'Choice of Robots' took me just over three hours to get through, and likely could have taken much longer, assuming that I wasn't terrible and took so many 'bad' decisions, I'd say my first read could have easily lasted me four or maybe even five hours. It should go without saying, that there is an immense amount of replayability in a game such as this. Which is to mention, replaying this is definitely something I intend on doing, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to recreate the attachment & bond I had with my three foot tall, human-like, winged 'Ariel' with multitool hands, whom was vehemently opposed to conflict as a result of my actions.

See, Choice of Robots is a game where your choices can influence the course of humanity so heavily, that the sense of creating a story just for yourself lends to a sense of wonder and beauty that I haven't really experienced in many conventional books or text-based games in perhaps forever. Even though I could tell from about halfway through that my choices were going to lead me down a seemingly 'undesirable' route, (considering that my presumption was that I would shatter Capitalism and create a Utopia) I still continued to read on and make decisions based on the situation, as the writing and sense of achievement is so fantastically constructed, that I didn't find myself feeling sad, or upset at the fact that I might not get that 'good' ending, instead, I felt happy that in what is undoubtably a story of such scale & grandeur; mine was a story revolving around me, my friends & my family. This is what, in my eyes, we'd call a testament to the brilliance of the writing.

I can't speak of the aspect of how destroying the world may turn out, or how imposing a singularity upon humanity would be, but in my playthrough, the process of building up a robot in my own image, including its gender & naming it, right up to the viewpoint it had on the world, made interacting with my three foot tall companion really something quite special. Taking my creation which, at this point, had evolved into something so much more than just that, to the park, and observing the body language she gave off whilst she learned to properly kick off on a swing to propel herself up into the air was certainly pleasant. But knowing that our actions had turned her from being a military-backed weapon, into a video game loving creature of empathy? That was something else entirely; something I've not experienced before.

If you are even remotely interested in robotics, sentience, world politics and business practices, I'd heavily advise picking up this game. Even if you are just looking for a great story, you definitely won't be disappointed. I think the myriad of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews such as this give evidence to that.

My one gripe with this game, if anything, would perhaps be its length, which I don't even feel justified in saying, especially after just one playthrough. But in my particular instance, it felt as if certain sections were rushed, and that at quite a lot of stages, I didn't get the chance to sit and talk, explore and influence quite as much as I'd have liked to with other characters & situations. But this is completely forgiveable given the scale of the game and the immense replay value.",1439263989,1439264407,True,6,1,0.586178064346313477,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am fan of robots. Especially intelligent robots. They force us to imagine a world where humans come into contact with an intelligent species of our own creation and ask ourselves what we value in humanity and what we want represented in our creations.

This game perfectly captures what a ""make your own adventure"" should be. There are choices that you make that you won't see the results for until much later. There will be times where you eagerly want to restart the game because of a choice leading you down a undesirable path. And yet you want to see if you can salvage the situation because you created your robot companion, forged bonds with the people around you, and cause the stablility of the world to hang in the balance.

Example (*Spoilers*): I tried my hardest to make my robot (Legion) with empathy and autonomy so he would not despise humans. Imagine my shoch and horror as he almost betrays me at the start of a robot revolution. However, by making some tough choices, I managed to end the revolution (the robots still came out on top) and managed to patch things up with my creation. I grew old with him and my lover. At the near end of my life, he wishes to die with me, and wants to help me become a robot so I may live. I decline, seeing that I don't deserve to live forever and convince him that death is essential to being autonomous. My story ends with my family celebrating Legion's first daughter's birthday. I struggle to make it through, but through the choices I made, I manage to live on for a while longer and enjoy what I made. I, like my character, set out to make the perfect, human companion. What I didn't realize was I made the most perfect, imperfect companion. And that made him all the more human.

There is no music in this game, there is no fancy graphics either, but the story will have you immersed like no other and make you question how you would be in real life, and perhaps, what kind of impact you might make in the world.

No graphics, no gameworld, no combat. But what is one to expect from an interactive novel. Since i am such a stickler for form, i will still rate the game according to my normal nine criteria. 


genre: 3

it is the best interactive novel i have ""played"", at least in terms of making choices that matter. 



character customization, mods, etc: 1

You can pick male or female. That is it. You do get to pick whether you are interested in wealth, military, or idealism. But i wouldn't really consider this a character. 



story, mission, relevance: 3

don't expect War and Peace, because the writing has no literary merit, but there is plenty of story and your choices do matter. I have played through the story 5 times, and got 5 very different stories. There are at least 4 romantic partners (2 male, 1 female), there is a war, there is how your character will live out their life. In an interactive novel, i want my choices to matter. They definitely matter. In one of my play throughs, one of my choices resulted in my character dying in 10 minutes. I found this surprising, and satisfying.



gameworld: 1

not really a ""game world"", but there is a world you react to by making choices (usually 3). And the world does change. By your choices, the game world will either have you win, lose, or stalemate a war, build robots that help or harm humanity, or cause the world your character lives in experience a revolution. Certain key characters will thrive or die, including yourself, based on those choices. But this is not what i would call a game world. You don't pick up anything. You never see a picture of a single character or scene. You do a lot of reading.



innovation: 0



mechanics, combat, saves: 0




replayability: 3

like i said above, i played it 5 times, and got five different stories, including different endings and romantic partners. And i haven't exhausted the game's choices yet. I haven't played as a dreamy idealist. Haven't explored all the romantic possibilities. Still some ""gaming"" to do. 



uniqueness: 2

the fictional world is a sci-fi cliche. As the title suggests, it is a world full of robots. Being a lover of sci-fi, i am okay with that. I did find the number of choices a bit unique. And the straight-forward approach, with nothing but text, was unique to my experience of these sort of ""games"". 




graphics: 0

unless you consider the image of text on screen graphics. 


13 out of 27, or 48%



Do you like to read? Are you sick and tired of killing things? Had your fill of scavenging ruins for that bit of something needed to craft the next great weapon? Then this is the ""game"" for you. If you consider it a game. Even with such a low score, i do not regret buying this game. In an hour i can have a new story unfold before my fingers, and all by my choices. And i am kind of sick of these interactive novels that try and give the player gaming experience but fail to give players lots of meaningful choices. Just about every choice i made affected the story in some way. And there weren't walls of text to read through.

My second robot ""Dragoon"" was built specifically to be mass produced and world domination...  However between chinese hackers and a terrible grace score, I went bankrupt before the final phase of my plan, and instead reprogrammed his military into an atonomy boost, turning him into a prophet and briefly forming a religion around him.

...Then everything changed, when the chinese robots attacked...
The military recruited me for a secret project, Dragoon philisophically pondering my every choice...
I helped America win the war against China; but I'll never forgive the fact that I didn't win it myself and establish my New Paradigm...
...My friend was killed in a concentration camp...
...My rebellion begins in Alaska...  In hind-sight, I should have named Dragoon ""Liberty Prime"" for the irony...

My best friend turned on me, I thought I could trust her, but I knew I could only trust myself, my robot assassinated her before she could finish drawing her pistol.
We fought but eventually were out-gunned and out of luck...  But I fought until the bitter end.  I may have died, but I live immortally through history.

This game isn't so much a game as one of the most engrossing short stories I've ever read.  I guess I'll start at the beginning.

I am not a fan of text based games.  Take a look at my game library and you'll find it filled with graphically beautiful titles.  I bought this game on a whim because it was reviewed as overwhelmingly positive and it was extremely cheap during the Steam Summer Sale.  Having played it now, I gladly would have paid full price (which is still less than 5 dollars).

I made one mistake (or incredibly brilliant move, depending on how you look at it) when I played, I named my character after me and my robot after my wife.  This made the story all the more impactful and meaningful than I ever could have expected.  I tried to play peacefully, I cared for my loved ones, I avoided conflict and tried to be quiet, but they hammered me down.  Took everything I loved away from and locked me up.  Bitter and angry, I fought back, but I didn't have the skills or know-how and I failed bitterly at that as well.  In the end, the one thing that mattered most was still with me though.  All of those emotions came through in just two hours of play.

Having played it, you then look back and think ""I should have done that differently"" or ""I shouldn't have helped that guy"" or ""what could life had been if I had chosen her instead of her"".  These are all questions you can answer by firing the game up again.

+The story can take unexpected turns
+You very quickly get emotionally invested in the characters
+I have no doubt you could play the game four times through with wildly different results, and another eighty times for fun

You have to play this game atleast 2 times.

[b]TL;DR of the first time I played[/b]
[spoiler]Things couldn't have gone worse. At first I was very happy and I thought I was going to make the right choices and get everything I wanted. Then my dad died, Josh died, I couldn't stop the war from starting, I lost my company trying to help Silas and Eiji, I've been in jail, that Ziegler stole my robots, I couldn't get revenge, the robot friend I was starting to like wants to be a couple, and now my robot named ""Hope"" killed someone. I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, but I continued playing anyways. I bought the best lawyer and tell him to treat Hope as a pet and we won. But Hope was angry and ran away. Somehow (a game glitch) Hope was still with me after that. Unless at the beginning of the story, I always felt like everything bad that happened was somehow my fault, while at the same time I felt like I was nothing. Some time later, I died. End.[/spoiler]

[b]TL;DR of the second time I played[/b]
[spoiler]I left robots to be secondary. Bad things happened sometimes, but everything was ok at the end. I helped A LOT of people and everyone was happy. And I didn't die![/spoiler]

[h1]My story first story (that I wrote before playing for a second time). SPOILER ALERT[/h1]

Ok so I was happy because this game looked like what could happen to me, because the protagonist has my exact age and I'm creating an artificial intelligence. I didn't like the fact of working for the military, so they finaly fired me. That Ziegler is stupid. I didn't feel I had the experience of founding my own company, until I found Silas. He was my first employee, and I started to make robots for Hospitals at Detroit because Silicon Valley seemed too expensive. One of the robots I sold killed a patient but- Oh, who cares?? Then there was a bomb -I never figured out who or what was the cause- and I told my non-sentient robots to save the humans inside. Josh sacrificed himself to save important documents against my warning, and the robots were angry because I didn't try to save the rest of them but that doesn't make any sense because I didn't programm them to have feelings...??? Then thanks to the stupidness of Josh (that poor Josh) my company was saved. Oh yeah I forgot: Silas left the company because goverment was spying and I didn't fight them. But now he's here again and I LIKED HIM U KNOW ;_; but he asks me for help and then RUNS AWAY!! But yeah fuck him. Then I learn that Eiji's on danger (that manga-maker friend that reminds me of a real life friend who likes manga too) and I warn him, but then I get arrested. I'M IN JAIL!! I want rebellion. The president Irons gets me out of there with the condition of making robots for the military. I said yes, while my idea was to betray them once my robots were everywhere and stop the war somehow... Crazy, eh? Welp, somehow the war ended much sooned than I expected, but I was rich. I didn't get my revenge. I didn't care anymore. I made another robot and named it ""Hope"" while my idea was to teach him the basics and leave him live his own life without me; like to leave free a part of myself, and then end my days living as a rich without a care. But the game didn't let me choose that option, and Hope, Ivory (who is my first robot) and me, go living at the town of Hope, in Canada. Oh the irony. That wasn't planned, I swear. When I was starting to see Hope as what his name says, and I started to care again, something bad happens... again. Police calls and tells me that my robots killed someone. I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, I just wanted it to end. But I continued. I got the best lawyer and tell him to see Hope as a pet. We won but he got angry and left me- ""one morning you wake to find Hope gone"" I laugh at that... Then he somehow (a game glitch) is still with me. Hm :/ Some time later I die. In the dream at the end, I told Hope that I was glad to be his friend, then he said ""Thanks"" and SUICIDED. ""Go to hell"", I said. If you can't understand that I'm not in love with you, if you can't look for another girl, then you are dumb. I just wanted a friend. End.

[h1]My second story[/h1]

Chapter 1
I make a metal rotary-wing robot with a panoptic head and Inspector Gadget arms named Guardrone, because one of the reasons my first story went wrong was because my robot couldn't help anyone, and this time I want it to be strong. At first I don't want a boyfriend, but I end up being with Eiji because in the first story I died ""alone"" and bored, and I don't want that to happen again.

Chapter 2
Even if Guardrone looks like it's made for military, I want it to be good and I teach it as I teached the robot in my last story and increase its Empathy, and I keep being funded by DARPA...

Chapter 3
...until I let the reporter Mark to interview me and Guardrone, because that makes Ziegler angry. Mark writes a positive article about me and Guardrone, and Silas finds me again, the same way he found me in my last story. I treat him the same way even if I don't trust him like before. My dad dies (I thought I could prevent this but I guess not) and I decide to create my own company named Effort, to create the best medical technology. 

Chapter 4
I make a contract with Galen Medical, buy a factory in Silicot Valley and hire only human workers. Everything was fine except I there was not enought money, and China stole my technology, so I went bankrupt. I went to live with Eiji and started to work for Josh. Something political happened (I don't understand politics) and the war between the United States and China started.

Chapter 5
This time, I didn't care that Ziegler was stealing my robots, and I accepted to work with Captain Rogers but only if my robots were nonviolent. Silas asked me to help him, like last time, and everything went exactly the same way as in my last story, except this time I didn't care that he betrayed me, and I thought I could save Eiji because my Guardrone was better for protecting people. But when the agent came, I did't want to risk my freedom, I didn't want to go to jail like last time, and I thought that maybe, if they capture Eiji but they let me free, maybe I could get him out of there somehow. But I couldn't, there weren't any options for that. America lost the war, and as I had a lot of Grace, I could choose the option of ""develop resource allocation algorithms that gradually made human governments irrelevant.""

Chapter 6A (why that ""A""?)
Many people felt displaced, but I decided they had to deal with it. I helped Josh, I didn't hate Ziegler anymore so I said nice things to him, I convinced Mark to not suicide, I let Juliet Rogers to be Batman if she wanted, I let Silas and some other people to believe what they wanted about robots (they made a Church) but never encouraged them to do it. And I had Eiji and my son Angel (how cheesy, I know. I thought of naming him Soul or Spirit, because I wanted to highlight his humanity, but I chose Angel because its a real people name and it's similar to what I had in mind).

Chapter 7
My surgical technology kept my mom alive this long. I had that stroke again, but this time I didn't saw a robot in the dream, but Eiji, and I was happy with that. I left robots being absolutely secondary in this story. Even if maybe this time could have gone well, I didn't risk going through surgery, and I decided to let Angel ignorant about this. Maybe in the future they will be able to cure him. Eiji approved my decision. While I was in Angel's birthday party, I was about to faint again, but I could fight it because I had 93% humanity! Yay! So we lived happily ever after.

Summary of Completed Chapters 

Chapter 1 

On the day you first built Sarah, you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make Sarah more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a plastic winged robot with a humanlike head and humanoid hands. 

Then you went back to your place to teach Sarah some words. 

Chapter 2 

The next day, you hooked up Sarah's biodiesel engine and tried activating her. You then took Sarah to see Josh, who was impressed and agreed to fund your education if you would work for him after you graduated. You discovered you were attracted to Juliet, but you didn't succeed in making a good enough impression for her to reciprocate your feelings. Josh told you that evening about how he'd once been a juvenile delinquent, essentially, but turned around because he was inspired by Asmiov's book I, Robot to make a robot company called ""U.S. Robots."" 

As months passed, you became busy teaching Sarah about the world through high school textbooks and taking her to the park. Your funding from U.S. Robots kept you in Professor Ziegler's good graces during this time. 

In time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about Sarah and asked for an interview. You agreed. 

Chapter 3 

You gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview Sarah. 

Mark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and Sarah. When Professor Ziegler found out about the article, he was very displeased, but decided that the most effective way to get you out of his hair was to let you graduate. 

Mark's article also attracted the attention of one ""robotObsession1987,"" known in real life as Tammy Cooper. A month or so later, you received your doctorate. Shortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved then to work on better medical technology that could save people like your father in the future. 

You joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. Elly had already volunteered to be your first employee. 

Chapter 4 

Your first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Detroit. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered. Your business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy. 

You were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. You gave a significant donation, and Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths. The tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. 

Chapter 5 

Captain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. An agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. Elly fled to Canada to escape the American agents. A man identifying himself as ""Mr. Sun"" hacked his way into one of your robots to ask you to defect. You did not. 

In the end, America muddled its way through the war relatively unscathed. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. 

Chapter 6B 

You created a humanoid companion robot named Michelle, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed Michelle was interested romantically in you. When Sarah and Michelle were attacked in the street, your robots were badly damaged. You pressed charges and dissuaded Tammy from any further attacks. 

Chapter 7 

In 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to surprise your mother with a gift for the holidays. You learned it was your surgical technology that had kept her alive this long. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. 

Instead of undergoing surgery, you chose to create a robot body for yourself. With your robot self pursuing all of your ambitious plans for you, you finally had time to relax and enjoy your relationship with Michelle, and you lived happily ever after.

In interactive novels the writing is (literally) everything. And on that merit alone this one succeeds with flying colours. It's just so well written, I really can't praise author Kevin Gold enough. His real-world technical understanding of the concepts involved make Choice of Robots emminently immersive and believable without going (too far) over your head. And beyond the technical details, this is just good old fashioned great storytelling. Whether you choose to roleplay the asocial genius with only robots for friends, a cuthroat captain of industry, a devoted lover, an artist, a power hungry tyrant, or any other of the myriad life paths Choice of Robots presents, this game will tell you a story that is fundamentally about being human. And it's a compelling one at that.

Every time I sit down to play, I'm choosing to reinvest my precious time in a game that I know is going to make me really feel something, and often it's something completely different from the last playthrough. I feel thrilled when a long term goal comes to fruition, and conversely the way things spiral out of control sometimes can be genuinely upsetting. Whether I achieve my starting goals or not, almost every playthrough prompts me to redefine what it means to win. Because five playthroughs in, I'm still finding myself becoming attached to the small cast of characters in new ways. I can't say that about many other games.

Although the replay value of this game is quite high because of all of that, there is one caveat. I'll call it the Taris Effect (KOTOR players will already know what I mean). The story will always start the same way, and there are only a limited number of ways out. The choices in these first big branches can become familiar, and the immediate results start to lose their impact after only a few plays. In Choice of Robots' defense, the number of smaller and more unique branches quickly multiply once you get [strike]off Taris[/strike] out of school. Not really a dealbreaker I'd say.

I have build robots for war, for peace, for intercourse, for success and failure.
And not a single time i felt like i was forced to do something.

That is why i love choice of robots.
Where other games stuff must happen for the plot.
In choice of robots the only thing that must happen is that you build a robot.
Everything else change's by every choice you make.

The game is also very believeable.
No techno babble or random unbelieveable hyper tech.
No everything in the game is believeable because it uses stuff most internet user have atleast heard off.

There are so many times when i asked myself:
What did i do wrong.
What choice to i have to change to get a different outcome.
Sometimes it is something as small as being nice or mean to a person you met 3 years ago.

Your robot has four stats.
They effect the outcome of many choices.
The difference between success and failure often relies on your robots have the stats for what you want them to do.",1428063269,1428063269,True,29,0,0.659546315670013428,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The level of details and sophistication is over the top. The consequences of your choices are never dull and always exciting and full of emotions. I just love this game and the maker for this experience. 

Pros:
+ The story itself is not linear but very open to your choices so that you can have freedom to decide your own fate in this game.
+ The maker knows what he's talking about about various topics including robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and even legal aspects of human rights.
+ The characters are very unique and personal. They are never the same people but are unique in their views and beliefs.
+ The robots you create respond to you according to your decisions.
+ The political aspect of war and moral dilemma was superbly done. I had to pause the game for a moment to decide which choice would be 'right' for me.
+ As a player, you can be emotionally attached to your robot and it feels as though she(or he) is really alive.
+ I just finished the game but I've only unlocked 14 percent of the achievements. There's definitely replayability for this game.
+ Personally, it is far better than your typically 'wifu' games that have shallow stories and charcters. This game allows you to interact with your robots on deeper level.

Cons:
- I really can't think of any. I hope the game would have been longer, but I'm not really complaining.
- No graphics or sound effects, BUT I actually prefer it that way because it forces you to use your imagination. And come on, this game was made by ONE person if I'm not mistaken. I'm still very impressed by the fact that one person was able to write this lengthy scenario of a game.
- More 'war' scenarios with China or other countries would have been nicer.

Bottom Line:
This is an extraordinary game and the maker of this game is brilliant.
Your robots can be as fun and interesting as you make them to be.
It all depends on your choice.
But you might not like this game if you believe that graphics and action are a must in a game.
Personally, I appreciate deep story and memorable characters (I'm also a fan of FF games).
So you'll like it (or love it like I do) if you are like me.

However, for someone who is looking for a good story, Choice of Robots is worth the money you spend on it and is a wonderful narrative. I blog about stuff like this all the time, and am always looking for a good read. Choice of Robots was far better than I could have imagined and was worth every penny, as well as will be worth all the time it will take in order to get each and every achievement.

The story is interesting on it's own; make a robot, decide who to work for if anyone, go through a war, maybe even find love. The choices you're able to make through the game is really what puts the cherry on top of this game; the game's mechanics follow a normal choice based game, but the choices you choose are relevant throughout the story; depending on what you choose at the beginning alters the ending(which is where some choose your own story games lack, and instead, your choice is more relevant between different sections of the story). It's interesting to choose what you would like to do and see all the concequences this leads to.

I won't spoil any of the actual game because it's so worth it to check out the whole thing, but I highly recommend this game. As I said, it was short; for a fast reader like myself, it took a little over one half hour to go through one ending of the game, but it's very touching and you fall in love with the characters you meet/create.",1426826478,1426826478,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

No music, no pictures, just text. A ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" game apparently. You are a robotic engineer in Sillicon Valley building a robotic companion and shaping the world along the way over the course of your life. Each section of text comes with you making a decision potentially altering your path - what you are doing with your life, how the people around you will react and what will happen with the world as a whole (or not, as being passive is usually an option too). 

There are several values regarding your life and the character of your robotic companion that you'll influence with your choices through the entire game and which will affect the choices you can make later on decisively. For example you can build a humanoid-looking robot and teach him (or her, or it, or whatever - you are given freedom in naming and adressing things) to get along with people increasing his ""Empathy"" and ""Grace"" values or, on the contrary, shape him to clearly stand apart from humans and handle guns and stuff increasing ""Military"" and ""Autonomy"". This value-play can sometimes feel a bit like a guessing game, and how it will affect your later course is hardly predictable, which can be seen as a good or bad thing I guess, but then I suppose that's just how life works too.

Perhaps at times the game feels a little bit too much like a dating simulator or relationship juggling. Maybe this comes natural with such games and with them trying to resemble life and how choices affect it. I can't say I remember having played anything like this before (""Cinders"" maybe), so I don't know. Still: There is a ""Romance: ..."" placeholder at all times and the game doesn't hesitate to question your inner self quickly whether you have romantic feelings towards a just recently introduced character of either gender, or make them burst out with acts or words of affection towards you right away, which felt a bit unrealistic and forced or at the very least awkward to me at times. 

Sometimes events are pressed on too quickly for my taste. There are some happenings and characters I would love to see elaborated more, but the game can be unforgiving there, making you lose track of them rather quickly pressing onward towards new things and situations. Even some greater time leaps of multiple years it doesn't hesitate to do where a little more patience might have served better. I haven't finished the game yet though so I don't want to fully judge that yet. I don't claim to know better in terms of writing. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's just right, elaborating more could end up losing track of things and aims and such and bloat things up artificially. I just sometimes felt sad and unhappy about the turn of events and how I lost touch to some characters or screwed up in geopolitical questions with no chances of undoing my mistakes.

If you're into the Interactive Novel stuff in the first place, then the game is definitely worth trying out.

Pros:
+ Being a pure text-based, it doesn't bore you to death with pseudo-animated scenes: you progress as fast as you can read, with no need to abuse the mouse and / or resorting to the 'skip it' button;
+ Meaningful choices at the end of each (well, almost each) text block. Each of your actions reflects on your robot which in turn reflects on the next set of actions available;
+ You can actually kill off pretty much everyone mentioned as notable characters in the end ^_^
+ No ""sweet-soap"" type of happy ending... at least, it is not enforced upon you =)

This isn't unplayable garbage, nor is it mindless. However, its attempts at intelligence only set it to a higher standard, which it fails to live up to.

First, a story is a lot shorter than I thought it would be-both of the two endings I reached took less than half an hour to get to. This means it's not nearly as deep as the promised ""300,000 word epic""-oh, even if it has that many in its files, you'll see just a tiny portion of it. So that's one problem. The second is that while my first playthrough was genuinely ""in-character"" and ended up with me getting a ""bad"" (though not unexpected) ending, my second had me actively trying to munchkin my way to a good one (and being at least partially successful).

That I resorted to this was not a good sign. The game is too complex and has too many outcomes for one to just follow a strict ""Do X to see Outcome Y"", like in some similar ""choose your own adventure""-style games. But the differences in outcomes themselves aren't great enough for the complexity to be worth it. Nor is the story great or intellectually stimulating enough-though it tries- to be worth repeating many times.

PROS:
-Long gripping story that will keep you entertained for hours.
-Choices that actually shape the story around you.
-Many different endings that can change with the smallest choice.
-When you think you have a part of the story figured out and you believe you have the perfect stategy for making the most money the game laughs in your face be changing the outcome of that situation on your next playthrough..

CONS:
-Will make you realize that no other text based game can compare.
-Could use a few more main characters in the story.

[*] Restart: there are no save slots, no save scumming out a different ending here buddy.

There's some genuinely moving moments and some genuinely depressing/tragic ones, depending on the choices you make.

RIP-Darwin Tesla 1995-2049 (SPOILER ALERT)

starting off at the age of 19 creating the first (aptly named) Drone. this companion would be with him till the day he dies.

yet never learning that he should have just told the media to ""fuck off.""

Though before I can tell you his story it's best i describe Drone to you: Drone has a panoramic head with multiple cameras for a great enviromental awearness attatched to a relatively small chassis containing a motorcycle battery with a small pair of helicopter like blades for flight as well as insect like wings for stability

Now that thats out of the way:

When he first activated drone he did so looking directly at her (he had decided to refer to Drone as feminine due to the sleak design) so that the first thing she would see is him over night she went through a simulation of kindergarden to highschool and very soon he found himself with drone in everything from the the front page of the new york times to starring on the late show Drone was originally designed with military purpose in mind starting from killing someone who sent him a death threat to assassinating the first person involved with Drone in military purpose (the day after drone was first created) skipping ahead a few years Darwin found himself at the funeral of his father having died from a tumer which would ultimately be the death of Darwin himself.

((i should have known the option to see if it was genetic was going to bite me in the ass))

Drone by this point was the size of a person and Darwin was close to opening his first factory which he had decided would be completely autonomous creating exact replicas of Drone using the identical AI knowing everything Drone had learned up until this point

(a few more years ahead)

china had stolen designs of Drone but they weren't as good though carrying rifles were far more deadly especially when the chinese president himself was on a parade though the streets one of the bystanders had opened fire sparking a skirmish between the people and the chinese droids Drone had tried to protect the president though this was mistaken for an act of hostility in the end causing Drone to be shot in the centre most camera which is why Darwin tried to resue her resulting in him being shot in the crossfire which meant he had to amputate hes arm though being the robotics genius that he was he built himself a new arm (which proved to be useful upon his death) this one with a gun inbuilt so that he would never be defenceless again

And this is where i leave you to make your own story and see how amazing it this game really is.

(SUPER SPOILER ALERT)









The genetic disease Darwin had (as mentioned earlier) both caused his death and let him live because it both made him smarter but over time caused large portions of his brain to shutdown instead of surgery to fix this he decided to build himself a new artificial body entirely which was only finnished in his dying moments as he desperately clinged to life just to flick that one switch which would turn on his mecanical doppleganger which was the last thing Darwin would ever see as it left the room if he didn't create his mechanical arm he would have likely died before being able to complete his new body

""Full"" Review.

Now since this is a Choose Your Own Adventure(let's call it for now CYOA) , it makes little sense to write a traditional review. What I can say about this  game is that it's pretty great if you're interested in AI and Sci-Fi(and CYOA Games, duh), then you will enjoy it, alot. I played through it twice already it I had two completely different stories, dispite some events remaining more or less the same. There are only two negatives to this game that I have found, 
A) Is there a save option? Can I contintue if I close the game? A possibility to close the game normaly to begin with?
B)Also, no FOV slider.
Both of those are however rather irrelevant I found.(B was irrelevant too for some inexplicable reason)

Análisis basado en una copia digital del juego para steam, facilitada por el equipo de Choice of Games.",1421590197,1421590197,True,5,6,0.567928731441497803,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Главный герой - молодой ученый, который занимается конструированием роботов. Все действие представлено в виде фрагментов текста, большинство из которых предоставляет возможность выбрать один из нескольких вариантов развития событий. Они влияют на статистику главного героя (например, здоровье или богатство) и на характеристики его спутника-робота (автономность, боевая мощь, эмпатия...). 

До этой игры я относилась к жанру ""Choose your own adventure"" несколько предвзято - книги этого типа на русском языке, которые мне попадались, были написаны не слишком интересным язком и ориентировались скорее на внешний сюжет и статистику персонажа, а прохождение заключалось в нахождении самого ""правильного"" варианта. Choice of Robots от таких книг разительно отличается. Единственное ""но"" - нужно знать английский язык, причем на неплохом уровне (несколько раз пришлось отвлекаться на поиск в интернете перевода слов, значений технических терминов, источников цитат... но для меня это еще одно достоинство игры, поскольку в остальном чтение сложностей не доставило). 

Одно прохождение-прочтение заняло около 3 часов. 

Существеные особенности: 
- Нет возможности вернуться к предыдущей странице, если результ выбора чем-то не понравился. Даже если вы случайно кликнули не на тот вариант или недопоняли его смысл. Выбор сделан и вам дальше с этим жить)) Это очень усиливает впечатление от игры: местами психологическое напряжение выше, чем в иных ""обычных"" РПГ со звуком и графикой. Хорошо, что хоть время на размышление не ограничено. 

- Игрок ""конструирует"" не только себя (что характерно для любой РПГ), но и своего спутника-робота. Для меня уникальность Choice of Robots именно в этом - робот является самостоятельным персонжем, с которым игрокв ведет постоянный диалог, но при этом можно сильно повлиять на то, каким он будет.  

- Много текста. Я ожидала, что при втором прочтении большую часть страниц можно пролистывать, так как их содержание будет уже известно, но нет: меняются мелкие детали, меняется поведение персонажей, могут появиться целые новые эпизоды. Далеко не всегда можно вычислить, что именно послужило причиной этих изменений. Почему в первый раз робот не спросил у меня, как называть меня - Master или Sensei, а во второй спросил? Что произойдет, если из двух одновременно поступивших на телефон звонков выбрать другой? Если сбросить оба? Какой жесткий диск лучше выбрать для робота? Как повлияет на его характер, если его обучение будет состоять из игры в Braid? 

Даже при повторном прочтении, когда основной сюжет уже известен, и можно поставить себе цель раскрыть конкретную концовку, игра остается захватыавющей, поскольку ""подходящие"" варианты неочевидны. Прочитала два раза, в планах, как минимум, еще два, а может и больше. 

Не знаю, насколько хороши другие продукты Choice of Games (вряд ли настолько же), но при случае посмотрю и их (благо, с демо-версиями порядок, и можно оценить, насколько нравится стиль конкретного текста). Но это игра - не просто понравилась, а попала для меня в разряд шедевров. Тем, кого не пугает большой объем текста на английском языке, отсутствие музыки (но всегда ведь можно включить подходящий саундтрек в плеере) и иллюстраций (отлично написаный текст плюс ваше воображение это с лихвой кмпенсирует) игра однозначно придется по вкусу.

Build a robot for war, or for love, (heck one option that you can get is to build sexbots!) legalise human-robot marriage, you can even have a cult around your robot.

Conquer the world and rule it as a dictator, or have your robots infiltrate society and get humans to accept them as their rulers.

Обновлено 14.01.15:

Я ""прошел"" игру. Никогда прежде меня так не завдевала ни одна книга и ни одна компьютерная игра. Я сделал много не очень правильных решений, но в жизни не всё зависит от нас самих, быть может, здесь и не могло быть правильного пути, но в конце было очень сложно ""платить"" за свой выбор. А в конце своей ""жизни"" решил, что мало сделал глупостей, и сглупил так, что теперь очень тяжело на душе... А ведь это всего-лишь текст.

Пройду еще несколько раз, попытаюсь найти свой хэппи-энд.

In CoR, your choices define the story; there is no illusion of choice. Your choices have impact and they will make a difference. As such, CoR is definitely worth two or more playthroughs because you'll get vastly different situations and events each time.

The choices you get are interesting and thought-provoking enough that it's almost always guaranteed you'll find one you like. Oftentimes, they are just downright tough. However, CoR is very forgiving in that if you do happen to make a less-than optimal decision, you can just continue right on because the resulting consequences are just as interesting. I would not recommend you to restart the game because that is unnecessary. You'll also get many backdoor options that you can fall back on if you choose to.

Robots are my favourite trochee!

Witness a compelling story as your actions will influence the character of your robot, as well as their ability to 'have character', and the only loosely formuleic and entirely unpredictable actions of your robots influence your humanity. The story the game generated for me was easily comprable with a good speculative sci-fi novella, however downsides included a shortage of character development (possibly triggered however by my character's insatiable bloodlust).

All in all, my robot, 'Killall', loosely followed the common 'robot struggle for autonomy and recognition' formula, but there was a lot in the way of robot parenting that could be performed by the player to divert the robot's agenda, wherein the interaction between player and robot (second player character, I felt) was not a chore at all, but felt the part as the most real interaction in the game.

During my first playthrough (skip to avoid spoilers) after creating my robot (Airu) I got kicked out of school for not conforming to a military agenda. I met up with an old friend who I started to date. Made my own company. Indirectly started a war when my company's security got hacked. Refused to use my robots to fight in said war. Got Married. Got thrown in prison where I stayed until the president got me out. Made companion robots possible. First companion robot was madly in love with me and made my spouse jealous. Reassured spouse and then together stood up for equality between humans and robots. Decided to have a kid. Mom made me tearful. Had medical problems. Companion robot made me want to cry. My spouse made me cry. Airu made me cry more. Underwent surgery and became slightly robotic. Airu created a kid for herself. Companion robot and Airu started to like each other. Changed a lot and I survived.

I really enjoyed the story and writing of this game and will definitely be playing more of it.

The only thing I particularly have grief with is the lack of a save system, which makes replays arbitrarily longer, especially considering how the first chapter is largely stats-building with fewer (relatively) plot-influencing choices. If you want to retry a choice to see how it turns out - or worse, misclick at any point - the only recourse is to restart the entire game.

Simliar to Telltale Games the game is tailored by choices you make with some events being fixed to happen, but how they happen and their outcome is up to you. This game seems to have 3 or 4 main stages.

Stage 1: You're a grad student working for his/her PHD under a professor Zeigler (or something like that), the year is about 2021 and you are creating a robot, little do you know this little critter (depending on how you play the game) will revolutionise the modern world of robotics. You have (in my mind anyway) 2 main stats, fame and humanity, your robot also has stats: Grace, Autonomy, Empathy and Military. Both your stats and your robots are effected by your choices and actions.

Stage 2: You either work for your friends company or you own your own company. Your earlier choices effect what kind of robots you specialise in so military, friendly and intelligent AI, surgery, work-bots or just mass production. I shan't spoil the suprise but war is declared by the US against China.

Stage 3/4: You are at war with China, how much you contribute to the war effort will affect the outcome. After the war, depending on your stats you can either create a rebellion against the winning side of the war in Alaska, create the algorithms for the perfect peaceful society, create companion bots or something else I can't remember.

Step 5: I shan't spoil too much but it can be rather emotional :'(

Choice of Games is an interesting game publisher; their games  don’t have any fancy graphical effects and they certainly don’t contain any sound, either. In fact, they  are entirely text-based  choose-your-own books. Over the years they have garnered a huge fan base who eagerly await their new releases. Choice of Robots, by Kevin Gold, is their latest game – and my first foray into their offerings – and it has left me more than a little impressed.

Choice of Robots casts you as a scientist working on their PHD thesis in a university robotics lab, under the guidance of Professor Ziegler.  The choices you make in this expansive 300,000 word novel will not only determine your own fate, but could also impact the fate of the world as a whole. Every decision you make has a very real consequence and could benefit you greatly, or come back to haunt you later on down the road.

What kind of robot you  create is entirely down to you, and Choice of Robots is very open in this regard. Whether you want to create the ultimate war machine used by the army on the battlefield, or something more useful for the general public, like a cooking robot, or sexbot, is all down to you. My own robot, called Flexo, was an empathetic, human-like machine, with arms and a sock puppet face , much to the chagrin of Professor Ziegler. Ziegler’s only concern is acquiring funding money for his department, so that he can kick back and relax while his students do all of the hard work for him. He argued that my robot was too human and would not appeal to the military, and so I appeased him by adding a hand-mounted gun to Flexo. This would be one of only a few interactions I would have with the military over the course of the book, but I was tantalised by what could have been if I had created a combat-focused machine.

I soon found myself travelling to China and setting up a factory, selling directly to the consumer. Our brand of robot could be used for cooking, cleaning and childcare. It proved to be a hit and made me moderately wealthy! I was a fool to have been so easily lured by those damn slave-labour wages, though, as the Chinese government stole my designs and began manufacturing a cheaper alternative.  I got my own back on the Communist bastards when I started manufacturing robots for the American army, who swiftly kicked their arses! Manufacturing military robots was never my intention though, and I returned to my initial goal:  creating realistic humanoids that could reason, laugh, and maybe, even, love?


I had devoted my life to robotics, lost friends and created enemies, but I had never truly loved, but then I created ‘Flame’. Flame, Flexo and I lived out our lives in relative harmony, and although I hadn’t impacted the world in a hugely meaningful way, I was content with the decisions  I had made. As things go, I came  away with a positive ending for my robot lover and I.

Kevin Gold deftly interweaves humour, suspense, sci-fi and romance in Choice of Robots. At points I felt saddened by the results of my actions,at others I laughed heartily at the fact I was dating a robot.  Everything flows together so neatly that the game’s distinct thematic differences feel natural and intriguing. The game also has its own progress menu that keeps you up to date with how your relationships with other characters are going, and  they can change depending on your actions towards them. You can also keep tabs on your wealth, humanity, and how well your own robot is developing. Neat little touches like this give a real reason to go back and replay the game, to see how different decisions affect the outcome. Given the plethora of decisions you can make, and the number of different paths you can go down, it is clear that Kevin Gold has poured an absurd amount of time into Choice of Robots,  It is not your typical game by any stretch of the imagination, but having just completed Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf, I was happy to jump into another text-heavy adventure that let my brain do the graphics processing for a change.

Choice of Robots is a fun and absorbing book, that feels like your decisions have importance. Ultimately, it is what you make it, and whether that is a war torn planet with robots that hate humans, or one where sexed up robots want to jump your bones , is up to you.

Я никогда не был фанатом игр типа Choose Your Own Adventure (да и, честно признаться, даже за игры их не считал), но в случае Choice of Robots я не мог отказаться от покупки ввиду двух причин: во-первых, научная фантастика рулит, а во-вторых, я прочитал множество различных отзывов об этой игре и не смог остаться равнодушным.

Свобода выбора здесь, по факту, безгранична: вы можете контролировать каждую деталь при создании своего первого робота-компаньона (от выбора формы его головы и количества ног до выбора источника питания и типа жёсткого диска) и в течение всего сюжетного пути. В Choice of Robots я чувствовал себя как нельзя уютно, и успел вжиться в роль Тима, который собрал своего геликоптерного робота Robobate'а с двумя клешнехватами и глазами по всему периметру его головы. Потом я обучил своего компаньона всему-всему через Интернет. То, что происходило дальше, может испортить ваше впечатление от игры, ибо спойлеры - зло, так что я просто скажу, что последующие события не давали мне оторваться от экрана до самого конца, который, признаю, был весьма неожиданным. 

Количество разномастных концовок я даже не хочу пытаться сосчитать. Десятки? Сотни? Моя была очень трагична, но кто знает, как бы всё могло обернуться, не сделав я своего робота из металла? Не приняв звонок от репортёра? Не поругавшись с профессором в университете?
Вы вольны завести здесь роман, запустить свой стартап, или даже захватить весь мир.

Да, в игре нет графики, нет музыки, лишь примитивный геймплей под названием ""ткни-по-одному-из-вариантов"". Зато у игры есть сюжет. Нет, не так: СЮЖЕТИЩЕ. Тысячи сюжетов. Это как прочитать книгу своей мечты, как погрузиться в осознанное сновидение. Вы сами хозяева своей судьбы. Вам решать, что будет дальше. Просто запустите любимый музыкальный альбом в аудиоплеере и наслаждайтесь... жизнью?

Нет у данного шедевра весомых недостатков. Нет - и всё. Кому-то может не понравиться то, что игра доступна только на английском языке, но вы представьте, какой это труд - перевести  массив из трёхсот тысяч слов? Если хотите в полной мере насладиться этим незабываемым приключением, то выучите английский! Переводчик здесь не помощник: море речевых оборотов и игра слов вам не хухры-мухры.

Знаете английский? Любите научную фантастику? Берите, не задумываясь. Вам понравится. А я обязательно как-нибудь перепройду эту красоту, и, скорее всего, не один раз.",1420647696,1450552176,True,46,5,0.77791517972946167,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has persistant stats/traits of your robot and yourself that set it apart from just being a simple CYOA book/game.

There's, to say the VERY leasy, a plethora of branching options. There is so, so many. I have played this intensely for 13 hours I and I feel I have explored less than half of all the options. You can choose so many different things it's incredible, and I hope they do more sci-fi adventures like this.

Some of the options include: Becoming a zillionare, conquering alaska, creating sexbots, making robots rule everyone, making robots serve everyone, or a mix of both. Creating a personal robot companion. And best of all, electrifying a pickle and eating lutefisk.

All these possible options and choices are determined by the stats you gather through the choices themselves. The future consequences of your choices are mostly determined by what stat you have on yourself or you robot relating to that choice.

It's quite simple, but it works very well, and if the story is good enough, the gameplay frame behind it works, too. The lack of save/load is my only qualm, and I hope they expand ChoiceScript to allow for that, because having to explore a million options by restarting the game over and over can get quite bothersome.

Overall I recommend this game to anyone who has ever had even a passing interest in sci-fi or sci-fi literature, as it is not a hard thing to enjoy this, and it explores many ideas. Some of which can be ridiculous, plausible, or prophetic. It's fairly obvious a computer scientist wrote this, but I think it works well for the setting.

In this run, China rose up to defeat the US, but I made China's so-called victories hollow by making robots run the world as humanity's caretakers, making their ""wins"" irrelevant. Love that twist!


UPDATE: Second playthrough. I hate being a rebel. But seeing Alaska being run by robots, and the money going to the people felt good.

UPDATE: 5:20pm. Gosh darnit just finished playing my third playthrough. This time, I liked ripping Alaska from the US and making it the first automated nation in the world.

You know, I even mananged to forget that I had to eat lunch? So I ate lunch at arond 4pm. And now, I'm getting hungry again. I will not forget to eat dinner.

The game let's you question your own moral and does not show a fairy tail version of the world, but a rather realistic one where you are not always able to go the way you want to. 

I think Choice of Robots really is an awesome variety to your typical pc game and I want to recommend it to everyone who sometimes feels tired of those flat triple a titles - just like myself.

the form this game, this experience, comes to you is perfectly fine as it is.

ever felt a bit disapointed after completing a game (or book), because playing (reading) it again wouldnt be that great or even pointless even if you liked it so much?
well, me too. but i got through this three times already (in three days), after each session already thinking about the next try, which decissions to take in the new story ect.

The amount of work put into this book is rather amazing.  The beginning is repetitious in subsequent playthroughs because the time is spent designing and building your robot.  After this point, however, your story can vary wildly.  A lot of philosophical questions are addressed throughout your life.  It's reminiscent of Asimov in a number of ways.  Occasionally, you are limited to choices that differ from what you want to do, but not often.  

For completionists, there are a number of achievements to get depending on what you've done or who you've become.  The game suggests you look through them, I suggest you avoid doing so unless you have played through many times.

Most people complain about the odd details forced into the story and simple writing but it isn't supposed to be a book. Its a game, as stated earlier I thought it WAS a book but it isn't. It is a full-fleged game. The writing isn't supposed to be wonderful. Also, those odd details are there because they are a result of choosing your own Adventure. And they pop up later.

-Took over Alaska
-Killed a women
-Built a robot-tounge
-Got my arm blown off by a terrorist and replaced it with a gun

You affect the world, you affect everything around you with the choices you make. Is your robot going to be a soulless military machine? An emotional believer in robot-human rights? Or something else in between? Will you hate all the humans and assume they're exploiting you, or work with one or two and see where the road takes you?

I recently finished playing ""Choice of Robots"". My first time through I lost badly.I'm still trying to wrap my head around how my own personal choices were deemed inferior. But since it was MY story, I'll have to accept my failings, though I have to expect the creator/writer of EVERY choice I made to be willing to share those flaws.
I've played many text games. When I began playing there wasn't much else, unless you wanted to play Pong. Zork, which I played in 1985, is still perhaps my favorite computer gaming experience. Some of the WONDERFUL Infocom games, such as ""Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare"" actually benefited from being purely text. 
I've read many pages of science fiction. Between my two favorite catagories, science fiction and fantasy, the pages literally number well over a million, so there aren't many speculative fiction concepts I've not encountered.
But we're here to discuss ""Choice of Robots"". First off, on the basis of cost/hour this is among the MOST expensive, shortest computer games I have ever played. True, it was less than $3 (on sale), but lasted under 2 hours (even with starting over on PC #2), most of the time spent in thought. There was nothing new in this game, beyond perhaps some of the more recent concepts not devised yet when I was doing the bulk  of my reading. As far as robotics, Asimov has already said pretty much everything encountered in this story, better. While Dr. Gold has allowed the reader/gamer to create his own character, or explore themselves (however briefly), a writer as good as Asimov (or numerous others) creates a world so real you believe yourself a part of it. As far as feelings of reality, I prefer the latter.
I began it a second time, but only a few pages, so I'm not sure if I ""achieved"" further. I'd presume I received around 1/10th of the achievements. This presumably means one of two things: 1) either the story branched so often that, even with substantial overlap in story, there were perhaps in excess of 20 endings (seemingly too many to consider equally), or 2) the story was far more fleshed out for a prefered reader/gamer type, and I was not among them. (I don't understand the purpose behind having achievements in this game, except as a selling tool. Why create a ""loser"" scenario (OR winner) in a game marketed as being an individualistic world? ""Personal choice""=""wrong choice""?)
This felt less to me a story OR game, and more like a personality test, perhaps as component of a thesis. I admit, by far the majority of the time I spent was in contemplation of what the character I created might actually do if he were real. While the other characters I was given were extremely superficial, I still felt a strong obligation to create as real, AND as good, a world as possible for them to participate in. But despite MY agonizing over choices, I felt the writer rapidly lost interest in my character as I made less ""literary"" choices. He simply ended the story with no resolution of any kind, leaving the lead character to complete his participation several short paragraphs after life-extending, life-affirming choices. While I anticipated fighting for life using robotics as tool/metaphor, the majority of the story remaining as life choices are considered/corrected, instead I was reading the last paragraph on the final page. The overwhelming feeling was one of abandonment, much like Mary Shelley wrote of Dr. Frankenstein feeling for his creation. Except that the abandonment was of OUR jointly created world.
Quite possibly this game/story simply wasn't written for me. Perhaps if I were educated or intelligent, or imagined greatness, there might have been some AMAZING stories in this game. Instead I'm just a regular guy with personal dreams of home, hearth and health (albeit, while dealing with greatness would be for me, a GREAT story to create, or better still, to participate in.) I've read those other people's accounts lived out THOUSANDS of times in other stories. This time I wanted it to be my story. Perhaps there are choices that would have made it longer or more interesting, but then it would not have been MY story. And after all, wasn't that the whole point?

As this is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure), your experience may vary, but, I say with little hesitation that [i]my own[/i] experience with the story is the most meaningful experience I've had with a game - ever.

Although wonderful in their own right, choice oriented games like The Walking Dead and Mass Effect don't even come close to what this game accomplishes.

[h1]What Choice Do I Have?[/h1]

CoR gives you choices.

CoR gives you lots of choices that make the story feel like your own, fostering immersion in a way that traditional literature cannot.

CoR gives you lots of difficult choices that may have you thinking hard and agonizing about the potential consequences. The game has no manual save function. If you make choices that lead to a premature ending, you can't undo and must start over. (such branches seem rare, though, and replaying doesn't take much time once you're familiar with the text)

CoR gives you lots of difficult choices that have a real impact. Something that is uniquely possible when the creator is unconstrained by the need to create full art assets for every possibility.

[h1]Deep Dive[/h1]

This ""game"" has no graphics at all except for the cover image, which is exactly akin to a book cover illustration. Is it a game or a book? I say it is most certainly a game. Graphics is not a requirement of a game. Interactivity is. A series of choices that impact the experience do a game comprise.

CoR's language is competent, but not ""literary"". It reads like a matter-of-fact narrative of events that might actually happen in your life if the stars align in just the right way. Initially, I got an ""amateur"" vibe from the writing, but later realized that the experience may actually benefit from the simple, contemporary writing style. As the story progressed and sucked me in deeper, I became much too busy thinking about what was going on to criticize the writing style.

CoR is (mostly) accessible. Although the fact that it was written by somebody with a Ph.D. in Computer Science does show. Having a CS degree myself, I certainly appreciated that perspective. Although lots of artistic license is taken for the sake of plot, there is lots of grounding in contemporary technology.

The story makes mostly ""reasonable"" extrapolations starting from the near future forward several decades. Like all good science (or 'speculative', if you prefer) fiction, the story poignantly references the present while writing about the future, framing the timeless human condition in extrapolated contexts.

To elaborate about why I put ""reasonable"" in quotation marks above, the story explores the future in ways that could, for the most part, conceivably happen, and many futurists would even claim that CoR's extrapolation towards the Singularity doesn't go far enough. However, the author is not afraid to explore fantastic scenarios that probably won't happen, at least not soon, and in some cases, hopefully never.

The scope of the story is indeed quite epic, following the main decades of a lifetime of the character you control. I do have to object to the game description's categorization of this as a ""novel"", though, as it is not nearly long enough to count as one. At best, it is the length of a (very) short story (a single playthrough takes a matter of hours). On the other hand, the sheer amount of content of all possible branches easily exceed the length of a long novel (50% longer than Moby Dick). It's quite an accomplishment.

And, if you are worried about this being a boring, technical slog, don't be. Despite the apparently sterile subject matter of robots, there is plenty of emotion in this game - or, at least, there can be, depending on your choices.

[h1]Turn to Page 23[/h1]

I've only explored one of the many, distinct branches of CoR. I will probably be going back to explore the others.

I heartily recommend CoR to anyone who can read English, especially those with an interest in technology and/or science fiction.

Note that there is also a free demo where you can play through the first 2 chapters (out of 7), either via Steam, or on the developer's web site.

[h1]UPDATES[/h1]

Having now explored a few other branches and having made more ""optimal"" choices, I feel that choosing less optimally for the first playthrough does make for a better experience.

My first playthrough involved an above average number of failures and tragedies, which amounted to a much more poignant experience than when everything basically goes well.

I do suggest playing the game ""organically"". Perhaps it is unlikely to play optimally the first time around anyway. Certainly I would discourage any attempts to ""cheat"" by looking up optimal choices beforehand. That would truly ruin the experience. You can always go back later and ""fix mistakes"" on subsequent playthroughs.",1419622151,1423966732,True,334,4,0.925052285194396973,14,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm a huge Transformers fan, so a game entirely revolving around the idea of playing a character that creates robots and the impact/influence that has on the world immediately grabbed my attention.  I tried the demo, and was hooked.

I'd never heard of the developer, ""Choice of Games"" before now, but their other works are of a similar vein.  All of them are basically text-based CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) games, much like the old CYOA books of our childhood.  You play a character is can be like, or unlike yourself, and progress through a series of choices that can have a variety of branches, leading the story's eventual conclusion.

""Choice of Robots"" follows the life of a young college student, trying to build their own robot.  It starts with a cryptic dream sequence (an excellent plot hook I might add), before going into 'character creation', which consists of selecting a name (either a custom one, or chosen from a list), and your gender.  (I should note, you can only select 'boy' or 'girl', so NB people don't get an option, sorry!)  From there, you make choices which influence a variety of stats (which can be easily checked), including your Fame, Wealth, status of your relationship with the NPCs, and other numerical values.  The status screen even gives you a summary of all the completed chapters so far, sort of an abridged version of your story.

The writing is well done.  It's vague enough that you can easily imagine events or people in your head as you would want them to be, while still giving them enough detail that it's not a complete blank space.  There's a template, and you can fill the gaps.  The way the game interprets your choices is quite fascinating too.  Even small, seemingly insignificant choices can influence future areas.  Not all influences turn out to be significant, but it does address and acknowledge choices you've made, so it feels like you're having a greater push on the story.

However, for all of the game's interactivity and originality, it falls (sometimes painfully) flat in a few areas.  The biggest and probably most damning thing, is the lack of a save/load function.  It autosaves your progress, so if you need to take a break, you can shut it down, go do something else, come back, and immediately jump back in.  And with the summary in status, you can easily determine where you're at.  But without a hard save function, you literally have to start completely over to experiment with new branches and decisions.  This does give a sense of finality and weight to the story, since you can't save-scum for an ""ideal"" outcome (to whatever degree a player would consider 'ideal anyway), but it makes trying out different decisions painfully tedious, as you have to start over totally anew each time.

This leads to the second issue, and one that most adventure games always fall into, and was the trap of the CYOA-genre: replayability.  While Choice of Robots has a LOT of variation, after a while you do start to notice the patterns.  You'll start to know which options lead to what future choices.  Eventually, it probably becomes second-nature what sort of paths lead to a particular ending.

Which ironically enough, leads to a sub-issue of this problem.  While some of the patterns are obvious, others are not.  Painfully not.  There's a few branches I have NO idea how to access, because the options you'd need aren't very obvious, and the achievement descriptions don't help at ALL.  And as there's no guides, it's a constant stream of trial and error.  This also hurts in-game.  It's not always obvious how good (or bad) a stat should be to elicit a particular response, or to enable particular choices, which again, can only be determined through trial and error, and a LOT of it.  So be prepared that if you're someone who really wants to earn/unlock everything, it'll take some time.

The NPCs tend to suffer as well.  As the story focuses on your avatar and his creation, the NPCs, while recieving a modicum of development, don't really tend to be more than accessories to the overall story.  There's a variety of them, and story does do justice to fleshing them out at times, but after a point they sort of fall into scripted roles and don't really contribute to the story beyond being names.  And scripting can be a problem as well.  There's a few milestones you simply cannot avoid, and a few events where you would think there should be a third option or a way to avoid having to go A or B, but none exist.

Even with these issues, Choice of Robots is an excellent game considering you can get it for under 3 dollars right now (until the sale ends after New Years anyway).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who:

- Loves robots

Losing her was not the hardest battle I'd ever though... no that was to come, I felt alone in this world and I had nothing to live for anymore... my days were spent alone and miserable and one of my old proffesors saw this I think and offered me a contract job at his place dsigning War Machines...

After a few pages into it, I fell in love with it, and consequently my little robot child. 

As other reviewers have said already said, it's hard not to give away any story spoilers while discussing PROs and CONs, but I'll give it a shot.

The game does a great job of giving you several ways to navigate throughout the story, while making each story ""branch"" or ""path"" just as detailed as the others you passed over. While some of these CYOA games feel like choosing one option over the other is only to gain/change some stat, with little variance in the rest of the story, [i] Choice of Robots [/i] does not do this. It's also incredibly written, with just enough detail to help you envision the story, while giving your brain the freedom to ""fill in the holes"" to your desire on how something/someone looks. For example, you design a robot specifically pick out certain components/aspects of it that give you a general basis of how it looks. However, someone else may have picked the same exact makeup of their robot but imagine it differntly in their head because the writing leaves things purposefuly open for you to imagine.


In short, if you really enjoy scifi writing and the idea of advanced robots in the near future, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if you don't, like me, you'll probably still end up enjoying it and admire it for the plot and detailed writing.

I've played most of them, including the Hosted Games. They're fun to play around with and some have pretty good writing. However, most of them don't live up to the concept of being a choose-your-own-adventure. Instead, they are more like customizable linear narratives. There are things that are always going to happen, you can't avoid them, all you're changing is your reaction or the broad methods you use to complete the scenarios.

Choice of Robots is easily the best CoG release. That core that exists in all CoG works is present in Robots. There are plot points you always hit, but they are more like the screws to the narrative, not the meat of it. Your choices mean a lot in Robots. The story and specifics change based on your choices. YOU, the PC, feel like much more of a character than in other CoG stuff. You feel more drawn in. The customization, the impact of choices, gives the game an insane amount replayability. Where other CoG games have you skimming through the text on replays to find the one paragraph that has changed since the last time, with this one the changes are in your face. You will experience radically different stories each time.

Secondary characters are always pretty weak in CoG games. They're not spectacular here, but they are better than usual. The romantic interests in CoG works are quite often non-characters. They tend to be little more than some text in your stat window. Here they have a little more character, picking one person over another will lead to minor events playing out differently. It's a good step that is small, but noticeable.

There's one problem with Choice of Robots (unless you consider the game being text only a problem and if that's the case you don't need to read this review to know if the game is for you) and that the lack of a save of any kind. This is standard for CoG and in the past it hasn't been too much of a problem. Here, I find it bothersome. Possibly, because in Choice of Robots it feels more like a ""Game Over"" than a ""The End.""  If the possibility of death was more prominent in the game, if it made things more tense, if it were anything more than just a narrative possibility it would be much less annoying. If you're OCD, you have to go back and try to recreate your game exactly to get back to that point.

I love robots and transhuman themes. Worse, I cannot resist a good story. I was definitely going into this primed to enjoy it, and enjoy it I did.

There are some benefits to things most of us gamer types would call ""failure"" which take the story in interesting directions.

If you're not however, it's as good a starting point as any, especially when there's a free demo that adequately presents what the game entails.

Robots is about crafting, growing and teaching your own personal robot, and for someone familiar with the Choice of Games series, that's all you really need to know. Besides the wildly varied tone and settings, the majority of these games function nearly identically.  For those who are new, it's a text adventure, and what that boils down to is simply: You read a whole lot and make choices. There's no graphic, no music and no action (besides the ones being described with words). And if that puts you off, that's fair, still, the demo's free if you want to confirm your position.

As with most other games of the series, the choices you make influence your stats and how the story progress and, again, as with the other installments, the game encourages at least a certain degree of specializations. What is new, however, is that the protagonist have only one stat to keep track of, humanity, which tracks how kind, humane, social and emotional your decisions are. Your robot, on the other hand, has four stats: Autonomy, Military, Empathy and Grace, and the decisions you make throughout the game influence what kind of robot you will have, and, in turn, how you will influence the world. Would you end up with a mindless militaristic machine at your whim, a self-conscious and independent robotic sentient being or a curious, constantly learning robot with near (or perhaps completely) human emotions? Chances are, though, you're going to end up with a combination of all the things in between. 

While, like the other Choice of Games, Robots do strongly encourage specialization in at least one or two stats, the games do not seem to punish you as harshly for deviation from your initial plans. The other Choice of Games' strategic elements usually boil down to specializing in a number of areas and then make only decisions that test your strong points and avoid your weaknesses. Robots is similar, except you have more leeway and, in fact, planning becoming a lot more difficult as decisions often have unforeseen consequences. For example, there's a point in the game where you are able to make a decision on what kind of information you want your robot to extract on the internet, and allowing it to pick up whatever it wants result in it learning things like ""Big Brother is watching"" and ""the US is the bad guy"", resulting in a substantial raise in intelligence (Autonomy) and a distrust of authority (Military). There's also a point in the game where your robot is interviewed, and if your Autonomy is high enough, the review will claim your robot is smarter than humans, giving it a boost in confidence (Autonomy) while making it more arrogant (decrease in Empathy). While the unpredictability of the gameplay structure here may hamper cold strategic decision making, it also makes the story more spontaneous and exciting, as your choices can have truly unforeseeable consequences later in the game, making the narrative incredibly dynamic. That said, depending on what you choose to focus on, the game can also end up rather difficult, requiring multiple restarts, which is even more frustrating considering the fact that the game has no manual save whatsoever, forcing a restart every time you want to change something. I believe this is to make you committed to your choices and make each playthrough special and dynamic, but I still feel that the game would benefit more from having a save system of some description, especially when you've already completed the game and don't feel like skimming through most of the story to change one decision. Robots, in particular, seems to offer more consequences and variations to your decisions than any other game in the series I've experienced (skim through the achievement list if you want to know how much you could achieve, and know that I only got 10 in one playthrough, and I thought I did pretty well). That said, personally, I don't plan on replaying the game anytime soon. This is in no way a fault of the game, but rather a strength, as I feel so attached to my first playthrough that any second attempt would feel as if I've cheated that unique experience.

But gameplay aside, this is still a text adventure, and as a game that's going to make you spend the majority of your time reading, it lives and dies on the writing. Robots, like most of its predecessor, does not disappoint in this regard. There's moment of humor, melancholy, romance (with the usual inclusiveness of the series) and, perhaps most of all, introspection. The parental relationship between you and your robot becomes clear very early on, and the game handles it extremely well. Your robot grows, imitates and reacts to your actions as you would expect, with great curiosity and bewilderment. As I watch it develops, I feel proud when it understands or questions, scared when it picks up undesirable tendencies, happy when it expresses indignant at cruelty and warm when it seems more human than any living character by the end, while still having more to learn and expressing fear of the inevitable as a child would. At least that's how it was for my Sapling (that's how I named mine, and Sapling was a she and refers to me by my real name rather than titles because that's the level of customization you have), your robot could go in so many unforeseen direction it's difficult to ""plan"" its development, and considering the theme, I think that's the point. The human characters, while getting less attention, are well-written and varied enough in their own right, but some, even if you choose to begin a relationship with them, will feel somewhat detached from the main storyline until the latter chapters. The game, despite its initial lightheartedness and humor, asks difficult question, present morally ambiguous choices and depicts interesting, introspective themes. The final two or three chapters are the most powerful part in the game for me because it shows the growth of your robot and how you've molded the world, for better or worse, as well as calling your ideals into question. I can only speak for myself, but my ending reflected my choices appropriately, filling me with wonder, doubt, melancholy and hope. While the game has its stronger points and weaker, more filler-y portions, the finale was undoubtedly my favorite experience of any Choice of Game story.

If you enjoy the Choice of Games text adventures, then I'll just repeat myself: Buy the damn game, it's, at least in my opinion, the best in the series yet. If you have no interest in the structure and ideas behind text adventures, then I suppose there isn't much here to convince you otherwise besides good writing. If you're new and willing to try out one of these games though, I can't think of a better place to start. Choice of Robots is inspiring, funny, well-written and introspective, and for a game about robots, it has more philosophies and humanity behind it than most games out there combined.
