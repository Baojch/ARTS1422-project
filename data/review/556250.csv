I have played the game since it was on Gamejolt and in that time it was already really good, and the updates just keep making the game better.
The game has plenty of game modes, from a simple survival arena, a RTS-like mode, and multiplayer, by playing you earn money to spend on buying new parts and upgrading existing ones, and you can also level up, wich allows you to choose from 3 upgrades each time, the upgrades are made to make certain playstyle better and sometimes making others less viable for eg: you can choose between a faster Core charge rate (your speciall weapon wich fires a powerful laser beam) or perhaps make it charge slower but make it more powerful?.
Aditionally there are plenty of different parts and some of them change the way they work when fully upgraded.
Also the game works in a ""design"" system wich means that all bought parts go to a stash, and you can always make a different design using all parts in stash regardless if those are being used in another design.
In conclusion the game is perfect, with the only exception of the simple graphics, but if you really enjoy games that is the least of your concerns",1500406918,1512099478,False,1,0,0.53125,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Like Reassembly or Istrolid? You'll like Final Core.

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Ship building is quick thanks to the various snapping options and shortcuts. All you need to know about your ship is displayed on screen.
[*]Deep design strategy, there is always a way to defeat a certain design no matter how strong.
[*]Tons of replayability, you can select one of three playstyles, and there are many choices for special abilities as you level up. There's so many different Sector gimmicks to keep you on your toes.
[*]Awesome soundtrack I just want to listen to on loop over and over, sound effects are also unique enough to tell apart every weapon.
[*]Big ""fuck you"" laser weapon.
[*]Able to quickly switch from cruising to strafing, in*action settings can change how your ship behaves.
[*]HUD displays part integrity, which is useful to avoid part destruction.
[*]Most weapons can fire in 360 degrees, and all parts can be rotated to whatever direction you want.
[*]Aimbot can be enabled so you can focus on piloting your ship, I find this especially helpful against enemies that fill the screen with bullets.
[/list]

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Final Core is very repetitive, but that's just the nature of every game isn't it? (Rhetorical, don't answer.)
[*]There is a grind to be able to build the biggest baddest ships, it will take a while before you can fight the toughest champions.
[*]Some Sectors are completely unfair.
[*]You can only use one color, and choosing the same color as an enemy team becomes confusing sometimes.
