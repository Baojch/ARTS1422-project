It's not a serious fishing game.  It's also not a terribly good game and I'm pretty sure it's abandoned at this point too.  

The graphics are nice enough.  Nothing special, but it won't distract too much from the experience... until you start reeling in the weird fish.  I mean, it IS ""Crazy"" fishing right?  Expect boomerang fish speaking in terrible Australian accents, banjo-fish, and a bunch of other weird stuff that I can't remember. 

Once you start to play this game it becomes clear just how old this game is.  The only movement scheme is teleporting and that might not even work for you if you're using the ""wrong"" VR Runtime.  If you're on OpenXR it probably won't work right... or it might but only for certain headsets.  If you're unable to force it to use the usual SteamVR runtime (OpenVR) then it probably won't work right for you since this game was created in the before-times when OpenVR and Oculus were the only real choices.

So you move to the outside of the cabin and go down by the lake and you can find random junk to put on your hook.  Might as well try anything and everything in case it works.  You just never know.  In fact I'm sure that certain fish are only going to go after certain types of bait, but then not every fish is in every part of the lake, so you'll just have to experiment.  Is there a wiki with the answers?  Who knows?  

Casting the rod feels just OK.  Sometimes it feels like you can do a decent cast like you'd expect and other times you wind up just launching your bait directly at the ground in front of you at 100mph and you wonder what happened.   I find it's generally easier to do a sideways cast motion instead of over head.  Reeling it back in doesn't really feel right in my opinion, but it probably differs depending on your controller.  I'm using the Index controllers and it works just ""ok"".  

Audio is ok... some of the voices you hear are pretty goofy sounding (but hey, it's CRAAAAAZY fishing, right?).  The music is utterly forgettable, and sound effects are just pretty basic for a fishing game.  I feel like this is one area they could have put some extra effort into it, but they didn't and we got what we got.  Nobody is coming to fix this so I hope you like it (because if you don't you're stuck with it anyway).

This is probably suited for kids to play with more than anyone over the age of 15.  I bought it back when there weren't any other fishing games in VR and was disappointed with it, but then later we got  ""Catch & Release"" and a few other VR fishing games, including some that aimed more for realism.  If you aren't a little kid you might want to check out ANY other fishing game instead of this one... except the ""fancy"" games.  Fancy Fishing is crap.  

It's not that this game is really tough or anything.  It's pretty casual and so again, a little kid would be right at home with this game.  I think for an adult, the game is just plain tedious.   The ""humor"" just comes from silly bait, silly fish, and silly locations to fish from.    From an 10 year old's perspective this might be worth a chuckle.

Since this game is so old, your PC is probably more than enough to run it.  There's not a lot going on at any point in time so it's not going to stress your system out unless you got a computer that was marginal for VR in 2015...and even then it'll probably still run.  Just look at the system requirements...even what the developer lists is probably overkill for this game.

I didn't put a lot of work into this game and I doubt I ever will.  It feels too tedious to try to even catch all the fish.  I bet if you did try to catch everything you'd spend a decently long time, but if you're not a fan of the fishing what would make you keep going?  

Worst of all, the price right now is just insane.  $20 for this?  A game this old and hasn't had an update in probably 4 or 5 years?  Looking at SteamDB says the last build of this game was December 2017, so yeah... 5 1/2 years.  There should be a way to filter games that don't get updates anymore from the steam store.   

I haven't had any serious bugs with it except when I tried to play it on my HP Reverb G2.  I think maybe I could have gotten it working if I fiddled around with the runtime since microsoft's openXR doesn't work 100% the same as Steam's OpenXR.  I'm sure if I played this game for 100s of hours I could find some bugs, but I've struggled just to get 3 hours clocked in.  

If I had to give this a numerical rating it'd be a 5/10.  Not horrible, but there's so much better things out there so unless you're getting this for $2 or less, why bother?  Go play Catch & Release instead.

Ich muss gestehen, dass ich mir bei Crazy Fishing nicht ganz schlüssig bin, wie ich es bewerten soll, es gibt viel positives, aber leider hat es auch ein paar Macken.
Fangen wir mit den positiven Sachen an. Das Spiel macht optisch einen guten Eindruck. Der Comic-Stil passt zum Humor des Spiels, Realismus dürfen wir hier nicht erwarten. Wir starten an einem Steg an einem kleinen See und können uns per Teleportation fortbewegen, um noch andere Angelplätze zu entdecken. Zu denen können wir uns direkt beamen, wenn wir sie einmal freigeschaltet haben. Natürlich gibt es an den unterschiedlichen Angelplätzen auch jede Menge zu fangen.
Es gibt Boomerangfische, Basketballfische uvm an ""kranken"" Figuren, die wir mit der Angel aus dem See ziehen können. Gefangene Fische können wir entweder verkaufen um uns bessere Ausrüstung zuzulegen oder schreddern, um Köder zu bekommen. Gefangene Fische können wir in einem Aquarium in unserem Haus begutachten, das hat mir gut gefallen. Hat ein Fisch gebissen, vibriert der Controller und der Kampf beginnt. Auch neben der Angelei gibt es jede Menge zu entdecken. Es gibt versteckte ""easter eggs"", Schatztruhen mit speziellen Ködern und viele andere Kleinigkeiten.

Bis dahin machte das Spiel einen vielversprechenden Eindruck, doch es gibt auch ein paar negative Aspekte. 
Der Kampf mit den Fischen fühlt sich nicht wirklich gut an, der Controller vibriert zwar, aber immer in der gleichen Stärke. Auch das Befestigen der Köder funktioniert eher mäßig, der Haken bleibt an allen möglichen Sachen hängen, Köder fallen ins Wasser und sind futsch und andere kleine Ärgernisse...
Auch im Sitzen kann ich das Spiel nicht wirklich empfehlen. Unsere Köder bewahren wir in einer Bauchtasche auf, die wir im sitzen kaum bedienen können. Insgesammt fühlt sich die Steuerung nicht 100% stimmig an, ich kann nichtmal genau festmachen, woran das liegt.
Aber trotzdem macht das Spiel im Gesammteindruck vieles richtig, wer just for fun mal ein wenig am See quatsch machen will, mit einigen kleinen Unstimmigkeiten leben kann und keinen Realismus erwartet, sollte mal einen Blick riskieren. Der Umfang ist durchaus in Ordnung, es gibt viel zu entdecken und es sieht auch noch ganz gut aus.
Wer eine Angelsimulation sucht, ist hier allerdings an der falschen Adresse. 
Ich habe das Spiel im Sale gekauft, bin mir auch nicht sicher, ob ich den Vollpreis bezahlen würde.

 more of a novelty and a short experience for an outrageous price. Most people have about 3 hours or less playtime, and I assure you, those who have more probably used this game to demo VR to other friends/family. 

The majority of the game is catching fish, using that fish to get food/bait to catch other different fish. It gets old fast. I mean, I dont know what I expected, its a fishing game.

If it was $9.99, I'd say it be worth it for some, but unless you're well off and dont mind wasting 20 bucks, Spend your money on a better VR game.

Do I wish there was more to the game?  Sure.  I think you could cut up the fish, maybe cook them.  I do wish there was a slower, less arcady version of the fishing (basically being more patient and having to reel it in properly).  Would also be nice if there was a co-op version where you can talk with your buddies while you fish together.

After talking to my girlfriend about fishing games we played when we were younger, she convinced me to pull the plug on Crazy Fishing (had been on my wishlist for some time now) so she could try it herself and we both wanted one that required the player to physically reel in fish. I have to say that I love the game so far. It's simple, but at the same feels necessary for a fishing game in VR. I do wish that there was slight feedback when I am just reeling an empty line in, but I understand that since it's utilized to determine wheter or not a fish is nibbling or biting that it's probably best not to. Still, I can wish. This is a solid title that deserves a lot more love so it can continue to get the updates to expand it. At the moment I have no regrets about my $11.99 purchase and believe it's more than worth it. I still can't figure out entirely what did it for me, maybe it's the boomerang fish saying, ""Aw, C'mon mate"" when I grind him up or just the thought gone into the crazy fish themselves, but expect to see my time with this game easily reach the double digits just for the relaxing factor. Still managed to break a sweat reeling them in though. If you're having trouble finding the tablet to buy upgrades just redo the tutorial (few seconds) and it will pop back up. Don't forget to look at the watch while holding different types of bait to see what fish it attracts. Really cool that the fish can range in size. First fish was a tiny radar screen fish and later on caught a pretty big one that took me by surprise. Definitely adds replayability.

You wont get a bite everytime you cast, but 90% of the time I'd say.

There are 8 different preset locations you can fish from with a range of environments, but you can also teleport around the lake to find your own spot to fish from. You can also take a raft out onto the lake and and fish from there.

　　游戏画面还算清晰，建模也比较细致，整体的卡通风格让游戏看起来比较有趣味性。游戏模拟真实的钓鱼准则，玩家需要自己挂饵、抛线，然后静静等待鱼儿咬勾，就连收线也是要时放时收才能将鱼钓上来，一有操作不当小鱼可能就跑了。
　　虽然操作真实，但这钓上来的鱼儿们却不普通，游戏中的鱼全都有技能傍身，什么火箭鱼、炸弹鱼、篮球鱼等等，没一个是正经的鱼，还有不少有趣的鱼种等你去发现。
　　目前《疯狂钓鱼》在steam上的售价为68元。游戏适合休闲娱乐，安静的享受游戏的乐趣，推荐喜欢这类比较安静游戏的玩家们购买。不过目前游戏价格偏高，若能够降低个40%左右的而价格会更适合购买。

the game really feels like fishing  and the relaxing setting fits PERFECTLY for those looking to fish.
the fish themselves are little characters with a little bit of decritption given, hinting that they may serve other purposes besides catching which i really like.

I also desperately crave haptic pulses before a fish bites, to raise the tension and make it much more like the real thing.

Even though it is in its early stages, it is incredibly immersive. The minute I got into this game I felt relaxed - it's a lovely scene being on this lake.


Then the fun begins. Every catch is comical and gave me a good chuckle. My first play session was a little over an hour, and I did a short video showing my first impression of the game.

If you are tired of playing fast-paced games in VR and just want to sit back, relax, and have a good laugh - Crazy Fishing delivers.


[b]Graphics[/b]

The cartoon style of the game works well. The colors are vibrant and remind you of a sunny spring day down at the lake. Subtle features in certain areas (not going to spoil them) really give a nice ambience. Certain things could be improved, such as the waterfall, but overall the game is beautiful to experience.

[b]Controls[/b]

There is little to no learning curve as far as the controls go. You can really figure out the mechanics of the game right off the bat. I never even saw a video of this game prior to playing and I figured it out without even trying - that, to me, is a sign of a well-made game.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

It's a mixture of relaxing atmosphere and comedy. You're going to feel tranquil, but you're also going to laugh. It's exciting to catch a new fish, open a treasure chest, or discover a new secret. The progression of the game is simple: catch fish, exchange them for new bait types or for money. Money buys you the ability to go to new locations around the lake while new bait types allow you to catch different fish. It kept me engaged for my first play session and definitely intrigued me to come back and keep playing.

[b]Drawbacks[/b]

I did encounter a few bugs (some are shown in my video) but they didn't ruin the experience - if anything they added to it. Some bugs are simple, such as the lighting with the flashlight. Some are larger, such as your line being cast underground. Either way, due to the comical nature of the game the bugs had me laughing, and after all it's still early access - bugs are to be expected.

[b]Overall[/b]

I give this game a solid 9/10 for an early access release being that it is completely playable, very enjoyable, polished, and most of all: FUN. I can only hope that the developers build on the game, improve current features, and add new ones along the way. This game is shaping up to be a real winner, if it isn't already. I really can't wait to see what comes next. If you want to judge the game yourself before buying, just watch the above video. To me, it's definitely worth the money.",1491494476,1491494476,True,15,0,0.612331807613372803,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Here is my first look and VR gameplay in Mixed Reality view on HTC Vive:

Review in text:
Wow, where to begin... Im a fishing lover, a true fishing maniac in real life, so a fun VR fishing game was very welcome for me! First of all, this is not a fishing simulator, and don´t expect it to be. This is a funny arcade fishing game for everyone, with great feeling using the Vive controllers, loads of cool content and a full immersion in VR. Its easy to start off with and once you go fishing - you dont want to leave the lake :) My VR and Mixed Reality video probably says it all, but lets to a short text-review of all the game-elements: 

Graphics.
The graphics are one of the most cool looking Ive seen in VR and definately best beinga VR fishing game. Its colorful, sharp, and polished with great envorironment, well detailed surroundings and the fishes looks great with polished textures. The graphic cartoonish-style really reminds me of a Zelda game or something similar, and that really adds to the funny gameplay and the game itself. Just brilliant! The water looks great and you can also see a lot of fishes under the surface on shallow waters - it really helps finding spots!

Sounds.
Sound effects are nice, and the background music really adds to the immersion and is very relaxing. Really nothing to complain on here.

Controller system
The room scale support and Vive controller tracking is flawless here - Even thou this is a arcade game, it really feels you are casting with that rod. It really feels realistic to play the fish as well! Great sense of feeling catching and playing those fishes with the ""line tension meter"" above the rod, that makes it quite challenging to master, especially in the beginning. You reel manually with your second hand holding your rod in the first hand (you can of course switch hands and reel side). If you release too much slack line the fish gets away, if you get too much tension the line snaps - just like in real life fishing! You load your hook with baits manually, and practically do everything manually - thats superb in VR as your really want to do everything by ourself!

Gameplay
This game gives you tons of hours of gameplay as you catch fishes, earn money by selling them or ""create"" new baits from the fishes you catch. You unlock new locations (5 available in first version but much more is coming in new updates they say) like a boat, cave location and much more. yopu unlock new baits, new fishes, new treasures, challenges and much much more. Also, besides the actual fishing there is so much more ""bonus"" gameplay and content that really nails it. Treasure hunting for example - what a brilliant idea! And there is so much to explore so the game really never gets boring. Its a fun and crazy fishing game, not too serious but also not too foolish. Its one of those ""thinking outside of the box"" titles in VR that really stand out from others! Great job, developers!

Performance
I experienced NO frameloss at all playing this on my GTX 980 Ti. I bet this game could be played on most VR-ready computers! If you capture your gameplay at the same time (as I did), of course it could get more PC demanding, and the asynchronus reprojection in Steam VR may kick in to help the framerate, but still no problems as long as you use a GTX 970 or better I guess. 

Upcoming updates
The developers are planning to update Crazy Fishing with new content, new locations, new fishes, new challenges and much more, so we will probably get loads of more funny gameplay further on, as well!

Price and worth
Well, what can I say. Its worth every penny! Great gameplay and truly entertaining, loads of content, loads of gameplay hours and much more to come in future updates for that price is a no-brainer. Just get it and you will never regret!

All in all, I can recommend Crazy Fishing to every VR gamer, in all ages. You and your kids will love this, and probably your grand father as well :) Its easy to get started, and just so funny that you can´t stop playing! A perfect introduction into VR as well, if you are a new VR-gamer or just want to show off. Just get it and enjoy the most good looking, most entertaining and crazy fishing out there!

I may update this review later on when new content is added in updates and when I have spent more hours in Crazy Fishing (so far been playing around 5 hours, but Steam is showing wrong, as I mostly start the game outside of Steam due to better Mixed Reality-support this way).

Cheers
