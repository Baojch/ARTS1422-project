My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707242115,1707242115,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There are 4 levels of difficulty to choose from, Ataraxia (Very Easy, most extra health), Utopia (Easy, extra health), Dream (Normal, no changes to health), and Nightmare (Hard, less health).  I chose to play on ""Dream (Normal)"" mode.  You can have up to 15 different save files, which is nice if you want to keep save files from different difficulties.  I appreciate the humor and banter among the characters.  I did not encounter any bugs in my playthrough.  

You use headphones to travel to various characters' dreams, explore them, and revisit them at times (pretty cool concept).  Some dreams are happy, some are grim.  The game is non-linear, which leads to lots of exploration.  Along the way you fight ""glitches,"" that look like little flames (some will move around, some are stationary).  The glitches will either be orange (normal), red (harder), or purple (hardest).  After you defeat a glitch, it's gone for good.  If a glitch is too problematic, there is a limited amount of items that will let you skip a stationary glitch.  

There are limited amounts of battles (experience), healing items, and gold, so there is some resource management.  There are healing items, magic replenishing items, and stat boosting items to pick up from the ground.  These get consumed and used immediately when you walk over them.  (You can always just leave them there and grab them when you actually need them if you don't need them at the time - you may want to do this in case someone in your party is knocked out; some of the healing items will revive them.)  There are also a limited amount of permanent stat-boosting items you can purchase from various vendors.  As a note you can use the healer in Lostham, but if you do that you will not get the best rewards upon completing the game.

You'll get 3 additional party members along the way, for a total of 4.  One minor gripe with getting a new party member is that they always start at level 1 instead of joining your party at the level you're already at.  At least you do get all of your party members relatively early on, so catching up isn't that bad.  Each party member has their own unique/most helpful thing, see spoiler.  [spoiler]Erin (girl) is good at tanking hits, but also has a heal and does decent damage.  Athena (cat) is a good magic user.  Peeboo (mouse) is good at crowd control with ""Carrot Transformation"" and also good at physical damage.  Clochette (flower) is good at support, healing your team, boosting stats, and protecting from venom.  She also gets some pretty awesome set-damage weapons later in the game.)[/spoiler]",1690718630,1690801297,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

《Dreamscape》是一款由Aldorlea Games制作，Degica发行的角色扮演类冒险游戏。在一次失控的实验后，Erin被困在了梦境之中，为了找到出路，她只能依靠神奇的耳机（可以访问其他人的梦境与幻想中），游戏也就从此拉开了帷幕，接下来将会发生怎样的奇遇呢？

[h1] 游戏的体验 [/h1]
游戏的感受还是挺不错的，由于被困在梦境想要找寻出路，就需要去拜访其他人的梦境，找到所需要的物件，这就会有一种梦中有梦的感觉，很是魔幻，而且玩着玩着你会感受到其中所具有的关联性。剧情还是比较有意思的，有时会出现一些小转折，当然人物之间的对话也是很有趣的。游戏的战斗依旧采用回合制的方式向大家展现，但是难度不大，可以很容易的搞定，若实在困难难度下，则需要一定的斟酌，建议在完全状态下迎战比较好，可以好好的利用一下治疗水晶，除此之外，还会伴随一定的解谜，解谜还是比较重要的。

[h1] 游戏总结 [/h1]
游戏的质量还是很不错的，并且有着不错的可玩性，主要推荐给喜欢角色扮演类的玩家。

A few hours in, I can now buy healing items at shops for paltry sums of money - is this supposed to negate the healing problem, or is there something else the game hasn't told me about?

Being able to explore the dreams of every character in the game seems like a promising idea, but the characters are flat and unmemorable. Moreover, it quickly becomes clear that this gives the game little to no sense of direction, and I found myself frequently searching in vain for the hook I needed to continue progressing forward.

The story line isnt too major, but it is decent enough to enjoy. You are lost in dreams which you need to escape whilst trying to save your boyfriend, yeah this time your the damsel doing the rescuing. The progression isnt always simple, to proceed from one area to another you often have to go to a different area to and complete soething there to gain access in your previous area, so the game does offer some clever and enjoyable mechanics. The game is fairly simple regarding the fights, most fights don't re-spawn so once they are defeated you don't have too worry about fighting them again, some fights can be voided whilst some has to be fought to proceed.

The game can take up to 15 hours to complete and it offers 4 different difficulty modes to play at, so you have extra options there.

Its got about 15 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with four difficulty modes. I think the intent is that you play it once on each, but I don't see how someone could stand that. 

Its a pretty neat take on a JRPG though. Encounters don't respawn, Most are mobile and can be avoided and the rest are static and must be fought to physically progress. The characters are cute and the game play is basically like a mix of a point and click adventure/puzzle game and a JRPG. Its neat and the story is decently engaging. 

There's an endurance element to it also. Vendors are rare and all but two sell only stat ups. Their inventory is fixed so once you buy them out they're done. Recovery is mainly through picking up items that are autoconsumed when picked up, and recover a small amount of HP or MP. Same for curatives. There are dmg/poison proc ones, sometimes the game tricks you wtih them or makes them required to walk through, or just requires you to always weave through a maze of them. Which is blah. 

Its not without some serious flaws though. Like most point and click games it can be frustrating to know where to go, since the path through is so backtrackey (get a thing that lets you break rocks, redo everywhere breaking the rocks to go new places, etc). Keys or key-like items (there are quite a few) have to be equipped to offhand to use, and the things that let you break the 3 different kinds of rocks (for real) have to as well, and later on the jumping item. That means you spend a lot of time in your menu scrolling through a big ass list to equip the key then immediately take it off and put back on your shield/good weapon/good charm. 

As a consequnce of the lack of one shot recovery at an inn or resting it makes things like getting poisoned or statused very frustrating. Especially early on, having someone die (all the pickups rez them but at one heatlh) or getting your team poisoned blows, it can be a hard stop on your playthrough. It also means later one when your last party member gets an in combat heal thats cheap (she has 3x your mana and it costs 1/4 what your protagonists heal does), you sandbag lots of routine fights to slowly heal. 

Your protagonist ends up being the tankiest by a wide margin, and has a free taunt and a counterattack proc when hit. Lots of fights especially lategame devolve into your protagonist just murdering everything on the crackback, including all the bosses. It leads to hilarious fights with some bosses and the non-boss enemies that use their sprite (they're all just recolors) since they can too, so once one of you hits the other you sit there counterattacking until someone dies. 

There was a really bad difficulty curve on mobs. A lot of areas are a pretty std level of strength with large jumps, which usually means you get to backtrack in the harder areas to go heal up and then slog back in. This is partially alleviated by two teleport items but you don't acquire them until right at the end of the game, since you would otherwise have to slog back through a really long empty room.

The ending, to cap it off, is rather unfulfilling. 

Thats a lot of negatives and no praise really, but despite that this game was very engaging, very charming, and fun. It had some really well done levels and sets, great music, and the cutest theme imaginable. This is definitely worth playing if you think you can deal with the negatives ( or don't consider them to be, different strokes for different folks).",1506222406,1506222406,True,3,0,0.529703021049499512,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is by far one of their best games I've played!  And I've played some really good games, and really bad games.  This one is a solid 8/10.   If anything bad can be said about the game is that its a little too open, and very little direction is given.

I actually the first time through the game had to stop, because I couldn't figure out a way to make any more progress whatsoever.  I had to look at the guide multiple times in order to figure out how to beat this game.  It's not bad in the aspect of difficulty (unless doing true nightmare mode) but it is confusing on the 'where do I go now' portion.  Several key items are in areas you normally wouldn't expect, or you do things in ways that are a little too obvious.  

The biggest example is that there's a big brown mouse at the beginning of the game that there is no real indication that he's your next party member XD.  You have to talk to him to unlock the next area and get the giggle bell, which gives you a key to unlock stuff in egypt, and the list goes on.

Some humor in the dialogues, surprising characters. If you finish the game you unlock a foreign character(from another 2D RPG)  and have him in your party for a 2nd walktrough at another mode. You explore each character’s dream.

My gameplay advices:  find the easiest dream on monsters to start with or you’ll feel stuck. You have to pick a strategy to get XP cos monsters don’t respawn. Bosses are quite hard but optional. There's no or FEW restor items!!
 There’s the temptation of the fairy in the in-between dreams which can restore you but if you use her you won’t get a great reward.  If I’m correct you need an item from a dream for another. 

I recommend the unique and challenging gameplay, the time of playing is very long, 
I don’t recommend if you want a good end as the end is disappointing to me. So much work for this!",1444682405,1444682447,False,14,0,0.575994014739990234,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So far, I've unlocked 4 of the playable characters and all of them are completely different. And I do mean COMPLETELY different, which is really awesome. The story is as simple as the main character searching for her boyfriend that's gone missing, but the story is so compelling that it really is the journey that is more important than the destination. Logistically, this game has unique features that most RPGs do not have. For one, battles can be choose and most enemies do not regenerate at all. This helps you tell where you've been and where you haven't been. Also items are not put directly in your inventory; instead, you have to decide whether you should pick them up now and use them or wait till later to grab them. This adds strategy to the gameplay. 

On top of the great story and gameplay, the game is just overall whimsical and colorful and really embarks some of the visual aesthetics of games such as Earthbound.

Dreamscape has everything a fan of these games could want, and much more.

As always, these games are driven by the story, and, IMO, Aldorlea always has this element perfected. In the game you are Erin ---- who is on a mission to save her boyfriend. Sounds simple enough, but to accomplish this seemingly straightforward task she has some magical headphones that allow her to enter the dreams of virtually everyone she comes in contact with including a cat, a mouse, and a plant. Together, they explore the dreamworlds of those within their own dreams (an adventurer, an old man, a dog, a pharaoh, and many others). So much for simplicity ---- yet the story remains tightly organized, and everything makes sense. Some of the dreams are simple, some complex, and they all add up to a story that is beautifully put together with no meandering that completely draws you in and holds your interest in a completely captivating way.

With so much to see and do Dreamscape is a long one, and offers high replay value with 4 levels of difficulty that offer new challenges. The game offers an innovation that is different in that the items you need for good health and magic are not always able to be stored in your inventory, but are found everywhere in the world to be used or left behind for later ---- your decision, and an interesting spin on the ordinary. But there are plenty of items so it never becomes a problem (at least not in the easiest level, which I am playing).

Character development is excellent (even Marine from the Millennium series makes an appearance), and offers a lot of good humor ---- it's easy to like these characters as they offer their comments to one another while exploring ---- especially the cat.

Gameplay is with either the keyboard or mouse, and both work well.

The artwork is very nicely done, and includes some very different and detailed scenes as you travel throughout the various dreams. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive which adds to the enjoyment of the game.

This is a very creative and different rpg that shows great care and attention to detail by the developer that I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone of any age. And, if you have never experienced an Aldorlea game, this one is a fine place to start. But, then, I would say that about any of their games here on Steam.

You are lost in dreams and need to escape (and rescue your boyfriend in the process). But the path is far from linear - in order to progress in one dream you often need to do or get something in another one. This makes the different dreams ""linked"", and since each of them feel very distinct, the frequent ""jumping"" helps feel the game various and enjoyable. Plus, there are also dreams in dreams...

 So basically, on lower difficulties, DSC is a bit like a puzzle / adventure game. The battles (turn-based, btw) are relatively easy. Exploring the dreams and solving the puzzles is your main goal. And if you should run out of health / spells you just can teleport to the beginning and touch a healing crystal.
 If you are a dedicated player, DSC offers much more, though. For completing the game you get a reward - bonus characters, resistance to poison, ... - it depends on the mode you played in.
 But, if you complete it without touching the healing crystal, you get better reward. And there's a catch, the game only offers a limited amount of resources. Enemies don't respawn, which means your experience earned (translating into levels) is limited. You earn money by picking coins on the maps, and these are limited, too. And on top of that, the consumables cannot be stored in inventory and are consumed just as you touch them. Plus, you heal a tiny amount after each won battle.

 So, on harder difficulties the game becomes very tactical and challenging. Since the enemies are progressively harder and harder as you venture further into the dreams, you need to balance very carefully how to play. Some battles can be too ""costly"" in terms of healing required, some easier ones can be left behind and used for ""healing"" later and so on.
 The ""True Nightmare"" (playing on the Nightmare difficulty ""from the scratch"" (i.e. no bonuses) and without touching the crystal truly deserves its name. I even dare to say it was the hardest game I have ever played.

 The other aspects of DSC will be no surprise for those familiar with Aldorlea games - funny characters and dialogues, unexpected plot twists and many secrets. And the music feels really dreamy. Together with the replayability and the great variety of dreams (deserts, cities, some are funny, other ones scary or more adventurous ...), DSC is one of my favorites.",1423497091,1431508335,True,53,0,0.715644776821136475,2,False,False,False,False,,,
