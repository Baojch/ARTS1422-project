After that memory surfaced all these years later, I decided I needed to dig around and get to playing the Journeyman Project trilogy as a whole.

The gameplay style is like no game I'd ever played through before, kinda like Myst as I understand it, in that you travel through a 3D world, with a directional cursor, only stopping at certain junctions of your movement directions to spin in place, investigate your near environs, and interact with what you can, y'know, picking up items and using them on other items to solve puzzles and unlock areas and whathaveya.  I've played a good handful of point and click adventures, and that last part is highly reminiscent of that point-and-click problem solving method with aggravating solutions that sometimes feel so out of left field that you may find yourself using every item available on every other item available just to make something, anything at all, happen.  Luckily, we live in the internet age where solutions aplenty are available online with a quick search, but that doesn't mean I won't make myself suffer for at least half an hour of aimless wandering in-game before breaking down and resulting to google.  I like a *good* puzzle, but 90's ""adventure"" type games can be awful that way, in specific.

There's not much in the way of character interaction, as you are a time traveler and interacting with inhabitants of the past is strictly forbidden.  Your in-screen AI avatar doles out warnings and advice off and on, to keep you from a bevy of instant death outcomes you could otherwise walk facefirst into.  The deaths don't amount to much though, as it just forgivingly respawns you right before you made your fatal mistake.  They are usually accompanied with a well illustrated image of yourself being fed to machinery, or chucked off a cliff, or lasered to death in a number of ways.  Some can be pretty humorous, so I found them worth walking into at least once to see the result.  SO yeah, there is no combat really, as your time agent status disallows that, but there are a few environmental opportunities to harmlessly incapacitate the people who might get in your way.

The story is fun, just revolves around a secretive government agency tasked with making sure time travelers don't tamper with the past in any big way.  This, of course, happens from the get-go, and without spoiling too much, the story explores some fun thoughts on diplomacy, proliferation, bureaucracy, and sure, why not, the nature of time travel.

The graphics are what this upgraded version seems to have improved most on, having seen some pretty gnarly screenshots from the previous versions.  They're still considerably dated by today's standards, but there's just a good nostalgic feel to them.  The live action actors are pretty enjoyable, and I didn't find their performances lacking, though it can be a bit sci-fi cheese at times, but I think you should understand that sci-fi cheese is what you're in for.  I can only hope the cheese will sustain you as it did me.

This is definitely a niche game for reaching that nostalgia itch, if not for this IP particularly, but as a relic of its time.  It was worth the $10 to me, but I can fully understand it wouldn't be everyone's cuppa tea.

For those who don't know, Pegasus Prime is a remake of the original Journeyman Project from way back in 1993. Originally planned for release in 1997 it was plagued with problems. Firstly the Saturn version got cancelled, then the Pippin version was released for a platform that quickly vanished into the long list of Apple failures in the mid 90s. Then the Playstation version was cancelled when the publisher went bankrupt.  Eventually a rather cut down version was released solely for the Powermac, unlike the original game which was also available on Windows. So even though Pegasus Prime has been technically available (although long out of print) for some years, it's been a real pain to play, if you can even find a copy.

However, in 2012 ScummVM added tentative support for Pegasus Prime. Now the game could be played on modern systems, although you still needed one of the rare copies of the 1997 release and a method of extracting the datafiles (which isn't easy). But in a wonderful twist, some of the original Presto staff started working with ScummVM and between them they managed to fix some of the bugs, spliced back in content that was dummied out long ago like the interactive chases, and released a funky modern version compatible with newer systems that was available on digital download services. So now we have effectively the Director's Cut of the Director's Cut of The Journeyman Project.

So...how does it compare to the original? As a longtime fan of the original JP I'd say it is a vast improvement in almost every area. The graphics are miles better, the world is more fleshed out and interactive, there are more puzzles, many of the live action actors from Buried in Time and Legacy of Time return as the same characters to provide a nice sense of continuity, and in general it feels like a more lively, snappy game. My favourite enhancements are the vastle expanded Martian Maze, which always felt like a bit of a letdown and too easy in the original, the little bits of video calling that make you feel there is a world going on outside of what you're seeing, the challenge faced when returning to the TSA after the wave hits and you have to deal with the new staff unaware anything is wrong...and the submarine section, which now actually gives the dock a purpose other than providing atmosphere.

On the downside, eh...the new music isn't as good as Geno Andrews' original compositions, and there are a few places where you feel that they're just padding for the sake of length rather than bringing anything new to the game, but they can be excused. Also the interface is a little clunky, requiring a bizarre mix of keyboard and mouse - it's not possible to play with one or the other and the default settings aren't very intuitive. There is a lot more back-and-forth between the time periods than in the original game, but I don't really feel this is a downside...it makes it more of challenge and requires a different method of thinking rather than just ""Finish zone A then B then C"", as all three zones require something from one or both of the others...this is a trait inherited from the sequels.

Most of the problems this game has are present in the original too. Perhaps that's no excuse as they could have fixed them...things like how you have to wait for doors to close behind you before you can move off...and the way that every single interactive display feels the need to read the text out to you before you can do anything. But these are minor complaints.

I always felt sad that these games were overshadowed by the likes of Myst and 7th Guest which are the ones people remember, but I never enjoyed them. 7th Guest is nothing more than a series of ancient puzzles loosely strung together with pre-rendered video, and Myst is pretty, but very VERY dull and relies an awful lot on thinking-outside-the-box and ""solving the soup cans"". By comparison the Journeyman series has a great plot, excellent worldbuilding and a much better sense of immersion.

Overall, yes. I would say if you're fan of mid to late 90s interactive adventure games then give this one a try. There is a huge amount of worldbuilding, some really interesting puzzles, and whilst it is possible to die the game does let you carry on from an autosave some moments before, so it's never more than a minor annoyance. The Steam integration is great too, with some really interesting achievements to work for. And then check out the sequels, which for some reason aren't on Steam but you can get them from GOG.com. Buried in Time is a little more...dastardly and perhaps unfair, but Legacy of Time is the best of the lot.",1589575365,1589575448,True,33,0,0.814550697803497314,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I remember reading about PP way back then (around 1996, methinks), and being incredibly hyped about it - after all it was a remake of the game from my childhood. And then it happened - the game was only released for Macs and PSX (in Japan), so my chances of playing the title I've waited so long for, were pretty much zero. And suddenly in 2014 a PC-compatible Pegasus Prime was released on GOG, and now, in 2017, a Steam port also joined the family. I could finally experience the game I always wanted to play.

Playing Pegasus Prime today is like revisiting your old hometown after several years - things have moved on, some places were built, other demolished, yet everything feels so familiar, welcoming and nostalgic. This is the exact feeling I have while playing PP.

Simply put - it's THE adventure game, now available for our modern machines! The ""lost"" features of the Japanese PSX version have been restored. It features two difficulty modes, depending on how you want to play. Multiple save slots. The AI commentary, including our beloved Arthur (though you need to find him first!). Updated locations and new puzzles. Cheesy (but in a delightful way) and nostalgic 90's acting. And, of course, the time travel plot and the general world design. It's all here man, it's all here.

Of course it's not perfect, as some people may be irritated by the control scheme, the interface (though there is an overview tutorial, which explains a lot of things), no windowed-mode option, frequent backtracking and unforgiving character deaths (save often!). However, if you played the original, or just want to experience a damn solid late 90's first person perspective adventure game (as well as a damn solid remake), Pegasus Prime is for you.

Exploration and puzzle solving are its core strengths. While it can be argued that the constant backtracking through multiple time zones to retrieve an item you need in another, or to use a newly acquired item in a previously visited location can get tiresome (since given you're returning to the same exact point in time, all the previous progress through the location is undone), it adds to the setting and idea of jumping back and forth thru time trying to fix everything. Concepts like Gandhi bonuses (whether you deal with the antagonists violently or non-violently) and different puzzle solutions add up to the replay value, which in this particular release is also helped by the various achievements you can get, some of them pretty obscure and/or difficult to unlock.

Working against it are the limited inventory, and the game's decision to automatically discard a ""non essential item"" that can leave you without an actually important item depending on the specific route you take, wasting time and forcing you to do even more backtracking. Thankfully, due to time travel, any item can be reacquired in the same way you previously did (unless it came from another timezone...), so there's actually no way to get permanently stuck. Another potential flaw are some cheap, Sierra-style deaths that sometimes can make no sense, but since the game allows you to continue immediately from where you were the impact is lessened. Lastly there are some vehicle steering sections that feel forced and unnecesary overall. Puzzles can also get irritating (especially the last one), but the AI companion usually does a good job helping you overcome them, even if she can be a bit annoying from time to time. (There's an easter egg you can find that gives the option to silence her, or more accurately, replace her...)

The acting and overall sound design can be cheesy at times, but considering this is a game from the 90's, that's actually par for the course.

As a final point, while it involves time travel, none of the locations you visit save for a very short one are actual historical locations: they are all in various times during the setting's future (present day being 2318), so that can be a bit disappointing for anyone hoping to travel through the Middle Ages or something. The series takes care of this particular problem in the next two installments.

It's not a flawless game. I wouldn't even go as far as to say it's the best adventure game to come out of the 90's. But it IS an interesting, fun and well thought adventure, and for any sci fi fan, I believe it's a must play.",1487748365,1487748365,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A clear example of good story-telling meeting good gameplay elements, it emerged as a success in the relatively niche marketplace of PC gaming in the early-to-late 90s. 

A lot of options or hidden items and easter eggs affect your experience of the atmosphere and of the very course of the game itself. Some of the most successful games to date still follow such a philosophy.

Pretty interesting gem of 90s stereotypes and some its ideas of the future. The music is classic, totally early-90s theme music and cyberpunk type sound. The game is very cheesy where it needs to be, nothing over the top I would argue.

It's always fun to die, provided you save regularly. Other than the obvious ways, plenty of at-first-sight logical steps or simple mishaps can result in your demise and some often hilarious commentary about you. 

Some people have FPS problems or stuttering, as did I. RivaTuner and no native vsyc were to blame. I changed the OSD render type, then forced vsync, and all was well.

It has Adveneture mode which allows you to experience all the game and walkthru which removes some of the elements to make the experience more casual. 

Cons: Compared to what we have today the graphics would be considered horrible (my friends saw me playing and looked at it then began commenting on ""how old"" it looked. I have also had some weird crashes that just kind of appear out of the blue so save often.

I'm not in this for the Graphics though, I'm here for the story.

A more detailed critique:

I remember the original game tha came on my family's Packard computer back in the late 90's.  It was known as Jounreyman Project Turbo and i played it every chance I got.  I remember looking over every detail trying to find clues and rubbing every item in my inventory over everything always looking for secrets.  This was the game that got me into the ""point and click"" genre of gaming.  

The story is somewhat unique as it similar to Quantum Leap with the ""putting right what once went wrong"" theme, however you are not lost in time in a broken time travel experiment. Instead you play as a security agent who's purpose is to safe-guard time against anything or anyone who tries to change it.

Now as I mentioned earlier, this is a remake, the major difference between the two besides the original using still images and the remake using something like pre-rendered interactive video. Another difference that it also includes a larger cast (the same cast that appeared in the sequels just not in the original). there are also other subtle differences like adding in and removing of some puzzles as well as greatly expanding the areas you can explore and of course, changing the solutions to some of the puzzles which threw me off when i started playing. This of course made me enjoy the experience more as my memory betrayed me.

Now for the one thing that, while i absolutly loved this character in the sequels, felt bizzarly betrayed by the inclusion of Arthur in the remake.  For those of you who don't know who Arthur is, I'm only going to tell you that you meet him in the sequel ""Buried in Time"" and he acts as an informative comic relief. While he is an easter egg in the remake and somewhat easy to find, i was kind of hoping that he would have new dialogue and be at least extremly entertaining. Well he wasn't, not that i didnt find myself snickering at his dialogue, its just that i heard it before as it is the same things he says in the sequels all chopped up to make what he says a little more relivant to what you are doing (i will admit that he is less annoying than the AI that noramally assists you in the game).  I will admit there are some moments where he does say something I don't remember him saying in the sequels but i can't help but think now that they could have been things that ended up getting cut out out of the sequels (i find it hard to believe as the creaters left in about 10 minutes of him joking about a hairy rug in ""Legacy of Time"" that still makes me laugh when i think about it).  I mean I understand his inclusion to help sell the product and maybe give a nod to the fans of the series but it all felt a little ""phoned in"" by Presto if you get my drift. 

In conclusion I feel the game is worth getting, it has good story, the gameplay is a little trial and error, and it's a great game for killing time.",1487690784,1487690855,True,22,0,0.67891991138458252,3,True,False,False,False,,,

cons: cinematics are stuck at 15fps, random fps drops, unforgiving instant death scenarios (a lot of trial-and-error so prepare for a lot of save-and-load), no windowed full-screen option, RNG color puzzle on mars, hit-or-miss on the final puzzle 

Overall, a PC classic for anyone looking to experience some nostalgia. For anyone new to the game - I would encourage looking at the key mapping first, exercise frequent saves on multiple files, & you will need to time travel at different timelines (usually more than once) to acquire items that allow you to progress. I bought & completed this steam release on day one (7-20-2017) to re-experience this game when I was a young kid during the 90's sitting in front of my family's first PC on windows 95.
