一款冒险解谜游戏，游戏中玩家将要进入到神话传说中的王国身处，破解各种谜题机关。

游戏的画面表现非常棒，细腻精致的建模场景令人眼前一亮。游戏并没有给玩家过多的提示帮助，需要玩家自行在场景中探索解谜，这种设计方式令游戏的难度增加了不少。游戏中的谜题机关大多数与镜面反射有关，玩家需要通过调整机关的角度，通过镜面反射来破解。这种谜题设计非常有趣，难度适中。

游戏售价25元，总得来说，游戏内容的表现可圈可点，但是也存在着BUG的情况。有时候通过手柄来移动会造成超出场景范围的问题，只能通过重启游戏解决，另外一些伴随着机关的BUG也影响玩家的游戏体验，建议感兴趣的玩家等待官方的修复在购买体验。",1486980131,1486980131,False,1,0,0.449927419424057007,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Eigentlich ein relativ solides Adventure mit guter Grafik, interessanter mythischer Atmosphäre und guten Soundeffekten.
Die Rätsel scheinen etwas einfach, was sich aber sich im späteren Spiel noch ändert.
Was aber gar nicht geht sind die Unmengen an Bugs. Weder die Steuerung funktioniert gut (Schalter und ""Räder"" schnappen sehr oft ungewollt wieder in ihre Ausgangsposition), noch kann man sich sicher sein, dass man ein Rätsel richtig angeht, weil man durch Bugs vom richtigen Weg abkommt. In meinem Beispiel war ich auf einmal in einem weißen Raum, das war wohl ein Glitch. Zudem konnte ich fast das Tür-Farben-Rätsel nicht lösen, da der Lichtkreis mal klein wurde und mal einfach nicht. Zudem ist der Preis sehr hoch für die paar Minuten.
Das Spiel hat Potential, aber es müssen dringend die Bugs beseitigt werden!!

On that day, it was basically unplayable due to a plethora of bugs. Those bugs have been fixed  and pushed to Steam. 

I will reiterate from my first comment that I had played part of a demo at GDC 2015 and eagerly waited for the final release. With the bugs fixed, I was able to get through this VERY short experience (about 10 minutes.) For some reason Steam continues to log time for every game I play, even after I quite, so don't look at my time played as anything of consequence.

What Thunderbird has going for it are nice graphics, and what I hope will be a good series once it is completed. Is it worth the $6. That's a tough call. Unfortunately, this particular release is not much more than a glorious way to demonstrate VR for friends and family who want to dip into something for a very brief time. If the series grows (as the developers promise) then I can imagine that it will be a fulfilling puzzle game. Currently the puzzles are two easy, but that is okay if they progressively become more difficult. 

It is hard to tell from this if there will be a story, or just a series of puzzles to solve. I am also not clear on the business/release model. Are we going to pay $6 for each installment? I don't know how many installments there will be, and I'd have to say that if it's going to be 4 releases totaling $24, then I question the value, unless there is something about it that blows my mind.

There are still a few bugs in the game, but not ""game breakers"" like on initial release. Some collision volumes are still active, when they shouldn't be, triggering a sound that should not be played. The developer should check all locations where objects are retrieved.

In general, the mechanics are pretty good, but some of them required too much precision, especially when placing objects. If you don't have it just right, it can fail. Sometimes needing the object respawned.

Room Scale or Standing? Apparently the problem with the original release was some sort of mixup between the two locomotion versions. The issue I have with room scale is that if your boundaries are close to the edge of the game's minimum Room Scale requirements, then you are often looking at Chaperone Lines. This breaks the immersion. I would allow teleporting in Room Scale.

I think there is better value for your money elsewhere, however, I think with a few adjustments, this can be a nice thing to have around for a quick, easy to use demonstration, and that is worth $6 to me.",1486879698,1487138923,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,2,True,False,False,False,,,

--old review/issue report below (now out of date)--

Not so much a review as the reason why I refunded (for now, will buy again if fixed and give a recommendation)

I've got nothing against the format (4 times 15 minute installations etc) although it is a little bit short.. 

I refunded because there are some major issues when playing with teleport like not being able to walk on to the *last object* (no spoilers) because you can't teleport at that point or also the bit before it too. 

This means it's not intuitive for some one who has had VR for many months let alone the people I would love to show this too. I know this is probably a non issue without teleport but a lot of us don't quite have 4 metres of space! :)

Also menu select at the start could have been more intuitive. the ""start"" hit box could have maybe been bigger as I thought I was looking at it but had to raise my head quite a bit to get it to work. I t also wasn't aware that was what you had to do and same with the teleport.

Fix these bugs and I'll buy it again as I've been waiting for this game to come out before I even got the vive and it was a major reason that finally convinced me. :) Looking forward to the other parts and hope they come soon.",1486778261,1499022691,True,0,0,0.508327007293701172,4,True,False,False,False,,,

So the developers are very responsive and are working quickly to squash bugs in the game. They have already fixed and addressed the bugs I mentioned in my below review. I will continue to test the game. I can say they are working to correct issues.

***ORIGINAL POST***

I really wanted to like this game. The intro was ok and graphics looked great. However that is where the dream ended. 

I was presented with the first bug after the first light puzzle and blinked forward to enter the door. The door closed but I was presented with a turn around graphic and then white cube room of no escape. The second bug appeared after entering a getting set on the down elevator when working the lever the thing flipped around to the other side! I got the mirror disk in it but I had to reach around the back to work it!. After at least 20 minutes of positioning the light in different spots with the concave and convex sides of the mirror, I am convinced the game is too buggy and seems like it was rushed to publish without proper QA and bug-sqaushing. Very disappointing. My advice for the time being would be to stay away until they either fix it, which I hope they do or to bypass it.",1486772672,1487355377,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False,False,,,

My experience was this:

Game loads and I get asked if i want roomscale or standing, I went for the standing option and i get shown how to teleport.
The teleportation is standard stuff thats in alot of VR games so I jumped a couple of times and wanted to start the game waiting for it to continue. it was only until I had satisfied the game and teleported several times more that it presented me with the start option.
Looking at the word ""start"" did nothing and pressing a few buttons on the controller only gave me Resolution options (which was nice), but I was unable to change the resolution.. I managed to discover that scrolling on the track pad highlighted a different resolution to pick, but I couldnt actually select it.
Finally i found that I was just off the games ""prefered"" standing position (which is marked on the floor) - finally I could get into the game.

Now, other than a very short clip of the game with the first puzzle I hadnt watched any other videos about the game - dont want to spoil a puzzle game by seeing other people complete the puzzles and make the game a walk through.

The game loads and the first puzzle is solved within a few seconds and i went onto the next.. the game is quite dimly lit after the first puzzle, so there isnt much in the way of amazing views.
The second puzzle (no spoilers) was very obvious and again it was just a few seconds to solve.
The 3rd puzzle got me for the longest time out of all of the puzzles, but as soon as I saw 1 item it all fell into place and that was solved.
4th Puzzle was solved within a few seconds once again

I do hope they add more do this game as it does look good, but if you want to see what you get for your money at the moment (and see the puzzles solved), UploadVR has the entire game in 12 minutes on Youtube (which was uploaded over a year ago 12/Jan/2016). After the Youtube video ends, in the actual game it says ""to be continued"" and you get the credits.

At the moment this game feels like a Demo. I really do hope they add more at some point.

My total play time for this (including going through the teleportation tutorial) was 23 minutes - 5 minutes was before and game play + setting up broardcasting (twice, first time failed) so a friend could watch",1486728884,1486728999,False,34,0,0.742433845996856689,7,True,False,False,False,,,
