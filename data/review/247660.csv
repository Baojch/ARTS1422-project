First off, the settings (that you supposedly can change AND save) do revert at random.
No controller support. You'll need a mod for this and change controller settings template (until that part, left is up, right is down, up is right and down is left). 

Sometimes, the game will decide to not respond at all to controls.

I have had issues that forced me to close the game, restart and hope for the best before i could even finish the prologue ! Who knows after that... I would not be surprised to read that the game is broken enough to prevent from finishing it.

Add to that that launching from steam or the game's launcher crashes the game on start 100% of time i tried.
Launching it from the game's exe (not the shortcut though) lowers it to roughly 60% of the time.

This is not my first time playing Deadly Premonition and I definitely do not recommend this port for your first time either, unless you're willing to jump through hoops on fire. I was curious to try this version out after hearing how bad it is and for the low price of $1 I figured it was worth the try. Despite all sorts of problems it is in fact possible to complete the game 100%, so things could certainly be a lot worse.

Let me walk you through my experience:

My controller is not detected by the game/launcher.

Turns out you need to go to USB controller setup in Windows and then set your controller as the preferred device in the advanced settings.


I boot up the game and it crashes after the intro cutscene.

The game dislikes LAV filters for WMV playback which you probably have installed if you use MPC-HC or such.


The game boots up but things seem to be running at 15 fps.

The solution to this of all things is restarting your computer, I still don't understand why.


The control stick ranges bugged out a few hours in and barely register.

Downloading a controller profile with Steam Input seemingly corrected this. Still mystifies me.


The game might randomly crash.

Patching the executable to support 4 GB of virtual memory may have alleviated this but I can't say or sure.


The game crashes consistently during a cutscene that plays when grabbing the guitar.

Windows XP compatibility mode on the executable solved this (why?) and also smoothed out the FPS which had been juddery. I only noticed later that it also comes with the caveat that your aiming range breaks and becomes greatly limited which makes some spots awfully difficult to clear. (again, why???)

Things were quite smooth sailing after all of that was figured out but then the dreaded chapter 9 hit me. Something about that intro cutscene does not like to be played from a fresh boot up of the game so you need to make sure you save the game after watching it first. I lost about 3 hours of progress to that which would've been a lot more had I not created a back up save.

Then there's the crash at the cutscene after visiting the diner. Entering the cigarette smoking screen is somehow enough to avoid it. At this point I stop questioning the solutions. I had some side quest cutscenes crash on me too during that chapter which the smoking screen helped me avoid. I have no idea why it is so unstable.

After chapter 9 there were no further problems aside from needing to deal with the broken aiming from time to time.

I would love for some reverse engineer expert to look at this game to figure out what's going on under the hood. And maybe to try fixing the game too, would be really appreciated because Rising Star hasn't done anything for 10 years and the community needed to come up with all these workarounds. Had this all not been figured out I would've given up multiple times.

It's a damn shame too because this port is so close to being good. Being on PC makes it really accessible, the discounted price is impossible to beat and you'd be hard pressed to find another version that runs at a relatively smooth 60 fps the whole way through. And this pulls it off with very low spec requirements too which I find very impressive when compared to something like the PS3 port.

All that said, if you actually want to experience this game properly, you will need to get your hands on an Xbox One or Series console to play the original Xbox 360 version which you can thankfully buy from the Microsoft Store for $20. Forking over 200-350 just to play a single game is silly of course but maybe one of your friends has one laying around covered in dust that you can borrow? Just an idea. Maybe you'll figure something out.

It's been over 10 years and nothing has changed with this port. Unless you're a fan of the game and willing to troubleshoot all sorts of issues like me, steer clear of this sad mess.",1710419908,1710420404,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Most gameplay is exploration and time based. you will drive around Greenvale, while being aware of your car's gas and using turn signals. Francis York Morgan will often talk to an unseen entity he calls Zach, using these one sided conversations as a way to both occupy time and to help him connect clues together. As time passes, you will have to investigate areas and talk to people at the right times to advance the plot or complete side objectives.

When the gameplay switches to its action segments, the game borrows from Resident Evil 4, but without any of that game's skill or depowering horror. York carries a sidearm with infinite ammo. SWERY didn't even want action at all, but was somewhat forced to implement it.

The story and characters are really interesting. its best to go in with as little information as possible.

If you are as determined as me, just know that along side running in windows 98 and running the launcher as administrator, sometimes you will have to switch to windowed mode. And when that doesn't solve crashing issues, you will have to download an unofficial patch for the game and place it in the files. That helps with some crashes, but causes others so you will be switching from removing the patch and putting it back.

Update 1
Hit my first frozen blackscreen. As others in the community suggested, I changed DP.exe to run in compatibility for Windows XP Service Pack 3. I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.

Update 2
Needed to change the compatibility back and forth from Windows XP to 8 to get through the 
[spoiler] Community Centre Gathering [/spoiler] chapter from the game freezing at certain points. It's schizophrenia, isn't it Zach?

Update 3
The game crashes in Episode 2 right before you go to meet [spoiler] Olivia behind the diner [/spoiler] and will work in XP Service Pack 3, but now this feels like it's running at 10fps. Playing in windowed mode helps a tiny bit before I could turn back to Windows 8 compatibility. 

So what makes me keep playing this game? It feels special enough to want to try to finish it. It's a game with the setting and vibes of Twin Peaks, some influence in encounters and experiences from Silent Hill, the voice acting is masterful in bringing the characters to life.

Deadly Premonition è un gioco unico nel suo genere, con un ottima trama, piena di sorprese e momenti inaspettati, un cast di personaggi eccezionale e una colonna sonora memorabile. Tuttavia, queste caratteristiche sono le uniche che si salvano. Questo gioco soffre di numerosi problemi tecnici e di design che rendono l'esperienza di gioco frustrante e poco piacevole, un ottima idea affidata a sviluppatori incompetenti.

La versione PC è totalmente instabile, con crash e corruzioni di salvataggi continui, e mentre questo non è il primo gioco ottimizzato male per PC che abbia mai giocato, questo è l'UNICO che mi ha dato continui grattacapi anche dopo aver installato tutte le patch e mod correttive in circolazione. Più volte durante il mio playthrough ho rischiato di rimanere bloccato per colpa del gioco che crasha costantemente in alcuni punti.
Il caso più grave è stato durante il capitolo 9 dove il gioco crashava in continuazione dopo essere usciti dalla galleria d'arte, ma fortunatamente sono riuscito a proseguire solo dopo ore di ricerche online e smanettando con le impostazioni del gioco. 
Un altro caso grave è stato quando sono rimasto bloccato dentro l'ospedale perchè ogni volta che provavo ad uscire il gioco crashava (avevo salvato DENTRO l'ospedale quindi ad ogni riavvio mi ritrovavo bloccato), sono riuscito a risolvere solo facendo scorrere il tempo fino all'orario di chiusura, ma se fosse stato un luogo aperto H24 avrei perso tutti i miei progressi di gioco.
Anche fuori dalla storia principale il gioco crasha quando provi ad avviare alcune missioni secondarie o durante i caricamenti. Come ciliegina sulla torta, alcuni achievement di Steam si sono buggati, costringendomi ad usare Steam Achievement Manager per sbloccarli.

Quando il gioco non crasha, hai l'opportunità di visitare uno dei peggiori open world mai creati. Il gioco è ambientato in una cittadina di campagna di nome Greenvale, che si presenta spoglia perché in giro si possono trovare solo i personaggi principali della storia, non ci sono NPC che popolano le strade come in molti giochi di questo genere, se non alcune auto che girano per la città. L'ambientazione in se è poco interessante e poco dettagliata, con poche cose da fare a parte le missioni secondarie, inutilmente grande e sparsa, il 70% della mappa è composto da strade in mezzo al nulla che collegano punti diversi della città distanti tra loro qualche chilometro. Sarebbe stato cinquanta volte meglio fare un ambientazione più piccola ma più dettagliata.

Le fasi di combattimento sono noiose e ripetitive, la maggior parte si svolgono in corridoi e stanze infinite, e si affrontano sempre gli stessi nemici lenti, che rappresentano un pericolo solo in spazi stretti dove il gioco li fa comparire all'infinito. Il 90% dei combattimenti è così inutile che rimuovendoli dal gioco non si perde nulla della trama, e gli unici interessanti sono le due boss fight contro [spoiler]George[/spoiler] e [spoiler]Kaysen[/spoiler] verso la fine del gioco.

Ci tengo ad aprire una piccola parentesi per il sistema di guida delle auto nel gioco; tutti i veicoli sono noiosi, troppo silenziosi, e non si danneggiano visivamente quando sbatti contro qualcosa. La fisica è fatta male, quando vai troppo veloce l'auto sbanda spesso a caso senza motivo anche se stai andando dritto su una strada piana.

La grafica è letteralmente l'ultima cosa che guardo in un videogioco, ma questa è fin troppo antiquata, i colori sono troppo spenti e molte texture sono a bassa risoluzione. Menzione speciale per la vegetazione, per essere un gioco ambientato in campagna, è troppo spoglia e da l'impressione di trovarsi in un campo da calcio con qualche albero e collinetta qua e là. Questo gioco è uscito nel 2010, quando in circolazione c'erano giochi open world del calibro di Saints Row 2, GTA IV e Mafia 2, eppure ha una grafica ed un gameplay degno di un gioco per PS2 dei primi anni 2000.

Se volete provarlo consiglio di lasciar perdere la versione PC e prenderlo su console, il gioco è disponibile su Xbox 360, PS3 e Switch. Se non avete nessuna di queste console consiglio di emulare la versione PS3 su PC (ha più contenuti rispetto alla versione 360). Se proprio non avete altra scelta oltre al PC consiglio di seguire questa guida prima di iniziare a giocare, così da renderlo un po più giocabile:

What a game!.. Not sure about Deadly Premonition 2, haven't played yet, but the first game definitely deserves the “A Blessing in Disguise” subtitle.

[hr][/hr]

In summary, to complete the game I had to:

[list]
  [*] use DPfix for Borderless Windowed Fullscreen; the game hangs up when loses focus in Exclusive (Real) Fullscreen;
  [*] cap frame rate at 60 FPS (the game physics is broken at higher frame rate);
  [*] patch the executable to set the “Large Address Aware” flag (not sure if it really helps);
  [*] save a lot, I mean, [b]A LOT[/b];
  [*] back up the savestate (dp.sav) each 2–3 save points, immediatly after a save point (there is a non–zero possibility that the game will break your savestate on the next crash);
  [*] roll back to the previous backup to replay some parts of the game (two times the savestate was broken; two times there were game–breaking bugs);
  [*] use a crappy old 2nd gen i5/Intel HD/Win 10 laptop to beat one chapter near the end of the game — it crashes on my modern desktop PC despite all the fixes and workarounds.

O jogo em si é ótimo (ignorando o port problemático da Steam). O modo como ele te mantém tenso e, depois de 30 segundos, faz você rir é excelente. Você está em um hospital atirando em sombras e logo depois tem que ir comer, ajudar algum NPC ou algo do tipo.

So Deadly Premonition released in 2010 on PS3, Xbox and PC, and maybe should say that graphics of this game looks like this came out on PS2. Looking at this fact, I will start with the fact that if for you the graphics in the game is an important part of the game and you cannot play the game despite the good story, forget about Deadly Premonition. Unfortunately this game looks worse. But if you don’t care about the graphics and just want to enjoy a good story and interesting characters, this game is what you need. While playing this game, you meet interesting characters with their storyline. Some stories are copies from Twin Peaks, and the main part also has similar moments from the True Detective.
And now a few words about the gameplay. This game has technological problems such as crashes (never save the game near the Milkbar store). Regarding the shooting mechanics, the game is trying to copy Resident Evil 4, but they failed in quality. The requirements for completing several side quests were difficult, but there are also good ones that are not difficult to complete. If you missed side quests you can go back to a specific chapter and complete them there. Deadly Premonition is both a good and bad game at the same time. If you like a good detective story with interesting characters, you should definitely try this game. But if you are not familiar with the Japanese mentality or have not watched series like Twin Peaks and True Detective, you will have a hard time understanding this game.",1694534507,1694534507,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Por hacer un análisis rápido: Guionistas excelentes, programadores malos aunque en el fondo creo que ellos querían que este juego se viera y funcionara así de mal a propósito,  hay demasiadas referencias al cine de serie B y creo que aquí han querido que el juego fuera de segunda.

Aún así me parece un juego disfrutable si consigues arreglar los problemas de rendimiento, crasheos, archivos de guardado corruptos entre otros.

Mecánicas de principios de los 2000, texturas feísimas, sonidos falsísimos, combate horroroso pero..., de verdad, vale todo la pena por una gran historia detrás de toda esa fachada de serie B.

Personajes carismáticos con historias detrás de cada uno, muchas interacciones y misiones secundarias, un mapa abierto que explorar en un survival horror (primera vez que lo veo) hacen que mi voto sea positivo, sobre todo la historia.

Si tuviese que compararlos supongo que es con lo que todo el mundo lo compara, una mezcla de Twin Peaks en la ambientación y Shenmue en lo jugable y mundo ""vivo"".

The game in question is Deadly Premonition.

First and foremost, Diane, I must inform you that this game is not for the faint of heart. Its bizarre nature and unique charm are what make it stand out, but may be off-putting for some. I, however, found myself intrigued by its odd storytelling and quirky characters.

Taking on the role of Agent Francis York Morgan, I found myself solving a murder mystery in the small town of Greenvale. York, as he likes to be called, is quite a peculiar character with a strange love for coffee and cherry pie. Moreover, his constant conversations with ""Zach,"" an imaginary friend that only he can see, make for some fascinating dialogues.

The visuals of the game are quite dated, but in this case, I believe they add to the game's charm. It reminded me of the good ol' days when gameplay and story were more important than flashy graphics.

I must mention the soundtrack, though. The music complements the game perfectly, with its ethereal tunes heightening the overall sense of mystery. It has definitely left a lasting impression on me.

Now, Diane, I must caution that the game does have its fair share of glitches and bugs. While some of them can be frustrating, I've found that they don't detract from the overall experience too much. One could even say they add to the game's quirky charm.

In conclusion, Deadly Premonition is an odd, one-of-a-kind experience that isn't for everyone, but I must say, it's certainly worth a try. Its unique storytelling, eclectic characters, and haunting soundtrack make it an unforgettable journey. So, Diane, if you ever find yourself in the mood for something different, pick up this game. You might just find yourself immersed in the strange, yet fascinating world of Deadly Premonition.

Crashes during the hospital cutscene, and both the windowed fix AND the gamesave fix on the PCGamingWiki doesn't work to fix it. Just loads into a complete black screen. According to someone on the Steam forums, DXVK fixes the game crashing, but the current issue is that there's no way to chainload a proxy DLL through DXVK that would allow for DPFix to function. Even after trying it with just DXVK, same issue occurs. Plenty of places where the game can softlock or corrupt your save too. This PC port is just completely busted.

Keep in mind, this is with these modifications:
- DPFix (The game itself doesn't have issues hitting 60FPS at 3440x1440 with this mod and with mostly maxed settings, but on my other setup with a Ryzen 5 5600X, it had really bad performance issues)
- The intro skip, ultrawide patch, and large memory address aware modifications to the game executable
- Windows 98/ME Compatibility Mode (Which apparently fixes some crashing)
- Application-based DPI scaling in compatibility settings (So you can use a high DPI without being messed up)
- The Immersive Premonition mod (that is available on the Steam forums) which aims to fix color grading issues, alongside making the game more ""immersive""
- The assorted HD texture packs and PlayStation button prompts mod

Please for all that is holy, just buy the Switch version, dump a ROM of it, and emulate that at 60FPS, or (if you have a Bluray drive for your PC), dump the game files for RPCS3 using a physical PS3 copy of the game. This is such a shame since I honestly like what I've played so far.

The developers of this port seemingly haven't fixed the major issues with it. How is this port even being sold on Steam to begin with when it may as well not come with the executable at this point?

An Open-World, (Semi-Action)-Horror game, With Survival Elements.
The game has a lot you can appreciate and a quite a few things you can dislike throughout the game. It's honestly surreal this game manages to be as playable as it is.
It's difficult to get immersed from it being a game, but you can get immersed into the game and the world if you play for long stretches. The Game Rewards you really easily, and honestly if you're not familiar with this game, it's better to go in without expecting the best experience in the world, but expect something that is unique. Cause this game is one-of-a-kind. I've yet to think of a game that does everything the same as this game, but doesn't crash.
Even then, I consider the crashing as part of the experience even if it's not something I look forward to.(It just means I can do some stuff in a more time efficient manner with how I see it)

How is the Main Story? - Interesting, and engaging, keep tabs on the story of the game.
Is there something I should look out for? - If you're doing Side Quests, I'd recommend just using a guide, the numbering of a lot of them seem really random, even as chained quests.
Is this the best possible way to play the game? - Supposedly the Xbox 360 Version is the best way to play it, it's the 'Least Buggy' way to play, every other version has a chance of crashing, and gets a more likely chance with each later iteration.

I play this game, as it stays a buggy mess.
The guides I went though were just a mere test.
Seeing the issues arise as I play.
The funny fast car glitch is the one I wish could stay.
(So Says, Mr. Stewart.)

Crashing and errors pop-up throughout my play.
aiming is broken and a guide said ""compatibility Win98""
Some of these fixes just flat out don't work sometimes.
Definitely play on a console or patch this game.
Even edit the exe, so it will use more than 2gigs of ram.(It made the game also look better)

I'd make a guide to how to make the game work and how to beat it from my personal experience with this very broken game game.

I found two guides that made the game run well, and I found some things that stayed broken so I had to look through discussions. I might make a mega guide or something if I note things down soon enough.",1692020058,1692020058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Lots of bugs, crashes, etc. (but if you are lucky they can be worked around). 
There are some parts of the gameplay that are really annoying, and kinda of stupid. When you are being chased by the main antagonist. And some other parts later on. (not a big deal though for me)
There are a few other things regarding the story that I have issues with but that would be me flirting with spoilers, so I'll keep it in my pants right now.

The positives.
Everything the f@#$ else.
As a huge fan of who done it genre this game blew me away. Whenever I thought I figured out who the main antagonist was the game made me feel like an amateur, a fool of the highest order.
Even in a such a dark setting , the whole atmosphere of the game felt really light hearted. 
There were so many times I had to pause to laugh at the quirks of main character.
And to top it all off, the supernatural elements really meshed with grounded murder mystery as well. 
I could go on but I don't want to spoil even a tiny detail of the story so. 

Play it NERDS.

If you can't run the game, just watch a playthrough , you will enjoy it as a story.
And if you can figure out who the Raincoat killer is, you have my utmost respect.
Signing off.
Call me Elric! Everyone calls me that.

Touching a physics object has a 50% chance to break the crash the game. The lighting bugs out during rainstorms, and gives everything blinding textures. I've softlocked myself several times, and I nearly permanently broke my save when I messed with a scripted chase ahead of time on accident. And to top it off, it crashes at random.

That being said, I still kinda love this game. Despite this being maybe the worst way to experience it, I love a lot of what it's doing. The main character is insufferable in a wonderful way. The story is weird and bizarre but just good enough to keep you hooked. The world is so open and so ambitious that you almost forget it doesn't work. The dialogue is unintentionally hilarious, with stilted deliveries and tangents that go nowhere. It's a game that shouldn't work at all, but somehow does. And there's a lot of charm here, just waiting to be experienced.

Do I recommend this game [b]in general?[/b] Absolutely. If you're a fan of those bizarre Playstation 1/2 horror games, and can appreciate an old janky game, you'll love this. It carries that atmosphere and feeling perfectly. 

Do I recommend you buy [b]this version[/b] of the game? No, not at all. This is probably the [i]worst[/i] way to experience Deadly Premonition, and you'd be better off emulating it or playing it on a console.

You need to install a bunch of mods to make it work and it still barely functions. Crashes every 20 mins. Bugs fucking everywhere. Audio is complete garbage. Somehow the controller cameras are flipped, so looking up and down is now right to left and looking right to left is now up and down. 

Darts mini game is a piece of shit and horribly bugged. The darts never land where you are aiming its random. I keep watching guides of people nailing it over and over, but when i aim perfectly at the spot it goes nowhere near where I am aiming. Seriously whoever designed this dart game, I wish nothing but the worst for you. 

Generally not worth the time. I played it years ago, its an alright game with some interesting stuff in it. But its not worth the time and effort to get it to work. Just watch Twin Peaks. This game hardcore rips it off anyway. 

This is the worst port I have ever seen in my entire life and this shouldn't be up for purchase on steam. Whatever company ported this, should not be allowed near any game again. Fucking disaster. You should be embarrassed by this shitshow of a job you did on this port. 

Seriously fuck you. 

Edit: I looked into it. The darts mini-game is 100% broken. They are always vertical for me so they never go even remotely where I am aiming. I followed a bunch of fixes and none of them work. This makes the entire mini-game random because the darts can land anywhere they want on the board. If you watch guides, everyone's darts go straight to where they aim. No vertical darts. Even if you watch random let's plays, people just randomly playing it, all their darts go straight no vertical. 

Its impossible to win this mini-game now. I've tried everything. I tried with DPFIX, someone said you can fix it by removing DPFIX and running the game in default resolution. It didn't work. I even tried using cheat engine to change my score and that doesn't even work. The game made me resort to having to use a cheat engine to try and beat it and its so broken that you can't cheat it. Fucking dumb. 

Update: I FUCKING DID IT!!!!! I BEAT THE STUPID SCORE WITH VERTICAL DARTS!!!! FUCK YOU DART GAME!!!!!!

Update 2: I 100% the game. Don't buy this. It crashed around 250-300 times during this playthrough. I lost count around there. This shouldn't be allowed to be sold on steam. Its a broken mess. If you have to play this game, then get it on literally any other platform or emulate it. 

My favorite part of the whole ordeal is when the game crashed on the last ten seconds of the final cutscene. It had to do it one more time before I departed the game. I will never play this again on steam. Its a disaster.",1687317730,1687632472,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Но если спустя годы после покупки и ~надцатую попытку пройти,  всё-таки дать игре шанс, ты влюбишься в мир DP и станешь обожать с той же силой, с какой ранее плевался в монитор и называл неиграбельным куском дерьма. 
Ты влюбишься в неповторимую атмосферу Твин Пикс, которую Хидетака настолько мастерски и творчески спёр и внёс в неё своей гениальной отсебятины, что смог даже переплюнуть оригинал.
Ты влюбишься в сигму-куна Френсиса Йорка Моргана и станешь ему лучшим другом и узнаешь обо всех фильмах категории «бэ» и «гэ» хочешь того или нет.
Ты влюбишься в городишко Гринвейл, в разговоры о кино, в ночные прогулки под ливнем в тёплом красном дождевике.
Тебе захочется возвращаться туда снова и снова за ответами, ради тех неповторимых диалогов и обитателей, которые вызовут такие искренние и такие настоящие эмоции: тепло, сочувствие, понимание, грусть, слёзы,  ненависть, раздражение, злость, презрение. 
Тебе захочется стереть память и снова пережить ту детскую сцену Йорка и Зака, те эмоции и залитое слезами лицо и радость, что всё-таки не забросил игру и смог прожить этот великий момент и что он навсегда отпечатается в сердце, вызывая ностальгию спустя годы и мотивирующий снова заехать на пару вечеров в ставший родным Гринвейл. 
Ты зальёшь весь саундтрек в особый плейлист для дождливых вечеров и особого настроения, настолько он прекрасен и напомнит тебе о первом прохождении и невероятных эмоциональных качелях.


Что из себя представляет геймплей? Боль от управления и стрельбы,  открытый мир, сбор улик, сражения с боссами с помощью самых забористых и утомительных QTE  (утомительных не потому, что сложные, а оттого, что минуты четыре нужно не останавливаясь, долбить по двум кнопкам, с каждой новой минутой ощущая ужас бытия и нарастающую боль в фалангах пальцев). 
Большую часть игры  придётся ездить, как в Мафии, попутно испытывая реальные муки от управления машинами: на задание, с задания, на поиск сайд-квеста, на поиск собираемой атмты для сайд-квеста, на рыбалку, на гонки. Однако это контрится записанными  специально под поездки в машине  кулстори Йорка о просмотренных им фильмах или о прошлых расследованиях, которые очень интересно слушать и время в поездке летит незаметно. Ах да, УЧИ КАРТУ, чтобы ездить по памяти, это пригодится, поверь! 
Остальное время занимает стрельба, беготня от одного из боссов посредством QTE и сбор улик. Сбор улик и их анализ казуален донельзя. Ммм, а ещё завезли симуляцию жизни а-ля, Sims: Будни агента ФБР Делюкс пак. Да, Йорку надо кушать, спать, чистить костюм, бриться и принимать душ. Кому-то такая рутина не понравится, мне же она пришлась по душе и разнообразила вечные поездки. Единственный минус: из-за того, что все жители живут по распорядку и их личные квесты доступны только в определённое время и ограничены несущимся вперёд сюжетом, можно упустить многие важные для понимания лора и характера того или иного персонажа, квесты, особенно, играя впервые без гайда по сайдам. 

[h1] К ЧЕМУ СТОИТ БЫТЬ ГОТОВЫМ: [/h1]
– Вылеты, много их! Лечится только синхронизацией с win98 (официальный совет от разработчика в треде игры в комьюнити Стима).
– Низкий фпс, особенно, для тех, кто чувствителен к малейшим дропам кадров, это может быть проблемой.
– Графика из середины нулевых, как в своё время  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth отставала в техническом плане и отпугнула многих игроков своей устаревшей на добрый десяток лет, графикой, так и тут та же самая картина. Добавить сюда ужасную работу со звуками стрельбы или шагов и вот одна из причин, почему игре ставят отрицательные отзывы. 
– Самая неудобная стрельба эвар и пустынная достаточно большая песочница, где ничего не происходит вне сюжетных или сайд-миссий. Несмотря на потуги Суэхиро сделать свою GTA, делать в открытом мире нечего, кроме рыбалки, гонок и сбора коллекционных карточек.
– Если ты не поклонник виабу-сюра, тебя отпугнёт буквально любая даже самая лайтовая странность в поведении персонажей или города. А с каждым  часом эти странности будут только усугубляться и градус сюрреализма нарастать, поэтому, если ты захотел купить игру ради детективной истории, расследования и ожидал что-то между L.A.Noire и каким-нибудь Шерлоком и не знаком с играми Гоичи Суды, ты дропнешь игру и запросишь рефанд, я гарантирую это. Не люблю шаблонное «Не для всех», но здесь это определение как нельзя в тему.
– В игре есть очень тяжёлые моменты физического и морального страдания, издевательств, гуро и давящая атмосфера, поэтому если всё вышеперечисленное может затриггерить какие-то расстройства психики, погрузить в депрессию или заставить пережить какие-то травмирующие события прошлого, лучше воздержаться от игры и не рисковать здоровьем.

ИТОГ: Это одна из мощных по гениальности, эмоциональному влиянию и запоминающаяся история о.. самом банальном житейском, о собственных демонах, комплексах, девиациях, о травмирующем опыте, о преодолении и потерях, но в фирменном стиле Хидетаки, который не станет церемониться с теми, кто привык к современной попсе игроиндустрии. 

Eh,no no non nonno no no.
Представляю, как форсили бы этот момент, будь DP распиаренным дepьмoм с миллионными продажами.

i imagine as new windows versions become commonplace, this game will become even more difficult to play, so i'd just recommend trying to grab one of the console versions if you're interested. i've heard the switch version works well. the game, when it's playable, has this ugly-cute charm i think is easy to appreciate if you're a fan of quirky or janky games. it attracts a lot of comparison to twin peaks, and rightly so, but be prepared for the game to start shedding the more high-brow aspects of that show around the halfway point of the main plot - it starts to meander out into sophomoric-nonsensical territory pretty fast after that. be sure to take the time to do the side quests during the story, too - the game's strength lies frequently in the personalities and connections of its townsfolk, and working with them in these smaller ways can really bolster your experience of the main storyline. the combat just sucks and is boring but is mercifully very easy to get through (excepting the boss battles, which can pose a challenge especially if you're having issues aiming). the protagonist, york, is a distinct bright spot in the game - his voice actor is excellent, and he has a specific lack of social sensibility that i find really engaging and fun,

i think the reviews are certainly correct when they emphasise the uniqueness of the game - there really is nothing else i could directly compare it to. i think it's definitely worth a shot if it interests you, but try to get it for cheap or free, or at least buy it somewhere you can ask for a refund if it's not up your alley. [b]100%, do not buy this port.[/b]",1685947893,1685947893,False,3,1,0.519782304763793945,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Но чем больше я играл, тем больше игра разочаровывала. 

Во-первых, очень много врагов и много пустых коридоров (в прямом смысле пустых), игрока заставляют ездить по городу и бегать очень много. А, еще и повторяющиеся анимации. Анимацию как ГГ закуривает я видел раз 50, наверное. Катсцены часто медленные. Итого игрок тратит примерно 60% от всего времени прохождения впустую. 

Во-вторых, игра в очень плохом техническом состоянии. Вылеты случались много раз, и чтобы их обойти, надо скачать комьюнити патч и танцевать с бубном. Иногда надо в оконном режиме запустить игру, иногда надо закурить в определенном месте (я не шучу, 9 главу я смог пройти только куря в кафешке), иногда надо пропускать катсцены. Но вылеты - это еще не все. Также тут очень неудобное прицеливание, нельзя ходить, когда перезаряжаешь оружие, карта очень неудобная, ее нельзя нормально отдалить, на дороге невидимые препятствия, физика автомобиля просто неадекватная.

В-третьих, эта игра бредовая. Например, агент ФБР задает вопросы для расследования убийства, ему некоторые люди (например, Кэрол) просто не отвечают. И он такой: ""Ну ладно, пофиг"". Также есть тут 1 персонаж, который не стареет, но за 50 лет никто этого не заметил. Вообще, чем ближе к концу, тем больше этого бреда. Красные семена, красные деревья, военные эксперименты без цели, бессмертие и т.д. А финальный босс... Я когда увидел это, я просто oxyeл. Вся детективная история постепенно превратились в сюр.

Что-то на меня сегодня нашло и я решил - пора писать свой обзор на это произведение игровой индустрии. На данный момент я наиграл менее 10 часов,но мне хватило и первого часа,чтобы понять -  я с этой игрой надолго и бросать не наш вариант! Я увидел эту игру не так давно у одного из моих друзей в профиле(alex_snake,привет!) и начал изучать ее. Когда я перечитал несколько рецензий и посмотрел пару обзоров,то мне стало понятно - не все так однозначно. Тут я и решил,что нужно попробовать самому.Я не прогадал!
Сюжет заставляет погрузиться в повествование с первых минут и чем дальше,тем только больше. Он так и просит не останавливаться и идти все дальше и дальше,узнавая все новые и новые детали расследования. Гринвейл - тихий и маленький городок,но внезапно в нем происходит ритуальное убийство официантки Анны и Френсиса Йорка Моргана(зовите просто Йорк,все так делают) отправляют на расследование жутко интересного и запутанного происшествия. Чуть позже станет известно,что он уже сталкивался с подобными событиями и тут то все начинается!
По мимо основного сюжета вам предоставлена возможность перемещаться по городку и его окрестностям.Это позволяет изучать Гринвейл ,быт и тайны простых обывателей,коих у местных жителей как минимум по одной на душу. 
Каждый из персонажей,которые перед нами предстают чем-то цепляют и запоминаются. Все они разные и у каждого своя история. Их диалоги очень забавно слушать и некоторые фразы легко запоминаются. Чего только стоят монологи главного героя при поездке на авто,где он обсуждает кинематограф и рок!
Эту игру нельзя назвать идеальной,но есть ли такие вообще? Многие жалуются на управление авто,стрельбу,вылеты в неподходящий момент и тд. Все же со всеми недочетами в игре можно справиться или смириться. Если вы дадите ей шанс (а шанс дать стоит),то может тогда вы поймете,полюбите и примете Deadly Premonition такой какая она есть.
Я однозначно рекомендую пройти этот недооцененный шедевр,но или хотя бы попытаться позволить ему влюбить вас в себя!

On suit l’histoire de York, un agent du FBI envoyé dans une petite ville des Etats Unis pour enquêter sur un meurtre vraiment étrange. York, en plus de parler sans cesse à quelqu'un dans son oreillette qui ne nous répond jamais et qui ne nous a jamais présenté, se retrouve par moment dans un monde démoniaque à affronter des monstres sans jamais que la transition entre la réalité et cet univers parallèle ne soit expliquée.
Bref, beaucoup de mystère et une ambiance vraiment particulière font que ce jeu est vraiment prenant et qu’on a pas envie de s'arrêter pour en apprendre toujours plus.

Et puis ce jeu propose des idées que je n’ai jamais vu ailleurs comme la gestion de l'hygiène de notre personnage qui peut avoir un impact sur la manière dont nous perçoit certains personnages et d’autres aspects que je vous propose de découvrir par vous-même !
Au niveau de la structure, tout se déroule dans un Open World qui prend en compte la ville et ses alentours. Ce qui ajoute à l’ambiance si particulière c’est les citoyens de cette ville qui nous sont tous présentés au cours de l’intrigue et qui ont chacun une personnalité et une routine uniques que l'on peut voir lors de séquences d'enquêtes où l’on devra faire attention aux heures de vies des citoyens.

Si jusque là tout semble positif, on sent que les développeurs n’avaient pas les moyens de suivre leurs ambitions, et on va devoir subir ça. Déjà, le jeu est moche et pas du tout optimisé. Il crash souvent et c’est vraiment frustrant, surtout qu’on ne peut sauvegarder qu’à certains endroits. 
Ensuite, les phases d’actions dans le monde démoniaque ne sont pas du tout fun en plus de juste couper l’intrigue. Surtout que York n’est pas du tout agréable à contrôler. En plus de cela d’autres séquences sont vraiment chiantes à faire, entre suivre un chien sur plusieurs kilomètres et des QTE de 10 minutes face à certains ennemis qui détruisent les doigts j’ai vraiment hésité à m'arrêter à plusieurs moments.
Il y a beaucoup de BUG, mais vraiment beaucoup trop qui rendent certains passages irréalisables (le coup final pour achever le dernier boss qui marche presque jamais et qui fait recommencer presque tout le combat).
Le sound design est catastrophique, entre sons libres de droit bien cliché et bruitage inadapté (les écureuils font des cris de singe).
L’ambiance du jeu si particulière ne justifie pas toujours l’étrangeté de certaines cinématiques qui sont juste malaisantes.

Malgré tous ces défauts, j’ai quand même vraiment aimé découvrir cette histoire si atypique.

Deadly Premonition was my disappointment of the year. Not because it would be bad but rater because it does everything in its power to prevent you from not only enjoying it, but also completing it. Even though the game came out in early 2010's, I have only discovered it now and it was love at first sight. See, I have a weakness for ""weird"" games that people would not necessarily categorized as straight up bad but neither would they think of them as hidden gems. DP has that exact signature feeling to it along with a presentation unique to that specific niche of games developed by a Japanese studio in western-style setting - quirky dialogue writing, overload of unnecessary side activities, ominous plot player has no way of understanding and that gets crazier as the game progresses.... I love it. I have weakness for that particular niche and Deadly Premonition was able to scratch it fantastically....for a time.

See, the reason why I can not, in good faith, recommend the game even though I'd love for more people to play it is its infamously broken technical state. Now, don't get me wrong - I can tolerate A LOT of bulls*it from a game if I enjoy every other part of it. I have completed numerous titles that were either incredibly buggy or kept crashing constantly - if the game itself was worth it, I was always willing to push through these issues. But this was just too much. Even if I excuse the outer, less significant technical layer consisting of pis*-poor optimization, inability of the game to run at over 60fps (struggling to keep up with that, even on modern machines), A LOT of bugs and unresponsive controls, I can not overlook the worst offender - crashes. I was going to accept the game would crash in semi-frequent intervals from time to time but it kept happening more and more often which, when you take into account that the game does NOT allow you save anytime but rather in specific spots, is irritating enough on its own. What pushed me over the edge, however, was the save-bricking and inability to progress. Twice my safe game got corrupted as a result of a crash and twice I started again because that is how much I liked Deadly Premonition but my patience ran out when the game started crashing in one specific spot in the story and I was simply unable to fix it to get through it. Hell, even PCGamingWiki has a whole list of parts of the game that are known to crash and this was not there. So I've given up. And you should avoid this entire ordeal by simply skipping the entire thing. It's a shame because underneath it all, there is a really good game but juice is not worth the squeeze here.

El juego esta lleno de bugs que hacen que se te crashee el juego y hasta corromper tu partida guardada.

Es cierto que la comunidad hizo un parche (DPfix) que ""arregla"" todo el juego y trae mejoras técnicas como poder jugar a mayores resoluciones que 640x480 en esa resolución se me abría por el juego y en ningún lado había opción de cambiarlo ni en el launcher ni en las opciones dentro del mismo juego que son escasas.
Con parche instalado desde el principio.. después de 15 horas y habiendo llegado hasta el capítulo 12 ME CANSÉ, me cansé de tener que hacer malabares como jugar algunas partes del juego en modo ventana; saltear cinemáticas; tener que cambiarle el modo de compatibilidad al juego para evitar cualquier problema, todas esas precauciones siguiendo las guías de la comunidad para nada, ni así hubo salvación de los crasheos anticipados ni los inesperados (en cualquier momento, en cualquier lugar), la partida se corrompía igual osea que ya era inutilizable, cuando te pasa eso no te queda otra para poder retomar el juego que bajar partidas guardadas de internet y ponerlas en el juego.

La verdad es que ni así, no se puede jugar un juego teniendo que preocuparse siempre por los problemas y errores técnicos que puede presentar, los desarrolladores responsables de esto nunca les importaron los jugadores ni siquiera intentaron hacer algo para arreglar el juego que lanzaron estando mal de fábrica. Aunque la comunidad le haya puesto todas las ganas para que el público de PC pueda jugar este título, ni así fue suficiente.

CONCLUSIÓN:
(-) Jugar Deadly Premonition Director's Cut en las consolas que fue lanzado originalmente (Xbox 360 y Playstation 3), el port de PC es injugable y no se merece ser comprado ni aunque lo pongan a $1, es una estafa.

(+) En lo que respecta al juego su trama (muy basada en Twin Peaks) y lo que ofrece a modo de juego son atractivos, es un mundo abierto survival-horror con muchas buenas ideas: 
*Ciclos Día-Noche con cambios climáticos / Transcurso de los días (creo que influye cuantos días tardas en resolver el caso)
*Sistemas de Hambre, Sueño e Higiene
*Los vehículos dependiendo de la gasolina y bueno si se dañan dejan de funcionar
*Los NPCs del pueblo tienen una rutina y se los puede ver en distintos sitios, se puede hasta espiarlos por las ventanas
*Los Establecimientos del pueblo cumplen distintos horarios de apertura/cierre
*Actividades extra como carreras y misiones secundarias que te dan los habitantes del pueblo, desconozco que mas puede haber porque no tuve la oportunidad de explorarlo por problemas técnicos obvios

*Cosas malas que he visto son principalmente sus controles: a pie, lo shooter (tipo Resident Evil 4) me sorprende el nivel de tosquedad para ser del año 2010 y teniendo ejemplos tan buenos de hace 2 años como Dead Space que marcaba como tenían que ser las cosas en tercera persona.",1680467575,1680467575,False,4,0,0.582013964653015137,0,True,False,False,True,,,

 Primeiramente saiba que a versão de PC deste jogo é o [b]pior port que já vi na vida[/b], ela é totalmente quebrada e se não procurar nenhuma solução externa, jamais vai conseguir passar do começo do jogo ou sequer zerar e fazer 100%.
 A recomendação negativa é relacionada exclusivamente à ela (mas logo abaixo há a minha opinião sobre o jogo em si). Compre apenas em promoções com o preço próximo de uns cinco reais como eu fiz, [i]se querem mesmo jogar, leiam a recomendação a seguir:[/i]

 Use todos os fixes e soluções que estiverem no [b]pcgamingwiki[/b], e não se esqueçam de [u]NÃO fazerem sidequests até o capítulo 9[/u], pois há crashes específicos nesses capítulos que além de poderem corromper seu save, dificilmente tu irá conseguir passar desses pontos. Recomendo portanto [u]usar algum save exatamente após os crashes do chapter 9[/u] (há disponível na aba comunidade do steam posts com saves), ou simplesmente jogar outra versão do jogo.

[hr][/hr]
[b]— Recado dado, agora segue o que achei do jogo sem levar em consideração os problemas exclusivos do port para pc:[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
 [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] se trata de um jogo de aventura em mundo aberto, com elementos de survival horror e foco na narrativa (que é um dos pontos fortes). É um [b]jogo mal feito[/b], com mecânicas ruins que não funcionam (há mecânicas de [i]QTE[/i] por exemplo, que em momentos até tem uma boa aplicação, mas o fato de ter que fazer a lua cheia no analógico para andar nos [i]quick time events[/i], consegue estragar isso), combate fútil, gráficos bem ultrapassados até para época em que lançou e sem polimento nenhum, [u]contudo tem seu valor (mas em outras características)[/u].

 Em todos os aspectos já citados, o jogo é horrível, falha tanto como open world, como falha em ser um survival horror. Os produtores e distribuidores sabiam o que estavam fazendo e o resultado sair como foi é triste.[u] Repleto de problemas técnicos e bugs[/u], Deadly Premonition [u]tenta inovar na forma como sua narrativa é conduzida[/u] em relação a gameplay e cutscenes.


[h1]Estória/Enredo[/h1]
 A estória traz personagens bem desenvolvidos que mesmo os figurantes adicionam um pouco para à mesma. 
Quem prestar bastante atenção no jogo ou fazer várias sidequests, [i]não terá problemas em descobrir quem é o assassino[/i], que torna o tom investigativo do jogo excelente (que é extremamente inspirado em Twin Peaks pelo que li, e enquanto eu não vi Twin Peaks, notei que por outro lado é bem inspirado em X-Files também).
 A divisão por episódios e capítulos, somada as recapitulações à cada episódio, realmente dão a impressão de estar [b]jogando uma série de TV[/b], e isso é trabalhado da melhor forma possível.

[h1]Trilha sonora[/h1]
 A trilha sonora é ótima, todas as músicas das reflexivas até cômicas estão presentes nos momentos certos. As músicas interpretadas pela Carol são sensacionais. É de fato uma OST bem marcante.

[h1]Ambientação[/h1]
 O mundo aberto apesar de ser morto e vazio, consegue passar a sensação de estar numa cidade americana do interior, tanto pelo design caprichado quanto pela rotina dos personagens. Um dos grandes acertos do jogo.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Conclusões[/h1]
 É uma obra extremamente [i]autoral[/i] que faz de fato você relevar muitos dos problemas, por isso [u]vai encontrar muitas pessoas tratando-o como uma obra prima (e em características gerais, NÃO É)[/u]. e isso ocorre porquê [u]às pessoas obviamente tem preferências diferentes para o que mais valorizam num jogo[/u] (explicando a divisão enorme nas reviews que se encontra de Deadly).

  Joguei até o capítulo nove, daí usei um save exatamente após o temido crash para poder continuar. Fiz todas as conquistas da versão de PC, e tudo mais que dá ser feito no jogo (como pegar a carta extra do Swery).
  Lamentavelmente não vejo quase ninguém que não diga que esta é a melhor obra do Swery65, eu realmente gostei de uns aspectos de Deadly Premonition e [u]vi muito potencial (foi meu primeiro jogo do diretor)[/u]. Se você gosta de jogos como Silent Hill 2, possivelmente vai curtir este, mas [b]não espere nada absurdo da gameplay[/b] (muito pelo contrário), os problemas já foram descrevidos.

Есть значит такой анекдот. Приходит жена домой, а муж ей и говорит: «Дорогая, пока тебя не была, я приготовил ужин». И показывает здоровенную кастрюлю. Супруга ясное дело спрашивает: мол, а что это? А супруг ей: «А это борщ, пюре с котлетой, компот и десерт!»
Так вот, игра мне напоминает ту самую кастрюлю, куда накидали всего и сразу без малейшего понятия, как должен выглядеть вкусный и сытный обед. Издали этот кадавр может и способен еще выглядеть завлекательно, но вот употреблять его совершенно невозможно. Тут отвратительно практически все от и до. Куча технических проблем, скажем просто чтобы игра постоянно не висла в одном месте нужно настраивать ее совместимость с Windows XP. Аляповатые картинка и анимации, дубовое управление, кошмарная боевая система и в придачу враги, которые ползают со скоростью черепахи и не представляют особой опасности. При этом в игру напихана масса сомнительных фич вроде необходимости кормить и брить героя или кучи сюрных побочек а-ля какая-нибудь «Якудза». И фичи эти в большинстве своем также реализованы криво и косо, например, тут достаточно обширный мир, но он преимущественно мертвый и пустой.  Кто-то хвалит местный шизофренический сюжет, но лично мне он не показался чем-то выдающимся, да и повлиять на происходящее мы никак ни в силах несмотря на то, что у нас тут вроде как детектив, расследовать и тупить глав герой будет практически без нашего участия в сугубо заскриптованной манере. 
В результате имеем практически неиграбельное нечто и яркий пример того, что если дать некоей сомнительной творческой личности полную свободу, то это не всегда благо, так как эта самая личность может просто ничего толком до ума не доведя свалить все в ту самую одну кастрюлю, перемешать, и получившуюся бурду назвать «авторским виденьем». 
Ну а про вторую часть я вообще молчу. Получив уникальный шанс сделать сиквел коммерчески провального и полузабытого продукта, автор растерял даже немногочисленные сомнительные плюсы вроде того же шизойдного, но в какой-то мере до определенного момента интриговавшего сюжета и окончательно расписался в своей бездарности.

Меня очень привлек мрачный цветокор игры, а также тот факт, что в теории это должен быть хоррор, наполненный символизмом. Насколько я осведомлена, в узких(или не очень) кругах эта игра считается культовым трешем, типа как зеленый слоник от мира кинематографа. И на деле я в этом убедилась: картинка интересная, НО фпс в катсценах 10 стабильно(в самой игре плюс минус норм, но проседает тоже довольно регулярно); ужасная анимация, отвратительный геймплей, боевка тоже треш, хоть и забавно смотреть. Левел дизайн в прологе такое себе. И плюсом ко всему меню выглядит просто кошмарно, вообще ни к селу ни к городу. Сложилось впечатление, что я просто играю в смесь Твин Пикса(отдаленная от городской цивилизации местность, небольшой городок со свежим воздухом и прекрасными видами; играем за агента фбр, приехавшего расследовать убийство девушки, а встречает нас местный шериф и его помощница), Сайлент Хилла(религиозный подтекст, символизм, автомобильная авария в начале из-за выскочившей на дорогу фигуры) и четвёртого Резидента(монстры-жители в деревушке своей неторопливостью напоминают ганадо, плюс местность тоже похожа немного, не говоря уже о криво слизанном геймплее), только троекратно ухудшенную.

В общем и целом, не уверена, хватит ли у меня терпения играть дальше пролога(немного интересно, оправдает себя сюжет или он также плох, как и остальные аспекты), да и в целом я не уверена, что об этой игре думать. Я бы поставила нейтральную оценку, хоть и разочаровалась(ведь я успела скормить себе несколько надежд в духе «наверняка все не так плохо, как говорит аудитория, что-то в этом определенно должно быть»). Однако стим такой возможности не предоставляет. Посему, пока что отзыв отрицательный. Возможно, я когда-нибудь доиграю и изменю своё мнение.

The major problem here is that THIS IS THE WORST PORT EVER MADE. Even with all the community guides, bug fixing and trouble shooting, it is still an unplayable mess that will crash to desktop whenever there is a new cutscene or loading involved. I've spent way too much time with consistent crashes while attempting to fix this game, modifying DPFix.ini, running different compatibility modes, loading other people's save files, etc.

Honestly, I really, really wanted to give this a thumbs-up, a positive review. This must be one of the most interesting and quirky games I've ever played - the characters, the story and the world building are extremely fascinating and intricate. The music and voice acting stand out quite well. However, the gameplay is extremely janky and the controls haven't aged well at all. Regardless, I was committed to putting those aside and just enjoy this weird experience.

After almost 17hrs of trying to get this non-functioning game to work properly, I decide to not frustrate myself any further with this nonsense. I will instead watch this ""Twin Peaks-esque"" story unfold through one of those YouTube videos with compiled cinematics.

Having played the game in a company of friends I can say that: Deadly Premonition[i] is far from a perfect game but it is neither a bad one nor an average one[/i]. Let's start by saying the game has a lot of love put in and is a tribute to the series ""Twin Peaks"" which I really like. The game might not scream AAA and have the best graphics(though it does have one of the best mirrors in video games, lmao), but it's lovely. Cutscene animations might look janky, but lot of effort has been put into them, It gives the feeling like those indie games that use PS1 era style graphics. Storywise the game is good and the plot is full of twists, though it feels a little rushed by the end, but it still feels like it ends just as it should. Characters are also lovable and distinguishable from one another.

Now let's address the elephant in the room: the port to PC. Yes it's bad, but it's manageable, there are fan made patches but it won't save you from all of the [b]crashes[/b] in game. You know what will though? [b]Smoking!(in game of course)[/b] Don't ask me why, it just works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. By the way, drinking game: every time you crash! There are also bugs with the sound, like in my case the looping car skid sound when driving any car which became a running joke in our group throughout the game. And also some music might often stop abruptly and a new one start right after though I dunno if it's a bug. Also, rarely, probably due to high fps the game was running on it would play on super speed to the visuals would play at 1.5x but the audio would play at 1.0x which creates funny distortions with the visuals and the audio. 

And numerous other funny bugs like York's tie going through his chest, many funny bugs :DD

On game mechanics: the keyboard controls are not that bad once you get used to them, but it's far from perfect. And it's not the fault of the port it's most probably the fault of the fighting system in general. That said I didn't hate the fighting in the game, there were some ""how?"" moments but nothing worse than that, but it also doesn't have anything of note to be said about it other than it does have a great shotgun! The map requires better controls and to be able to zoom out of it more since most of the time it feels like reading a fully zoomed in google map with a magnifying glass. Also multiple save slots would help a lot, maybe to revisit previous parts of the game which you missed on. SINCE [b]some of the side-quests become unavailable[/b] as the story progresses, you can though reload a previous chapter, but you will have to fully complete it for the progress to count.

In conclusion I would WANT to recommend this game to anyone but it's hard to recommend a game where only 1 in 10 people have reached the second chapter of it. :DDD

Reseña corta: Juego que tengo entendido estuvo/está muy dividido en criticas. Empezó a gustar a una pequeña parte de la comunidad y ha ganado (desde mi perspectiva) más reconocimiento poco a poco, aunque actualmente siga algo desapercibido al menos en nuestro país.

Lo que más me ha gustado del juego sin duda es sus personajes, su historia y el carisma que rebosa en toda la obra. No he visto Twin Peaks, pero con conocer al menos un poco de que va la cosa (algunos personajes, el pueblo, etc), a simple vista se nota la inspiración. 

La música, aunque repetitiva en la mayoria del juego, me gustó. 

No se muy bien, porqué el final me llegó. Puedo tener una idea, pero no la confirmo. Si alguien lee esto y quiere contestarme si el también sintió algo respecto a las escenas finales, que me lo diga. 

La jugabilidad, puede que sea tosca, pero para mi todo lo demás lo acapara y no lo he notado tanto la verdad. También es cierto, que llevo jugando juegos antiguos un buen tiempo, por lo que puede que me haya acostumbrado poco a poco a ciertos controles jajaja. Y si, no por ser antiguo se debe ser tosco, pero en lineas generales, es asi.

Esperaba más a la hora de buscar secretos por el pueblo (como la posibilidad de espiar a gente), pero tal vez no haya estado en el momento justo para que sucediera x cosa. Y no he investigado del todo (no terminé ||el chantaje al de la gasolinera para que me diera información|| ciertas misiones secundarias.

Ojalá según descubrias cosas, ciertas cosas del juego no sucedieran o sucedieran pero de forma distinta (yo que se, imaginaos, descubris algo antes de tiempo, por lo que podeis cambiar el rumbo de ciertas situaciones). Pero esto ya es algo personal y no una cosa no quita la otra. Este juego para mi es genial.

PD: Como punto muy negativo, es que, aunque en PC me fué mejor que en PS3, en PC a veces me crasheo. Menos mal guardaba cada vez veia un telefono.

- If you don’t clean your suits/change your clothes, you’ll actually start to smell and attract flies.

- You have to eat to manage your hunger.

- You have to sleep to manage your fatigue. This will advance time.

- Cars have to be refueled with gas, and long drives have to be weighed into account.

- side missions are time dependent, and can be entirely missed. This mechanic is similar to “dead rising”.

- The protagonist is actually well written, in a strange but endearing way. Intelligent, but deeply unhinged.

- the combat leaves a lot to be desired, and isn’t worth talking about. The best parts of this game, are the most trivial parts in other games. 

Overall, I think the game design really shines here. I mean, it’s truly unique and innovative. I think if a AAA game was designed like deadly premonition, it’d be a GOTY contender. This isn’t that - the game is really janky and fairly low budget. But the gameplay loop is so immersive and innovative, that it’s still very much worth checking out.

This game is a mess. It's infamous for being very buggy and somewhat cringy. Main pros behind this title might be its story that keeps the game rolling. Very specific atmosphere that remind of Resident Evil series, but with more focus put on dialogs and investigation part. However not much investigation is here except go here and there, check what's going on, occassionaly finding some items. Map in the game is semi open so you can access different places at a different time. Gameplay consists of driving a car, dialogs and a bit of shooting. Music and sounds however are well fit and create mysterious atmosphere also the voice acting is decent. If you can withstand frequent frame drops, constant bugs and heavy bloom effects you might enjoy it. Hardly to recommend but at least it's unique. I must say the game was kinda interesting to play.

Avevo provato letteralmente DI TUTTO ma nulla, il gioco non voleva proprio partire dopo il launcher iniziale.
Ho seguito una guida qui su steam comprensiva di tutti i fix raccolti negli anni (una relativamente più recente, del 2016, dato che la guida omnicomprensiva del 2013 per me non aveva funzionato).
Il problema, per me su Win11, era che, oltre ad aggiornare/riparare PhyX come detto in tutte le guide, ho dovuto manualmente inserire nella root della cartella di gioco i .dll di PhyX ""common"", presi dalla cartella Nvidia.
Spero che questo ti faccia risparmiare qualche ora di ricerca e più o meno velate imprecazioni alla dea dei boschi che sono scappate a me durante il procedimento.

Existem alguns patchs que podem aliviar um pouco o estresse mas nada gritante. 

O que vou escrever aqui foi a experiência que tive jogando a versão e switch.

Deadly premonition é uns dos jogos mais exóticos que já vi, bebendo muito da série Twin peaks o jogo  ""pra mim"" conseguiu superar até a série. Vc controla Francis York Morgan que vai investigar um assassinato em uma cidade rural nos Estados Unidos, e com base sua investigação progride as coisas vão ficando mais estranhas . 
O protagonista é muito complexo e carismático,  a dinâmica com os personagens ao seu redor são hilárias  e rendem muitos momentos bizarros, mas ele esconde um lado sério e misterioso.  
Podemos dividir  jogo em 2 partes, a do mundo aberto onde podemos fazer quests dos moradores da cidade e as partes de investigação onde vc entra no modo ""Deadly Premonition"", que vc enfrenta umas assombrações ao estilo resident evil 4 ""só que piorado"".
A ambiente  da cidade é até ok, é bem baseados em cidades rurais dos Estados Unidos, o que complica é a dirigibilidade dos carros, totalmente tosca e sem falar  q tem alguns momentos que o carro buga do nada. A exploração do mapa pra mim faltou um modo de marcar um ponto no GPS, é muito fácil se perder no começo ou até msm para realizar as quests.
Os moradores da cidade são estereótipos de filmes americanos mas eles tem uma profundidade  e são bem escritos conforme vc vai  conversando e fazendo quests deles.
De longe  para mim o  maior ponto positivo é a trama, ela é sensacional! Consegue te passar a vibe que vc esta tentando solucionar um caso de um serial killer. Alias, o jogo tem muito sinais sutis que meio vai mostrando pra vc quem é o verdadeiro culpado antes de vc terminar a história, mas vc só pega quando explora o mapa ou segue algumas rotinas de NPCs e isso eu achei FOD@ para c@ralho. 
A Trilha tbm é uns dos pontos fortes, tem trilha para todo tipo de situação e algumas fica pregados na sua cabeça. E msm a expressão facial dos personagens sendo robótica a trilha consegue transmitir muito o sentimento deles, principalmente em momentos tristes.
Enfim se eu recomendo o jogo ? se procura uma gameplay que foge do padrão do mercado então SIM ... nem todo mundo vai ter paciência para joga-lo, ele é um jogo cheio de problemas técnicos, mas é umas das experiências mais únicas que já vi em um game. Na minha experiência conforme eu fui jogando e fui me importando mais com aquele mundo  e com os personagens, e confesso que até derramei algumas lagrimas no final.

[h1]Вступление[/h1]
-Deadly Premonition сложно описать в двух словах. Эта игра очень умело сочетает в себе одновременно и серьезный триллер-детектив, и самый что ни наесть ядрёно-угарный трэш. Лично меня игра этим и притянула к себе, несмотря на очень посредственную графику и геймплей. В самой игре было что-то такое, что приковывало внимание и обещало быть не скучным. И должен признаться, моё чутьё меня не подвело. Но давайте разбираться по порядку.

[h1]Оптимизация[/h1]
-Начнём, в первую очередь, с того с чем столкнётся любой игрок на ПК. Игра плохо оптимизирована. И я имею ввиду ОЧЕНЬ ПЛОХО оптимизирована. Первые часа 3-4 я только и встречал: стабильные вылеты, странные баги со звуком, непонятные дропы фпс, кривоватости местного управления и плюс ко всему графика времён 2й PlayStation в разрешении 720p. 
-Для более-менее комфортной игры мне пришлось перерыть кучу форумов, установить программы, о существовании которых я вообще не знал, перелопатить exe-шник игры, поставить фиксы на графику, чтобы хоть как-то улучшить картинку и перевести игру в “безрамочный” режим, не то стабильные вылеты обеспечены. Но даже после всего этого я боялся, что весь мой карточный домик из фиксов может развалится в любую секунду. 
-Говоря вкратце, игра сама не даёт поиграть в неё нормально. И я понимаю тех людей, которые отказываются играть именно из-за кривой оптимизации. Поэтому прежде, чем играть пройдитесь по руководствам или зайдите на PCGamingWiki и посмотрите с чем вам предстоит иметь дело, чтобы потом не жаловаться.

[h1]Геймплей разделён на 2 части:[/h1]
[u]Resident Evil Style:[/u] здесь мы ходим по потусторонним коридорам, напоминающим Silent Hill, отстреливаем зомбарей и решаем загадки. Иногда на сцену выходит главный злодей в плаще и заставляет нас по скрипту либо убегать от него(тогда экран разделяется на 2 части и фпс падает до 10-15), либо же прятаться как пусичка в шкафу, изредка задерживая дыхание, не то найдёт!
-Ни одна из этих концепций не выполнена так как следует. Стрельба не чувствуется, загадки наипростейшие, погони кривые и неуклюжие, а там где должно быть страшно, не страшно - от слова совсем. К чести игры скажу, что таких сегментов здесь не совсем уж много, но за всю игру их хватает чтобы надоесть. 
-Однако есть здесь и такая штука как “Профилирование”. С помощью трех-четырех улик наш агент Йорк может определить, что произошло на месте преступления и сделать соответствующий вывод. Фишка прикольная. Но проблема в том что, чтобы найти все улики надо пройти локацию от начала до конца. А она может сопровождаться всем тем, что было перечислено выше.

[u]Yakuza Style:[/u] эта часть геймплея мне понравилась. Здесь мы катаемся по городу, слушаем диалоги между персонажами, выполняем доп. квесты и знакомимся с миром игры. 
-Мир у игры не очень большой, но зато неплохо продуман, у каждого из основных персонажей есть свой распорядок дня, их можно встретить разъезжая по городу или закупаясь в магазинах. Благодаря подобным сценкам чувствуется что мир у этой игры хоть и небольшой, но всё же живой. 
-Доп. квесты тоже работают на погружение. С помощь них мы узнаём многое о городке и персонажах, однако и здесь есть свои нюансы. Квесты можно брать и выполнять только в определённые главы игры, коих здесь 26 штук. Так, например взяв несколько квестов в начале, я благополучно их провалил, потому что прошёл несколько глав и время выполнения закончилось. Но, с другой стороны, теперь есть стимул пройти игру еще раз. :)

[h1]Атмосфера[/h1]
-В игре прекрасная атмосфера американского пригорода. Несмотря на, мягко говоря, ""невыдающуюся"" графику у игры очень неплохой дизайн локаций и интерьеров. Видно, что разработчики старались сделать локации максимально правдоподобными. О чём свидетельствует бонусный материал, который открывается после прохождения игры. В нём куча фотографий с мест, в которых побывали разработчики, вдохновляясь американскими глубинками.

[h1]Звук и Музыка[/h1]
-Ещё одной интересной-странной стороной этой игры является саунд-дизайн. Например, в начале игры, прям в прологе, агент Йорк съезжает с дороги и чуть не наезжает на двух белочек, которые (клянусь, я не курил траву!) кричат как две мартышки. Чтобы убедится, что я не сошёл с ума я полез пересматривать эту сцену на YouTube и слава богу с умом у меня пока всё в порядке. Такие моменты встречаются, но в целом не критично, иногда даже забавно.
-С музыкой дела обстоят похожим образом. Есть отличные треки, которые идеально вписываются под местную атмосферу. Например, в меню звучит отличный трек. Но есть и моменты, когда музыка вообще не вписывалась в то, что я видел на экране. Представьте себе ужасающую картину: место преступления, вокруг: кровь, кишки, всё как полагается. И тут на сцену выходит пёс и нам включают мелодию которая вообще не вписывается в выше описанный контекст. Зачем? Не понятно!
-И именно в такие моменты игра кажется странной. С одной стороны, очень серьёзная сцена над которой разработчики отлично поработали и смогли вызвать определённые эмоции, а с другой ощущение такое, что они вообще не знают, что делают. И все те сильные эмоции которые разработчики старались вызвать - бесследно исчезают.

[h1]Сюжет[/h1]
-То, ради чего стоит играть и терпеть всё что я описал выше. Вообще говорить о сюжете и при этом ничего не заспойлерить – очень сложно. Поначалу он может казаться скучноватым и нудным, но зато под конец вас ждёт просто лютейшая бомбардировка из твистов, от которых ваша челюсть будет стабильно падать на пол. Насколько сильно она будет падать, зависит от того насколько сильно вам полюбилась эта игра. Мне она ближе к середине начала нравиться, поэтому в конце я и грустил, и смеялся, и истерично офигевал буквально каждые 10 минут, за что игре – огромаднейшее спасибо. Серьёзно, таких эмоций мне ни одна AAA игра не дарила.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
-Читая мой обзор может показаться, что в игре больше минусов чем плюсов, хотя плашка моего обзора почему-то показывает палец вверх. Но я не буду врать, игра действительно подойдет далеко не каждому. Но как же понять подойдёт ли она вам и при этом не тратить много времени? Очень просто. Посмотрите на YouTube пролог этой игры. И если после всего увиденного у вас пробудился интерес (как это было у меня), то можете смело пробовать. Только будьте при этом готовы к борьбе с технической частью игры, особенно поначалу. Но зато в конце игры вас ждёт “Top Quality Content” который оправдает все ваши страдания, верно Зак?",1668209306,1674351518,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

It's with a heavy heart that I cannot recommend this game because I really liked the story. But the constant crashes, no attempt to even have M+K, locked at 720p (unless you get a fan tweak) , and constant freezes there is no way I can recommend anyone pay any money for this. I got it for 2 bucks and I almost feel ripped off.  There was also a REALLY annoying bug where the left analog stick just quit responding and I had to reboot my computer to fix it. This happened EVERY time I played the game so if I had not come off a fresh reboot, I had to reboot the PC before launching the game. But even if the game ran perfectly on the PC, I do have other complaints about the game design.

1) This game seriously needed an editor. Some of the boring walking sequences went on for WAY too long. The car tail scene was obnoxiously long compounded by the godawful driving mechanics. I don't mind quick time events when used sparingly but if you are going to use them, don't have them go on forever FFS. That final sequence at the end where you are running down the stairs and you have to hit left and right on the analog stick for your character to run was so GD long I had to pause the game twice so my hand wouldn't cramp up. A lot of this stuff, obnoxious as it is, can be palatable in smaller portions. I guess they thought the runtime needed padding. It didn't. 

2) The game play was clearly phoned in. Maybe they ran out of time during development? but the shooting/aiming mechanics and repetitive enemies got old real quick. When you had to evade an attack, even if you evaded way too early it will still miss you. I get it was just the sloppy QTE implementation but it looked so damn goofy when York would roll to dodge an attack and the attack would come after he completed his dodge and still miss him. 

3) I know this seems to be a staple of Japanese games but I find it quite annoying when they refuse to VA lines that are not part of a cut scene. I seen them do this in the Yakuza games as well. I don't know if they are trying to save money on actors and if so quit being chinsey, you cheap fks. Especially a shame in this game because the voice acting was pretty damn good. 

In a time where 5 year old games are being re-made that have no business being remade, this one is a perfect candidate for it. The RE team at Capcom would be a nice choice. They could improve on the godawful game play mechanics and maybe spice up the puzzles a bit as they were pretty lame.  I actually really like the story and as flawed as a lot of the game design and mechanics are, I would recommend this game on PC if it weren't for the game breaking bugs.  Although I would be thrilled for more people to enjoy its quirky story and characters which has an obvious heavy influence from Twin Peaks, including the setting,  at this point you would be better off watching it on you tube.

First, you have to install a few fixes through mods (there are plenty of guides in the Steam Community).
Then, despite the fact playing with a controller is much better, the game will not recognize your controller. 
So you have to install community gamepad configs.
Even then, the game needs to be run as administrator or it won't work.
But then, the toolbox and inventory are very broken and you can't move items properly. So you have to run in compatibility mode (Win XP SP3) too.
And also it's a headache to run on fullscreen so I just play in windowed mode.
And, after all those tweaks, you may have to download some saved games because the game is known to have game-breaking bugs in at least two chapters.

The movement is janky, the graphics aren't very impressive for today's standards.
But.... I believe it's.... worth it?

Remember Twin Peaks? Everybody says this game is like Twin Peaks. Well, they are partially right. York could be a psychotic, socially awkward version of Cooper, cringeworthy in all his quirkyness, comparable to a high-school fanfic writer idea of an anti hero. Character reactions are stiff and weird (intentional or not, I have no idea), like Lynch's work turned up to eleven. The jankiness makes everything even more uncomfortable. It's a unusual case of ""storytelling so bad it's amazing"".

So, like, do you want to be weirded out? Do you believe an interesting game is worth more than a merely ""good"" game? Are you extremely patient?

Still, the game is interesting because of how bizarre it is, but the terrible gameplay doesn't do it any favours.

The whistling main theme is excellent, and it compliments the bizarre tone. That is one of the most memorable aspects of this game.

For all the many games I've played, this stands out as oddly unique, with as much emphasis on the ""oddly"" as the ""unique"" part. 

Make no mistake though, if you decide to play this, go into it with the foreknowledge that it is an absolute technical mess. Even getting the game booted up can be an upheaval. I've crashed going from cut-scene to cut-scene. Early game my save file corrupted forcing me to use a save from elsewhere and making sure I backed my saves up manually frequently. I encountered numerous graphical bugs that took me a significant amount of time to believe I'd worked out what the problem was, only for it to still happen sporadically after taking avoiding actions. If there is a technical issue you can perceive, chances are DP has it and then some. 

Yet, the game is playable. It takes work, frustration and some trial and error, but at some point I just found myself laughing it off. Of course this quirky, charming, bizarre, baffling game would have this many issues. Of course it would. Is it worth it in the end? Probably. I'm not sure! The mechanics in-game are typically serviceable, but by the end they became second nature. The game needs to be taken as greater than the sum of its parts because realistically, many of the parts are not worth a thing. It comes together though in a kind of beautiful mess. 

This is a game where despite the abundance of characters they each stand out with their own personalities. Sure, the comparisons to Twin Peaks are numerous and essentially justified, but it stands on its own rather than simply in homage or reference to anything else. These characters make the world real because whilst they could easily be one-note, they can express other thoughts and feelings. I found myself invested in the stories of all these people because they made the town you're in immersive. 

The game's greatest strength is its writing. It's smarter than you may give it credit for. It's also hard to tell if it's winking at you when it's being funny, especially when it isn't supposed to be...you think, at least. When it wants to be tragic it manages it with few, if any, goofs undercutting the scene. It made me smile, gasp a couple of times, it really has it all. By the end, as much as I wanted to go back and complete side-quests I'd missed, I couldn't bring myself to do so. The story ends so conclusively that I was left wholly satisfied as to my experience with it. Will I play it again? I don't know! It's a hassle to play, with as much time spent in-game as out trying to find a fix for something or other, but the notion of spending more time in the world is alluring.

Deadly Premonition is a baffling game. The ambition and sincerity of the creators screams at you as loudly as the many shortfalls that surround this, but I honestly enjoyed my time with it warts and all. I don't think I'll be forgetting it in a hurry and that's not something I can say about many of the games I've played.",1665087252,1665087252,True,8,0,0.637084901332855225,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Welcome to Greenvale, Agent York. ""Deadly Premonition"" is a third-person, police-theme investigation oriented open world adventure game... You might have noticed all the genres it is classified within with a look at the game's shop interface, and you'd be aware by now that when a game claims that it does too many things all at once it just ultimately means that it's crap in all of them.  

You play as Agent York Francis, who works for the FBI and gets called to investigate a murder of a young woman in Greenvale, a secluded small village with close-minded townfolk. Right off the bat, you realize, as the player, that York isn't quite right in the head... Throughout the game, he's rumored to be a top-notch agent with so many solved cases to his name, yet he keeps mentioning and talking to this imaginary friend of his that he calls Zach. The game puts you in front of two mysteries; who killed Anna? And who the HECK is Zach?

On one hand, the game excels at being a Twin Peaks reference... The cast of characters are goofy and just spot-on, some gameplay mechanics are quite appealing, you can drive around town, meet new townfolk, do side missions for them to further the investigation, gather collectible cards, play throw darts, get a paintjob... Honestly, it's more than ""L.A Noire"", for example, could ever hope to accomplish. The voice-acting is quite nice and the nods to other movies and games don't seem forced at all... And although you kind of realize who the killer is right at the start, the mystery of the Raincoat killer is still present as York travels between the real world and an imaginary world that only exists in his own delusional mind. ""To profile a killer, I have to inject myself into their mindset, their thinking process and even their shoes... somehow"".

On the other hand!! OH MY GOD, I've BEEN RETRYING EPISODE 2 TO GET TWO CARDS FOR LIKE 7 TIMES AND EVERYTIME I REPLAY IT THERE'S A GLITCH THAT FORCES ME OUT OF THE GAME AND FORCES ME TO REPEAT CHAPTER 2 AGAIN... Holy cow, this game is buggy as hell! It's out there with the buggiest games of all time... In terms of bugs and glitches, think of it as ""Assassin's Creed Unity"" but ON FREAKING ROIDS... That's right! 1/8 times when you get into the menu, maybe York is hungry you want to eat a snack, the game crashes.... 2/4 times when you actually manage to get into the inventory, you'd experience the inventory bug that locks you in the inventory and you can't quit the interface... 3/6 times your car will get stuck and when you decide to leave it you fall into the map, which coincidentally takes you to Gamer Hell haha! 3/6 times when you're at the bar and look backwards, you'll get stuck!! People around you and the time will continue to move, but you can't... That's of course without mentioning the fact that the game runs at 10 fps if you've been running your PC for too long, and it forces you into a resolution you don't want, AND it forces you to use WASD for movement. 

The game is an actual mess; everything is completely and utterly wrong yet people will tell you that it's one of the best games they've ever played... It is simply because people love ""Twin Peaks"", and I'm one of those that would argue that this is a great game! To me, anything this goofy is worthy of praise despite its shortcomings. I'll give this game a score of [b]7/10[/b]... Its characters are very likeable, and York's cringe gives you motivation to solve this murder case with Zach's help. I recommend it to anyone willing to look past the glitches.

The game looks like garbage, the gunplay is awful, the driving is physics-defying, and it's become one of my favourite games of all time. It's an incredibly bizarre journey through a seemingly ordinary murder investigation in the spirit of Twin Peaks that quickly takes a turn for the paranormal.[/h1]
On a technical note this port is a mess. It's incredibly unstable and the controls are awful if you're not using a controller and the game even required for me to install an external fix for it to even run. You should attempt to purchase this game on either Xbox or the Switch if possible. Consider this a review of the game's contents rather than its technical implementation.

The absolute highlight of the game has to be its characters. Everyone in the main cast is full of personality and the interactions between them are a joy to watch. Most of the side characters also fill these qualities, though not all of them. The main character, FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, everyone just calls him York, is the glue that holds these character interactions together. His dry humour and delivery, and his tendency to bleed obscure pop-culture knowledge into most conversations makes him a main character that's never boring to listen to and that’s never short on words.

The other big plus for the game is its story, which can at times feel nonsensical or even like a fever dream. The game definitely has some pacing issues with the story and feels quite rushed near the end, versus being very thin on actual content during the middle section. Ultimately though I found the story to be great fun and it managed to keep me interested in it for the entirety its time. The game takes place in rural America and follows the latest murder investigation in a series of murders across the States. From there the game incorporates the supernatural, detective work, slice of life, and a myriad of other aspects into the story.

The game also has a good soundtrack with a wide array of music for different occasions, and they are used liberally. This combined with the game's tendency to switch from suspension and surrealism to comedy or action multiple times during a single cutscene, unsurprisingly makes for some serious tonal whiplash in most cases where this happens.

If you're looking for a game with satisfying gameplay, rewarding side quests or impressive graphical fidelity, you're better off looking elsewhere. If on the other hand you're looking for a game in which the characters are charming and voice-acted fantastically, writing that will you make you laugh or maybe even shed a tear or two, and a story that is intriguing and full of mystery all the way from the beginning to the end, then Deadly Premonition is well worth your time.

I would urge anyone reading this to buy literally any of the other versions if you want to experience the game without much hassle. But, if you insist on playing this version, later on in this review I'll describe what the setup that allowed me to 100% this game was.

I went in with what everyone has been saying about this game in mind: ""low budget Twin Peaks"". And even if that description is, though simplistic, accurate, Deadly Premonition has a lot more going on that instantly charmed me and made me endure the awfulness of the PC version. 

I adore games with detailed worlds to explore and interact with; DP tries it's best to do that, and while not all of the resulting material is necessarily of good quality, it is that jankiness, perhaps involuntary, that made me absolutely adore Greenvale, it's inhabitants, and the story that unfolded there. The story is very entertaining to follow, and it certainly succeeded in drawing me in and eventually leading me to 100% the game. Of course, it is far from perfect, and it's shortcomings can be evident. I found it quite funny that the disconnect between what the script was trying to describe and how it actually looked rendered on screen was massive...certainly you don't need ultra realistic graphics to get a scene across, but when what you're offered are oversaturated PS2-like graphics with character models sporting incredibly awkward body and facial animations, some of the credibility is lost. Still, that's something I found oddly enticing, but perhaps for the wrong reasons. The story touches on a lot of interesting themes and tries to depict them in a serious way, and once again, sometimes it succeeds, and sometimes it fails.

Funnily enough, the game part itself is the thing I enjoyed the least about DP. Gameplay wise, the game tries to balance being realistic while still being very game-like. Not sure what the developer's were trying to accomplish here, but the end result can be very tiring at times, as it is stuck in the middle ground between both. 

I would've loved for the investigation portion to be like proper investigation, as in, going around, gathering clues, questioning people, and you having to put all the pieces together. The way it actually plays is very scripted, mostly taking the point A to point B approach where there is little for you to actually do. On the first chapters of the game, you'll spend a lot of time driving around, going from here to there, and while it can be great to know how to move around the town, it will soon become a boring endeavor. Getting the item that allows you to teleport around is essential, but even then you still have to go to all of those places first so they register. You also have a sleep and a hunger meter, which, given how the rest of the game plays, feels like it only gets in the way, unfortunately. The third person shooter segments are not very fun and this isn't helped at all by the slipperiest aim controls I've tried in a game yet. This makes those portions hard at times, not so much because the game is difficult on its own. 

As for the rest of the game, the audiovisual presentation is certainly a strong point for me, Yes, I know I complained about it just a moment ago but, when it's not embarrassing itself, it really accomplishes the task of setting the mood and portraying a lot of the imagery required for the narrative in a very competent way. I feel like the jankiness enhances some of the moments of the story, as I can only imagine disaster if more realistic graphics were paired with some of the less serious scenes of the story. I think it will click instantly with some people, but others will simply see the result of a low budget. 

All in all, it is an experience that I enjoyed a lot from beginning to end, though it is certainly not for everyone, and specially not this version. Though flawed, the portrayal of a small American town seen through the eyes of a movie crazy japanese game director is certainly one of the most unique I've had the pleasure to experience, and I'd recommend everyone feeling intrigued by the game's concept to give it a try. 

If you do decide to try this PC port, here's what I did to minimize crashes and make the game as playable as possible:

-Install all the files listed on the ""Essential Improvements"" section in the PCGamingWiki article for the game. DPfix is basically obligatory. I also recommend installing SweetFX to make the game easy on your eyes. Also obligatory is to modify the game's executable to skip the intro logos, given how often the game can crash. That is also listed on the PCGW article.
-Patch the game's executable using NTCore's 4GB patch. 
-Use borderless or true windowed mode. This can be set in the DPFix config file, and it should be pretty self explanatory.
-Set both the launcher and the game's main executable to run as admin and in Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatibility mode. Unfortunately this has the side effect of making aiming weird. Removing the compatibility setting reverses this, but you'd be loosing some stability, though crashes were rare with the rest of the fixes I've listed before. 
-Save as often as you can and backup your save regularly. A lot of people talk about save corruption issues, and while I certainly never experienced it, why risk it? Saving often helps to avoid loosing too much progress to crashes.
-Disable Steam overlay in game

[i]В этом сером и сыром городе ни у кого нет права на счастье. Так подумает любой пронёсшийся по пустынной дороге мимо вывески с блеклым приветствием. Из внутреннего кармана пиджака показывается красная пачка с крепкими сигаретами. Мгновенье спустя легкий дымок начинает подниматься от рук и растворяться в салоне автомобиля. Сквозь лобовое стекло практически ничего не видно. Дождь всё усиливается. Этот город, словно издеваясь, манит к себе несбыточным счастьем, но в то же время растаптывает все надежды своей безразличной пустотой. Но я знаю, глубоко внутри него есть... нет, должен быть искрящийся луч надежды...[/i][hr][/hr]
• А теперь, после лирического отступление переходим к делу. Эта игра заставит вас следить за своим сюжетом! Я буду банален, и напишу, что вдохновением был сериал [b]""Твин Пикс""[/b]. Если вы с ним знакомы, то сможете ""нормально"" воспринимать происходящее и некоторые моменты уже не смогут удивить так сильно как должны. У нас тут маленький городок, в котором происходит убийство. Но оно не совсем обычное, а скорее похоже на жертвоприношение. Ко всему прочему, у жертвы отрезан язык и весь рот забит... впрочем узнаете сами. Ну а дальше вам придется разобраться, кто говорит правду, а кто лжёт. И кто жё всё-таки убил [strike][b]Лору Палмер[/b][/strike] [b]Анну Грэм[/b]. Но помимо [b]""Твин Пикс""[/b] есть ещё одна картина, которая зеркалит добрый кусок основного сюжета. Называть я её конечно не буду. Но если вы её смотрели, то ближе к концу будут флешбеки.

• Лично для себя я разделил игру на три больших сюжетных слоя. Это само расследование убийства, это разговоры главного героя с кем-то и рассказ истории для маленькой девочки. К концу игры все линии переплетутся и закроют все сюжетные вопросы. Самое интересное в детективных историях, это создание своих предположений по поводу убийцы, и дальнейшее разрушение теорий. Словно карточные домики на ветру будут разлетаться ваши догадки. Сценарист этой истории серьёзно подошел к делу и основной сюжет это самый весомый аргумент пройти игру. В то же время, выполнение побочных заданий при первом прохождении сродни кощунству. Основная цепочка так выстроена, что не хочется ломать всю детективную атмосферу помогая бабулькам и ища кости в подворотнях.

• Стоит отметить и главного героя. Он своеобразен, у него свои заскоки и он боготворит кофе (как и главный герой сами знаете откуда). А ещё он видит мир ""по своему"". На самом деле всё что он видит реально или это его внутренние демоны?! Узнаете проходя игру.

• Ну а теперь к плохому. Даже очень плохому. Игра это порт с PS3. Очень, [b]ОЧЕНЬ кривой порт[/b]. У многих даже после первой заставки игра вылетает. На помощь приходят руководства, патчи и советы. Я с горем пополам смог осилить эту кривизну прочитав при этом кучу форумов. В 9 главе игра просто не загружалась, пришлось искать чужие сейвы. Как оказалась я не один у кого игра ломала файлы сохранений в том месте. Так же вам придётся играться с совместимостью. Если у вас не опускается или поднимается прицел оружия, то ставьте совместимость с Win 7/8. Иначе последняя глава покажется сущим адом. Зная насколько кривой порт меня ждёт, я решил посчитать все вылеты игры. В итоге их 21! Так что подумайте стоить ли игра того.

• Ещё из минусов это ужасное [b]QTE[/b]. После неправильного нажатия кнопки готовьтесь к загрузке и началу всего события с нуля. Так же не грех будет назвать игру симулятором загрузок. После каждой маленькой катсцены, после любого разговора вас будет ждать либо черный экран, либо полноценная загрузка уровня. А ещё тут огромное количество дверей, каждую из которых герой будет открывать отдельной анимацией. Прям старые Resident Evil'ы. Помимо этого на всех уровнях будут разбросаны медальки, которые приносят доп. деньги, но при этом выглядят абсурдно и ломают нарратив. Про картинку особо сказать нечего. Игра старая, и менять все текстуры разработчики не захотели. Так что стены в мыле. Ну и музыка, скудная по количеству, но не по качеству. Композиции запоминаются и создают нужную атмосферу в определенных моментах игры. Хоть и не всегда.

Uno de los peores port que he visto en mi vida desde que juego en pc.

El juego? Entretenido, random, y curioso cuanto menos, pero no lo recomiendo porque los devs se han preocupado poco casi nada en hacer el port, por suerte compre esta mierda en oferta estando casi regalada.

- Configuración de controles hecha por y para subnormales.
- Optimizacion como tal no existe, en algunas zonas los fps se van a la mierda por mas que cumplas con los requisitos recomendados.
- A partir del EP 2 capitulo 9 el juego comienza a tener crasheos antes, durante y después de las cinematicas... y aviso para quien no sepa que no hay guardado desde el menú, solo se puede desde los telefonos, y que tampoco es que los veras cada 2 pasos. Hay solución para esto? 
a) Al poner los exe del juego con compatibilidad con w98 no me ha vuelto a crashear, pero el juego como máximo me iba a 30 fps. Y por lo visto y leído no le funciona a todos.
b) Supuestamente hay un parche de la comunidad super milagroso que... mis huevos, con parche el juego se crashea igual.",1660590983,1660590983,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You need to know what you’re buying; this game is Deadly premonition a cult classic from 2009 (I assume), a 2013 port to PC.
But this port, the Steam port is very flawed, you crash in the middle of the game and corrupts your save file so this product alone is unplayable to a certain extent and not worth it’s price of 24,99 USD.

Fortunately, you can actually play this game to its entirety and it will test your patience and you will have to save every time you can because the game crashes in unpredictable moments.
You will require 3 things to play this game, a fix, patience and a save file that isn’t corrupted. 
The fix: https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/896-dpfix095zip/
I won’t give you a save file, but you can find one online.

The actual game, the gameplay is okay, nothing too complex nothing too impressive for a dated game, I played it on mouse and keyboard.
The story is the only reason I bought this game, I never saw anyone beat it on youtube, it’s enjoyable an original and interest concept for an idea.
The game really tricks you a lot of time, and before you think anything, this is more of a drama comedy game than a horror one since it’s very cheesy.

Очень сложно написать на эту нормально обзор,потому что она крайне противоречива и уникальна.Буквально на каждый плюс находиться сразу же минус,но при этом ты обожаешь эту игру,и готов ей простить все минусы.Поэтому я постараюсь вкратце рассказать свои впечатления.

Из положительного хочется выделить прекрасную атмосферу - она жуткая,загадочная и при этом умиротворяющая.Интересный сюжет,который находится на грани провала,но при этом умудряется заинтересовать,завлечь и все это подается неплохим юмором.Неплохие персонажи,которые хорошо прописаны и они интересны - особенно главный герой.Мне понравилась стрельба в этой игре,да,я знаю,что она корявая и убогая,но мне нравилось истреблять врагов.

Их негатива хочется выделить особо оптимизацию,кривое управление,как героем ,так и автомобилем,пустой и бесполезный открытый мир,тупые побочные задания,безумную затянутость происходящего.Оптимизация в игре очень плохая,а именно:игра любит вылетать просто так,еще вылетает в определенный момент(у меня это когда я входил в комнаты).Вдобавок у игры нет настроек графики и разрешения экрана,так что придется скачивать файл,чтобы настроить.Управление тоже не самое приятное,к управлению героем еще как-то можно привыкнуть,но вот автомобилем нет - как будто управляешь спорткаром и при этом пикапом одновременно,описать это сложно,но я думаю вы поняли мою мысль.Открытый мир абсолютно бесполезен,потому что в нем ничего не происходит,пустой город,в котором крайне редко ездят автомобили,и ездить вы будете по нему часто,потому что так задумано по сюжету.Побочные задания хоть и проходятся быстро,но они абсолютно бесполезные,они не раскроют персонажа и не расскажут историю города,просто получите ачивку и все.Игра проходится за 17-20 часов спокойно,но не забывайте про вылеты,так что спокойно можете докидывать еще 2-3 часа.Игра затянута искусственно,большая часть времени - это просто езда на машине от точки к точке,и так на протяжении всей игры.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
Уникальный проект,который выходит крайне редко.Несмотря на минусы - это отличный проект,который,увы,загублен своим же создателем,который не смог сделать нормальную оптимизацию.Если вы решитесь поиграть в нее и не удалите после пары вылетов,то эта игра подарит вам незабываемые эмоции.

Bien sûr, j'ai rencontré quelques bugs qui ont ralenti ma progression, y compris un véhicule braquant et crissant continuellement.

Hélas, je ne peux désormais plus aller plus loin, car sans aucune modification de ma part, le joystick de ma manette XBOX refuse à présent de fonctionner : ou plutôt celui-ci fonctionne dans les menus, mais mon personnage n'avance plus, pivotant sur lui-même à la manière d'un ""tank control"".

Les rares solutions proposées sur le net ne semblent pas fonctionner. Je pourrais tenter de paramétrer la manette avec un logiciel tiers attribuant les touches du clavier, mais alors je perdrais les indications visuelles des boutons, sans compter une avancée du personnage entre le robot et l'ivrogne.

De guerre lasse, je choisis de désinstaller le logiciel qui ne m'aura pas du tout donné envie de tenter la suite, étant donné que les retours sur l'aspect technique semblent à peu près semblables... Le département ""debugging"" devrait avoir honte de son travail.

C'est dommage, et comme la version Switch est apparemment également sujette à des crashs, je pense que je me renseignerai sur l'intrigue via une vidéo en ligne.

[/h1]

Я давно хотел ознакомиться с этой игрой, еще когда лазил по магазину Xbox Live Store в поисках интересных игр и по возможности скачать демку. Скриншоты очень интриговали, очень хотелось поиграть, да вот только ни демки нет, ни как купить не знал (мелкий слишком был для такого). Теперь на дворе 2022 год, и я прошел игру на ПК, перед прохождением имея представление, что меня будет ожидать плохой порт, НО НЕ НА СТОЛЬКО ЖЕ ПЛОХОЙ!

Игру я рекомендую к прохождению - не смотря на просто отвратные анимации (как тел, так и лиц, туда же и хреновый липсинк), одну из самых худших физик машин, с которыми мне приходилось сталкиваться, [b] очень длинные [/b] расстояния между локациями и многие другие агрехи - игра офигенная. Много контента и активностей, классный сюжет, захватывающий и не отпускающий до самого конца, юмор, эмоции и черти что еще - просто классно! Если нравятся детективные истории с примесью паранормальщины (стоит еще учесть, что она тут тоже своеобразная, игру японцы делали как-никак), и хотите, чтоб вы прям ахнули, то очень рекомендую к прохождению.

[h1] НО ОГРОМНОЕ ""НО""! ПК-ВЕРСИЮ ПРОХОДИТЬ ТОЛЬКО НА СВОЙ СТРАХ И РИСК![/h1]

Игре почти 10 лет на данный момент, но ее не патчили с НОЯБРЯ 2013 ГОДА! ВОТ ВЫ СЕРЬЕЗНО?! ПОРТ ВООБЩЕ, КАЖЕТСЯ, НЕ ТЕСТИЛИ! 
Стоит запустить игру, так проблемы сразу встречают - когда пререндеренные заставки идут отлично, сама игра люто лагает. Почитал руководства, решается путем включения режима совместимости с Windows XP и установкой на лаунчер галочки, чтоб всегда запускался только от имени администратора - и это сработало, однако вызвало другую проблему...

Камера прицеливания в режиме совместимости с XP [b] очень [/b] ограниченная, ты не можешь прицелиться выше твоей головы или взглянуть на пол (как во всех нормальных играх с механикой стрельбы от третьего лица). Я думал, что так и задумано разработчиками и прошел так больше половины игры, все сильнее и сильнее понимая, что что-то тут не так... В итоге в определенный момент у меня совсем кончилось терпения, ибо это совершенно отвратно. Вновь взглянул на руководства - пишут, что нужно включить совместимость с Windows 98, да вот только с ней у меня вновь фпс уходит в ноль. Писали также, что помогает перезагрузка, но я до последнего не верил в это. Я игру-то иногда сразу запускал после включения компьютера, считай, и так перезагружен... И знаете что? ПЕРЕЗАГРУЗКА ПРОСТО БЛЯТЬ МАГИЧЕСКИЙ БУБЕН КАКОЙ-ТО ДЛЯ ЭТОЙ ИГРЫ - и проблему с прицеливанием исцелила, и игра у меня больше не крашилась с ошибкой вижуала... Это как вообще понимать?

Также игра может крашиться после заставок, но от этого спасает механика с пропуском времени при помощи курения сигарет перед тем, как запустить заставку - прокурил часок игрового времени и вуаля - краша больше не будет. Это я вообще не знаю как комментировать, магия японских сломанных портов начала десятых годов, видимо.

И это те технические проблемы, с которыми столкнулся лично я.  У кого-то могло быть и хуже. Об этом говорит глобальная статистика достижений в стиме - дальше пролога, а то и первого эпизода прошли совсем немногие, а до конца добрались лишь избранные.

Игру к прохождению рекомендую, [b] но не на ПК [/b]. Я максимально серьезно. Пожалеете свои нервы и получите гораздо меньше негативных впечатлений от игры. Игра есть на свиче, но насчет качества порта на него не знаю - если на порт на ПК с 2013 года не обновляли, что можно ожидать от порта 2019 года? Сыграйте лучше в версию на PS3 или Xbox 360 - версии на них гораздо лучше в техническом плане, насколько я знаю.

You'll either love this game or hate it. There is seriously no inbetween. It really depends on your primary expectations from a video game and the things that you're willing to turn your eyes away from. Albeit the story constructs itself around an eerie murder mystery and a bunch of tiny bizarre events and personas, the game does not treat itself that seriously so, at times, neither should you. It's not going to be the most no-nonsense experience, I assure you. You might spot so many details that don't make any sense about the world of this game or the characters that you build a companionship with. Normally, even the awfully odd character designs would be a tip off for me but I won't lie, this game somehow got me hooked after an hour or so. Having played yet another Hidetaka Suehiro murder mystery game beforehand, which was Dark Dreams Don't Die, I figured this experience was probably going to be similarly weird and captivating, so I got even more intrigued. The story has a few holes and some bad apple cliches that honestly spoil the game's complete potential. The mechanics and the interface, and the logic behind them are beyond me as a player and possibly the most impractical I've ever seen. The port itself is a complete wreck and I doubt you'll be able to get this game to work on your first try without editing some files and yada yada yada... I guess the roasting has to end at some point, so I want to say that I'd recommend this game regardless of its shortcomings and poorly designed mechanics because it. Is. Such a thrilling experience. With all of its cinematographical allure, insanely well-written characters and a solid, tempting story, it's just as easy to completely overlook the errors. Ignoring all of its mechanical problems and tiny plot holes here and there, it tells a really capturing 'whodunit' tale that might even stay with you for a while after completion since the tension keeps rising up and down throughout the game. It's a roller coaster, but in the best way possible! Assuming you were victorious in your efforts to get this god-awful port to work properly, (you are one of the selected few) I'd definitely urge you to give this bizarre little game a chance and I hope you enjoy it and cringe along as much as I did.

Most reviews are going to mention this fact, and that's because there was no attempt to be subtle about what inspired the game. Many people often place this game into the same ""it's so bad, it's good!"" box as The Room, but I genuinely believe this game is more than that. The narrative is truly entertaining to watch play out. The writing for every character makes cutscenes a treat to watch. Sidequest dialogue helps further flesh out characters. The soundtrack, albeit limited, adds a lot of charm to the world, including the overly compressed, poorly mixed racing music. Characters are on a schedule, meaning you see them working their jobs, driving around, at their homes, or at bars; something that helps make things feel alive. And while some areas of the game are visually a disaster (because it's a terrible port and was supposed to be a PS2 game with a different name), it's obvious the team really cared about this project.

Now, for as much praise I can give this game, I could also make a giant list with much more talking about what's wrong with the port of this game, but I'll keep it short: Deadly Premonition is one of the worst PC ports on the market. Those low-effort Games for Windows Live ports from over a decade ago don't hold a candle to this. It's impressive how broken this port is and how much people have done to try and get it working so others can enjoy this wonderful game.

Signing up to play the PC port of Deadly Premonition is a lesson in patience. You might as well bookmark PCGamingWiki or one of the numerous Steam troubleshooting guides for this game. It will require you to mess with compatibility settings in-between missions because the game randomly decides to crash while running on your OS, but not when running in compatibility mode for Windows XP or 98. You will need to patch the EXE to increase its memory usage. You will likely need a community profile from the Steam input menu to fix the camera going up or down if you move the analog left or right and vice versa. And you will have to install DPfix, which is basically a mod that tries to fix as much of this game as possible to stop it from crashing every five minutes. And if all of that wasn't ridiculous enough, sometimes you will need to switch to windowed mode because a crash related to a specific thing only happens when in fullscreen. If you don't want to deal with how busted this port is, you have the option of emulating the PS3 or Switch version. It's hilarious and feels almost on-brand that people can run emulated versions of this game with little to no problems.

Everything aside, Deadly Premonition is often on sale for dirt cheap, and even if it's not on sale when you decide to check it out, it is worth every penny. Whether painstakingly getting this port to work or emulating it, everyone owes it to themselves to experience this game at least once.",1657185870,1657191071,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

When you open it for the first time, you are welcomed with a window with a small art of the game and the settings, in the style of 2000 games. That is the first red flag you get aside from the ""mixed"" reviews on Steam.
When you press ""play"", the game will just crash instead of starting, because apparently you need to give the .exe admin permissions (lol). 
Even after that:
-The game doesn't adequately support controllers: I have a wireless one, if it turns off during a cutscene, the game won't pick it up when I turn it on again
-The maximum resolution is 720p
-Audio is completely fucked up if you have 5.1 or 7.1 surround
-You cannot change control inputs from inside the game, you have to exit and restart to do so
-The game randomly crashes
-Full of bugs
-If you alt-tab it literally freezes the screen
-If you start it from the steam library it freezes steam and sometimes make it crash

[h1][b]✨ Здивувало[/b][/h1] 
[list]
[*][b]Надзвичайний сюжет[/b]
Це ігровий атмосферний «Твін Пікс», але більш шалений. Детективна частина гри – одна з найоригінальніших в цьому медіа. Розслідування вбивства дівчини в тихому місті зачаровує сміливими натяками на вбивцю, таємничістю історії та емоційним підґрунтям сценарію. Закінчується сюжет одночасно очікувано та неочікувано, глобально та локально. Але скажу одне – такого ви ніде більше не бачили. 

[*][b]Неповторні персонажі[/b]
Вони – головна родзинка всієї гри. Головний герой – дуже і дуже цікава, кумедна, розумна та просто крута особистість, про яку хочеш бачити повноцінний серіал. Всі інші персонажи також мають свої незвичні примхи та якості, за які їх легко запям’ятовуешь і закохуєшься. Cаме вони роблять детективну історію настільки інтригуючою, в кожного з героїв віриш. 

[*][b]Чарівна музика[/b]
Це щось нереальне. Саундтрек – дуже яскравий та виразний. І навіть кумедний, бо бадьорі треки можуть вставити в зовсім дивні сцени; я, наприклад, завжди покачував від радощів головою вліво-вправо, коли вмикали Life is Beautiful (веселе таке насвистування). Серйозні треки теж дивують своїм вмінням дістати потрібні емоції зі сцени та гравця, сильно занурюють в ігрові ситуації.

[h1][b]❌ Засмутило[/b][/h1]
[list]	
[*][b]Часті вильоти[/b]
Їх дуже багато. Вони, звичайно ж, бісять, а один у мене був взагалі вічно на одному моменті. Щоб його виправити прийшлося йти на сторінку гри в PCGamingWiki, де я знайшов рішення – «покури три-чотири години в кафе, перед тим як активувати кат-сцену». Геніально. Підбадьорює одне – зберігатися дають доволі часто.   

[*][b]Ніякий екшн[/b]
Він лише на рівнях з потойбічним світом і всі ці рівні – це дійсно якесь пекло для гравця. Мені вічно здавалися непотрібними ці затягнуті бігання по коридорам з кривою стрільбою в однакових зомбі. Після проходження гри я в мережі знайшов причину цієї нісенітниці. Виявляється, все це додали в останню чергу після прохання видавцю, який хвилювався, що через відсутність екшну гравці в США не оцінюють гру…

[h1][b]Висновок[/b][/h1]
Дивовижна пригода, яку портить страшезний техн. стан. Але потворні анімації та інші проблеми маркнуть на тлі блискучих діалогів, гумору та драми.

І так, щоб гра інколи нормально працювала потрібна ставити фанатський збірник патчів з “посібників” Steam ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The gameplay is terrible. The music is terrible. The characters are terrible and terribly written, as is the plot. By all accounts the game should have nothing going for it whether you’re a pure gamer or after some kind of story-telling experience.

But people don’t remember Drakengard for what it wasn’t, that being good; people remember Drakengard for what it was, that being COMPLETELY INSANE.

Everyone in Drakengard is a dick. EVERYONE. You play as a mass murderer psychically linked with a misanthropic dragon. Your sister’s a passive waif and your best friend’s a moron who trades away his singing voice for his own dragon from a 6-year-old little girl who is actually possessed by a god. You hang out with a cannibal, a pedophile, an immortal runt, and an alarmingly racist member of the clergy. By the end of it you’ve racked up about as many kills as the sum of the first world war SINGLE-HANDEDLY, so much so that the evil empire can’t even one up you by inventing nuclear weapons (which they do) and drop them (which they do) from their flying continental fortress (which they have) before they summon pan-dimensional space babies (which exist) to kill everyone (which they accomplish).

The final battle has you hurling an alien deity through a rip in the fabric of space time to engage them in a rhythm battle over a monochromatic Tokyo, after which you get shot down by the Japanese air force and proceed to infect the entire world (our world) with magical aids that either kills you or turns you into a bloodthirsty salt giant.

No puedo, simplemente no puedo. Se me crasheo muchas veces, tuve que recurrir a reiniciar la Pc a cada rato,  guardar constantemente y recurrir a la ""solución"" de poner al personaje a fumar antes del momento que el juego crasheara y aún así tuve que perderme la mitad de dos capítulos y usar archivos de guardado de otros jugadores ya que era imposible avanzar sin eso. Tuve que prescindir de las misiones secundarias y solo enfocarme en la historia principal...

Y luego pasa que la historia de este juego es demasiado buena y prácticamente carrea todo el juego. No quiero hacer spoiler, por ende diré que el juego presenta una excelente historia de terror, misterio y hasta momentos de humor te mete por ahí. Le sienta muy bien la influencia de la gran serie Twin Peaks.

Okay dejamos eso de lado. Pero es que el gameplay del juego es mediocre, pero por algún motivo te acostumbras y lo empiezas a disfrutar.  Luego vienen mas problemas técnicos, los malos gráficos, la pobre optimización, los problemas con los efectos sonoros. Y con todo eso, de alguna manera le vas encontrando un encanto al juego aún con todos estos defectos.

Es que creo que soy masoquista porque pese a todo esto disfrute demasiado del juego, de su historia, sus personajes, su terror, su humor, su música, hasta de su gameplay...

but after hours of troubleshooting, I discovered how to make this port ""stable"" in ""4"" ""easy"" steps. I haven't had any crashes or instability in a while :)

[h1]0) This should come pre-installed with the game at this point[/h1]
Download DPfix by Durante and install in the Deadly Premonition folder, we are never launching this through steam. DPfix.ini is the only way to have graphics options

[h1]1) Compatibility mode[/h1]
Before playing the game, set DP.exe and DPlauncher.exe to run as administrator. Check if the game can launch.
If no; set DPfix.ini to have the game run windowed (not fullscreen or borderless windowed). Check if the game can launch
If no; launch DP.exe directly
If no; set both DP.exe and DPlauncher.exe in compatibility mode for: Windows 8 -> 7 -> XP (breaks aiming, toggle lock-on to fix) -> 98/ME (sets the game to run on 1 core, how exciting!), try launching both from the launcher and DP.exe directly
If still no; it ends here, I'm sorry.

[h1]2) This game crashes when it uses >2GB of RAM[/h1]
Download CFF Explorer, part of the Explorer Suite by NTcore.
Make a copy of DP.exe and save for backup. Open the original DP.exe in CFF Explorer.
On the left side; click File Header
Right side; click ""Click Here"" in the Characteristics row. In the pop-up window, tick ""This app can handle >2gb address space""
Close the pop-up, then click File > Save.

[b]This fixes a vast majority of crashes relating to cutscenes and scene transitions[/b]

[h1]3) Controls[/h1]
If you play on KB+M, attempt to play the game! If not:

[h1]3 - Prefix)[/h1]
Deadly Premonition's PC port reversed the X and Y axis on its controller support. Meaning that up/down = left/right respectively. It's really awesome and in the spirit of the game's programming typos, since Coffee (Black) costs 31.50 while Coffee (Milk) costs 13.50

[h1]3 - 0)[/h1]
Steam -> Settings -> Controller -> General Controller Settings
Tick ""Xbox Configuration Support""

DPlauncher.exe -> Setting -> tick ""Controller"". Map your controls here as well when done setting up

[h1]3a) Xbox controllers:[/h1]
I have not found a remapper yet that lets you *remap analog directions*, only ones that let you invert controls or swap L/R stick functions

launch DP.exe and open steam overlay, then click Controller Configuration.

Search for the ""Deadly Premonition Controller+"" config by theraineydaze
Unfortunately, it turns the right analog stick into a binary input, so it's either no input or maximum input. But you get used to it :)

[h1]3b) DS4/5 controllers:[/h1]
Download DS4windows and make a new profile emulating a 360 controller
Bind right analog stick to:
Up = Left (-X)
Down = Right (+X)
Left = Up (-Y)
Right = Down (+Y)

Save and make sure DS4windows is running (it says ""Stop"" in the lower right of the window if it is)

Open the windows control panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Right click a controller and click ""Game Controller Settings"" -> Advanced -> Set ""Preferred Device"" to the 360 controller

You can use a steam preset still if you want, but this way lets you have full right stick analog control

[h1]4) Cut your CPU in half*[/h1]
[b]Disable hyperthreading / simultaneous multithreading (SMT) in your BIOS.[/b]
Look up the steps how to do so for your motherboard.

Deadly Premonition does NOT know how to handle threading at all and a HUGE amount of glitches result from this, such as falling through the world while drving, having the world stop loading, randomly freezing and hard crashing your PC, etc.
Essentially, the PC port likes to bit-flip [i]its self[/i]

Also disable steam overlay after setting up your controller if applicable. This game is held together with wishes and prayers, any amount of potential instability should be avoided.

*disabling Hyperthreading/SMT does not actually cut your CPU in half. Recommended to disable this feature anyway both due to a potential exploit using your CPU cache when it's enabled, and for stability with a lot of x32/x84 applications and running things like BlueStacks

[h1]Screeching Cars[/h1]
There's severe incompatibilities with any audio set up besides Stereo and Windows' default audio driver.
If you have screeching cars, blown out audio coming from different speakers, and/or constant footsteps behind you, try:

1) Set Windows audio to stereo

2) Disable any non-windows audio software (such as a virtual audio cable, or motherboard specific programs like Sonic Studio with Asus)

3) Unplug your extra speakers, if applicable.

4) Restart your PC if still not fixed.

5) Reinstall Deadly Premonition as a last resort.

[h1]Do I actually recommend the PC port when you have to do this?[/h1]
No.
These steps don't even fix all the bcrashes. You still need to smoke a cigarette after interrogating Nick to avoid crashing when leaving the diner (save before talking to Olivia), and there's still some random crashes like going to the graveyard at certain times of day (?). But there's no more runtime errors, so it makes the game [i]playable[/i]

edit: forgot to actually review the game. It's a very uncanny, light hearted, ""Horror"" game, with a protagonist that is equally full of ""Facts and Logic"" as he is ""Insanity,"" in a world that can't take its self seriously. A murder scene gets upstaged by ""Life is Beautiful"", and York recalling the case where a guy used human skulls as cups is immediately overshadowed by the fact he's comparing this to shoplifting and bar brawls.

The PC port, all things considered, also has the best audio mixing. For example, the 360 version has no directional audio, only left and right.

If you're a fan of Twin Peaks, you are probably going to find things to enjoy here. It's also very reminiscent of ""Mizurna Falls"" for the PSX if you're a fan of obscure Japan-only games, just in a post-RE4 world.",1652893578,1657154216,True,139,2,0.915734946727752686,8,True,False,False,False,,,

Почему? Например, вы играете за детектива с раздвоением личности, который постоянно разговаривает со своим альтер-эго и всем окружающим на это в принципе наплевать. И это только один из многих десятков приколов.

Игра, на самом деле, всем своим видом говорит - я треш. Дешево, нелепо, смешно, убого. Но интересно и сделано не на отвали - этим игра не дает себя причислить просто к трешу, но остается на него похожа.

Графика довольно слабая, но местами симпатичная. Главный герой приятный на вид, Эмили милашка, остальные персонажи в целом норм. Музыка неплохая, но не цепляющая, даже композиции с голосами как-то не зашли, хотя я обычно такое очень люблю. 

Геймплей с одной стороны разнообразный: вы путешествуете по довольно большому городу с кучей НПС, многие из которых дают вам свои квесты. Периодически продвигаетесь по сюжету, убивая всякую нечисть, которая появляется в “потустороннем мире”. Также вы едите, спите, меняете костюмы, бреетесь, катаетесь на тачках и играете в мини-игры. С другой стороны это разнообразие быстро приедается, потому что процессы начинают очень часто повторяться без какой-либо для этого необходимости. Например, когда вы ищите улики, вы должны сделать так называемое профилирование - столько раз, сколько улик. В итоге вы 3-4 раза повторяете одну и туже сцену, каждый раз когда находите очередную улику. Зачем? Создатели решили, что это интересно. Спойлер: нет. 

Отдельно расскажу про квесты. Они также повторяются - вам нужно 4 или 5 раз возить сумасшедшую бабульку и в итоге вы так и не узнаете, что скрывается в ее кастрюле (скорее всего ее мозги). Три раза будете передвигать ящики. Ну и т.д. Есть конечно интересные квесты, но им также часто не хватает логики. Из хорошего могу отметить историю Генерала (несмотря на также повторяющиеся квесты), историю Ника и его жены, ну и несколько других. Самое худшее в выполнении этих квестов - они часто привязаны ко времени и к определенным главам, поэтому если вы хотите их выполнить - не идите дальше по сюжету, пока их не завершите. Вы можете игнорировать время, отведенное на решение сюжетного задания и выполнить его на следующий день. Просто сосредоточьтесь на второстепенном квесте. А условия для его выполнения вам придется угадывать самостоятельно. Во сколько часов прийти в какую локацию - думаете вам скажут или хотя бы дадут подсказку? Нет, угадывайте сами или смотрите спойлеры. Я в основном справился со всем сам, несколько квестов пропустил, а к нескольким все же посмотрел подсказки.

Тем не менее, геймплей поначалу затягивал, хотя под конец настолько стал бесить, что мне даже не хотелось выполнять последние квесты (свою роль сыграла и сюжетная развязка о которой расскажу чуть дальше). Про геймплей скажу только еще, что враги безумно однообразны - всю игру одни зомбаки 3-4 видов, выбор оружия также довольно скуден (хотя более-менее), а управление самое ужасное в истории геймдейва. Например, последнего босса убить НЕВОЗМОЖНО было не установив совместимость с Windows98, так как камера не поворачивалась под нужным для его убийства углом. А еще ненавистные и бесконечные QTE, настолько неинтересные, настолько навязчивые и настолько частые, что я бы сказал, что Deadly Premonition является игрой с самыми убогими QTE, которые мне довелось увидеть. Чудовищно унылые сцены с чуваком в красном дождевике (чье поведение очень сильно похоже на пирамидоголового) это еще цветочки. Ягодки будут в финале. Все это превращает геймплей в настоящую пытку. 

Атмосфера в игре достаточно странная. Из-за огромного количества условностей и повторений проникнуться ей довольно сложно, но она все же присутствует.

Сюжет также очень специфичен. Несмотря на кровавое убийство с которого игра начинается, первая половина довольно забавная и веселая. Но ближе к последней четверти игры начинается полная жесть и, поверьте, лучше вам этого не видеть. Выбор? Забудьте. Возможность не совершить чудовищную глупость? Нет. Получить в финале полный трындец? Так оно и будет. Наслаждайтесь, если любите пострадать, этого удовольствия там будет сполна. Не могу сказать, что я очень переживал за героев, но… все же мне было неприятно от того, как сценаристы с ними обошлись. Я люблю драмы, но тут… я не увидел необходимости в том, чтобы делать именно такой сюжет и достаточной логики в нем. Скорее, было похоже просто на какое-то извращение.

Remember in Metal Gear Solid when the game deliberately starts to glitch out and act like you just bricked your console? This game feels exactly like that from start to finish. 

Sometimes I can't tell if the game is bugging out on me or if it's part of the cryptic environment it's trying to portray. A few examples:

[list]
[*]Are the colors intentionally washing out on my screen or is it the stamina mechanic telling me I need to stop to catch my breath? 
[*]Why is this joyful tune that sounds like taken out of a Blue's Clues episode playing while I'm in a morgue investigating a murder victim? -- Did I leave YouTube open in the background again?
[*]Did that enemy just just clip through the floor and sent my car flying like a rocket or is it one of its offensive abilities?[/list] 

The game clearly draws a lot of inspiration from Twin Peaks; Not just in an Alan Wake type of inspiration, but literally copy/pasting some of the peculiar characters that made Twin Peaks so great. I.e. The oddball FBI agent with a fascination for coffee? Check. The shy and clumsy police officer? Check. The log lady? Check. A town with a backstory of lumber mills? Check. A red room in your dreams? Check. 

Swery, the director, took the Twin Peaks blueprint (too literally at times) and applied Phil Swift's Flex Tape on it in order to tell a new and unique story, and you can't help but wonder if they had to pay royalties for the source material or if it's a case of blatant plagiarism.

If you lived under a rock and were told that Deadly Premonition was the officially licensed Twin Peaks videogame, you'd have a hard time disputing that claim.

This feeling of ""inspiration"" (read: outright rip off) goes beyond just Twin Peaks. I.e. For some reason the female deputy sheriff you meet during the first few minutes of the game, Emily Wyatt, looks exactly like Naomi Watts, but the latter is never credited in the game.

Whether by accident or not, this game is truly a masterful experience.

EDIT 1: 
I ended up playing it on a Switch, as it turns out, these were not intended game mechanics; I kinda miss some of these flavorful glitches tho.

EDIT 2: 
The Switch version also crashes (albeit less often) and it has the same bug where windows on non-interactive buildings shine completely white (like a missing texture). The framerate is also crazy and sinks into the low 10's making it almost unplayable.

EDIT 3:
I briefly tried the Xbone version, but it has tank controls. I can't in good conscience play this game with such outdated controls.

EDIT 4: 
I ended up going back to the PC version since I can at least run it at locked 144 Hz (the darts mini-game bugs out at high framerates so I had to temporarily switch it back to 60 FPS).

EDIT 4.1 (appendix):
Things that bug out at 144 Hz:
[list]
[*]Driving: Your car goes faster than usual (which is arguably a good thing; I actually used this ""glitch"" to easily win all the racing side missions)
[*]The mission where you have to tail a car. Said car simply comes to a halt when going through a small slope, preventing you from completing the mission
[*]The darts minigame (the reticle does not match with where the dart lands)
[*]The mission where you have to follow an NPC (the NPC will get stuck in lamp posts and/or mailboxes)
[*] During cutscenes, York's cigarette will get stuck in his mouth while a duplicate cigarette stays in his hand. At first I thought that the protagonist simply had a crippling case of tobacco addiction, but this doesn't happen at 60 FPS.
[*]The spider-like monsters that crawl out of vents. These will stay permanently cloaked, clip through the walls and disappear. It doesn't sound so bad on paper, but defeating these monsters will often trigger a door or a cutscene so they must be defeated in order to advance to the next area.[/list] 

EDIT 5: 
I managed to get past the infamous Chapter 9 on PC so I feel like I have crossed the Rubicon. 

So far the game has crashed at least a couple dozen times and I have had to switch between ""Windows XP SP3"" and ""Windows Vista"" compatibility mode from time to time; Some sections appear to work better with either setting so it's a 50/50 bet. Also, opening the ""Missions"" menu soft-locks the game and forces you to Alt-F4, so you have to remember not to open that sub-menu.

The crashes mostly happen during fast-travel sequences, so I've resorted to ignoring the fast-travel mechanic and instead hauling my ass  from place to place in my in-game vehicle... it kinda adds realism and the town isn't that big to begin with so it's a good compromise.

FINAL EDIT:
I've finally beaten the game. This is an exercise of endurance and patience. I feel I've aged a decade, but the story was worth the hassle.

Other than that, there's actually an amazing game and an excellent story hidden behind all these glitches.",1651374003,1665675162,True,5,1,0.551345348358154297,5,True,False,False,False,,,

Evet oyun çok sorunlu, aşırı kötü bir port (keşke yapılmasaymış da Xbox' a özel kalsaymış diyor insan), bir sürü fix kurduğunuzda çalışmaması da mümkün, gayet güzel oynuyorken birden bire crash vermesi de. Araç kontrolleri berbat, hele ki açık dünya bir oyunda bir yerden bir yere gitmek için sürekli araç kullanmak zorundaysak bu sorun bazen çileden çıkartabiliyor. Oyunda seslerde de sorunlar mevcut, demolardaki sesler çok yüksek çıkarken, oyun içi demolarda ise seslendirmeler aşırı kısık geliyor. [u]Buna rağmen tavsiye ediyorum evet, eğer imkanınız var ise pc de değil de Xbox ya da Ps3' de kesinlikle deneyimlemelisiniz.[/u] Evet pc' de oynanması ve katlanılması zor bir oyun ama eğer katlanabilirseniz... Önünüzde muhteşem bir oyun olduğunu yavaş yavaş anlamaya başlıyorsunuz.

2010 yılında piyasaya çıkan açık dünya hayatta kalma-korku türündeki Deadly Premonition, eski tarz Playstation 2 görüntüleri ve tank karakter yönetimiyle bizi tamamen eski tip oyun havasına sokan bir oyun. Hani ben görüntü isterim, kazık gibi bir combat istemem derseniz oyun hiç size göre değil.

Greenvale kasabasında gerçekleşen gizemli bir cinayeti çözmek üzere gönderilen FBI ajanı Francis York Morgan olarak oyuna dahil oluyoruz. Oyunun şüphelileri araştırıp katili bulmaya çalıştığımız hikâyesi klişe gibi görünse de, karakterlerle konuştukça ve kasabada gezdikçe içimizde bir merak uyandırıyor. York' un hayali arkadaşı olan Zack ile diyalogları ve kasabadaki karakterlerle olan diyalogların ise değişik bir mizahı var, eğer Twin Peaks izlediyseniz zaten oyun size çok aşina gelecektir.

Kasabamız oldukça büyük ve oyunda fast travel yok, bu yüzden bir yere gitmek için araba kullanmak zorundayız. Araba kullanımında ise benzin göstergesi ve hasar göstergesi mevcut, kasabada bir tane benzinci bulunduğundan bir yere gitmeye karar vermeden önce size önerim depoyu doldurmalısınız. Kasabadaki  evler, çiftlikler, malikaneler, dükkanlar vs. serbestçe dolaşılabiliyor, ancak oyunun oldukça yavaş akan bir 24 saati, hava durumu gibi gerçek zamanlı detayları var ve bazı mekanlar saat ve havaya göre açılıp kapanıyor. Mesela yağmurlu havada hiçbir mekan açık olmadığı için yan görevleri de ona göre ayarlamak gerekiyor, herkes evinde olduğundan belirli saatlerde gidip evde görevleri tamamlamak gerekebiliyor, mesela silahçı dükkanı gece 20.00-06.00 saatleri arası açık olduğundan alışverişinizi ona göre ayarlamalısınız. Oyundaki karakterlerin yerlerini anlık olarak görebildiğimiz canlı bir harita sistemi var oyunda. Yani kısacası önümüzde yaşayan bir kasaba var,  kasabadakiler günlük işleri için oradan oraya hareket ediyor ve bunları takip etmek mümkün. Gece saat 12' den sonra ise kasabada dolaşmak ise biraz sıkıntılı. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2785472196

Oyunun ana görev sistemi ise saat odaklı, mesela saat 13.00-15.00 arası bir mekanda olmanız gerekiyorsa ve saatleri kaçırdıysanız görev ertesi güne kalıyor, o zamana kadar da ister yan görevleri tamamlayıp, isterseniz de uyuyarak vakit geçirebilirsiniz. Yan görevler ise tamamen hava durumuna ve oyunun bölümlerine bağlı, bazı görevler yağmurlu havada alınabilirken bazıları sadece güneşli havada alınabiliyor ya da sadece belirli bölümlerde alınıp yapılabilen görevler var. Peki bir kişide görev olup olmadığını nasıl anlıyoruz derseniz, harita menüsünde side quest sekmesinde görevin hangi bölümlerde kimden alınabildiği listelenmiş durumda ama hava durumu işine internetten bakmanız gerekebilir. Oyun 26 bölümden oluşuyor ve oldukça uzun, ana görevin yanı sıra 50 tane de yan görev bulunmakta. Yan görev ödülleri de oldukça cezbedici, bazısı sınırsız mermili bir silah verirken, bazısı da güzel takım elbiseler verebiliyor.

[i] “In life, when we are in love with someone, we are actually in love with both the good and the bad sides of that person. We’re in love with that unique blend.” [/i]

Director Hidetaka Suehiro’s quote about the design philosophy of Deadly Premonition’s characters from GDC 2011 I think is also amazingly apropos to the relationship I and many others have to this inconceivable product- this unforeseen amalgamation of genuine creative passion and utter bamboozlement of what lies behind a conventionally 'good' game.

DP, at first sight, doesn’t only shamelessly steal whole concepts from shows like Twin Peaks and games like Silent Hill 2, it also manages to blunder almost every single facet of its own gameplay. The vehicle driving is stiff. The shooting mechanics are stilted. The enemies are trivially easy to beat, resulting in virtually no genuine challenge for the player to overcome as they explore the ominous otherworlds of different locations around town, which are really nothing more than sets of hallways stapled together in unstimulating cheap knock-offs of those from the game series it borrows from. The hunger and sleep mechanics act as an unsuccessful attempt to add definition to the rest of the game outside the corridor-shooter sections, proving too easy to fulfill. The salary system whereby you earn your funds to purchase items and weapons is [i] completely [/i] unrestrained, offering you thousands upon thousands of dollars for completion of each chapter, disallowing careful decision-making over how to effectively use your money. The sound design is cliche- full of the cheapest, most bafflingly atmosphere-destructive things that make you question if this game is supposed to be a genuine attempt at a horror videogame or instead a satirical masterpiece.

Not to mention how absolutely broken this PC port is. I had to download DPFix, which is pretty much required to run the game at any reliable measure to avoid unplayably-choppy framerate and the inevitable, innumerable, [b] near-intolerable [/b] amount of crashes. Even then, I had to download DP on ANOTHER computer after an unavoidable crash halfway through the game which rendered my original installation impossible to continue on. Backing up saves is a must. To put it simply, DP can suck big pee pee a lot of the time.

But note that I did not say [i] all  [/i] the time.

For as bug-ridden, and almost totally unplayable as a game could possibly be, Deadly Premonition is nevertheless one of the most charming and endearing videogames in existence. In the intermits of pain- caused by technical problems and irrevocably flawed design- the story and characters are what ultimately manage to glue everything together; the sole reason for the cult following and undying loyalty so many have to the game.

Playing as eccentric FBI agent, Francis “York” Morgan, you are brought to the northwestern town of Greenvale to investigate the mysterious murder of a local girl, following a trail of other killings involving strange red seeds. What follows from this simple premise is one of the most unpredictable, ridiculous, and downright silly video game narratives that has ever come out of the industry. The whole cast of unforgettably weird characters sticks in your mind long after playing, and as much as the [i] horror [/i] atmosphere is practically nonexistent, the atmosphere of the [i] town [/i] of Greenvale itself is likely one of the most accurate and true-to-life depictions of the American northwestern countryside you’ll see- no doubt one of the few true successes of the game due to the developers traveling and studying the real life landscapes in that part of the world.

The music too is surprisingly good. Magical and floating songs like the vocal version of Greenvale, or the happily relaxing Life is Beautiful that always seems to play at the most laughably tone-deaf moments, work towards a strong, if not characteristically motley mixture of identity. 

Even more unexpected is the fact that for how f*cking stupid DP’s narrative can get, there are moments of genuine poignancy that somehow work despite the general amount of insanity surrounding all else. The player’s emotional link to the protagonist by way of in-game portrayal as York’s imaginary friend, Zach, enables a genuine connection to the character that evolves through the course of the story. DP is oddly full of details that prove the game was legitimately developed with real ardor and effort, most notably in the mid-drive discussions of old movies, music, and previously solved cases that York has with you, Zach. By the time you get to the ending, you’ll not only have felt fulfilled from the conclusion of the case, you’ll also share a part of the feeling of bittersweet liberty with the goodbyes of the characters.

It is because of these things that make Deadly Premonition an inconceivable piece of art. To play through a gameplay and narrative that feels as if it were made by a child, yet at the same time get real enjoyment from the same things it fails so spectacularly at, through all odds, is incredibly inspiring and heartfelt, especially in recent times where the industry has really suffered from both an abundance of greed and loss of passion. A relic like this can remind you how stupid, fun, and sometimes touching games as an artistic medium can be.

Yes, today we will talk about the first part of Deadly Premonition and we got our hands on the ""improved"" version for PC - The Director's Cut. In this version, we are waiting for clearer textures, several scenes that were not in the original version, and a more “revealed” plot.
But in fact, we are faced with the appearance of bugs, conventions, mysticism and innuendo in the plot.
Let's start with the main thing that catches your eye - it's graphics. Even for 2013 - the identification of statistical data. Here and there - we are met by invisible barriers - which interfere with the movement of the player and transport, rather soapy textures (even with HD improvements), problems with shadows and light (often the picture is very overexposed).
Achieve this with not the most successful control, both of the main character and the car, and you will get the game of 2006. What a small memory pool may remind you of, which is why objects appear right in front of the character while moving around the city.
But we are not here because of the graphics, but because of the mysticism and the plot! And that's enough here.
The plot for the game is written and implemented very well, although there are holes in it every now and then - no one tries to shut up or somehow explain. Mysticism comes down to the manifestation of the ""other"" world - in the fact that rather low and slow opponents are waiting for us. They are supposed to scare the player and be dangerous - but in fact, the bobbleheads are quickly destroyed at a distance and are not dangerous for the GG. The same can be said about highlights with bosses - which are also present in the game for show.

Fun fact - the main plot and additional quests, sex of different people. Therefore, the secondary tasks are not to delve into the ENT of the game in any way, but are entered simply in order to allow the player to complete ""cards"" and ""weapons with endless ammo"".
Also in the game, things with music are rather sadly repeated - there are literally a few tracks here - which constantly happen from time to time, during certain events. It's pretty sad =(

[h1] Mi historia con este juego (no hace falta leerla) [/h1]

Antes de decir el porque si recomiendo el juego, quiero contar la historia de como conocí este juego. A este juego le tengo un cariño de amor-odio. Todo empezó cuando estaba viendo un video de un canal llamado PiviGames. Pivi recomendaba como anuncio, al principio de su video, una página de keys y había un bundle u ofertas de 1 juego por solo 1 dólar. Confiaba en lo que me decía esta persona y ""fuente"" si se puede decir. Decido dar un vistaso y entre todos los juegos, estaba este. No recuerdo los otros. Vi el trailer, vi algunas fotos y dije, bueno vamos a probar. Por lo que vi, el juego tenía una pinta a Resident Evil y en ese entonces estaba un poquito atento a lo que era Sillent Hill y no, no estoy igualando la saga de terror psicológico con Deadly Premonition. Asi que sí, asi fue como obtuve el Deadly Premonition un 15 de Abril de 2021 por tan solo 1 dolar en una página que era desconocida para mi. Por eso no me arrepiento de haber pagado esos 168 pesos argentinos (que era lo que valía el dólar américano, más los impuestos, en ese momento).

[h1] Puntos positivos y negativos [/h1]

[i]Pros: [/i]
[list]

[*]Personajes interesantes. No me encariñe con todo el elenco, pero los más importantes les guardo cierto cariño. Quizás si hubiese completado todas las misiones secundarias hubiese conectado más con algunos y con otros no.

[*]Buena Banda Sonora Original, escúchenla por favor.

[*]Buena historia. No es una obra, tampoco para tanto pero no es un asco.

[*]Diferentes vehículos para coleccionar. [spoiler] Si lees esto, tranquilo, que vas a poder recuperar el coche de York. [/spoiler]

[*]Barra de sueño y hambre (básicamente pequeños detalles que afectan al personaje).

[*]La ropa que llevamos se ensucia pasado el tiempo, tenemos que cambiárnosla y encima lavar la que quedó sucia.

[*]El coche se puede romper y quedarse sin gasolina. Tanto para arreglarlo como para renovar el combustible, necesitamos hacer una parada en la única gasolinera del pueblo.

[*]Ciclos de día y noche, como también días nublados y algunos con lluvia (este último es muy importante con la historia y también el como afecta al mundo y juego). Podemos informarnos de esto viendo la televisión.

[*]Podemos afeitarnos. Sencillamente algo estético que no marca mucho, pero sirve para elegir la apariencia que mas nos guste para nuestro personaje.

[*]Asi como tiene ciclos de día y noche, los horarios juegan un papel importante en la rutina de todos los npc’s y de los lugares, haciendo que el mundo abierto se sienta bastante vivo.

[*]Podemos pescar, lo probé y no es la gran cosa, pero es una forma de poder lootear comida, armas y munición.

[*]Algo que mencionaré en las contras y es que, el juego parece una parodia, es como un abridged, arruinando momentos tristes, lúgubres, de cualquier calibre, poniendo la música no adecuada en dichos momentos. Música feliz mientras inspeccionamos un cadáver, el protagonista fumando y muy relajado, después o durante una situación de estrés que requiere mucho profesionalismo. Pero es algo que me gusta, no voy a mentir.
[/list]

[i]Contras: [/i]
[list]

[*]Bugs, crasheos, problemas técnicos en general.

[*]Dichos problemas técnicos se debe a un mal port de pc, que fue un copia y pega de la versión de consola (preferiblemente Xbox 360) pero sin poner una gota de sudor.

[*]Es un juego de terror, y, digamos que no es su fuerte, es una parodia y sátira de si misma.

[*]La acción es mala o aburrida porque, cada vez que empezamos a luchar con las “Sombras”, estos enemigos son molestos y solo hace que el jugador quiera terminar lo más rápido posible con ellos.

[*]Volviendo a la acción, no vamos a tener muchas armas al principio, son caras algunas. El apuntado es más incómodo que los primeros Resident Evil. Para mi no fue difícil acostumbrarme.

[*]Cuando matas a un enemigo (Sombra) este muere y donde murió, parece ser que “sigue ahí” ya que no nos dejará pasar por unos segundos. Sumado a que en algunas ocasiones los enemigos son infinitos y se genera un spawn donde murió, haciendo difícil y tedioso poder pasearse por las zonas.

[*]El detalle de que los personajes no jugables tengan una acción diferente en ciertos momentos del día, lo hace tedioso, ya que algunos cuando van a su casa, no te dejaran pasar. Esto es algo bastante negativo si querés hacer una misión secundaria por puro interés o si querés completar los logros del juego.

[*]Esto conecta con el punto mencionado anteriormente, y es que el mapa y mini mapa del juego, es un problema. Es difícil estar aprendiéndose todas las localizaciones ya que el zoom para alejar, es muy poco y encima el mapa del menu rota al igual que el minimapa, termina siendo frustrante. Esto es tedioso para cuando querés seguir a un personaje, importante, que se esta yendo y lo requerís para cierta misión, entregarle algo, recibir, etc.

[*]El sistema de conducción es horrible, los coches no pueden ir a altas velocidades por mucho tiempo porque pierden la estabilidad y derrapan mucho, lo suficiente para que a veces, puedan volcarse o chocar.

[*]No tiene mucha dificultad el juego, es realmente un paseo, solo que se alarga debido a errores con los enemigos que mencione anteriormente. Además que los rompecabezas son fáciles de resolver, quizás hay uno que te sea más difícil que otro como me paso a mi.

[*]Hay un par de misiones (no recuerdo alguna otra) que son aburridas, se trata de manejar o caminar/correr por un buen tiempo. Hace que te mueras del aburrimiento, pero muy garantizado.

[*]El jefe final es fácil también pero gracias a las limitaciones técnicas, se produce un problema a la hora de querer matarlo, por lo cual habrá que tener mucha paciencia, que no es imposible.

[*]Los gráficos son bastante regulares, no sé si muy malos (A mi este apartado es el que me da bastante igual, pero es un punto objetivamente negativo).

¿Que decir? Me gusta el juego, los puntos negativos prevalecen sobre los positivos, pero fue tanto el amor que le tenía que aguante y lo jugué, eso quiere decir que realmente vale la pena. Para restar los problemas técnicos, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218647912] usé esta guía en español, recomendada si o si para los hispanoparlantes [/url] ya que el juego, en español, esta mal traducido. Ciertos caracteres como los signos de pregunta, de exclamación, tildes y la poderosísima Ñ no están y es una sopa de letras y garabatos los subtítulos. La verdad que un desastre lo que no han querido hacer los responsables del port y del juego en general. Gracias a la comunidad, sobre todo a ustedes: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/fernandoesra] Esra [/url] y [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/raskaipika] Raskaipika [/url] y los que ayudaron con los parches, con el DPfix y SweetFX.

Como dije anteriormente en la sección de ""Mi historia con el juego"" lo compré a 1 dólar, pero por ese amor que le agarré, decidí comprar la música del juego, que se encuentra a modo de DLC.
No recomiendo comprarlo al precio en el que está. Hagan como yo, compren la key o esperen a rebajas. No sé si el juego suele estar de oferta cada tanto y no se cuando. Pero este juego debería estar barato por lo que ofrece.

On a serious note the game is good. Whilst the gameplay hasn't aged the best, the pure batshit insanity of the story will hook you immediately. This game is like if the movies Mulholland Drive and Seven had a baby, and that baby was bipolar.

Crucial story events are often accompanied by the most out of place jazz music. 

The sandbox elements and side quests add more flavor to games world and provide an insight into the motivations and background of various characters in a thought out way. The game does a good job of making you feel like a detective. 

The amount of surrealist humour in the game is unparalleled by any other game (or form of media) I have played.

Вот что могу сказать - это уникальная игра в своём жанре. Серьёзно, эта игра не похожа ни на одну другую игру, единственное только некоторые моменты могут отдалённо напоминать другие проекты. Это и глубокий сюжет, и временами вещи свойственные только японским играм, и японский юмор(который мне к слову зашёл, хоть я и не особо фанат такого). В общем красота.
В этой игре все персонажи по своему хороши, но скорее всего вам больше запомнится колоритный главный герой - Френсис Йорк Морган, агент ФБР, он будет обсуждать фильмы пока вы будете ехать на машине в какой-либо пункт назначения, неплохо шутить, даже в казалось бы патовых ситуациях. В общем, классный мужик=)
А вот насчёт технической составляющей игры... ох-хо-хо! Это самая неоптимизированная игра на пк в которую я играл(не считая первый дарк соулс), программисты этой игры так накасипорили в коде игры, что она у вас будет вылетать либо каждые 10 минут, либо стабильно каждые 2-3 часа как в моём случае, тут кому как повезёт, но это всё цветочки, ведь есть же неофициальный патч - DPfix, который и графику настроить позволяет(да, в игре даже такого нет, в лаунчере можно выбрать только полноэкранный режим или оконный, на этом графические настройки заканчиваются) и даже управление для геймпада, да и баги некоторые исправляет... И казалось бы, установил этот патч, и всё, жизнь сказкой становится. Но нееет, из-за этого патча у некоторых вылетов становилось гораздо больше, у некоторых уменьшался фпс, ну а в моём случае этот патч не позволял мне нормально и полноценно целиться, только ограниченная ось. Да и графика в этой игре для 2010 года выглядит мягко говоря не очень, так ещё разрабы решили что будет хорошей идеей ещё и прикрутить серый фильтр в режиссёрскую версию, которого не было в оригинальной версии, исправить это можно только путём установки SweetFX. 
А, и музыка, она хороша, просто хороша, некоторые композиции конечно повторяются, но тут настолько шикарный саундтрек, что грех жаловаться, да и он мне не надоел ни разу. 
Но в целом, мои мучения оправдались, игра мне в итоге понравилась.

Think of the movie ""The Room (2003)"" had a baby with TV series ""Twin Peaks"", but a videogame. 

However this port is pretty god awful and is the definition of just ""phoning it in"". If you're willing to do a bunch of mod and config work beforehand to fix a majority of the issues in its vanilla state it is definitely worth a buy on sale. On the bright side this can probably run on a potato so it's also a good pick-up for someone who is at the moment stuck running lower spec hardware or even the Steam Deck since the native resolution for this game is 720p.

Regardless of all my rambling this is definitely worth playing through despite the really sad state of the port mainly due to vast community support to get the game in a very playable state. My negative review is a reflection of the PC port as is and not the game itself. (Also I've heard that DP2 has similar issues with another barebones port if you want to call it that which is really unfortunate, although I'm sure the community over time will fix that game too)

Sidenote: If you do buy this I recommend visiting [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut]this page[/url] to help you get the game running in an acceptable state. Also here's some steps to fix the gamepad controls since they're messed up especially the axis for the analog sticks.

[u]Начну с хорошего:[/u]

Сюжет и персонажи - это то, что несомненно удалось (особенно учитывая его полноценную логическую завершённость). Игроизация по сути Твин Пикса в версии второго сезона с щепоткой фирменного японского шарма, которая умело закручивает интригу, раскрывает многочисленных жителей городка (которые очаровательно эпатажны под стать первоисточнику), мотивирует пройти почти каждое побочное задание. И всё это под яркий и колоритный саундтрек, написанный как минимум  Японским Бадаламетти. А уж какое количество причудливых механик, грамотно вплетённой иронии и шуток, мелких деталей. Воистину Купер гордился бы!

[u]Но минусы всплывают всю дорогу с самого начала:[/u]

Игра попросту отвратительно портирована и без DPFix'а она будет вылетать ещё чаще, рендериться лишь в 720p и Ктулху знает что ещё (почти сразу заглянул на PCGamingWiki и накатил сей фанатский патч, чего и всем желаю). После этого предстоит столкнуться с крайне несбалансированным геймплеем и его сложностью, неудобным управлением (сломанным, отчего финального босса добить можно лишь проанализировав ролики таких же бедолаг в интернете), звуком лишь в стерео (в машине при ином позиционировании не завидую вашим ушам), пустейшим и большим открытым миром (возможность быстрого путешествия скрыта в награде за побочное задание, которое можно выполнить в определённых начальных главах) с постоянными поездками минут по 7-10 реального времени, частыми непредсказуемыми вылетами и возможностью в некоторых местах запороть сохранение (поэтому стоит прочесть гайд о всех замеченных ошибках и постоянно бекапить сейвы).

Short story, this version of the game (The PC Version of Deadly Premonition Director's Cut) is BROKEN. 
I have a windows 10 PC with a modern nvidia graphics card and the game out of the box did not work. 
It would crash on opening. I've tried the community fix(es) which are either a weird combination of trying different compatibility settings on the exe itself and/or the DP Fix, which is a community fix that requires adding new files to the game's directory. The DP Fix does include some extra settings like graphical adjustments, the ability to change the resolution as well. You will still need to make an adjustment to the controller profile for this game because the right stick by default is mapped wrong (up and down is left and right and vice versa by default).

Honestly the DP Fix made my experience worse, causing the game to crash often. Whereas rolling back the changes and setting the game's exe to compatibility mode for windows xp allowed me to play longer but ultimately I had the same result. The game would crash before a chapter even early on in the story. I tried practically everything I could find but nothing would work. 

While its my understanding this game is buggy on practically every system that it was ever ported to, this version in particular is... a waste of money. It just doesn't work and if for some reason you can get to work then my hat's off to you. I cannot recommend this game as it is on steam and TBH, the way that it currently is should be pulled from steam.

PS pour les soucis de démarrages qui peuvent en rebuter certains : 
- Pour les soucis de manette
Allez vous chercher un profil de manette (Le premier) en faisant clic droit sur le jeu dans votre bibliothèque, sélectionner le.
- Les soucis de framerate
Plusieurs solutions selon les cas (Testez plusieurs solutions, ou faites tout ce qui est listé ci-dessous) les 2 .exe avec droits admin cochés, comptabilité windows me (Pas besoin parfois), ensuite lorsque vous êtes sur le premier menu où vs avez le choix de lancer le jeu, faites gestionnaire tâches, détail, clic droit sur le .exe du jeu (DP je crois), priorité du jeu : forte, ensuite je ne sais plus quel onglet sur lequel cliquer mais cela vous va vous demander de sélectionner le nombre de coeurs du proc à utiliser, désélectionner ce qui est coché et cochez 0 et 1.
Avec cela ça devrait fonctionner, le jeu reste cependant très capricieux, random crash notamment, c'est embêtant mais redémarrer le jeu, s'ils se délenchent à répétition à l'enclenchement d'une scène : Le redémarrage du pc fonctionne plutôt bien.
Je précise que je n'utilise pas le mod qui existe pour résoudre les divers problèmes listés entre autres ci-dessus.

The only positive things I can say are there are quirky moments between characters making you think there will be some fun along the way.

If you look past the ‘bad’ graphics and wonky controls, this game is amazing! (The graphics and controls are fine imo, not as bad as people make them out to be!!) I'm lucky and I've had 0 crashes so far, I see that its a problem some people have?

I highly recommend this game, the story is amazing, York is a delight to play as and just overall it is a good game! I guess you could say some hate it, some love it, but it’s really worth a try!!

This is definitely in my top 10 favourite games!

Сразу предупрежу, что игра имеет множество минусов в плане совместимости с компьютером. Постоянные вылеты, долгая загрузка и время от времени отсутствие текстур могут отбить желание проходить игру совсем. Если нравится глубокий сюжет с неожиданными поворотами и с живыми персонажами, которым можно посочувствовать, то эту игру точно стоит пройти, закрыв глаза на минусы в техническом плане! 
Лучше изначально ставить совместимость «[b]Windows 98 / Windows Me[/b]», чтобы никаких проблем не было, а также настоятельно советую каждый раз сохраняться.

Как я уже выше написал, что сюжет довольно глубокий и пронзительный. Многие сравнивают игру с сериалом «Twin Peaks», но я, к сожалению, не смотрел этот сериал, поэтому мне не с чем сравнить.
«[b]Порой мы должны избавлять мир от вещей, которых вообще не должно существовать. Даже если ради этого придётся потерять любимого человека.[/b]» - с этих слов начинается игра, которые, в принципе, стоит запомнить, чтобы понять смысл в дальнейшем.
В маленький город приезжает ФБР по имени Йорк, чтобы раскрыть дело об убийстве восемнадцатилетней девушки. При этом же выступает потусторонний красный мир, в котором люди сходят с ума и ходят в изогнутом виде с мыслями «Убить! Убить! Убить!», и Йорк старается разгадать откуда появился этот мир. Вместе с Йорком делом занимается шериф Джордж и молодая девушка Эмили. Главный герой со своим лучшим другом старается никому не доверять и в одиночку расследовать дело, общаясь с людьми, узнавая всё постепенно. Люди дают свои дополнительные задания, которые можно выполнить и узнать много чего в плане расследования, а также такие задания могут вызывать и доверие, и подозрение одновременно.

В конце игры может остаться много нерешенных вопрос лично для игрока. [spoiler]К примеру, для меня единственные вопросы встали: «Почему Кейсен выглядит молодо на фото пятидесятилетней давности? И Полли, хозяйка отеля, всё время общалась с Кейсеном, разве она не видела, что на фото своей молодости она стоит с ним? Или же они друг про другу знают, но всё это остаётся секретом?»[/spoiler]

Управление в игре отвратительное. Бывает так, что в каст-сценах, где надо нажать быстро клавишу, меняется порядок клавиш при переигрывании и из-за этого можно легко провалить миссию, что крайне неудобно и необходимо каждый раз молиться, чтобы выпала та клавиша, которую уже кое-как запомнил. Управление машиной будет терпимо, но вот управление стрельбой - это уже ад. Про управление бега от убийцы я вообще молчу, сами поймёте, поэтому настоятельно советую менять время от времени совместимость, так как моментами на это влияет управление.

Музыка подобрана хорошо. Правда, в некоторых моментах музыка сменяется на комедийную, то есть сначала мелодия грустная, под которую персонаж делится своими чувствами или же прошлым, а потом резко атмосфера сменяется, и звучит уже комедийная мелодия, под которую хочется смеяться. Это, на мой взгляд, не придаёт полную атмосферу тепла, не придаёт того, чтобы полностью проникнуть в персонажа, наоборот, начинаешь проникать, понимать персонажа и тут же резко отталкивают назад со знаком «Стоп, мы же не для этого сюда пришли!».

В итоге, игра достойна внимания. но, к сожалению, не все люди обратят своё драгоценное внимание, потому что графика старая, а ещё и постоянные вылеты. Всем только подавай современный детектив, который можно пройти за три часа, в котором только счастливый конец и всего лишь. На самом деле это грустно, так как хорошие игры остаются в стороне, потому советую обратить внимание и пройти игру ради сюжета, ведь он шикарен, по моему мнению.

De sua premissa nem tão original assim? De sua gameplay travada? De suas mecânicas ambiciosas? De suas falhas? De seu port horrível para o PC? De sua reputação marcante? Ou talvez, de como ele se tornou um de meus jogos favoritos?

Um detetive do FBI chega em uma pequena cidade no noroeste americano, perto da fronteira do Canadá, para investigar a morte de uma adolescente aparentemente certinha e amada por todos. A morte afeta toda a cidade, e a investigação vai revelando não apenas detalhes sobre o assassino, mas também segredos obscuros que seus moradores estranhos não gostariam que fossem revelados. O que começa como um caso comum vai aos poucos demonstrando que forças sobrenaturais podem estar envolvidas. Além disso, o agente do FBI possui métodos incomuns, é viciado em café e parece ter visões relacionadas à investigação em seus sonhos, que envolvem quartos vermelhos e pessoas falando de forma estranha. Essa é a premissa da série Twin Peaks, de 1990, e também de Deadly Premonition. A inspiração aqui beira o plágio, com alguns personagens e lugares parecidos até demais. Mas, como Twin Peaks é a minha série favorita, também é o motivo de eu ter jogado esse jogo.

Por sorte, a história em si não é uma cópia exata da série, e eu diria que é o ponto mais alto de Deadly Premonition. Por mais que seu ponto de partida seja o mesmo, as duas histórias vão para caminhos e possuem mitologias bem diferentes. Os personagens que parecem terem vindo direto da série são poucos, e os originais daqui conseguem ser até mais estranhos e caricatos do que a série jamais foi. O destaque é com certeza o personagem principal, Francis York Morgan, que fica conversando com seu amigo imaginário Zach o jogo todo.  A escrita aqui é bem boa, sendo no geral bem cômica e absurda mas conseguindo atingir momentos sérios quando o jogo precisa. O que interfere um pouco com a história, assim como todos os aspectos desse jogo, é sua execução. As músicas desse jogo são boas, mas frequentemente usadas nos momentos errados. Junto com alguns dos piores efeitos sonoros que eu já vi em um jogo, isso acaba gerando um humor não intencional que cria o charme único e estranho desse jogo.

Quanto à gameplay, o jogo possui duas partes principais. A primeira são as sessões de Survival Horror, similares a jogos como Resident Evil ou Silent Hill, onde o jogador luta com inimigos similares a zumbis ou espíritos. Aparentemente essas sessões foram adicionadas de última hora, o que faz bastante sentido considerando que são as partes mais fracas do jogo. Pode até ser um pouco tenso quando um inimigo aparece diretamente do seu lado, mas no geral essas sessões não geram nenhum medo ou tensão. Esse jogo também possui algumas das piores e mais engraçadas sequências de perseguição já feitas. Eu não considero essas sessões necessariamente terríveis, mas a forma que elas são usadas aqui podia ser melhor.

E então temos a melhor das duas partes, o sistema de mundo aberto. O jogador é livre para explorar a cidade inteira de Greenvale e apenas seguir a história principal quando quiser. Mecânicas habituais de jogos de mundo aberto estão aqui, como comprar itens em lojas, jogar minigames como pesca, dardos e corrida, e fazer side quests. As side quests desse jogo variam bastante em importância narrativa, mas são bem divertidas e recompensadoras, desenvolvendo melhor os personagens do jogo e entregando ao jogador itens extremamente úteis, como armas de munição infinita ou a habilidade de quick travel. É nessa parte do jogo que suas mecânicas mais ambiciosas e sua dedicação ao realismo aparecem. Por exemplo, todos os personagens seguem uma rota diária, e você consegue vê-los vivendo suas vidas em tempo real. Inclusive, o jogador até pode espionar pela janela da maioria das casas para ver o que os personagens estão fazendo lá dentro. Além disso, existem níveis de fome e cansaço e mecânicas de trocar e lavar roupa suja, se barbear (a barba de York cresce em tempo real) e abastecer seu carro. Mesmo que a mecânica de dirigir desse jogo seja meio quebrada, a forma que esses sistemas foram implementados aqui gera uma experiência bem interessante e única.

Agora finalmente falando da parte mais assustadora do jogo: seu port para o PC. O jogo é conhecido por ser quebrado em todas as plataformas, mas a versão de PC é especialmente quebrada. Primeiro de tudo, para rodar o jogo em resoluções altas (a maioria), é necessário baixar um mod. O jogo crasha frequentemente, e possui cutscenes específicas que congelam o jogo, e para continuar eu tive que rodar o jogo como admin, em janela e usar o modo de compatibilidade Windows XP pra passar. Além disso, os controles com mouse e teclado não são muito bons, e mesmo jogando com um controle os analógicos ficam invertidos e é necessário usar uma configuração da Comunidade Steam pra funcionar direito. Ah, e se você ficar passando rápido demais as locações no mapa do jogo ele eventualmente vai parar em Nárnia e o jogo crasha logo em seguida também. Esses aspectos introduzem a mecânica mais importante do jogo todo: os telefones de save. Não importa a situação, sempre que ver um telefone corra como se sua vida dependesse disso e salve o jogo para não perder seu progresso.

Deadly Premonition tem a reputação de ser um jogo ""tão ruim que é bom"", e eu não sei se eu consigo concordar 100% com essa afirmação. Eu não quero dizer com isso que ele seja um jogo excelente ou subestimado, longe disso, partes dele se encaixam perfeitamente nessa descrição. Porém isso não representa o jogo como um todo: ele também possui partes ótimas e elementos bem ambiciosos. Mas a verdade é que o que faz Deadly Premonition ser tão especial são os dois: o bom e o ruim. Não existe nenhum jogo como esse, e talvez nunca vá existir. Ele é de longe uma das melhores experiências que eu já tive jogando qualquer jogo e, mesmo sabendo que talvez seja um jogo que não agrade todos, é uma experiência que eu recomendaria de coração a todos que se interessaram ou ficaram curiosos. Minha única ressalva é o port do PC, que mesmo que adicione à aura de elementos quebrados do jogo também atrapalha e frustra bastante. No meu caso, eu acabei considerando que o bom superou o ruim e eu consegui me divertir mesmo assim. Mas, para os que decidirem dar uma chance apesar desses problemas, a experiência pode ser bem recompensadora.

[h1] I don't even know where to start with this janky mess… [/h1] 

It's mind-blowing, that the game was published in this state. The frame rates are all over the place and without switching to Windows XP compatibility mode, you’ll get nauseous quite quickly and, in my case, couldn’t even interact with the menu interface. Noticed halfway through the game that the narrow aiming window is not intentional, assumed it was just bad game design... Had to switch to Windows 98 comp mode for one section to aim up and down… I mean, jesus christ. [b] Dpfix is an absolute must! [/b]
Game crashed frequently and corrupted my save files on several occasions, [u] so you better make frequent backups [/u]. To my annoyance I had to restart the final confrontation after realising I can’t finish the fight without aiming up and down and then had to switch back to XP Mode because it crashed after the loading screen.

Graphically it’s atrocious, look like it belongs on the PS2 instead PS3 era.

Gameplay front’s not looking better either, it is by no means a hard or scary game. Music sounds like someone sat down on the piano keys, which obviously does nothing for keeping me tense. It's too bright to create even the slightest atmosphere, the enemies are slowly lurching around and can be outpaced by a brisk walk, so no danger whatsoever. Shooting the shambling horrors sends them tumbling like they want to send me off the pitch.
Don’t know if it’s a glitch or due to the insane amount of ammo dropped but I somehow never ran out of pistol or shotgun bullets. And you don’t even need them for the majority of the game, melee weapons are superior in every way. Bonk them once and they’re dead!
Honourable mentions to the QTEs, which caused 100% of my death and I passionately hate. Especially the sequence near end dragged on well beyond sensible.

Driving around gets rather tedious, map is too large with too little stuff. Perfectly straight roads shot me somersaulting through the air or stopped me dead in my tracks because I apparently collided with the geometry.

The Story is a right pick ‘n’ mix. Shocking revelations are accompanied by upbeat music, awkward yet very serious dialog and townsfolk looking and animating like sock puppets lend the whole experience a rather bizarre tone. 
Plot is otherwise fine; it builds up a nice little story and kept me interested enough to finish it, mainly because of our eccentric yet likable protagonist. [b] FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan [/b] is plain hilarious, taking everything in his stride while geeking out over his favourite movies or calmly and smilingly enter the twisted nightmare world. Having him walk around slowly like he’s the terminator never got boring.

Can’t recommend it enough, underneath all the janky design and questionable gameplay choices lies a unique experience that must be seen.

Descripción general: Deadly premonition es un juego de donde encarnamos al agente del FBI York, en el caso del asesinato de Anna, una joven que ha muerto de una manera muy macabra en un pequeño pueblo de Estados Unidos. Parece que hay algo sobrenatural en todo esto, Zach...

Puntos positivos del juego:
- Historia increible, que te hace querer saber más todo el rato.
- Personajes muy definidos que te hacen sentir de verdad parte de la historia.
- Pequeños detalles jugables que me han llamado la atención, como rellenar gasolina al coche o que te de la opción de mirar por las ventanas.
- Las sidequests son bastante entretenidas, en concreto por lo que te cuentan en ellas.

Puntos negativos del juego:
- El port a PC le hace falta mods para poder ejecutarse... y aun así, hay crashes. Mirad las guias de la comunidad, que te indican que debes hacer.
- Se le nota en los gráficos el paso del tiempo.

Здесь нет чего-то среднего, есть либо хорошо сделанное, либо отвратительно. И касается это, к сожалению, всех аспектов.

Хотя погодите, насчет технической составляющей я даже не знаю, какие плюсы можно привести. Уверен, многие бросали игру, так и не найдя в себе силы разобраться с вылетами или прочими багами. О чем свидетельствует процент получения достижения завершения второй главы... Часто здесь решение одного бага ведет к появлению другого, а тот, в свою очередь, может вызвать еще один баг. И ты играешь и буквально держишь пальцы, чтобы успеть сохраниться после какого-то затяжного сложного момента. Предположу, что дело во всратом порте с консоли на ПК. Серьезно, это самая забагованная игра, которую я только встречал. Суммарно я потратил около 3ч на то, чтобы установить какой-то баланс между неработающим куском г и работающей исправно игрухой. Проблемы с частыми вылетами, с падающим почти до нуля ни на чем фпс, фризами на пустом месте, с сохранениями, со стрельбой, с полноэкранным режимом, с выставлением режима совместимости, с цветами, которые были до портирования другими и с тем, что иногда игра не запускалась, либо внутри нее невозможно было продолжить с момента сохранения - она просто висла. Я всего уже и не вспомню - иногда охватывала паника, когда в интернете не было решения проблемы. 

Кроме багов - в некоторых игровых механиках технически - игра просто отвратительна. Я говорю о вождении на высокой скорости, когда авто может просто на пустой дороге перевернуть набок, развернувшись в обратном направлении. Или когда врезаешься в другие авто или заборы при вождении. Просто 0 физики, бревно сталкивается с бревном. Да и стрельба оставляет желать лучшего: не представляю, насколько она была бы плохой без автонаведения.

Тогда почему я дал игре шанс, спросите вы? Во-первых, по рекомендации товарища и по рекомендации StopGame. Во-вторых, потому что меня по-настоящему увлекла детективная история, пусть в какой-то момент и выглядевшей чересчур жесткой. 

Практически до финала игры я был уверен, что это - настоящий самородок, спрятанный в пещере стима среди багов. Который большинство не стали откапывать. Я прошел все дополнительные задания, они были также интересны, как и сюжет, ни одного не было проходного. Я нашел все предметы и познакомился со всеми персонажами - они здесь отлично прописаны, каждый уникален. Я находил оправдание тому, что вроде оставлялось для додумывания, всячески защищал игру, но черт возьми, я ненавижу, когда концовки делают из побуждений ""а давай вот так, это более ярко будет для вызывания эмоций"". Хать пфу на такие решения, можно было и две концовки сделать.

Тем не менее, авторам каким-то невероятным мастерством удается после абсолютно не понравившейся мне концовки - передать открытое чувство свободы, лёгкости, раннего солнечного утра, когда день обещает быть добрым. И как игровой опыт, как отдельная история - этот продукт очень интересен. Но второй раз, конечно же, перепроходить не рекомендую - потому что тогда спадет весь шарм и обнажатся те странные игровые решения, вроде чрезмерно затянутых передвижений по городу, в которых игра не стесняясь жрет впустую время. Да и детектива уже не будет.

Кстати, очень рекомендую заглянуть после финала игры в раздел меню ""Дополнительно"". Странно, что он был заблокирован всю игру - там очень интересные материалы. Вроде живых фоток тех мест, которыми вдохновлялись создатели и с которых списывали образы мест в игре. Прям кайф.",1630504626,1630699507,True,19,0,0.720012187957763672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В них можно поверить, именно вся эта сентиментальность происходящего, нелепость и простота, дает чувство того что это игра. Нечто подобное я испытывал когда первый раз играл в RE4,  где после мрачной деревни, тебя встречает задорный торговец.

Игра интересная, но очень багованная. За все прохождение раз 30 пропадал звук, два раза побилось единственное сохранение, раз 50 вылетал на рабочий стол и приходилось переигрывать заново. Но что-то заставляло возвращаться к прохождению снова и снова. Наверное, необычный захватывающий сюжет, запоминающийся главный герой и желание узнать, чем же все происходящее закончится.

Игра портит сохранения! Перед тем, как начинать играть, обязательно установите, настройте и запустите скрипт из этого гайда https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=613643430 иначе когда у вас побьется единственный файл сохранения на середине игры, будет очень обидно. 

Также очень осторожно читайте гайды по сайд квестам на сторонних сайтах, я так проспойлерил себе уже в начале игры, что ""убийца-садовник"" и было очень неприятно. А еще игра неправильно распознает XInput геймпад, хоть в магазине и указано, что контроллер поддерживается полностью (на самом деле, перепутано управление камерой). Также обидно, что игра слишком легкая, это касается как обычных врагов, так и боссов. Огромный минус, что на карте нельзя ставить маркеры, а саму карту нельзя увеличивать, в результате, чтобы добраться в нужную точку, приходится десять раз заходить в меню, открывать карту и долго прокручивать ее в стороны.

Графика в игре отрисовывается в 720p, также она очень простая, времен PS2, и блеклая. Конечно, ее можно улучшить, как и выставить родное разрешение экрана, но почему-то в моем случае это приводило к вылетам при запуске в полноэкранном режиме.

Советую пройти чисто ради сюжета, особенно тем, кто любит все таинственное и мистическое. Главное, ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО поставьте скрипт для автоматического бэкапа сохранения.

Я, с вашего позволения, позволю себе рассказать, как более, чем на 70 часов игрового времени меня посетило Смертельное предчувствие. Случилось это спонтанно, на распродаже, и не покидало с самого начала игры почти до самого её конца. То есть рассказать есть о чём.
Это предчувствие во мне вызвали мистика и сюрреализм, характерные для произведений Дэвида Линча, и являющиеся основными составляющими игры под названием Deadly Premonition.
Игра обладает достоинствами, схожими с произведениями вышеупомянутого господина Линча, времен Малхолланд Драйв и Шоссе в никуда. При этом она густо приправлена шармом Твин Пикса, и иногда беззастенчиво чуть ли не полностью копирует персонажей сего нетленного произведения, не побоюсь этого слова, искусства.
Главным достоинством Deadly Premonition, на мой взгляд, является сюжет. В нём переплетаются психологический триллер, сверхъестественность, абсурд, детективное расследование и добротный атмосферный хоррор.
Вторым основным достоинством этого неоднозначного творения, по моему мнению, являются персонажи. Почти каждый из них чем-то интересен, а пресных нет вовсе.
Третьей примечательной чертой я считаю атмосферу, качественно погрузившую меня в происходящее.
Остальные же аспекты показались мне ужасными: для года выхода игры картинка выглядит устаревшей, механика стрельбы заставила страдать, звук создаёт впечатление, что озвучиванием занимались вручную при помощи окружающих предметов, а поездки на автомобилях напоминают пьяные гонки. Всё, что касается геймплея, сделано действительно из рук вон плохо. О комфорте мне пришлось забыть, наоборот, сквозь игровые моменты приходилось продираться, словно через препятствие на пути к отличной истории.
Deadly Premonition - авторское детище со своими, порой малопонятными, логикой и структурой, что, как я считаю, придётся по вкусу далеко не каждому. Играя в него, не стоит опираться на опыт прохождения похожих игр. Оно самобытно. Не один раз я пытался сообразить, что происходит и, чтобы это понять, слушал всё внимательно и проходил дополнительные задания, более подробно раскрывающие сюжет.
Коли уж в качестве основного достоинства я упомянул сюжет, остановлюсь на нём чуть более подробно. Протагонист игры, агент ФБР с признаками биполярного расстройства, волею судьбы оказывается в маленьком заштатном американском городке с целью расследования убийства молодой девушки. На этом я понял, что основным референсом стал великий сериал про городок, где совы не то, чем кажутся. Убитая была обнаружена местными детьми прибитой к дереву в красивой позе и со вспоротым животом. ГГ приступает к расследованию убийства, заранее готовый к происходящему, поскольку следы серийного убийства тянутся в городок Гринвейл из других штатов и других дел, которые детективу приходилось расследовать раньше. Умерщвления на этом не останавливаются, а расследование раскрывает агенту насколько глубока кроличья нора, швыряя в неё целиком. 
Сам же городок таит немало тайн и секретов, а также изобилует странными жителями. Добрые и фактурные на вид, почти каждый из них что-то скрывает. Среди них-то мне и пришлось отыскать маньяка, а в дальнейшем выяснить, что помимо серийного убийцы, городок таит в себе кого-то более опасного.
Поскольку выше я упоминал интересных персонажей, добавлю, что все они обладают индивидуальными характерами и хорошо озвучены, что немало способствует погружению в атмосферу происходящего.
Если Вы готовы ради интересного сюжета перетерпеть убогий геймплей, то считаю, что Deadly Premonition нужно прочувствовать самому, погрузившись в атмосферу, послушав монологи героя и его гадания на кофе, пообщавшись с персонажами и осмотрев местные достопримечательности. Предполагаю, что она Вам понравится и Вы пройдёте её до конца, насладившись интересной историей. Если же для Вас основным фактором является геймплей, то не стоит и начинать знакомиться с данной поделкой, ибо в этом случае Вас ожидают десятки часов болезненных страданий.
Подводя итог, отмечу, что Deadly Premonition не подлежит объективной оценке, слишком много в ней контрастов. Она хороша и ужасна одновременно.
Засим, поскольку ради сюжета я привык ко всем геймплейным неурядицам и регулярным вылетам, 8 загадочных кастрюль из 10.

The game is about a detective, who is investigating a murder case in some small town, where people know each other, the detective have weird sense of humor, loves movies, you may find that he has split personality, but that will be explained later in the game and reveals the reason of what is going on, so no spoilers here.

Gameplay is average, kinda repetitive, QTE ( quick time events ) can be super fast at times.

i like how randomly while driving a car he starts talking about old movies, he legit gives you brief story about the movie and who are some or the main actor(s) in it, a nice touch.

the story may seem weird, as what you fight has nothing to do much with how the case is going, like you would feel it is weird, but overall, it fills something to do, else the game would be empty and just puzzle solving.

annoyingly enough, on stage 2 i was being hardlocked into a stage where the game crashes, where i had to put compatibility on windows xp sp 2, literally... not win 7 or 8 or even vista, XP...

overall i give it a solid 6.5/10, buy it at discount, the story outside of the weirdness it has, is worth it.",1628542207,1628542207,True,5,0,0.51011127233505249,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The inspiration is obvious from the start. Small town murder of a young girl, a lone FBI agent comes to investigate, links it to previous cases, takes over the entire case, with many strange townsfolk, dreams, and surreal sequences somehow helping him with the investigation, fourth wall breaks all around. For a bit, that's all the game seems to be. But it quickly develops its own flavour that distinguishes it from Twin Peaks, and it's actually pretty well written for the most part. It gets much more messed up than the original Twin Peaks, and both to it's credit and fault; much more goofy. All in all, this is what gives DP its charm. A wonderful, cheesy game that is plagued by technical issues. 

What are the technical issues then? Let's start with controls. WTF are these controls? Aiming in this game is unnecessarily awkward. By default; left is up, right is down, down is left, up is right. If you invert the vertical axis, that improves the situation by a little bit. Luckily, if you press R2/RT, you automatically centre onto your target, which helps a lot. Another big issue is the random crashing and freezing that happens occasionally. That combined with the tendency of save files to corrupt, you'll need to back up your save file for your own sake. Other than that, graphics in this game are beautiful in how terrible they are. Locked to 720P with a weird green filter, the game looks plastic, the anti-aliasing is horrible. The driving physics are hilarious, you will literally fly with a fast enough car. If you download a file named DPFIX, this will allow you to play on higher resolutions and overall improved graphics. The game then looks a lot better, but certain scenes as well as the pause menu will be darker for some reason (or at least that's what happened to me). Overall, this has to be the worst port of a game I've played in a while, but at the same time, it feels pretty good.

What do I mean? The entire game is like this. It seems like it is a horrid, awful game. But it's actually genius. The characters, the story, and the soundtrack are so likeable, that the faults begin to compliment the positives. I love these types of games,  such as Shenmue, Deus Ex, Oblivion, Chaser, Worms, Postal, etc. The characters in this game are wonderful, especially Special Agent Francis York Morgan and his friend Zach. He's cocky, rude at times, strange, spiteful, but at the same time he is kind, funny, and has a strong moral code. He's an alternative to Dale Cooper, maybe a mix of him and Albert Rosenfield. My favourite pair of characters involve Harry Stewart and his assistant Micheal Tillotson. Stewart is wheelchair-bound and struggles to be heard, so Micheal speaks for him, always in a small poem. There are many other awesome characters, but it's too hard to mention them all.

Another thing that makes DP unique is its combination of genres. It's simultaneously a horror game, a mystery, a fishing simulator, a racing game, and an open world RPG. There a total of 50 sidequests in this game, involving various members of the town. I won't spoil any of them, as they are all quite amusing. The majority of the time the gameplay flow is this: Cutscene, dream sequence, drive around, talk to people (often a cutscene), shoot zombie like enemies in strange mutated versions of in game locations, investigate for clues, run away from the killer, repeat. It's a pretty satisfying loop. There are several weapons in the game; both ranged and melee. That includes pistols, magnums, rifles, shotguns. As well as; pipes, crowbars, swords, axes. An amusing element of this game is that you get paid for nearly everything you do. Whether you shave, save the game, view the weather report, defeat enemies, collect medals or cards, drive around for a while, etc. It's well paid to be an FBI agent, apparently.

The soundtrack is delightful, and it functions the same way the Twin Peaks soundtrack does. There's a song for every situation, emotion, even for some characters. ""The Woods and the Goddess"" is one of the best songs I've heard in any game. ""Life is Beautiful"" (the whistle song) is perfect. I can't get it out of my head. It's awesome how many times this song appears in the game, and how frequently it does so in inappropriate situations. Which makes the song all the better. The rest of the soundtrack is spectacular, too. Such as the haunting ""Greenvale"" that flawlessly encapsulates the entire feeling of the game, reminiscent of the Laura Palmer theme. ""FBI Special Agent"" is incredible, feels exactly like York. Makes every drive feel important. ""Comic Relief"" for humorous situations. ""Underground"" for creepy and mysterious vibes. ""After the Rain"" for sadness. And a soul-stirring cover of ""Amazing Grace"" to top it off. A faultless soundtrack, one my favourites.

Deadly Premonition is probably the best game of all time, isn't that right, Zach?",1627487407,1680691404,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cannot recommend this port for the simple sake of it being frustrating to setup and fix, in the case of not being as lucky as me you'll probably hit a wall and just beat yourself to it.

Deadly Premonition самый необычный проект на моей памяти и если вы справитесь с решением технических проблем игры, вы получите отличную историю с долей сюра, и интересными поворотами в расследовании дела. Геймплэйно здесь можно вспомнить и Resident Evil, и Silent Hill. Управление, хоть и не самое отзывчивое, но к нему быстро привыкаешь, и особых трудностей для меня оно не вызвало.

Em primeiro lugar, é preciso deixar claro que TODAS as versões desse jogo são problemáticas em alguma medida diferente. A versão de 360 possui uma boa taxa de quadros, mas, por algum raio de motivo, a câmera é travada no ombro do personagem, e você não consegue se orientar nem ver o que acontece. Já o PS3 e o Switch rodam na casa dos 20 FPS. 

A versão de PC, que aqui está sendo analisada, trata-se de um port feito nas coxas, em 720p e 30 FPS, com problemas constantes envolvendo crashes, bugs no áudio e na saturação das cores, e mapeamento dos botões caso você jogue com um controle (isso se o controle for reconhecido).

Dito isso, caso você tenha paciência para passar umas boas duas horas baixando patches da comunidade e fazendo as configurações necessárias para corrigir todos os problemas listados, a versão de PC é, ironicamente, também a melhor para se jogar Deadly Premonition -- que se beneficia muito bem com 4K, 60 FPS e gráficos retrabalhados, fluidez indispensável para deixar um jogo já muito datado para sua época adequado para quem deseja visitá-lo (ou revisitá-lo) em 2020. 

Feita a longa introdução, falarei apenas brevemente do jogo.

Deadly Premonition é um jogo imperfeito, desleixado, travado e feio. Apesar de lançado na geração do 360/PS3, parece mais com um do início da geração do PS2. Ainda assim, é um dos mais singulares, originais e fascinantes jogos que você poderá ter o prazer de jogar em sua vida. Enquanto você joga, você percebe que é um jogo ambicioso e feito com amor, e que os desenvolvedores deram seu máximo para entregar o que pretendiam, mesmo com todas as limitações orçamentárias e de escopo. 

As próprias limitações do jogo acabam, por vezes, sendo subvertidas e usadas ao seu favor pelos desenvolvedores, que pareciam ter noção da falta de polimento do título. Assim, o jogo muitas vezes adota um tom absurdo e não se leva a sério, desde os diálogos e personagens estereotipados, até o uso de recursos visuais e sonoros ""bregas"" para lembrar o jogador de que Deadly Premonition deve ser apreciado como um bom B-Movie de terror.

Ainda assim, apesar de toda a tosquice (proposital e acidental), a história aqui contada é fantástica, ao ponto de te deixar encarando os créditos boquiaberto com o final, que dispensa comentários. Apesar de ser um título de terror, o gameplay se assemelha muito ao de jogos como Shenmue e Yakuza: você está em um mundo aberto, e o principal atrativo é a interatividade com tudo o que é aparentemente mundano e ordinário, como pescar, preparar um almoço ou simplesmente conhecer as pessoas da sua vizinhança.

Deadly Premonition não é um jogo que vai agradar a todos. Foi feito para agradar um nicho muito específico de jogadores com um determinado tipo de sensibilidade. Se você é fã de Twin Peaks e já se aventurou por outros ""clássicos imperfeitos"" (como o próprio Shenmue citado há pouco), vá fundo, pois esse poderá se tornar rapidamente um de seus jogos favoritos. Como já mencionado ao início dessa análise, o port de PC é problemático e injogável sem o auxílio de patches da comunidade e outros ajustes, mas caso você tenha paciência para ""polir"" o jogo, será recompensado com um gameplay fluído, gráficos atualizados e raros problemas técnicos. Mas, mesmo assim, pegue-o em uma promoção; não é muito sábio pagar valor cheio em um port problemático que requer esforço do jogador para funcionar como deveria.

Por fim, caso queiram uma análise real, detalhada e de muito bom gosto do jogo, recomendo que leiam a do site Destructoid, que deu uma nota 10 a Deadly Premonition, mesmo com os inúmeros defeitos do jogo. Afinal, Deadly Premonition é -- perdoe-me o clichê -- uma experiência sem igual, e vai te marcar de um jeito que poucos jogos podem ser capazes.",1625789047,1625789436,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yo intentaré crear una guía para jugar en óptimas condiciones.

No utilicé el DPFix, así que en la próxima vuelta al juego, intentaré aplicar lo anterior junto con el DPfix para ver qué tal corre el juego en otra PC que tengo por allí, básicamente haré una instalación desde 0 para ver los resultados y comunicar si funciona correctamente.

Если ты, как и я, заинтересовался Deadly Premonition после легендарного сериала Twin Peaks (отметься лайком, интересно сколько нас), истинно тебе скажу - насладиться бытом сельского городка, утопающего в хвойных северных лесах, где провинциальный уют граничит с людскими пороками и силами зла, у тебя НИ КОИМ ОБРАЗОМ НЕ ПОЛУЧИТСЯ (!!!). Данное произведение заставит тебя вспомнить все известные ругательства, ибо:

1. Ты познаешь тяготы войны с багами, о половине из которых станет известно только в ходе игры. 

2. Deadly Premonition вышла в 2013 г., однако графика в ней выглядит на 10 лет моложе и наруливать более-менее играбельный вид предстоит через конфиг, ведь настройки изображения в игре напрочь отсутствуют.

3. В геймплее уйма времени уйдет на открывание дверей и демонстрацию найденного лута. 
Эта игра вообще взбесит своей медлительностью. 

4. Половину геймплея (ту же аркадную стрельбу по зомби) можно было бы успешно вырезать не потеряв ни кванта сюжета.

5. Deadly Premonition - симулятор топографического кретинизма. Карта в игре ""картонна"" и не интуитивна - придется ездить наугад, а потом бранясь искать ближайшую автозаправку. 

6. Анимации в катсценах едва лучше, чем в фанатских cleo-миссиях из GTA San Andreas.

7. В саундтреке есть неплохие мотивы, но все треки цикличны и включаются весьма резко.

So when last part of the game wil start, with all bosses - switch to windows 98 compability mode, it will allow you to aim any direction, but will significantly increase loading time[/h1]

I wanted to start my description with a plot. I've played this game just for cutscenes, humor and detective investigation. In my opinion nothing comes close to this game in balance of ""who did it"" mystery and setting of weird surreal realism. I like attention to the details and characters. Almost every vehicle has it's own music theme which fits it's owner. Even mini games here weird, for example I never see darts like in this game anywhere else. I'm rarely laught at comedies and intentional jokes, but this game just makes me laught all of the time with it's bizzare setups for scenes and surreal humor. Cinematography and music here great too. Some mise-en-scenes are printed in my mind, like [spoiler] shot where Emily and York kissing surrounded by ""goddesses of forest"" [/spoiler]. Only sometime I feel like music used randomly or without restriction, for example ""Miss Stiletto Heels"" used too frequently in a last portion of game in my opinion so this track loose it's emotional weight.
And now the thing which hold this game from being a masterpiece for me. It's battle sections. They are nor challenging, nor entertaining. Gameplay itself is junky, but it's not the main problem. Main problem for me is leight of levels. With battle system like this it's just feels like a chore and my brain keep thinking not about evading enemies, but why there's another hall or room? Levels like lumbermill and police station is a nightmare, the're long, not interteining, boring and fill with useless rooms. Worst offender here is long halls with a ceiling ghosts, they constantly get invincible and you're just forced to wait between attacks. 
I'm still very happy that I've played this game. For me the chores of bad battle system, boring levels and even softlocking on final boss (because of the compability mode settings) are worth to be played to see next cutscene or enjoy exploring this weird real-surreal place and characters which inhabit it.",1625441156,1625441156,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Она полна технических неполадок и недоделок, но сюжет и необыкновенная атмосфера всё это компенсируют!  Сюжет в духе кинофильма «Твин Пикс» Дэвида Линча и книги «Сосны» Блейка Крауча. Он закручивается постепенно, втягивает вас в круговорот событий, и вот вы уже не можете оторваться от экрана. Отличный финал! Он меня порадовал и не был предсказуемым. 
Вы играете за специального агента Фрэнсиса Йорка Моргана, который приехал в маленький городок Гринвейл расследовать жестокое убийство молодой девушки. Сможете ли вы разгадать тайну убийств  красного семени и остаться живым в схватке с убийцей в плаще? Всё это зависит от вашей реакции и терпения… Сможете ли вы справиться с бесконечными вылетами из игры? Иногда на одном и том же месте они повторяются огромное количество раз! Мне лично помогла перемотка времени (с помощью сигарет) и переход в оконный режим игры. 
Графика в игре на троечку: всё выглядит коряво и квадратно. Анимация сделана настолько деревянно… иначе просто никак не назовешь. Руки бы оторвал за такую рисовку! Управление в игре странноватое, но приспособиться можно. Больше всего бесят вылеты, а не управление. В конечном итоге ты просто привыкаешь и стараешься не замечать недочетов, потому что сюжет настолько затягивает тебя, все герои становятся родными, и ты переживаешь и волнуешься за каждого. 
Очень хочется отметить прекрасное музыкальное сопровождение. Все композиции отлично подобраны и помогают передать окружающую обстановку: местами загадочную, тревожную, грустную, местами трогательную… Мне очень понравилась «Life is beautiful», мелодия Йорка и Эмили, как я её называю. Милая и романтичная… 
Общее отношение к игре положительное. Такая игра должна находиться в библиотеке у каждого, так как она оригинальна и специфична по своей сути. Настоятельно рекомендую к прохождению!

Пора бы её заменить новой, но она ещё работает и справляется со своим предназначением. Порой, правда, отчебучивает такие фортеля, что не знаешь, как исправить очередную поломку. Но справившись, вздыхаешь с облегчением. Одной проблемой стало меньше.

В Deadly Premonition даже простой запуск требует подготовки. Следует сразу накатить фанатскую приблуду для поддержки пользовательских разрешений экрана. Поставить на основной файл режим совместимости с Windows 98, а на лаунчер запуск от имени администратора. Это приведёт к проседанию кадров, но улучшит стабильность. И, возможно, поставить русификатор. Его явно тестировали, спустя рукава, там полно ошибок с вылезающим за границы текстом, отсутствует перевод подсветки имён, есть путаница с полом персонажей, и даже в наличии нелепая ошибка в сюжетной головоломке, где вместо зелёного цвета указан синий. Но, при всех косяках, он не так уж плох.

Если вы провели надлежащую техническую подготовку, то всё равно стоит помнить, что игра вылетает стабильно примерно раз в час. Поэтому сохраняться нужно по малейшему поводу. При этом нельзя сохраняться рядом с ""Млечным сарайчиком"" и у общественного центра. Я так, по незнанию, засейвился у магазина и потом игра постоянно вылетала при загрузке, помог только режим совместимости с последующим сохранением у нормального телефона. Воспринимать сей аспект стоит как данность, нервов не хватит каждый раз раздражаться от очередного вылета. Только и выдержка и спокойствие помогут пройти эту игру.

Deadly Premonition интересна в первую очередь сюжетом. В провинциальном городке Гринвейл (дурацкое название, всё время называл его то так, то Гриндейл) развиваются события, очень сильно напоминающие ""Твин Пикс"". Происходит убийство девушки-официантки, которое приезжает расследовать агент ФБР. Он лоялен к использованию мистических подходов, любит кофе. В городе есть лесопилка, отель, офис шерифа, закусочная, дама с предметом в руках и странные мистические силы. При таком сильном сходстве, игра всё же имеет свою собственную идентичность. На мистический детектив накладываются чисто японские юмористические сценки, сопровождаемые нелепой лицевой анимацией. Местами может выглядеть глупо, но в комплексе этот коктейль выглядит органичным.

Возможно, было бы лучше, если бы игра была интерактивным фильмом, наподобие тех, что делала Telltale в последние годы своего существования. Но разработчики решили иначе, вроде как под давлением издателя. У нас в распоряжении есть целый город, в котором... нечего делать. По улицам никто не ходит. Машины едут непонятно куда. Доступных для посещения мест минимум. Карту нельзя просмотреть полностью. Есть определённый масштаб и его никак не уменьшить. Приблизить можно, отдалить ещё сильнее нет. Если увеличить карту во время поездки, то она будет закрывать почти пол-экрана. Маркеры есть, отметить ничего нельзя. Возьмёте квесты на исследование мистических мест - их указатели будут отображаться даже после их прохождения, постоянно мешая.

В городе постоянно идёт время. Очень медленно, почти как настоящее. Пропускать можно курением или сном. На карте нет расписания, нет указания часов работы какого-то заведения или времени, когда персонажи будут дома. Примерное время нужно держать в голове. У главного героя есть показатели усталости и голода. Поэтому нужно периодически спать/закидываться кофе/корневым пивом и есть. Не то, чтобы это сильно обременяло, но какой-то сильной необходимости в этом нет. К тому же, до последней главы после полуночи на улицах будут появляться местные сибито и ГИГАНТСКИЕ ДЕМОНИЧЕСКИЕ СОБАКИ, живительными пинками намекая вам, что пора поспать.

Передвигаться по городу можно на машине, главное привыкнуть к чувствительному управлению и проблем возникать не будет. Автопарк будет постепенно расширяться, новые машины можно приобретать на свалке. У каждой свои характеристики скорости, управления, разгона. Беда, что у каждой есть показатели целостности и горючего. Если разбивание машины не проблема, всегда можно пересесть в новую патрульную или вызвать вспышкой, то вот заправка всего одна и ехать до неё не близко. Поэтому лучше менять машины как можно чаще. Лучшая машина - автомобиль Йорка, она не разрушима, но топливо нужно и ей, хотя расход его ощутимо меньше, чем у других. От тачки также зависит музыка, проигрываемая во время поездки. Странное решение, но что есть, то есть.

Ситуацию со скукой немного исправляют побочные квесты. Их всего пятьдесят и они призваны лучше раскрыть жителей города. Но и тут есть загвоздка. Они доступны только в определённых главах. У одного квестодателя нельзя выполнять квесты подряд, если не прошло хотя бы 24 часа (это не точно) или не было продвижения по сюжету. К тому же, многие завязаны на конкретное время и погоду. В каком-то обзоре упоминали дни недели, это ложь, в игре нет дней недели. К счастью, главы можно переигрывать. Но в них нельзя сохраняться, а статус квестов и полученных предметов переносится в основное сохранение только после завершения главы и подтверждения сохранения. С учётом возможности вылета в любой момент - это очень небезопасное занятие. Советую, как можно быстрее выполнить задание Джорджа, чтобы получить радио. Это открывает доступ к быстрому перемещению в уже посещённые места. Тут тоже есть нюанс, некоторые дома открываются для телепорта только если игрок заглядывал в их окно.

При столкновении с врагами игра превращается в кастрированный Resident Evil 4. Есть автоприцеливание, но оно всегда концентрируется в паху, а не на голове. Тем не менее, даже такое оно полезно. Свободное же прицеливание очень медленное и шатающееся. С другой стороны это компенсируется общей слабостью врагов. По крайней мере, до появления вооружённых теней. Таких лучше убивать сразу или задерживать дыхание, чтобы они стреляли в воздух. Впрочем, если враги не загораживают проход, можно просто их оббежать и не тратить время. Лишь в некоторых местах по сюжету убийства обязательны, так как с теней падают ключевые предметы. Наиболее противные противники - бабы из вентиляции. От них нельзя скрыться, их заставляют убивать. Каждая выдерживает где-то четыре попадания из магнума. С оружием проблем возникать не должно. Я ещё толком не продвинулся по сюжету, а у меня уже было четыре ствола с бесконечным боезапасом. А в самом-самом конце можно получить ракетницу, убивающую с одного удара газонокосилку и световой меч. Как раз тогда, когда это всё уже не нужно. Лучше б дали бесконечный автомат, почему-то это единственное оружие, к которому надо покупать патроны.

Помимо перестрелок будут встречаться столкновения с убийцей в дождевике. Они всегда построены по одной и той же схеме. Сперва надо уклониться от атаки в кутэе, потом прятаться в шкафу, задерживая дыхание, и после убегать в очередном кутэе. И так раза четыре за игру.

Боссы тоже имеются, их три. И все битвы проходят в финале почти подряд. Учитывая местную боевую систему, никакой сложности они не представляют. Хотя у второго и есть прикольные формы, справиться с ним не тяжело. Вся тактика сводится к попаданию в уязвимое место и уклонение от атак в кутэе. Наиболее ужасна вторая фаза третьего босса, которая представляет собой затяжной побег, с постоянным долблением кнопок. Очень утомительный эпизод.

Кроме квестов, есть ещё и сбор коллекционных карточек. Часть валяется на карте, часть дают за выполнение заданий. Самые замороченные - получаемые в рыбалке или путём перепрохождения других миров. Правда, последние становятся проще, не нужно искать ключи, решать головоломки и убийца в дождевике не появляется. Но всё равно, чтобы найти карточку, приходится пройти почти всю локацию. А она может уже и так осточертеть, если после неё был вылет.

Игра может или понравиться или нет.

А теперь хочется подробнее рассказать чем игра смогла заслужить такое мое отношение.

   Сюжет. Диалоги.
Здесь игра заслуживает максимальной оценки. SWERY умело интригует и подбрасывает подсказки. Он втягивает игрока в круговорот событий очень незаметно и ты даже не успеваешь понять как тебя уже не оторвать от экрана. Автор изящно водит за нос и уже при втором прохождении ты понимаешь, что все лежало на поверхности. Но самым величайшим кайфом для меня было то, что игра заставила думать, строить теории и взывала к фантазии. И знаете что? В кое-чем я оказалась права, но такого финала я не ожидала! Для кого-то это наркомания, но я вижу в этом просто удивительную вселенную, в которую хочется периодически мысленно возвращаться. Что до второстепенных квестов, то они очень милы и для меня были интересны. Местами очень юморные.
Диалоги в игре под стать сюжету - не просты, а загадочны, но при этом точны и несущие всю необходимую суть.

   Персонажи.
По сути ключевых персонажей меньше, чем пальцев на одной руке, но то, как они прописаны, заставляет проникнуться ими. Безусловно самым любимым персонажем для меня является Фрэнсис Йорк Морган. Чудаковатый, умный, проницательный, харизматичный и даже симпатичный персонаж смог покорить мое сердце.

  Саундтрек. Атмосфера.
Безупречно. Некая тягучесть одних композиций очень хорошо передает загадочность. А динамичность других отлично контрастирует и побуждает к движению. Есть композиции трогательные и милые, а есть такие, что бьют в самое сердце и оседают в мозгу навсегда. Все выполнено со вкусом и ничего лишнего. (Выбрать любимую композицию сложно, но если выбирать, то это ""York AND Zach"")
Атмосфера в игре идеально передается авторами как саундтреком, так и визуально. Меня покорил параллельный мир кошмара. Он настолько затягивающий и загадочный. Тут ощущается хоррор. А в противовес этому мы видим реальный мир, который наполнен не просто зданиями с одинаковым наполнением - каждая квартира, дом и помещение обставлено под стать характера персонажа, как основного, так и даже самого мелкого второстепенного. Поразил размер городка - масштаб как города, так и зданий ощущается как настоящий. Это радует.

   Геймплей.
Меня предупреждали, что игра странная во многих отношениях. И в плане геймплея тоже. На удивление я быстро приспособилась и прохождение для меня было очень приятным за исключением багов, но о них скажу позже. Автор смог соединить механики совсем разных жанров и получилась отличная солянка. Тут и можно пострелять, и есть какая-то вариативность диалогов, есть миниигры, есть симулятор жизни. Но скажу, что есть недоработки и явно можно было сделать местами все поинтереснее. Например физика поведения автомобиля напрочь отсутствует.
Сложность в этом издании понизили, что стало для меня спасением. Данная сложность оптимальна для того, чтобы можно было насладиться сюжетом, но и не пробежать игру на скорости света.

   Баги
Как выяснилось, большинство багов вызваны костюмами из дополнений. Видимо их анимация в роликах приводит к вылету. [u]Поэтому рекомендую наплевать на плюшки и проходить игру в двух оригинальных костюмах[/u]. А другие баги тоже оказалось возможным обойти. 

[i]Я могу писать бесконечно, но придется углубляться уже описывая конкретные моменты, где не обойдется без спойлеров. Поэтому скажу так:[/i]
Игра не только заслуживает хорошей оценки, заниженной за счет недочетов игры в плане геймплея, забагованности и пары недостатков в плане дизайна, но и должна находиться в библиотеке любого человека, который ценит глубокие оригинальные специфические игры, которые по сути и просто играми не назвать. Это не развлечение, а скорее замечательная книга, переложенная на язык игры. Явление, которое если пережить, то планка требовательности к сюжетным играм может резко возрасти.

Да, не один Линч работал над сериалом, то что делает Линч в одиночку, вы можете наблюдать по продолжению 17-го года. Сцены изобилуют отсылками и автор (Swery65, он же Хидетака Суехиро) регулярно превозносит кино и сериалы 90-х. Если вы пробьетесь через устаревшую графику, кривое управление и рудиментарный геймплей то игра наградит вас отличной музыкой и великолепным сюжетом. И все это — в непередаваемой атмосфере мистического детектива в маленьком американском городке (как его видит иностранец). Как и в оригинальном сериале, отсылкой к которому является игра, здесь есть место ярким персонажам и чудоковатому юмору, который нужен чтобы мрачная и жестокая история побольнее ударила вам в спину когда вы расслабитесь. И последнее — играйте в оконном режиме, иначе вы дропнете игру на старте от постоянных вылетов. И потеряете очень многое. Для меня это однозначный шедевр, из тех что запоминаются до конца жизни.

Каждый из нас хочет найти нечто, что бы затронуло его сухую и очерствевшую в пучине современного массового контента душу, что-то своё. Найти то, что создаст ту самую химию внутри нас и вновь пробудит девятилетнего ребенка полного удивления и восхищения.

Ни для кого не секрет, мы имеем тенденцию фанатеть и создавать культ вокруг вещей, которые слишком хороши, чтобы оставаться на сером фоне. И будем честны, многие из них стали предметом поклонения далеко не благодаря своей ординарности. Мы не влюбляемся в симметричные идеалы, мы любим те вещи, которых не находим в других, их особенности, их самобытность, их странность, их шероховатости и даже недостатки. Мы влюбляемся в то, что выделяется, и Deadly Premonition выделяется слишком во многих аспектах, чтобы остаться просто игрой.

Японцы короли самобытности. Для многих из нас Япония стоит выше статуса просто страны, эти черти заслужили в нашей культуре звание своей маленькой вселенной.  Своим своеобразием японская культура во многом будто стоит особняком от всего остального мира, им удается абстрагироваться от всех остальных и сохранять собственную культуру в своей особой форме, но ее исключительность и значимость на фоне всего мира остается фактом. Я люблю японский геймдев, он, что называется, ебал в рот весь запад с их выстроенными за многие годы принципами создания игр, геймдизайном, киношностью, подходом к подаче сюжета, юмором и устоявшимися механиками. Японцы почти всегда остаются на своей волне, работают по-своему и это делает их произведения особенными (к слову о том, что резидент начиная с 7 части начал смотреть на запад и похоронил тем самым серию, но сейчас не об этом), Deadly Premonition лишь один из таких примеров, но, пожалуй, один из самых ярких. Примером того, как можно положить болт на то, как надо, и делать то, как будет круто. Как будет круто и здорово по мнение одного определенного челика. 

Хидетака Шухиро (Swery65) сценарист и главный директор, а так же дизайнер DP. Для кого-то он гений, способный конкурировать с Кодзимой по уровню своеобразия своих взглядов на игры, для кого-то недоделанный киношник, который не умеет ни туда, ни туда. У Swery есть стиль и он не боится его показать. Он, как и Хидео, рос на кино и, более того, на крутом кино.

Твин Пикс Дэвида Линча в своё время произвел фурор и зародил целое поколение фанатов, оно и понятно почему. Все знают Линча, все понимают, КАКИЕ фильмы он снимает. Линч делает не просто авторское кино, он делает артхаус, у него есть свои подходы и взгляды, из-за чего его фильмы сильно отличаются от привычного и приобретают чёткий авторский окрас. Твин Пикс не самое его изощренное произведение, но самое массовое, его крутили в 90х по тв, а не в кино. С соавторством Линча сериал не просто стал технической и художественной революцией того времени, но и приобрёл ту самую недостающую изюминку, которую он добавлял в свои авторские фильмы при их создании. 

А теперь, наконец-наконец, представьте, что будет, если взять самый странный массовый и культовый сериал 90х со всей его неповторимой ни до ни после атмосферой, полить это соусом японского подхода к созданию художественных произведений и сделать из этого игру.

Deadly Premonition это не просто игра, это предмет исторического достояния. Она сломана, она имеет массу технических проблем: низкий фреймрейт, непомерное количество вылетов и багов, устаревшая графика, плохая анимация, неудобное управление, софтлок моменты, наедающие пройти игру без дополнительных манипуляций. И все это не только проблемы порта на пк, большая часть проблем есть и на консольных прародителях. Напомню, что игра вышла в 2010, выглядит и играется как продукты периода пс2, и переиздание 2013 года не исправило ничего из вышесказанного. Так почему же DP любят и продолжают обожать?

В Deadly Premonition есть та особая атмосферу, которую давал нам Твин Пикс, уникальный геймплей и механики, которые дают только японские игры, и незабываемый опыт, единственный в своем роде. DP принято хвалить за сюжет, и с этим трудно не согласится, он хорош, а включая собственноручное знакомство с городом и его персонажами по мере выполнения сайдквестов игра дарит нам одну из самых лучших историй. Город, что погружает в себя, и может не отпустить вас пока не закончите сюжетку и все сайдквесты. Но не одним хлебом едины, игра также предлагает увлекательный геймплей. 

По сути DP делится на 26 сюжетных миссий, в перерыве между которыми вам даётся полная свобода в изучении города и знакомства с персонажами путём выполнения дополнительных заданий, коих тут 50. За квесты иногда дают очень даже полезные предметы, такие как рация-фасттелепорт, быстрая машина или бесконечное оружие. Но, конечно, никто не заставляет, и можно идти просто по сюжету и насладится расследованием, как крутым сериалом. Часть сюжетных заданий представляют собой несложные пробежки с тиром от третьего лица, а другая часть это недурные загадки, что являются скорее прелюдией к сюжетным катсценам. На этом основы игры заканчиваются, теперь можете покупать и приступать к прохождению, а я тут просто поднимаю рейтинг игре в стиме.

Играйте, если вы:
- любите жесткие детективы (настоящий детектив и твин пикс вам как референс) 
- любите японские игры или готовы к новым и нестандартным
- готовы смириться и любить человека со всеми его недостатками
- готовы подарить себе незабываемый экспириенс, полный боли и страданий

Немножко подсказок от себя:
- любую главу можно переиграть для прохождения сайдов, но придется доиграть эпизод до конца т.к. там нет сейвов, весь прогресс и предметы сохранятся и перенесутся в главный сейв
- в игре есть фантомные сигареты, позволяющие скипать время
- в игре есть фасттревел, который можно получить после выполнения второго квеста джорджа с безымянным цветком 
- самый простой способ вызвать дождь до специальной куклы, увы, - только спать. Есть не обязательно, сон не требует быть сытым, но не забудьте поесть как закончите в бесконечным отсыпом. Сам же дождь появляется в случайные дни, но если менять каждый день костюм и бриться, вероятность его появления, почему-то, повышается

Решения тех проблем которые помогли лично мне:
- в сети можно без проблем найти «dpfix», который оптимизирует фпс в игре до 60, добовляет высокое разрешение и массу других исправлений. Ставится простым копированием файлов в папку с игрой и перезапуском пк при необходимости
- проблема с невозможностью целиться наверх и вниз, которая будет в некоторых моментах необходима, исправляется альттабом игры туда обратно, но с «dpfix» игра не сможет развернуться, так что придется перемещать его файлы из папки на это время 
- игра может систематически вылетать в некоторых моментах, например после взятия сайдквеста, в таких случая рекомендую сохраниться, перезапустить игру (сам exe файл, не лаунчер) с совместимостью windows95 и правами администратора, пройти момент до ближайшего сохранения и поменять обратно
- геймпад у меня просто не работал, сдайтесь",1620993542,1620994693,True,2,0,0.422496527433395386,1,False,False,False,False,,,

creo que pase mas de 5 horas solo buscando soluciones a los incontables bugs que arruinan este juego y si! se ve horrible y se juega peor algo que perdonaría PERO! NO PERDONARE 2 COSAS.
1-los constantes crasheos de la nada 
2-las partidas se pueden corromper, siempre ... osea siempre y en un cap en especial esta 100% confirmado que la partida se corromperá, como es posible que la desarrolladora jamas arreglara eso ? 
me paso en un punto avanzado de la historia.... 

creo que como fans de este juego debemos darle un voto negativo y creo que si todos los que hemos comprado en PC este juegos nos unimos y exigimos una mejor versión, puede que se cumpla. 
realmente me conformaria con que se solucionaran los crasheos y las partidas corrompidas nada mas. 
amo Deadly Premonition pero sin duda la version de PC es la peor

• The game itself doesn't work without elevated privileges.
• Without dpfix, resolution is locked to 1280 x 720.
• Alt + Tabbing out of the game either halves the game's effective framerate or crashes it entirely.	
• Sometimes starting the game will permanently tank the framerate for no reason. Normally running at 60 FPS, the game will instead start at 22 FPS and continue to drop as play continues (I stopped at 8 FPS before it could get any worse).
• Quick time events don't register inputs properly if the framerate drops too much. In these instances, trying to complete the QTEs associated with the Raincoat Killer becomes effectively impossible, resulting in an immediate game over until the framerate issues are fixed.
• With dpfix, the launcher no longer works, requiring a manual startup from the DP.exe itself.
• Occasionally, starting the game from DP.exe crashes the game.
• Steam Overlay crashes the game.
• After using dpfix, the game's language keeps changing to French for some reason.
• Setting the game to fullscreen using the launcher causes the game to run windowed, and vice versa.
• Saving at the wrong time permanently crashes the game when trying to reload the save file, rendering the save completely unusable (this has happened in Episode 1 - Chapter 05, Episode 2 - Chapter 09 & Chapter 12).
• The art gallery cutscene crashes the game, at the point where Forrest is seen speaking with Diane.
• Being in the wrong place at the wrong time (such as outside the police station, or a nondescript patch of grass) crashes the game.
• Smoking at the wrong time crashes the game.
• Not smoking at the right time crashes the game.
• Driving on the wrong part of a road crashes the game.
• Driving the wrong car crashes the game.
• Using flares to get a car that won't crash the game at the wrong time locks the game, rendering it unplayable.
• Going near the gas station crashes the game.
• The leg bone's connected to the -- crashed game.
• Opening the game days later to play it again crashes the game.
• Running the game in the 'wrong' compatibility mode will sometimes prevent the game opening altogether, even when it had worked previously.
• Trying to eat big dinner crashes the game.
• Walking near Emily's police truck during the stakeout crashes the game.
• Virtually every time the game is saved the game will crash shortly after.
• Helping the general with his junk crashes the game.
• Trying to collect specific trading cards (No. 30 - Gina) crashes the game.
• Getting the [Lollipop] tooltip on loading screens will sometimes crash the game.
• When tailing Nick's car in Episode 2 - Chapter 12, there are occasions where his car will be unable to gain enough speed to move up inclines, preventing the mission from proceeding and resulting in an automatic failure (the only way to fix this issue was to cap my framerate at 60 and ensure I was more than 100 yards away from him as his car went up the hill).
• Going down a ladder in a cutscene crashes the game.
• Going into a highlighted area the game expects you to go to (just outside the hotel) crashes the game.
• Trying to enter the diner through the back door crashes the game.
• Going near the police truck parked on the grass next to the diner crashes the game.
• Talking to Gina at the gas station crashes the game.
• In one instance while driving, York said to himself ""...Hm? Nothing, just my imagination."" followed by the immediate explosion of the car he was driving, treating me to an unceremonious game over (my car was at 33% durability at the time).

• Completing a QTE during the final boss in a way the game seemingly does not like crashes the game.
• Doing a twirl during the final boss crashes the game.

Let me start this off by saying if you can get this game on sale for anywhere under $5 it is absolutely worth the price on Steam... But with that being said if it IS NOT on sale STAY AWAY from this version i do not know why any developer would port games from console to PC without trying to test it and fix there issues. The PC version is pretty awful, nothing to do with the frame rate on my Nvidia 1050 you can get 60fps without any real trouble, my issues come in the form of two VERY BIG problems, One being that for some reason randomly my game will just minimize for absolutely no reason, Not Close but it will just Minimize and that gets irritating if you are either getting immersed or having fun playing the game, and i have not been able to fix that. and Number Two being the lack of the controller support functioning correctly even with downloaded custom patches that say (IT WORKS) spoiler alert IT DOESN'T. The PS3 Version has shit framerate at most times but i can still finish that version without it crashing. If you REALLY WANT to play this game, the main version is backwards compatible on Xbox One and it runs very smooth, it is a fantastic experience and the game is one of a kind, yes it can be very weird, yes the gameplay can get repetitive, but if you haven't been spoiled on the story of this game it is a fantastic time from start to finish, never have i once got bored with the games story (although there are occasional [Follow this character] Missions that do get real annoying killing the speed you wish to go) But the Xbox 360 Version of Deadly Premonition is your best bet if you want the best overall experience, if you want to see the new Directors Cut scenes just look them up on YouTube, you aren't missing much there.",1618082626,1693271777,False,1,0,0.524793386459350586,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As FBI agent Francis York Morgan, your task is to travel to the small town of Greenvale and find out what supernatural forces are sowing sorrow among the citizens. The plot is one of the most captivating video game stories I've seen - it has a great setting, very developed and unique characters with professional voice-acting, as well as many tasteful plot twists. And while it could be classified as a horror game, many of its moments are intentionally humorous. One would doubt how such a combo could ever work but amazingly it does here. All the emotions, all the tone changes are also felt through the brilliant soundtrack. It all created an experience where the more I played, the more I wanted the game to never end.

Sadly there are also plenty weak points in Deadly Premonition. You can see everywhere that this was a budget title - the graphics (almost terrible), the UI (counterintuitive, outdated and clumsy), the controls (god the atrocious controls...), the animations (wooden and repeated), the world design (a huge map with forced long journeys in cars that barely handle), the scandalous achievements (their descriptions are pure spoilers, who in their right mind would do that?) and don't get me started about the technical problems the PC port has... In order to run this game and make it playable, one needs to apply a handful of fixes/patches and then some (look up Steam guides - there are a few good fix collections packed in one place for you to download). Once you get it running it will crash every once in a while - some of these crashes you'll overcome by relaunching the game whereas some other crashes may corrupt your save data and you'll need to download a savegame made after that point to continue the story. I'm sure I missed some, but in any case this problematic side is hell.

When you sum up the downsides it may seem like this game is not even worth trying due to its issues, but I assure you - it's perfectly playable with a little effort. And I encourage all who love a good supernatural mystery to give Deadly Premonition a shot -  it's a most enjoyable, spooky and fun experience that had me thinking about it long after I'd turned it off.

You never know if you will get to the save point because if you don’t and it crashes, you have to go through a walk/running segment all over again. I was naive and thought that other players just weren’t willing to go out of their way to fix the game with constant bugs. I thought “Wow, I can just install this fan patch and deal with some minor crashes here and there. It will be easy.”

No I was wrong, very very wrong. This game crashed on nearly every end of every chapter. I was even hard stuck on chapter 16 and had to get another save file. It is unbelievable to me how bad of a state this game is on PC. Buyers seriously beware, if you do not want to tinker and try to fix things with this game then don’t bother. It REALLY is as bad as others and I say.

However, if you get past that. This game is incredible. Being an FBI detective with an imaginary friend creates wonderful dialog along with the other oddities that happen throughout the town. About 80% of the cutscenes have something to have a giggle at. Whether that be writing, delivery, sound mixing, graphical bugs, physics with the game. It’s just great. As for gameplay, it is honestly quite bad. It is even worse than a poor mans Resident Evil 4. Enemies are barely a threat, you have a pistol with unlimited ammo, and you just shoot stuff until it dies. If they get too close just hold your breath and they will not attack you. Most melee weapons can only be used on enemies about 10 times before breaking. You can get unnecessary points for doing “things” around town and also collect them. There are side quest and trading cards however I didn’t try hard to get them due to being afraid of the game crashing (maybe some day). Puzzles are hardly even there. The answer is always a straight line with absolutely nothing puzzling.

But even then, with all these complaints and all of these crashes. I could not put this game down. It was a hilarious ride and I loved it all. There is something charming and lovable with all the characters. This game really is all about its story, universe, and soundtrack. However, admittedly, if I would ever do this again I would buy the switch version. This port is truly terrible something to behold. That’s why even though I really loved the game, I cannot recommend it in good conscience. If it ever gets a patch, you best believe this is getting flipped to a recommendation.

Here are random fixes that may help you get past a crash.
-Smoke to past the time to a certain time of day
-Lower the refresh rate
-Run the game as Admin
-Run the game in various versions of windows through compatibility mode
-Press escape on black screens (this is when cutscenes don’t trigger properly)
-Download another save from someone else
-Disable steam overlay

Good luck if you end up trying to run with it!

If you can't, then this version is probably worth 5-10 bucks if you are willing to fiddle with it and deal with random crashing.

PS: For those who decide to take the plunge on PC and are on Windows 10, I will give you a tip and save you some time. Right click the game executable, go to properties, then compatibility tab, and set it to Windows XP SP 3 mode or else the game will run like a slide show. Also I have had the best luck just running it windows, as painful as that sounds.

Долгое время всех интересовал вопрос - как же так вышло? Давление со стороны издательства, недостаток бюджета?

Другое дело что для сюжета это нужно, так как в формате интерактивного кино игра бы попросту не работала. Пройдя через борьбу буквально со всем содержимым игры, ты больше веришь в это безумие и сюрреализм что преследует персонажей и главного героя. А они тут просто прекрасны.

Диалоги и химия между персонажами прописаны просто на высоте, даже разговоры о кино с Заком во время бесконечных поездок весьма доставляют и привносят своей атмосферы. Большинство действующих лиц не раз сменяют свою амплуа и раскрываются с новых сторон, более того, сам главный герой весьма харизматичен и за ним интересно наблюдать, даже любовная линия не кажется ненужной и вызывает какие-то эмоции. Ну а истинное происхождение  Зака - это отдельная причина для прохождения.

Про сюжет многие говорили что он вдохновлён Твин Пиксом, я его не смотрел, так что поверю на слово, мне же больше показалось что это Сайлент хилл, наполненный японским юмором. Сам сюжет радует неожиданными поворотами и постоянной балансировкой между оккультизмом/реализмом, в конце же все окончательно скатывается в классическое японское безумие.

Сложно поставить игре оценку, большинство людей ее выключат ее после часа или вступительных 15 минут, но если это ваше - то осознание этого придет в те же 15 минут. Стоит ли потраченное время и борьба с механиками того? Безусловно да, так как это одно из тех произведений которое точно вам запомнится на долгие годы.

This is a game i would recommend but NOT on steam if you're looking for a stable port

Deadly Premonition is a game i first picked up back in college for the Xbox 360. I asked a staff member if they'd recommend any games on a certain shelf (cheapish) and Deadly Premonition was the first one
On the 360 i loved the game, it took me a few hours to really get into it but once the story started coming together i was really enjoying the game and wanted more.
I figured out pretty well who the killer was before the ending of the game although the last few chapters did mislead me and make me question my prediction 

So, this port the main issue's are the game crashes, the game will randomly at any point shut itself down and leave you feeling like a virgin being stood up
i have had numerous crashes so far, there are some help guides online which i've used and running the DPlauncher as admin helped a bit but the crashes are still happening. It's a shame as this game is really good and underrated. If you play this be sure to safe extremely often as you might find yourself having to repeat any story from your last save.

As for controls i couldn't find a way to get the controller to work even though it says controller is supported but i'm happy using Mouse/KB so no loss for me. Shooting is a little clunky but free roam with a mouse is better and is near enough the same as the 360 version and easy to use. The weapons you get are multiple blunt/sharp objects and firearms which are good to switch into on different enemies

Driving is still as clunky as the 360 version, you kind of get used to it after a while but i find myself flipping more cars than i did when working in fast food, you can have your own car and different police cars and using  the sirens to go faster

I'm not sure if it's me but the colour seems to be very bland in comparison to the xbox version but that could be bad memory, it doesn't effect gameplay or cutscenes though

Graphics are dated but i've seen worse, there is the odd graphical glitch ere or there like a coat becoming intertwined with other clothing but again, nothing game breaking 

I know it may seem weird that i recommend the game but if you can stop the game crashing it's a great game, with a cool story, side quests to keep you busy, collectables to find and even fishing and races

One of my favourite things from Deadly Premonition though is definitely the unique soundtrack, it's a drawing point as i've not heard a soundtrack like it before but i love it.
Plenty of backstory for characters main and side and constant convo's with Zack to keep you in the loop of what's happening 

So, main story (no spoilers) You come to a small town in the middle of nowhere, there has been a murder and its' your job to solve it, the game does this very interestingly and makes each place unique with you finding clues in each locations giving you more and more leads, but with public getting in the way, who's the murderer?!

Great game, Fun story, easy combat, let down by bad stability in the port

As such, the game itself feels like a relic from another era.
In terms of presentation, the game is woefully outdated. The graphics would only be impressive if it was released on the Dreamcast or PS2. The mapping and guidance system, which is seemingly borrowed from GTA is just plain terrible, when you consider how big the map is. Also, there are maybe five or six character models for enemies throughout the game. Finally, the sound during the combat missions basically consists of the enemies muttering the same two phrases over and over again. That said, Deadly Premonition offers something downright inspiring for every one of its technical shortcomings. There's an ugly world thick with idiosyncrasies and history and a fascinating lead in Agent Francis York Morgan. Even though it reminded me of some other games, it's really a mixed bag and in a league of it's own. I didn't mind that it switched genres back and forth from a Resident Evil style survival horror, to a crime thriller, to a semi-open world with random quests and people to talk to. 
Throughout Deadly Premonition, you'll find yourself in very odd situations punctuated by Agent York. This is where the game absolutely shines; the surreal interaction between York and the townsfolk, as well as the interaction between York and himself can only be described as a work of art. In a town where crimes can be solved by shooting bird nests with shotguns, trees drop severed hands that can be used as doorknobs, and countless giant dogs fall out of the sky at midnight. The game contains an intangible, eccentric atmosphere which easily overshadows its many shortcomings. This is a game simply overflowing with a vivid personality and bizarre charm. I enjoyed the diversity of the characters and the atmosphere of the town.
Ultimately I enjoyed the game, If you're the kind of person who is willing to look past the flaws and see a game as a whole, you'll have a lot of fun. Irregardless, Deadly Premonition is one of the most incredible games ever made with it's unmatched characterisation and unique story that will have you guessing as to who the Raincoat Killer is until the very end. However, this game is not for everyone; some would find themselves unsatisfied with the somewhat repetitive combat and the confusing endgame twists involving certain characters.

I would also say it is bad-good in the same vein as Twin Peaks, but some people actually like that program? So take that how you will. There's numerous allusions and homage-stylings to Twin Peaks, and it's by far the strongest influence on the game, but what you have is that sort of a detective story - which already features an idiosyncratically bizarre protagonist, and a definitely-dementia-rattled director, [i]through the lens of a Japanese indie developer.[/i] That prospect alone is enough to sell the game, I think. 

More towards the point of a negative review, it is imperative that you are aware it is buggy as sh*t. 

Controllers don't work natively (or at least my 360 one doesn't); the game is liable to crash (I had about one every 5 hours, except for one reliable crash that mandated XP compatibility mode). If you're okay with installing 13+ pieces of remedial malware to get it to operate, that's great - and power to you! - but I think a positive review should be, as a low bar, predicated upon the game working ""out of the box.""

Beyond that, there's a number of frankly idiotic design choices. The game operates on an internal 24-hour clock, which is fine; the town often feels lively because of it. But all the mechanisms of interacting with it - sleeping and smoking - are painstakingly slow. Some events only happen at specific times, and both the game and the guide world are fairly quiet on this front - you've gotta tap into the logic of idiocy for it. There's also a weather system, which restricts some events, and enables others - this is fine; the game explores it in-universe - but once again it creates an [b]arbitrary block on accessibility of certain events.[/b] As far as I can tell, rain is a random (though frequent enough) occurence - but it [b]never improved my experience[/b] as a timing system. It was strictly questionable. Combine that with the knowledge that completionism, postgame, relies on infrequent saves (specifically, you lose the ability to save mid-game, and instead must finish the ""chapter"" you're playing to save - why? What the f*ck?).

Deadly Premonition: Director’s Cut is one of the best AND worst games I have ever played. And I think that contradiction perfectly summarizes the experience.

Let’s talk about the (quite abundant) bad first: Tech and gameplay wise this is a terrible game, I had an awful experience playing it. The controls are abysmal (that camera control for Christ’s sake!), there are endless bugs in the open world, the NPCs AI and the physics engine are a smorgasbord of errors, the performance is hit and miss (I had rock solid 60fps sessions and sub-20fps ones, sometimes in the same area and chapter), and don’t even get me started with the stability. The game was a constant festival of crashes, and they seemed to happen at total random so I couldn’t see them coming. Sometimes it crashed indoors, sometimes outdoors, sometimes during a cutscene, a conversation, a loading screen… for me, this was the most nightmarish horror game because I played in a state of constant, increasing tension before I reached a new phone (not to save the game, but to be sure that the next crash wouldn’t restart me from too long ago).

The gameplay is also absolutely dated. The missions are boring as hell, the combat system is clunky, the enemy variety is non-existent and the very few boss battles have positively nothing special. Driving around Greenvale is a pain with almost every car in the game, the map confuses you instead of being of any assistance, and the music tracks, albeit quite fine, are very scarce and play over and over again... Also, during cutscenes, the voices are almost every time out of sync and the character animations rarely fit the tone of their dialogue, producing some unsettling feeling while you’re watching them.

But, you know what? I… actually enjoyed Deadly Premonition. I can definitely understand its ‘cult classic’ appeal.

The story is super interesting and always leaves you wanting to know more and more. The game world is very believable and the characters that inhabit in it are (at least the main ones) properly fleshed out (their voice acting is actually very good as well). Despite the obvious influence from David Lynch’s work, Deadly Premonition is able to find its own unique personality and direction, and it does it with an endless supply of charm and uniqueness. The story it tells is so engaging that you start overlooking its very obvious and painful flaws and just focus on moving forward as York continues to delve deeper and deeper in the mystery of the Raincoat Killer. Every new twist and turn keeps you on your toes and Swery even manages to save some surprises until the very end. The writing here is top-notch, a surprising gem.

I guess that’s where the love of its super hardcore fanbase comes from. Deadly Premonition is so good and unique at its core that you forgive its limitations and errors to a point in which they don’t even matter in your experience anymore, despite constituting 90% of it.

I screamed at the screen in frustration an infinite amount of times, I wanted to kill its creators over some god-awful design choices, or every time the game randomly crashed or made me close and restart my computer. However, I couldn’t stop playing; its weirdness captivates you like very few other games in existence, casting a spell over you that numbs your senses and good jugdgment, and in the end only good memories remain.

Driving around town doing sidequests and interacting with its inhabitants also has its charm.

This Director's Cut port however, is not worth playing. It crashed at least once every hour, sometimes during critical story scenes, which just destroyed any momentum they had. Usually the crashes are random, sometimes they're consistent, requiring bizarre steps like having to smoke cigarettes for an (ingame) hour to bypass.  There's all sorts of strange hiccups like constant stuttering during driving, hyper sensitive controls during driving, and QTEs not triggering properly until I just mess with the games configuration files randomly until they make me pass. The lighting is blown out in many cutscenes and makes it look like the games in a supernova. Water shaders are broken during certain cutscenes making it look like a blue paint, making an already ugly game a real eyesore. Infamous save-destroying bugs from the original version are still here. This is all with Durante's fan-patch, which the port is only quasi-playable without it (no diss towards Durante, bless him).

The new content the Director's Cut adds isn't really worth it either, basically a few new interlude cutscenes that are so pointless they may as well not exist.

This feels kind of wrong, because DP is genuinely a great and unique game that doesn't really have anything that can compare to it, even ten years after its release. Unfortunately, this version of the game has a whole bunch of issues that keep me from being able to recommend it.

Some of the issues I experienced include:

- I couldn't get my 360 controller to work in any way other than in win98 compatibility mode which quadrupled load times and killed the frame rate
- I got run time errors every other hour without enabling more ram, and about every three hours with 4gb of ram enabled
- I had frequent physics glitches were the game sped up my character in and outside of cars
- at some point, I got weird visual glitches during the rain that I couldn't reproduce later
- the game got stuck in a black screen during a chapter transition (fortunately, rebooting my PC fixed this)

So, the bottom line is, if at all possible, get this game on the switch (along with the sequel), or on the PS3 or 360.

It's frustrating doing the same segment more than 5 times only for it to crash at the exact same time. I've given up. Save yourself the headache by not supporting this horrible port.

If you would seriously like to enjoy this Japanese Twin Peaks fan fiction then I highly encourage you to seek out the Xbox 360 version because it's the only version of the game that is not a complete mess. Plus, it is backwards compatible with the Xbox One and the Series X.",1602467140,1685998985,False,2,0,0.522859871387481689,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This might take the cake as the single worst PC port I have ever played.  It's so bad, I can't even get it to function.  Stick to literally any other version of the game.  After I get the Steam trading cards for this, it's uninstalled and never seeing the light of day on my computer again.

Es como tener un sueño extraño que puede estar lleno de simbolismos o sencillamente consumiste más de lo debías

Pero es importante que sepas que es un desafío jugarlo de manera cómoda, si lo compras tienes que ser consciente que es muy probable que tengas que estar las primeras horas configurando y pasando rabias con el juego. Muy recomendable al empezar a jugarlo contabilizar las horas de juego de modo que no sobrepasen las dos horas, para que puedas pedir reembolso si no consigues jugar en condiciones

Resumo el camino que tuve que recorrer para jugarlo. Windows 10 64 bits pc gama media (RX 580)

- El juego parece ir bien, pero está capado a 720p

- En el segundo arrance del juego instala archivos (vaya, que extraño que no lo hiciera antes)

- El juego deja de arrancar

- Para que vuelva arrancar, al menos en windows 10, es necesario ir al directorio donde está instalado el juego, carpeta redist (""\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut\redist"") y abrir el archivo ejecutable ""PhysX_SystemSoftware.exe"" En este instalador bastaría con hacer click en ""repair""

- Ahora el juego debería volver a funcionar pero estás en 720p y es muy probable que tengas problemas con el joystick o mando que quieras ocupar

- Existe un parche de la comunidad que ayuda, entre otras cosas, a cambiar la resolución. Se llama DPfix. En realidad tiene varias opciones gráficas, puedes sencillamente subirlo a 4k o 1080p con varios filtros y mejoras
http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DPfix095.zip

- Solo falta el mando, yo tuve los problemas con mando de xbox one. Si bien era reconocido en el menú, en el momento de jugar el personaje no consigue moverse. Los pasos que seguí para poder ocupar el mando son los siguientes:

1 - Click en ajustes de steam, opción ""Mando"" y luego ""Ajustes generales del mando"" se abre una pantalla tipo Big Picture de steam y ahí marqué ""Configuración mando Xbox"" y ""Configuración mando genérico"". Si el personaje sigue sin poder moverse intenta dejar marcada solamente la opción de mando xbox o al revés, solamente dejar marcada la configuración mando genérico

2- Ahora el personaje debiera poder moverse al menos, no obstante el stick derecho tiene los ejes invertidos, vale decir mueves la palanca a la derecha y la cámara sube, tiras la palanca hacia arriba y la cámara se mueve a la izquierda (en este momento ya estaba al borde de las lágrimas, pero Miyazaki estaría decepcionado si me hubiera rendido xD)

3- La comunidad ha hecho un mapeado correcto para poder jugar el juego, para llegar a el mismo tienes que ir a tu biblioteca de steam, click derecho a Deadly Premonition, click en “Administrar” y luego “opciones de mando” (tienes que tener al menos un mando conectado al pc, si no tienes ningún mando conectado no aparece esta opción) luego tienes que ir a “explorar configuraciones” luego click en “comunidad” y finalmente aplicar la configuración “Deadly Premonition Controller +” de theraineydaze. En realidad este paso es opcional, podrías tu mismo mapear una configuración jugable pero es probable que a estas alturas quieras aplicar una configuración y que termine el sufrimiento

-Importante considerar que el juego NO cuenta con Steam Cloud, si quieres cambiar de pc o formatear y seguir jugando la partida tienes que respaldar manualmente los archivos de guardado

Tal vez alguien pregunte ¿Vale realmente la pena?
Yo francamente diría que sí, es realmente un buen juego. Aunque claro tal vez es mejor optar por alguna versión de consola y ahorrarse todo este dolor de cabeza

Considering my expectations of DP, which were fairly low to begin with, I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay but would only recommend to purchase the PC port on sale. I actually did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Is the game perfect? Not by any stretch of the imagination. But it is a classic. 

[b] TLDR; Buy the shit out of this – but on sale!  [/b]

Here is a summary and rating (1-5) of my personal experiences with the game: 

[u] Interface/Port [/u] [b] (1) [/b]

Oh boy, where to start? Although the game provides you with the option to switch between keyboard and controller before game launch (and the default controls themselves I had no problem with), you have to pretty much jump through every hoop known to man to actually get the game to launch after the starting scene. The PC port leaves a lot to be desired and this is putting it very gently. I am one of the few lucky players who managed to find solutions around the plethora of Windows compatibility and driver issues and actually played the game through to the end. Simple achievements that are awarded for completing chapters range at 5-15% rates, which pretty much reflects how difficult it is to mould this game around your PC settings. I had to research various guides and discussion forums after experiencing a total of approximately 7 major game crashes. Buy at your own risk and if you’re prepared to spend at least some time researching fixes. 

[u] Gameplay [/u] [b] (5) [/b]

I personally loved the game. With all its technical faults, it is definitely charming. The characters are pretty well written and the chemistry between them is refreshing. I think the highlight of the game is definitely our protagonist detective Agent York, who has a very quirky and unusual method of investigating crime scenes. The backstories and plot twists in this game never end! And although the story is pretty linear, I will definitely be going back for a second run-through to enjoy any bonus side quests or content. I also found the option to listen to York chat about his favourite movie classics while you drive about to be a very nice touch and make the task much less tedious (you drive around quite a lot in this game!). Overall, even though I started playing this game for shits and giggles, it genuinely grew on me over time as an endearing storyline. 

[u] Pacing [/u] [b] (4) [/b]

I would say the game is pretty well paced, although you are often left to your own devices for hours at a time and it sometimes feels a little bit like an open world without much chance for true exploration. The game map is actually quite vast, however, so if you are looking to do side quests frequently I suppose the free time given is required. 

[u] In-game Bugs/Annoyances [/u] [b] (3) [/b]

I am actually quite surprised that this game is not as buggy as anticipated. That being said, my expectations set a pretty low bar! You will experience the occasional crash between scenes. The animations can also seem a little clunky. I have had enemies pretty much teleport on top of me before, though I think this was intended for jump-scare purposes. One of my biggest pet peeves is a buggy final boss scene and this game actually does have elements of this, though not to the point that it is unplayable. 

[u] Difficulty [/u] [b] (1) [/b]

I think my cat could probably play this. Extremely easy to pick up and play, especially if you’re a beginner. The game does have a “lock-on” aim option too, which makes it easy to get targets quickly and there is a variety of weapons to choose from. Controlling your car is also pretty straight-forward. DP is very forgiving in terms of most “quick react” scenes, as you are able to Continue on the spot and retry. The puzzles are very easy also.  I would say overall it’s a pretty casual game perfect for a Sunday afternoon. 

[u] Replayability [/u] [b] (2) [/b]

Although my score for this is rather low (as far as I am aware, this game does not have several endings to explore), I will very likely be going back to complete quests I could not do before as I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. I have seen people with 400+ hours in game so I would say there is content to be found for sure. You are given the option to continue investigating the town even after you have finished the game.

Grafica da ps2, gameplay legnoso e gioco buggato.  Il porting pc è probabilmente il peggiore che mi sia mai capitato, soprattutto per via dei numerosi crash (a fine recensione elencherò gli accorgimenti che ho seguito io per avere un'esperienza decente). Quindi perché pollice su?  Perché è un gioco fuori dalle righe, con una trama che va dal trash al geniale, un'esperienza difficilmente classificabile. Memorabile il protagonista, sia per via del suo carattere unico che del suo aspetto a dir poco bizzarro. Insieme a lui sono ben delineati anche tutti gli strambi abitanti di Greenvale, il paese  nel quale saremo chiamati a risolvere il mistero dell'Assassino con l'impermeabile, sopravvivendo nel frattempo a momentanee incursioni in un mondo ""da incubo"" in stile Silent Hill. È possibile esplorare interamente la regione di Greenvale (sia a piedi che in auto), per scoprirne i segreti e conoscere meglio gli abitanti (ognuno dei quali caratterizzato da routine giornaliere), oltre a risolvere le varie missioni secondarie presenti (fin troppo difficili da scoprire senza l'aiuto di una guida).  Il tutto culminerà in un finale folle, carico di momenti toccanti e inquietanti. Menzione d'onore anche per le musiche, un mix eclettico e fuori di testa (anche se alcuni brani tendono ad essere ripetuti troppo spesso). Sicuramente non un gioco per tutti, ma riuscendo a passare oltre gli evidenti difetti si troverà un'esperienza che difficilmente sarà possibile dimenticare.

Di seguito, gli accorgimenti che ho seguito per stabilizzare il gioco (non garantisco che funzionino per tutti).

-Non installare il DPfix, questa mod necessaria per poter giocare a risoluzioni alte ha aumentato a dismisura il numero dei crash.
-Creare collegamenti sul desktop sia del launcher che dell'eseguibile e impostare la compatibilità con Windows 98/ME. Avviare il gioco dal launcher.
-In caso di crash durante una cutscene, riavviare prima il pc e poi il gioco. Consiglio in generale di iniziare a giocare subito dopo aver avviato il sistema, senza aprire nessuna applicazione (eccetto Steam ovviamente).",1597357095,1615298062,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Para quem está na dúvida se deve comprar ou não, aqui vai a minha opinião:

Parece-me que o jogo foi estranhamente desenvolvido e digo isso, pois, existem detalhes absurdos no jogo que eu nunca havia visto em outro do gênero, e que tornam ele muito bom, mas por outro lado, existem certos aspectos do jogo que me fazem questionar o seu desenvolvimento e podem estragar a jogatina de muitas pessoas. Vamos começar pelos pontos positivos, na minha opinião:

- O jogo tem uma história sensacional, que consegue prender o jogador até o final, lembrando muito a série Twin Peaks;
- As mecânicas do jogo são muito boas, fazendo uma espécie de mix entre várias mecânicas de jogos do gênero survival horror, com investigação e liberdade para transitar em um mapa de mundo aberto grande;
- Existem detalhes que me deixaram muito surpresos, como por exemplo ao final de cada dia as roupas do personagem devem ser trocadas e lavadas, pois sujam, caso contrário, um bando de moscas começará a perseguir o protagonista, ou então a barba do personagem que cresce a cada dia que passa, ou ainda a tela de GPS dentro dos carros (que não tem um interior muito detalhado) que vão atualizando conforme você vai andando pelo mapa. Outro detalhe importante é que as horas no jogo correspondem às horas no mundo real, o que dá bastante tempo para fazer as missões secundárias entre uma quest principal e outra ou então para explorar a cidade e todas suas peculiaridades e bizarrices. O sistema de ter horário para ativar determinadas quests também funciona bem, permitindo que o jogador possa adiantá-lo fumando um cigarrinho;

Já os pontos negativos, quase estragam o prazer de jogar este jogo, mas mesmo assim, ainda mantenho a opinião de que vale a pena ser jogado. Como os principais pontos negativos temos:

- O port do PS3 para o PC foi feito sem a devida atenção. É possível notar diversos bugs e problemas em função dessa má otimização, como crashes recorrentes e bugs de som que incomodam bastante. Então se você for jogar, lembre-se de sempre salvar o jogo seguidamente para evitar perder o progresso por causa de algum crash eventual;

- Os quick time events são algo que podem incomodar bastante, pois são bem travados e muito rápidos; 

- As expressões dos personagens são mal feitas, o que torna o game cômico em alguns pontos, mas quebra com a tensão da maioria das cenas. Essa questão das expressões dos personagens é um dos motivos que deixarem esse game famosos, o que eu não acho positivo;

- Por mais que seja classificado como game de terror, o jogo não assusta. Ele é muito mais um game sobre investigar e matar inimigos atrás de provas do que propriamente sobre sobre terror;

- Os inimigos são bem fáceis de serem derrotados, o que tira um pouco a graça de confrontá-los, além de o jogo não incentivar muito que o player adquira novas armas ou teste novas maneiras de derrotar os inimigos, o que torna os combates bem monótonos;

- Já falei dos bugs e crashes do jogo, mas tem um específico que simplesmente não permite avançar na história. No capítulo 9, episódio 2, logo após sair da galeria de arte e assistir a cutscene, o jogo trave e fecha sozinho, pois o save se auto corrompe, impossibilitando que o jogador continue a saga do detetive York. Pelo que vi, esse problema ocorre em quase todas as versões de PC, só sendo possível solucioná-lo após acessar os arquivos do jogo, apagar o save da pasta e baixar da internet algum save (tem em alguns fóruns saves específicos para corrigir esse problema) que tenha sido feito logo após a cutscene da galeria;  

Concluindo, jogar este jogo foi uma experiência diferente para mim. Eu gostei, mesmo com todos os seus problemas e acho que vale a pena ser jogado por outras pessoas. Se você não dá bola para gráficos perfeitos e é daqueles que gosta de jogos com uma boa história de suspense, esse jogo pode ser uma boa opção, mas saiba que você poderá passar raiva em alguns momentos por causa dos bugs e crashes recorrentes.",1596743182,1596743182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Some tips: 

DPFix makes the game look better. It's pretty great. 
-Unconfirmed rumors however of DPFix causing more crashes so take this with a grain of salt.

If your game crashes and crashes consistently, restart your computer. 

If your game crashes at a specific cutscene when you're leaving the hospital, restart your computer and set the game to windowed mode.

For compatibility settings, right click BOTH the executable and the launcher and set them to Windows XP service pack 3. You'll have issues with aiming up while doing this, but, you can swap it off once the crashes have stopped.

For the tailing mission, if you're running it on windowed mode, swap it to full screen for just that mission then save immediately after it finishes. I don't know what it is, but I think the windows size actually influences the driving.

Get all of the bones, but don't turn them into the guy who wants them immediately. Let them get stolen. Find the bones. Turn them in. Suggest getting all the bones within the first two days before going to the community center.
Complete the spirit maps when you can.
Do the block pushing puzzle/store room stuff.  You'll thank me later. (Don't actually give the reward away.)
Bribe the gas station man. Do it as often as you can. 

Fishing is annoying.

The animations, while funny, are still really good compared to other games that came out during the time. (I'm looking at you, Oblivion.)

tl;dr: I really love this game. It's a garbage fire port, and if you're persistent you'll be rewarded with one of the oddest yet most engrossing stories in a video game I've seen to date.

I've heard about this game from an old dropped let's play by a known lolcow around ten years ago. The low budget J-jank aesthetic has always intrigued me, and the interesting main character made me think that this has potential, so I had to try it. While initially a lot of things turned me off, this turned out to be an amazing experience, and a legitimate example of what well-written art is.

Although some things are annoying and deserve a warning (such as sound/music cutting out inappropriately, graphical glitches and limited animations, overly long animations every time you open a door or grab an item, terrible driving controls), they did not ruin the experience. In fact, the low budget jank strangely added to the eerie feel of the game. It continuously surprised me with its' great writing and lovable characters. The weirdness of it all, which, if you've seen Twin Peaks, will make you feel right at home. The soundtrack and voice acting, are pretty decent as well. But overall, the biggest strength is the writing and the characters, that hook you in and don't let go. The final few chapters have some extremely gripping moments, and despite an extremely long and annoying quick-time sequence, the end was very satisfying and unique. I'm sure you agree, Zach.

Anyway, tl;dr - this game is flawed, but brilliant, and if you enjoy weirdness and good story - give it a try. This is as close to a Twin Peaks game that you're going to get, people.",1595454529,1595454529,True,3,0,0.563758373260498047,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It features an interesting story with bizarre characters, action sequences that play like a slow third-person shooter, occasional easy puzzles. and a fairly large map to explore. Unfortunately the PC port is barely playable due to technical issues.

The game successfully creates a ""US small-town"" environment with many characters who have their own schedules, and have different things to say depending on the current state of affairs. The murder mystery is exceptionally well designed - lots of people are suspect in one way or another, but there is no obvious culprit. You always feel that there is more to the murders than you already know, and the story ends in a chain of revelations that definitely surprised me. The main plot is very linear, but the game also offers 50 side quests, and you are usually free to decide which tasks you tackle next. The side quests are, however, often completely nonsensical and feel tacked-on.

The FBI agent that you play, is a pretty interesting character (for example, he keeps talking to his partner that no one else can see, and uses his morning coffee as an oracle). However, he's also an arrogant jerk and a terrible chauvinist, he's very judgmental in his off-hand remarks about other people, and I didn't really feel comfortable playing him. I think he was intended to be a brilliant but emotionally challenged detective, but the writing was not good enough to pull that off. The writing - or perhaps rather the English translation - is unfortunately a problem for many characters and scenes throughout the game. Speakers often contradict themselves within just a few sentences, the flow of many conversations makes little sense, and it often feels as if lines were translated one by one without knowledge of the context. 

Apart from exploring the map and talking to people, a substantial part of the game takes place in a surrealistically warped version of the town's environment where zombie-like creatures try to kill you. You fight back with a variety of guns and melee weapons while also looking for clues and helpful items. The fights are fairly easy as most of the enemies move slowly and/or in predictable patterns, but they are successful in creating an eerie, creepy atmosphere. Occasionally you run into harder boss encounters with QTE elements and multiple phases.

The game provides ample room for exploration and generally rewards it with small amounts of money. There are also 65 collectibles to find.

Graphics looked already dated when the game was originally released in 2010. They look crude and primitive by today's standards, but were still good enough to not affect my enjoyment. Unfortunately the PC port is locked to a 720p resolution, which means that you can see each individual pixel on a large monitor. It also uses a washed-out color palette, which many people see as a negative compared to the original Xbox version, but I think it actually fits the atmosphere quite well.

Sound and music are competently done. The game contains some catchy, simple tunes that I liked, though they seemed much too upbeat for the atmosphere of the game. That said, they can be seen as providing welcome relaxation and relief between the more tense parts of the game. Much (but not all) of the dialogue is voiced, and the voice actors did a good job, though voice direction was clearly lacking - it's often obvious that the lines were delivered without knowledge of the context.

Usability features are a mixed bag with this game. You can rebind action keys, but that's not very useful because movement is fixed to WASD. You can invert the Y- and even X-axis separately, and you can choose different settings for camera movement and aiming, but there's no FOV slider. You can save manually, but only at dedicated save spots, and there's only one save slot.

The game's biggest problem by far are its technical issues. It kept crashing about once per 90 minutes on average, and while that can be mitigated by saving at each and every opportunity, that is a) not always possible, and b) detrimental to the experience when you keep worrying about finding a save spot rather than enjoying the story. One scene crashed every time it played, so I had to search forums for a workaround (which was, oddly enough, to let several hours of in-game time pass). Another problem is a perpetual loud screeching noise, accompanied by equally loud, high-pitched, frantic ""blip"" noises, whenever I was in a car (which amounts to many hours). Alt-tabbing out of the game caused it to freeze irrecoverably each and every time unless I was playing in windowed mode, but then I was limited to a 720p window. Two boss fights require you to turn off auto-aim (otherwise you _cannot_ hit your target), but auto-aim always gets automatically switched on whenever you draw a weapon, and turning it off requires a keypress that does not always work. There are community fixes for some of these issues, but they do not work for everyone. In short, this port is a terrible mess and it reflects badly on Rising Star games that they released this title in such a shoddy state without ever fixing it.

I recommend Deadly Premonition for its complex plot, immersive setting, and bizarre characters. It definitely deserves its status as a cult classic. That said, be prepared for many painful moments due to the game's technical issues. If you're not willing to accept frequent crashes and multiple other issues (like that loud screeching noise whenever you're driving), you probably won't be able to enjoy this game. The Steam achievements show that 42% of players finished the prologue, but only 12% made it through the first quarter of the game, and my guess is that most players will just decide that the technical issues are too annoying to put up with.

I played this back on the Xbox 360 waaay back in 2009 or so, I don't really remember. I just remember totally falling in love with everything so weird and quirky about it. The controls take a bit to get used to, but it's not horrible or unplayable by any means.

HOWEVER, I do not recommend this port. It's a terrible port imo, and many other people have agreed. I was only able to get a few hours into the Steam version, just because there are so many issues that I doubt will ever be fixed. Playing it with a controller seems to be hit-or-miss, at least for me. I was able to use my Xbox 360 controller plugged in for a while, but trying again recently has just been total failure. I'm not really a fan of the keyboard controls, but I guess it's better than nothing if nothing else will work. 

There's also a really annoying issue with when you're driving around, where this obnoxious screeching/breaking car noise just keeps happening over and over and over again. Apparently it has something to do with audio drivers or something, I have no idea. It's just something that I guess there is a fix(?) for, but as far as I know, and as far as my experience is, it does not work all the time. That particular bug/issue doesn't seem to happen when I play through my speakers, but that's just one of the many issues I've seen and/or heard about this port.

Once again, this game is a cult classic and definitely worth checking out, but I'd say get the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version if you can. The controls are always gonna be janky and bad, but it just takes a few hours of getting used to and they don't seem to be too much of a problem, at least the way I remember it.

Quiero recalcar que este juego es pésimo, todo el aspecto técnico está muy mal hecho, tiene un sin fin de errores. Es más, la versión de PC es la menos recomendable. De hecho opté por dejar tirada esta versión y simplemente jugarlo en otra plataforma, lo jugué en Switch.

Dejando de lado lo horrible del apartado técnico y jugable, narrativamente es muy, pero muy bueno. Diría que es como una mala película, la mayoría de personajes rayan en lo cliché a propósito, pero pese a ello son terriblemente carismáticos. La historia junto con los protagonistas se desarrolla muy bien, los giros argumentales están muy bien hechos. Si bien en un principio el juego posee aspectos que detesto, como lo es la disonancia ludonarrativa, al final la mayoría de huecos terminan siendo explicados.
Deberás soportar todo por la historia, si te atrapa antes de las 2 horas, bien, juégalo porque te va a encantar, si no, reembolsa en ese mismo instante.

Pienso que hubiera funcionado mucho mejor como libro, película, o hasta como un juego de los de Quantic Dream. Si no, simplemente quitándole el 50% del gameplay hubiera quedado mejor, porque es tedioso.
Mi consejo es ir netamente por la historia, olvídate que es un mundo abierto.

Hidetaka 'Swery' Suehiro'nun yönetmeni olduğu Deadly Premonition'ın yeni oyunu 10 Temmuz'da Switch oyuncularıyla buluşacak. Polisiye, macera ve korku öğelerini kullanan ve oyuncuya sunduğu özgürlüklerle dikkat çeken bu yapım, Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut adıyla PS3 versiyonundan daha detaylı bir oynanışı ve içeriği de sunuyor. Francis York adlı detektifin 'kırmızı tohum cinayetleri'ni araştırdığı Deadly Premonition, David Lynch'in yönetmenliğini üstlendiği Twin Peaks'ten de oldukça esinlenmiştir. Gizem ve polisiye dolu bir macera arıyorsanız Deadly Premonition sizi memnun edecektir. Oyunun bütçesinin düşük olmasından ötürü oynanış açısından biraz zorlasa da, sonunda tatmin olacaksınız.

У Френсиса есть воображаемый друг - Зак(это мы), с которым он обсуждает почти всё что увидит или услышит.

Геймплей поделен на две части:
 1) Повседневные будни где вы будете путешествовать в машине или без(не советую) по пустому и открытому миру заглядывая в местные закусочные, бары, магазины и чужие дома для общения с разными персонажами живущими в городе и выполняя второстепенные задания и мини-игры связанные с ними. Френсису также требуется употреблять еду, стирать одежду(а то вокруг вас разлетятся мухи), бриться(по желанию) и спать; 
2) Детективное расследование во время которого мы перемещаемся в потусторонний мир и отстреливаемся от мертвецов, девочек из звонка и убийцы в красном дождевике. Последнего кстати нельзя убить - от него нужно только убегать и прятаться. После нахождения каждой улики, Френсис производит в своей голове ""Профилирования"" для  раскрытия полной картины произошедшего.

Саундтрэк порадует вас - от жизнерадостных и успокаивающих до таинственных, мрачных и драматических композиций.

Интересная история с неожиданными поворотами и событиями, приятным саундтрэком, множеством харизматичных и странных(игра японская) персонажей - Ради этого в игру стоит сыграть. Но как игра - Это гoвнo. В игре плохо почти всё: Графика с анимацией пришли с 2004(игра вышла в 2010) года, пустой открытый мир, неудобное управление, конченная стрельба(одновременно стрелять и ходить Френсис не может) и плохая оптимизация(её просто нет).

Первое, что нужно обязательно сделать, садясь за Deadly Premonition — отбросить в сторону логику.

В Deadly Premonition непостижимым образом сочетаются очень жестокий психологический триллер в духе «Молчания ягнят», мистический детектив в лучших традициях «Твин Пикс» Дэвида Линча, насыщенная драма, вполне себе сайлент-хилльный хоррор и по-японски абсурдистская комедия. Второй такой игры больше нет. Это факт.

В отличие от многих других, Deadly Premonition не пытается ничем казаться. Она не пытается походить на кино, выдерживать чью-то атмосферу или использовать клише — это полностью законченное и самостоятельное произведение, чистый полет авторской мысли. 
Именно поэтому многим игра может видеться сумасшедшей, это не типично киношный детектив, как Heavy Rain, работающий по логике других детективов. 
Deadly Premonition не будет заботиться о том, чтобы вы все поняли, правильно восприняли и ушли довольным.

Так уж устроил SWERY свою игру, что все враги в ней — не опасность, но препятствие, а главный противник — время и ваше терпение. Однако затем, когда внутренняя логика станет ясна, откроется второе дно. А потом третье. И четвертое. А может, и пятое.

Как и многое другое, боевые сцены в Deadly Premonition следует воспринимать как данность, как препятствие на пути к решению загадки. 
Враги повторяются, надоедают, стрелять неудобно — всегда проще убежать, если есть возможность. 
Они тут в первую очередь для того, чтобы утомить, — чтобы игрок плюнул и выключил игру. Естественный фильтр, отсеивающий нетерпеливых.


Зато технических изменений побольше. Немного поправили графику (от чего кожа персонажей стала похожа на резиновую), управление сделали поудобнее, зачем-то прикрутили смешной 3D-режим, изменили дизайн интерфейса.

А вот то, что следовало бы поправить, не изменилось. Неудобная карта — по-прежнему отличный стимул, чтобы выучить Гринвейл наизусть, работа со звуками по-прежнему непрофессиональная, музыкальных тем удручающе мало. Добавились падения FPS, такое ощущение, что игра работает на 15 кадров в секунду. 
Не то что стрелять — путешествовать по Гринвейлу невозможно!

Плюсы:
+ Красота смерти; каждое убийство — арт-инсталляция;
+ Нестандартность всего и вся;
+ Сочетание несочетаемого;
+ Психодел;
+ Сюжет;
+ Диалоги;
+ Карточки и ачивки.

Минус:
- Всё остальное выполнено на довольном посредственном уровне, множественные технические косяки. В этой игре плохо абсолютно всё кроме самой истории, персонажей, сюжета и т. п.

Если оценивать Deadly Premonition по стандартным параметрам, много баллов она не получит. 
С точки зрения геймдизайна, это очень сырая и неудобная игра, местами откровенно неприятная. 
Но как произведение искусства она заслуживает 10 из 10 — это действительно гениальная (или безумная?), ни на что не похожая игра.",1593640536,1593640760,True,79,3,0.786185503005981445,0,False,False,False,False,,,

	A lot of respect is paid to intricately marvelous technical accomplishments in AAA blockbuster releases, but I expect a game with a budget to rival the GDP of a small nation to have a few tricks up its sleeves, to show us rope moving as we have never seen rope move before within a digital space. But it’s much more spectacular to find it here, in this game that seems as if it should not exist salvaged from an innocuously titled project called “Rainy Woods” and made on a budget similar to my annual cigarette purchasing expenses. In a AAA game, I will ooh and aah at a passing semblance of genuine physics expressed upon a wire. In Deadly Premonition, seeing the scene or two where York enacts a reasonably rendered facsimile of pulling a sheet over his bed-bound body seems like a miracle. It is finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. It is seeing a unicorn on a walk through the woods. 

	So much of Deadly Premonition works on that level – the common refrain is that it is a bad game, possibly a game so bad that it’s good. But, let me tell you a secret, lean in close – it’s actually a good game. Just out and out, a good game. It looks bad, feels worse, sounds confused, likely smells funny, and now courtesy of a Switch release with a don’t-eat-this coating on the game card even tastes bad. But it’s a goddamn good game, because under an obfuscating morass of outdated gamemaking it is full of moments that reflect and even outshine modern games. And that, from a title that originally released 10 years ago. 

	There is, for example, a surprise after every meandering low-impact Resident Evil 4 inspired shooting sequence. Not a surprise as in a GOTCHA but a surprise as in a dramatically rendered murder scene that transcends Lynchian inspiration and becomes Fulleresque, reminiscent of the dramatic death tableaus of Hannibal that would populate network television three years after this game’s release. And even more dramatic than the visuals are the characters reacting to them, characters built in fits and starts in ways much more accomplished than many other games – Emily Wyatt, the traditional Woman Who Can’t Cook who is also the only big city transplant in Greenvale expressing unequivocal horror that something like this could happen here. Meek and effeminate Thomas Maclaine who treats the investigation to lunch on a daily basis, finding time to hone his cooking craft despite late nights tending bar at his sister’s place, eating lunch to be inevitably regurgitated. George Woodbridge, the handlebar mustachioed sheriff with dumbbells called Arnold and Sylvester and an ailing mother who is stricken by how impotent all his power, physical and institutional, seems to be in the face of such grisly crimes. 

	Each of these things are surprises. To feel such attachment and empathy for these characters is testament to how well the game captures its tone of a small town full of small people caught up in something awful and big. Outside of these big moments, life goes on in Greenvale like a quiet murmur punctuated with sudden shouts. There are 27 named characters, one for literally each letter of the alphabet (and two for I – twins Isaiah and Isaac, the cherubic manifestations of small town innocence in York’s dream sequences). Each of them have their own stories to varying degrees, ranging from the General Lysander’s veteran status haunting his graveyard to gas station owner Jack the Raging Bull who just wants bribes in the form of $100 bills to converse with. Lynch’s log lady here finds a sort of analogue in Wandering Sigourney who makes her way around town with a pot, its contents a mystery but always growing cold and necessitating York giving her a breakneck ride home to reveal...literally nothing. An amusing subversion of any Twin Peaks fan’s expectations. 

	I could talk all day about how bad those drives are, how the controls for vehicles feel like driving a Matchbox car down a waterslide and no passengers make any remarks as York careens into poles and shrubbery. I could talk about the weird pointlessness of the action sequences, evidently a publisher mandate to make a more salable game and actually quite decent considering that but superfluous nonetheless. I could talk about how when York goes fishing, he can catch anything from fish to trading cards to ammo and all but the first of those is represented with a big flat icon on the end of a hook in York’s hands rather than an actual object. 
	
	That’s missing the rainy woods for the trees when this game, more than absolutely any other, is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a game where the phrase “games as art” appears twice on its Wikipedia page – a full ¼ as many times as the phrase appears on the page “Video games as an art form.” That may be perhaps overselling it a bit – the tail end of the game has a sudden series of boss encounters that wouldn’t be out of place in a JRPG suggesting that the developers ran as fast and hard as they could to make art but the fact they were making a game still caught up with them. 

	Still, for most of the game’s 20ish hours it exceeds the expectations its own presentation brings on to provide a fascinating, often funny, sometimes frightening, consistently human take on small town America as filtered through a specific sort of American television. Agent Francis York Morgan – his friends call him York – is among gaming’s most memorable and idiosyncratic characters even as he functions perfectly within the narrative as an outsider to Greenvale on par with the player. And for most of the game, his asides to an unseen “Zach” seem like they might as well be whispers to whoever is on the other side of the screen. With York as a vessel into this plasticine pastoral world, this clearly mechanical simulation full of life, the player is led into one of the most remarkably unique games in the medium.",1592897778,1592897778,True,35,0,0.770220398902893066,1,False,False,False,False,,,

(Please read ""This Port"" part too)

Deadly Premonition, in my opinion, it's a masterpiece. 
The first thing I want to mention are the characters, 
Each character is well thought out and each one is different from the other, and a lot of them are really weird too, and that makes it more fun. a lot of them also have interesting back stories, development and relationships, which can be seen during the main story and sidequests.
And the Main character, York, is just full of personality in his own way, and it's interesting to see how he holds up relationships with other characters because of his oddness. and there's also another character I felt very attached to, I was hoping that nothing would  happen to him/her in the story, because I really liked that character.

And then is the Town, Greenvale. is so full of personality, variety and things to do, it's like playing a real life simulator almost. you have a sleep meter and a hunger meter, and have to sleep the proper hours and eat the right amount, and you can shave if you want too and change or clean your suit. What's cool too, is that in this game there is a clock, where in every day each character has a routine that they follow and they are in different places or doing different things depending on the time, story placement and even if it's raining or not. This also applies in the different shops that are in town, having open and close times. This is an open world game after all, you can explore the town by walking or driving around, talk to people, enter places and do sidequests, which a lot of them can only be done at a specific time and/or at a specific episode, and they are also really great and keep adding lore to the characters and town. Sometimes it can be hard to know exactly when and where to meet a person to start a quest, but I can see past that when I actually do them, because they bring more story and interesting things to the game. You can still use a guide if you want though, here's one I used to know where to get some trading cards I was missing in the cards collection: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=775096779&insideModal=0&requirelogin=1


And with all this of course it comes the story. I think this is one of the best stories in any game, I don't wanna say too much but it keeps adding mysteries and clues to keep it entertaining, and having all the interesting characters in it makes it so much better, maybe you will feel attached to some of them like I did. The game also has emotional moments and some heartwarming ones, that make the connection with the player even better.

You will also start wondering who the killer may be, which is fun to speculate and see who you think it is changes throughout the story.
The dialogue and voice acting is really good too, and they mark the feeling or mood of the characters really well.

and then, the gameplay. Aside from the driving and open world of the game, there are  third person shooter sections, where you explore places and have to deal with zombie-like creatures, which I found to be ok, but nothing too special.
and it has some horror and suspense elements too, but if you are not into that kind of thing I think it's okay because it's nothing too crazy. (keep in mind this is a M rated game after all, and some other very impactful things happen)

and the music is really good too, there's one really catchy song I can't get out of my head!

Here I would like to mention some things that the game lacks, but I can see over them considering all the other stuff the game offers, but for some people this may be something to notice, and may be the reason why this game got mixed reviews.
The reviews sometimes say the game lacks with the graphics and animations, but I think the game looks pretty good for its time though, and in fact I found all the details and touches made in the character models and in all of Greenvale pretty nice.
The other thing is that the controls in the third person shooter segments may be a little weird and not as good as other games. And the last thing I wanted to mention is that you can't mark a place you want to go when you're driving, which bothered me a little at first, but then I got used to the town and unlocked a teleporting item to make things faster. It's mostly technical problems, but in my opinion they don't detract from the experience, because the game at its core is fantastic.

Getting that out of the way, lastly I would like to mention that the developers seem to have put a lot of details in the game, for example if you play side quests at the last chapter of the game that could be previously played in other chapters, some dialogues change, and it's cool because just a few people may notice this but the devs added the extra detail just for them.

Overall, I really recommend this game and is one of my favorites of all time, there is nothing out there quite like it, and you can tell it had a lot of heart put into it.


THIS PORT

However, I do not recommend this version of the game. 
unfortunately, this version is very likely to crash, and I also ran into some almost game breaking crashes, but I just kept trying and trying different ways until I got past it, and I luckily got past all of them, but it cost a lot of tries and time. I have also read online that some of the ones that I have experienced made people stop playing because they just couldn't get past it like I did, or maybe didn't want to keep trying different ways until it worked, which is understandable.
It's such a shame, because this is just a great game with a lot of heart and effort put into it, but its technical problems make a lot of players back off from this experience.
I hope someday they will fix it, but I recommend getting the PS3, Xbox 360 or Nintendo Switch version instead, to avoid any problems.

But if you want to stick with this version, I recommend following the instructions in this post, it makes the game look better and run better:
https://steamcommunity.com/app/247660/discussions/0/1290691937708333615/
And if you are playing with a controller, I recommend using the Deadly Premonition controller + setting from the steam community, it solves a problem with the camera movement and it also makes the controls better in my opinion

○ Terrible graphics, even for 2010 standards, characters lips don't even sync with what they are saying.
○ Lack of polish.
○ The ""open world"" map is difficult to orient yourself with, a lack of proper zoom out function and the fact that your map turns as your character tuns makes it rather confusing. Game's only saving grace is the fast travel mechanic which you can only get by doing the nameless flower side mission which you can only find the flower on a rainy day. I found that once I'd unlocked fast travel, I did not want to travel manually anymore. Ever.
○ Low budget.
○ PC version crashes semi regularly. If you're a completionist, don't even start this game, but if you must, SAVE OFTEN!
○ Side missions are terrible. Practically 50 fetch quests. No genuine thought put into any of them.
○ Original controller settings for camera control make this game unplayable. You will need an alternative controller config.
○ Lack of varied sountrack and sound effects. There's very few background tracks.
○ Combat is clunky, aiming is not great and enemy variety is lacking. 
○ 27 chapters, yet could have been condensed into a lot less and had the same impact. Some chapters only require talking to an NPC, finding some red seeds or the fishing ""minigame"".
○ Speaking of the fishing minigame, it's just terrible, the use of what seems to be PNG image files and the ""slots"" feel to it just feels cheap and unfinished.
○ Red vines are blockades but there's one in Harry's Mansion that was not programmed to stop you so you can easily walk through it.
○ Driving controls are clunky and buggy,
○ Tiredness and hunger mechanics don't fit in well. 1 min of game time =  1 min of real time... just does not work, even with the whole smoking to fast forward time mechanic.

Subjectively a good game:
○ Story and characters are great, this probably should have been a B movie though, not a game.

The graphics are total crap also, the textures are bad and even more you cannot play this game on FULL HD or better resolution, it's locked on 1280x720 resolution, framerate also locked at 30 fps.
To play this game on FULL HD or better and 60 fps you must use mod called DPFix. lol modder are way more smarter than these lazy a.s.s developers.
What a shame this game has a good story and interesting main character, it's hard to recommend this hidden gem because of these annoying bugs, there also many glitch that can cause some key items to disappear, if you save the game often also cause crash and glitch to appear more frequently, really an unfixed terrible mess.

El juego es la hostia en cuanto a historia, ahora es ortopédico como él solo y es bastante rudimentario a la hora de jugarlo. No lo dejéis pasar es una joya oculta, dadle una oportunidad. 

CRASHEOS POSIBLE SOLUCIÓN
Para los que le crashean, yo lo pude jugar poniendo compatibilidad con windows xp service pack 2 tanto el launcher como el .exe de la carpeta de common de steamapps. Deshabilité la interfaz de steam desde las propiedades del juego (en la aplicación de steam en la biblioteca) y eliminé una librería dentro de la propia carpeta raíz del juego que se llama d3d9 (si no recuerdo mal) después de haber hecho esto, no solía crashear (algunas veces de manera random pero muy pocas veces). También me bajé la última versión del DPfix y lo único que cambié fue la resolución a pantalla completa y ventana a la de mi monitor, lo demás lo dejé por defecto. Lo único malo es que no saltan los logros pero bueno, al menos lo puedes jugar. 

PROBLEMA EN EL APUNTADO
A veces se quedaba como pillada la mirilla y no podía apuntar hacia arriba o hacia abajo (que unido al sistema rudimentario de apuntado era bastante latoso). Lo pude solucionar dando a la tecla windows o tabulando para acabar en el escritorio, luego volvía a seleccionar el juego abierto en la barra de tareas y al parecer al bloquearse los fps, o algo así he deducido, podía apuntar perfectamente en todas las direcciones.

Al principio me pareció interesante el intento de copia de la serie unido a un intento de copia de Silent Hill con los cambios de escenarios y con mecánicas de mundo abierto entre GTA y Yakuza. Pero al final se queda en eso intentos.

La navegación por el mapa es tediosa, ya que no puedes ver el mapa completo en ningún momento y las carreteras no son precisamente intuitivas. Los zombis son una broma y en ningún momento se sienten amenazantes, menos aún cuando haciendo un par de secundarias tienes armas potentes con munición infinita. 

Los personajes intentan parecer esos anticlichés que Lynch utiliza, pero terminan siendo tropos que están para decorar. Por ejemplo tenemos a Sigurney, la señora del cazo, una copia barata de Margaret, la señora del leño de twin peaks. La segunda es un punto clave dentro de la resolución del misterio y forma parte del lore de la serie, la primera sólo sirve para unas misiones secundarias que sirven sólo para conseguir coleccionables y coches nuevos.

En cuanto a la imitación de Silent Hill, tenemos al asesino del impermeable, de nuevo un intento de crear su propio Pyramid Head. A diferencia de su inspiración, este señor del hacha sólo es amenazante porque el juego mecánicamente te hace imposible responder ante él y sus encuentros se reducen a hacer unos pocos quick time events que sólo son difíciles si te pillan por sorpresa.

Por último, el final del juego es bastante anticlimático. De repente el juego se cansa de ser un survival horror y se convierte en un devil may cry, pero con unas mecánicas que no están hechas para estos tipos de jefes, los cuales desentonan enormemente con lo que había sido el juego hasta ese momento. Además te enfrentas a una elección de la cual sólo hay una respuesta correcta, supongo que intentaron dar la ilusión de múltiples finales.

En definitiva, este juego intenta muchas cosas y consigue muy pocas.

[h1] There can be no disagreements about this game [/h1]

So, you know how you can get into an argument with another game-enthusiast about which game is best/worst? It seems that no matter which game you love, there will always be a person who will hate it with a passion and you will undoubtedly end up in a discussion with them, and vice-versa.

Not with Deadly Premonition. You can't do that with this game.

Observe:
“Deadly Premonition is a bad game”, “Yes, it is”, 
“Deadly Premonition is the best game ever made”, “Yes, it is”, 
“Deadly Premonition has the worst writing ever”, “Yes, it does”
“Deadly Premonition has the best writing ever”, “Yes, it does”.
Even as I’m wiring this, I’m surprised that all of these are actually true.

[h1] A horrible game that everyone loves? [/h1]

What is Deadly Premonition? In short: Deadly Premonition is a horrible game. It is also one of my favorite games of all time and many people share my opinion.

So what’s so good about Deadly Premonition? The story and the characters. But didn’t I just say that the story was bad? Yes, I did. It’s a bad story that’s extremely enjoyable filled with bad characters that are also extremely enjoyable.
So let’s start at the beginning: The game stars FBI Agent Francis York Morgan. York, as he likes to be called, is sent out to investigate a series of murders that occurred in a quiet little town surrounded by woods. 

[h1] The gameplay is a mess [/h1]

The first time you actually get control of the game, you realize that the game tries to replicate Resident Evil 4
https://store.steampowered.com/app/254700/resident_evil_4__
 or Dead Space
https://store.steampowered.com/app/17470/Dead_Space/

 with its controls, but it does so in the worst possible way. Everything that’s supposed to work, works in the worst possible way. The movement feels awkward, drawing your weapon feels awkward, aiming feels really awkward and even locking-on enemies’ feels awkward. It’s barely playable and it’s hilariously bad game design. Not to mention that the graphics look like crap. So once you get past the first “game” session you are thrown into this open-world forest town and that’s where the game actually begins (the good parts).

[h1] You want the story! Not the gameplay! The story sucks too! [/h1]

The cutscenes. That’s the reason most people adore this game. They aren’t well acted, well written nor do they make any sense most of the time but you get to watch all these characters speak and do their stuff which is where this game shines.
Take the main character, Agent York, for example. While he is generally an arrogant and rude person he is also particularly picky about his biscuits and coffee. Often during dialogue, he will pop a random smile that’s nothing short of creepy. He is also schizophrenic and will talk to his “imaginary friend” Zack. Since you get to answer the questions he asks Zack, that kinda makes you his alter ego… I guess. Surprisingly this is a very good way to get you engaged with the character. 

The other characters are a bunch of weirdos as well. You’ve got a millionaire tycoon who refuses to speak and wars a gas mask only talking through his butler in rhyme, a police officer who runs like a ballerina and bakes biscuits, an artist who is a nymphomaniac, an overweight gardener with a dark secret, the list just goes on and on. It’s the kind of weirdness you simply can’t predict. It’s like watching a murder mystery TV show where the detectives and the suspects are clowns. You laugh at how bad everything is but are also weirdly intrigued.

[h1] Lots of things to do in this game and most of them are poorly made [/h1]

While all that’s nice and good, what’s the gameplay like. The gameplay of this game is just bad. Everything about it is bad and I mean everything. I already mentioned how the controls are lousy and how the graphics look like they are from the 2000s but it just keeps getting worse. Since this is an open world game, you also have driving vehicles. The driving sucks. You also have free roaming where you do side quests and collect trading cards. All of these suck too. Then you have your stamina bar and your health that are mostly pointless because you rarely run out of health or stamina. You also have a sleep and eat meter which you have to replenish and by that I mean, do it once or twice during your entire playthrough. You also need to change your clothes and shave, otherwise flies start flying around you and you grow a beard and no, there isn’t really a penalty for not doing either of those.

[h1] We have to have zombies, right? [/h1]

While going through the investigation is fun and all, before every major location you will be forced to go through … uhhh…. A shooting section I guess. Basically, that’s where most of the gameplay is. While driving around, collecting cards and doing side quests is mostly optional, you have to go through shooting sections and they are easily the worst part of this game.

What happens is that every time York is alone, the atmosphere turns dark and weird zombie-like creatures start attacking him as he makes his way through the level. I use the term “attack” very loosely because these, while scary, are some of the worst enemies I have ever encountered. They are really slow, they can be ran past without any problems and when they do actually notice you and attack you, they bend backwards and do a crabwalk in order to get to you and even when they hit you it’s not a big deal. Needless to say, whenever I replay these sections, I always just want to get through them as quickly as possible so that I can enjoy the rest of the story. And YES, these have absolutely nothing to do with the game.

Sometimes, York will also encounter the raincoat killer (the main antagonist) of the game. During these sections, York will have to hide or run away from the killer. These again are really badly done and are laughable at best.

[h1] You must endure all the bad parts in order to get to the good parts [/h1]

Now, many people will tell you that this PC port is really bad and that you should avoid it at all costs unless you patch it heavily and even then it’s not worth it. This is all true. The game is locked at 30 fps, the resolution is locked, the graphics are far from perfect, the controls suck… basically… the game barely works… and, if you ask me, that’s just the way how this game should be played.

You don’t really want to play the zombie sections or the driving or anything, you want to watch the cutscenes and the story BUT in order to watch this hilariously bad story, you have to ENDURE the game. YES, I honestly think that you should play this PC port as it is just so you can pay an imaginary toll in order to get to the next cutscene. Why? Well, the Xbox 360 version (the original one) barely worked too, so it’s the way how the game was supposed to be played. 

So, yes, the game barely works and it will probably crash and stutter and run poorly, but if you are determined, you will get to those beautiful cutsences. Sure, you can patch the game and make it all nice and more playable but, honestly, it will still be a bad game just slightly more playable. So I don’t think these is much point.

[h1] Even though it makes no sense, I absolutely adore this game [/h1]

In conclusion, Deadly Premonition is a cluster-f***. It’s a horrible game where everything is horrible but it’s also horribly enjoyable and I wouldn’t have it any other way. The Xbox 360 disk of Deadly Premonition will forever sit proudly on my shelf and so will this Steam version.

Deadly Premonition — это шутер от первого лица с отличным мистическим сюжетом, интересными персонажами и диалогами, открытым миром и головоломками. И всё это погребено под горой самых разных багов, подчас не дающих продвинуться дальше по сюжету.

Чтобы никто не питал напрасных надежд по поводу незначительности багов: на данный момент в Стиме опубликовано 38 руководств, и 21 из них касается решения [i]неизбежных[/i] технических проблем в игре. 21 из 38! У этой игры ОЧЕНЬ много проблем. Она может внезапно вылететь или зависнуть без возможности выйти на рабочий стол (придётся отключать её на ощупь через диспетчер задач), может так сильно лагать, что играть будет крайне неприятно, а ещё, говорят, может уничтожить ваши сохранения. Это то, что возможно преодолеть, если периодически переставлять совместимости и режимы игры и делать бэкапы сохранений. Но есть и то, чего избежать нельзя: неудобное использование карты, прицеливание и управление автомобилем, проблемы со звуком (иногда голоса звучат тише, чем надо, а музыка — громче), тонущие в асфальте машины, проходящие сквозь холмы олени, протыкающий Йорка насквозь галстук… в общем, много того, что не ломает игру, но способно в неожиданный момент разрушить для вас атмосферу.

Геймплей чётко делится на две чередующиеся части: в одной Йорк волен перемещаться по открытому миру — городу, общаться с NPC, ходить по магазинам и т.д.; другая часть представляет собой линейные уровни с призраками, от которых нужно отбиваться, чтобы пройти дальше по сюжету. Как в любом survival horror'е, эти уровни также содержат простейшие квесты (сходи в конец одного длинного коридора и возьми предмет, чтобы применить его в конце другого длинного коридора), а также напряжённые QTE-сцены с прятками от одного из злодеев игры.

Изначально уровней с призраками в том виде, в котором мы их видим сейчас, не планировалось, команда разработчиков хотела сделать лишь QTE и прятки по шкафам, но издатель сказал своё веское слово: сейчас в моде шутеры, будьте добры подогнать игру под шаблон. В итоге эти сцены выглядят вымученными, враги однообразны — их всего два вида, и второй встречается в игре от силы трижды, — а для тех, кто не любит шутеры и зашёл в игру ради сюжета и атмосферы, оставили имбу: бесконечный пистолет, который лежит в инвентаре Йорка с самого начала. Обладателям PC-версии сделали ещё больший подарок: из всех существующих на консолях уровней сложности оставили один: самый низкий. Благодаря этому встречи с призраками проходят легко и непринуждённо, если их не слишком много и они не зажимают героя в тесной комнате.

Побочных квестов, которые разбавляют сюжет и привносят любопытные штрихи в облик города, довольно много, и выполнять их интересно. Среди них загадки, поиск и доставка предметов, гонки, коллекционирование, тесты на знание медицины и реалий игры, дартс и даже сокобан.

Отдельный акцент сделан на самочувствии главного героя: ему нужно есть и спать, чтобы не умереть, и переодеваться, чтобы вокруг не начали летать мухи. Также герой может бриться или за несколько дней отрастить бороду. При этом предметы, восстанавливающие голод и усталость, встречаются порой в самых неожиданных местах: как вам, например, тарелка копчёного лосося, найденная в ржавом шкафу потустороннего мира? Там же, бывает, можно поспать и побриться — призраки подождут.

В связке с Deadly Premonition неустанно упоминают Twin Peaks, потому что в игре много отсылок, а то и украденных деталей из сериала. Разработчики этого и не скрывают. Агент ФБР приезжает в тихий маленький городок расследовать убийство — есть. Сцены, посвящённые кофе и еде, — есть. Странные персонажи, бессмысленные и ненужные детали — есть, и в избытке, ведь это Япония, страна крайностей и абсурда. Не забудьте о сильно выраженной мистической составляющей в обоих сюжетах — и вот готово представление о том, что Deadly Premonition — это японский Twin Peaks: с перекосами во все стороны и чёткими признаками хоррора.

Такого мощного и богатого сюжета не встретишь почти ни в одной другой игре. Местами это душераздирающая драма, местами придурковатая комедия, ну и, конечно, без ужасов не обошлось. Игра пугает без скримеров, а некоторые события сюжета могут выбить из колеи на несколько дней.

Ни одна сцена не существует просто «для галочки», каждая из них если не даёт нужную по сюжету информацию, то обязательно вызывает те или иные яркие эмоции. Чего стоит сцена, когда за обедом сотрудники департамента шерифа выпытывают у Йорка, какими были его расследования в большом городе, и получают такой прямой и детальный ответ, что у всех пропадает аппетит.

Работа режиссёра в катсценах на высоте, «оператор» часто выбирает необычные планы, которые отлично подходят для конкретных сцен и делают акцент на том, что в этот момент важно.

Подборка музыки необычна. Несколько мелодий так красивы и атмосферны, что чем глубже погружаешься в сюжет, тем больше от них захватывает дух, есть и удачный жуткий эмбиент, а есть глупейшие треки, использованные в игре для контраста. Включат одну из них посреди какой-нибудь кошмарной сцены, да сопроводят неожиданным глупым событием — и вы прочувствуете странный фирменный контраст этой игры.

Исследовать игровой мир интересно, замечать намеренно вставленные странности очень смешно, а весь глубокий многоплановый сюжет невозможно воспринять за один раз, слишком он концентрированный. Пусть игровые улицы Гринвейла и пусты, нельзя сказать, что в Deadly Premonition мало контента. Эта игра продумана до мелочей, есть даже подозрение, что всевозможные баги и недостатки тоже были оставлены намеренно, чтобы сделать игру более странной, оторванной от реальности, чтобы помимо всего остального она смешила тонущими в дороге машинами и тревожила прерванными катсценами.

Бесспорно, техническая сторона игры безобразна, так делать порты на PC нельзя. Но эти бесподобные сюжет и атмосфера оставляют впечатления на долгие годы. Хочется найти другие подобные игры, но их попросту нет и, скорее всего, не будет.

Чтобы пройти Deadly Premonition, придётся люто плясать с бубном, на это пойдёт далеко не каждый (и тот, кто не пойдёт, будет по-своему прав), но это возможно. Если вам нравятся ужасы, мистика и необычные игры, дайте ей шанс, и она отплатит вам отличным сюжетом.

Holy smokes, this was amazing! The entire game and story and everything felt so well done, besiiiiiiiiides the combat, BUT the elephant in the room is the crashes. If you're willing to put up with a LOT of crashes, scouring the internet for fixes, this is worth checking out, but it's a huge headache. There's a reason there's like... 12% people that have the chapter 2 complete achievement. If you're extremely patient, this version is worth a try, but I'd recommend any other port over this one. Even with DPFIX and compatibility modes, you're going to get crashes and lose progress and need other saves or backup saves. You've been warned.

**Original Review**

This has been a great game so far. The combat is lacking, but exploring and getting to know the town, soundtrack, the intrigue, dialogue, everything is great. But then it crashes. A lot. For no clear reason. And there are definitely fixes online for different issues, but that kind of postpones things until the next crash. Changing compatibility mode helps a bit, but its kind of a shot in the dark with how long it will help. I'm thankful the community is on this to try to get things working and people have save files to get past troublesome moments, but it's a bummer that the developer didn't fix these issues themselves after all these years. 

I do advise checking it out, but probably on any other version besides the PC unless you're will to put up with a lot of stuff. I plan on finishing it, but I know the game is going to fight me every step of the way :(",1581984620,1582257443,False,3,0,0.551143765449523926,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You see my first name is Zach, and one day it showed up on the Steam front page and I had had no previous introduction to it, but a trailer started autoplaying where the main character starts talking to his other personality in such a way that it seems as though he's talking to the player, and he keeps calling him Zach.
I was shook. I thought for a second that the game had somehow figured out my name and automatically edited it into the trailer. It felt weird as fuck. And for the entire time I played this game, I felt like I was getting another layer of experience that regular players wouldn't because all of the dialogue directed at Zach really felt like the game was communicating with me directly.
I googled the game and realized how stupid that was, but everything I saw online about the game made it seem divisive.
This game has a definite cult following, but there's also a lot of people who just straight up hate it, and with good reason.
The game is unfinished, or maybe overly ambitious. It's too long with too many pointless systems, and the systems it does have aren't really executed that well.
That said though, this game is impressive in the scope of what it's trying to do.
It combines detective style gameplay reminiscent of LA Noire with the survival horror elements and gunplay from Resident Evil, all the while taking place in a persistent open world that you can explore and with a storyline that's a little too closely ripping off of Twin Peaks, but still manages to hold up on it's own.
Now, although all of that is incredibly ambitious and impressive, I'm sorry to say it doesn't really do any of those things very well. All the gameplay mechanics are at least a little bit clunky, and although it was the game director's ambition to have this open world, the driving and the shooting mechanics of the game could've been reduced or eliminated entirely and I wouldn't have felt that the game was missing out on much. Also, using the map or the overall UI in general is just such a needless hassle.
The real thing here is the story which is surprisingly deep and complex despite the surface similarities to Twin Peaks. Now, be warned though, the dialogue and voice acting is pretty bad (with the exception of York's voice actor who sounds amazing). I'm not sure if this is just a problem of a Japanese game being poorly translated to English, or if the dialogue was just meant to sound this hokey and weird, but regardless, if you can muscle past that, you might actually find yourself enjoying the characters here much more than expected.
Now, as I've said, this game has a lot of similarities to Twin Peaks, enough so, in fact, that I think they got sued over it. Regardless, I actually feel like these are mostly surface or purely aesthetic similarities. The themes the game deals with in it's story are different and the overall vibe is actually pretty different too. Everything feels a little surreal, and you're never quite sure if it's intentional on the part of the developer or just something wacky and stupid. The music often seems weirdly out of place too, but is still really nice to listen to.

Overall, I can't help but recommend this game, although I fully admit it can feel like a bit of a slog at times. I feel like if this game had been given a AAA budget and maybe come out a few years later we would be talking about it nowadays as one of the greatest games of all time. But as it is now it's a fun, but weird, attempt at something bigger and grander.",1581399362,1581399362,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- using the .exe file to launch instead of steam
- running it in compatibility mode
- uninstalling lav from your computer
- realizing the previous step is harder than it sounds
- finally uninstalling lav after like an hour
- editing the game with a hex editor
- installing a bunch of hd ui mods
- installing your appropriate controller prompts
- creating a savedata folder because the game doesn't create it itself and it needs it to save
- installing a bunch of fixes I didn't mention because it'll still crash anyway
- making a deal with the devil

Me he armado de paciencia para descargar, instalar y configurar el archivo DPfix que ayuda (más bien habilita) a jugar, haciendo posible una configuración gráfica. Cabe destacar, que, por defecto, el juego se ve en 720 y está limitado a 30fps y sin este archivo creado por la comunidad, no hay ningún tipo de opción gráfica. Aun tomando estas medidas, al monitorear los recursos consumidos por la gráfica me he encontrado con la sorpresa de que estos oscilan brutalmente. A veces no consumía más que 25W para llegar a los 75fps (el refresco de mi pantalla), pero aleatoriamente empezaba a consumir 180w, el máximo de mi GPU para darme más de 300 fps, innecesarios.

Configurar el mando me ha sido imposible, la sensibilidad del ratón no funciona nada bien y los controles son horribles, es muy incómodo de jugar. Además, tiene unas teclas asignadas muy raras(apuntar con espacio?), los menús no están nada claros y mucho menos accesibles. Son muchas las ocasiones en las que estás en espacios oscuros con poca luz y lo único que acabas viendo es lo que está frente al personaje, por la linterna que lleva (una luz que le sale del pecho sin ningún sentido). Es importante puntualizar que lo que está enfrente del personaje no es aquello a lo que estás apuntando con la cámara, sino lo que tiene literalmente delente, teniendo que hacer que gire sobre sí mismo para poder enfocar luz allá a donde se quiera ver (¿he dicho ya que los controles son malos?, porque hacer esta cosa tan simple resulta muchas veces una azaña).
El sonido se supone que es estéreo, y realmente lo es. Independientemente de donde se suponga que viene el sonido, puede salir por cualquiera de los dos altavoces. Es una locura, solo sirve para confundir y no tiene término medio: sale por el izquierdo, por el derecho o por los dos con la misma intensidad, no hay una progresión que de sensación de entorno. 
El combo de la muerte ha sido el coche, en el que se han juntado una especie de bug de sonido estridente que no dejaba de sonar (evidentemente por encima de cualquier otro sonido del juego, como pueden ser conversaciones importante) y los pésimos controles (a mayor velocidad más rápido giraba el coche, haciéndose imposible su conducción). Además de parecer que carretera y vehículo no tenían ningún tipo de contacto.
Luego la narrativa... Sí que lo envuelve cierto halo de misterio y mal rollo del que quieres saber más. Pero no es nada que se desarrolle mientras haces misiones, si no con cinemáticas que solo generan más preguntas que respuestas. En más de una hora de juego he caminado por el bosque después de tener un accidente de coche, he llegado a un pueblo en el que me han dado café para desayunar y he buscado unas llaves perdidas en una comisaría que tan siquiera eran mías. Encima, buscando la llave me he tirado un buen rato por el simple hecho del tiempo que tarda la propia cinemática de abrir puertas para acceder a otra habitación (en la comisaría hay muchas puertas). Las conversaciones también tienen un ritmo muy muy pausado y no parecen tener ninguna relevancia.

Es un juego muy mal programado, gráficamente horroroso, no tiene jugabilidad y la poca que tiene se hace insufriblemente ortopédica y encima la narrativa es demasiado pausada, no he visto un juego con tan mal ritmo nunca. Todos estos factores han podido con la paciencia de la que disponía y que me había preparado a sabiendas de lo que se me venía encima, pero ha sido mucho más de lo esperado. No creo que nadie debiera jugar esta cosa.",1579002202,1579002202,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The port requires a collection of community fixes to really pass as a game you can get very far in, and it will still crash quite often, as if resource leaks or asserts fail after a while (especially with the map/driving). You can also get corrupted saves or points of instant-crash even with the community fixes in place.

I would like to believe the original Xbox 360 version in backwards compatibility on an Xbox One is a far more stable way to play than the PC release. Or even the recent Switch port.


The game itself is worth playing. The characters are curious, and if the idea of wondering around town as a rather odd FBI agent, and trying to solve a murder mystery between supernatural shootouts is your idea of RPG fun--you'll probably enjoy it. It's a bit slow paced compared to modern games, and the a lot of cut scenes. But it's fun, curious, and a little unique. You'll either love it or get bored within a few hours.

The only thing I really dislike is the PC port's lack of stability. There's only so much that users can fix without being able to recompile the game, or getting really jiggy with a hex editor.

Da sieht man wieder wie teilweise unglücklich 3D Spiele altern können, zumal hier auch noch eine ohnehin schwache Konsole Engine zugrunde liegt. Auch wenn das Spiel sicherlich bei einigen Fans von diesen alten Mystery-Horror-Actionspielen gefällt, vor allem mit der Nostalgiebrille betrachtet, objektiv betrachtet haben wir hier ein schlecht gealtertes 3D-Actionspiel mit abstrusem Storytelling und katastrophaler Portierung (Steuerung und instabil also crashanfällig). Wer das Spiel auf der Konsole mochte, sollte es auch besser auf der PS3 oder Xbox360 spielen und die Finger von diesem Port lassen.

INVENTORY BUGS! If you go to inventory, click the map, the game is running but your mouse pointer and keyboard is FROZEN! ALL YOU CAN DO IS WATCH AND HEAR THE PLEASANT BACKGROUND MUSIC. Forces you to Control Alt Delete and force close the game. and btw, I had to do this over 10 times! 

CUTSCENE BUGS! I found 3 or 4 different cutscenes where you watch it. After the cutscene, the game either CRASH or goes into a BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH!

DO NOT BUY! BUY IT FOR SWITCH, PS4, OR XBOX ONLY!

05/18/2021 REVIEW
So many cruel people in this world giving false fake lying good reviews. The reviews make this game look mostly good but they are all lies. They just feel bad for the developer making a broken game so they convince new players to continue to fund them out of false donation. That's not right at all. Shame on the most good reviews seriously shame on most of ya, all teaming up so the people who want to try this or don't believe the bad reviews are the actual truth will end up buying the game and find out the hard way. They will doubt and say this is a good game based on the majority good reviews. They will try the game out themselves and see the bugs errors and crashes themselves (seeing is believing, sadly) and will deeply regret it. It's not too late. Listen to the bad reviews, the game is indeed broken or has a lot of problems. If you wanna doubt us and waste your precious hard earned money, be my guest.

О мой юный друг, ты должен знать, что эта игра своей кривостью, багнутостью и мотанием нервов лично тебе побьет баггерфол, Андромеду, новый бардс тейл и пафиндер вместе взятые.
О, сколько раз я переустанавливала игру, так как переставали магическим образом работать сохранения, выдавая ошибку об отсутствии карты памяти. Два раза я перепроходила ее по той же причине, но с непосредственно запоротыми сохранениями в принципе, где даже переустановка не спасала ситуацию.
Сколько раз я переустанавливала игру, потому что не могла выйти из долбанной больницы. А один раз, опять по той же причине, перепроходила игру.

О эти пустынные и узкие тропы в горах и лесах, железная дорога и вагоны в дальнем углу мира, проезжая по которым практически каждую секунду убавлялась прочность машины, а сам процесс убиения железного коня сопровождался ""пумом"" - воистину, к концу игры этот звук стал родным. Ну, хоть благодаря этому был повод лишний раз заехать на мойку для спец обслуживания *яростно подмигивает и солютирует чупа-чупсом*.

О этот кривущий абсолютно везде геймплей, особенно боевка - вам не нужно огромное количество оружия. Я даже больше скажу, вам не нужен и пистолет с бесконечными патронами. Все, что вам нужно - это гитара, которую получаешь за один сайд квест. Воистину, с того момента, как я ее получила, не было ни одного монстра, которому нужно было бы двинуть больше одного-двух раз. Гитара в этой игре - просто откровенная имба, куда там магнуму и всяким огнеметам. Я не шучу.

Глава-миссия со слежкой на автомобиле до музея даже спустя 1,5 года стоит в топе моих личных кошмаров. Как ее можно было настолько криво сделать даже в сравнении со всей игрой, я не знаю.

Про графику я просто молчу. Насколько я к данному аспекту не привередлива и люблю старые игры, но даже я вынуждена признать ее убогость для тех лет абсолютно во всех аспектах, за исключением, пожалуй, дизайна персонажей.

НО. Эта игра, не побоюсь этого слова, шедевр (в своей нише, кончено - поймите меня правильно). Или где-то около того. Собственно, именно поэтому я (и другие такие идиоты) столько возились с этой игрой. А причин для этого три.
Сюжет, персонажи и атмосфера.
Настолько оно все проработано, нешаблонно и при этом тонко подано, что тебе остается лишь сидеть с открытым ртом и восклицать в немом вопросе: ""Да ладно???!!!"". И это настолько же неожиданно, насколько и логично, ведь игра почти с самого начала дает нам половину(А то и больше) подсказок-ответов на происходящее вокруг. 
И немного поразмыслив ты уже понимаешь, что неожиданный твист - не такой уж неожиданный, а нас к нему очень даже плавно подводили.

А моменты с девушками? Ах, меня пробирало до мурашек как в моменты ""сами-знаете-чего"", так и когда выяснилась причина их поступков. Вызвавшая опять ту самую реакцию, о которой я писала выше.

При этом удивляет то, что именно сайд квесты могут дать многие ответы на вопросы о том, что тут происходит. Или подкинуть те же намеки. Без доп. квестов у вас цельной картины никак не сложится - это я гарантирую (с ними тоже немного будет голова болеть, но не так сильно).

Собственно, только за эти три вещи(особенно сюжет и главные герои) и можно оценивать и любить эту игру.

При этом следует сказать, что из той половины людей, что все-таки ее прошли и не бросили, сюжет придется по нраву все той же половине от половины. Остальные посчитают его бредом. Возможно, даже будут правы.

Также кто-то мне однажды сказал, что зачем нужна такая игра: с сюжетом и без адекватного геймплея - пусть пишут книгу. Но ни от книги, ни от комикса или фильма не было бы тех эмоций, что давала игра. Ведь ты сам решал, пройти или не пройти доп квесты - париться или нет с гаданием дня-недели-погоды-времени. А это очень важная часть... целого. Целой картины происходящего. Картины, которую пытаются разгадать трое: Йорк, Заг и ты.

Так что если для вас важен нешаблонный, интересный и продуманный сюжет, несмотря на ужас шамана геймдева - игра для вас. Но я хоть и купила ее, не уверена, что она в принципе адекватно пойдет на 10-ке, ибо даже на 7-ке я страдала всем вышеперечисленным.
Так что берегитесь.
UPD. В целом на 10-ке идет нормально, но через пару часов начинает виснуть и вылетать. Лечится перезагрузкой компа :' )

PS. Ах да, если все же решились играть - попробуйте однажды ночью прогуляться по улицам. Будет очень интересный намек, от которого сначала будет лишь один вопрос - что с этой игрой не так???)",1572710342,1586712475,True,5,2,0.553443968296051025,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cualquier videojugador que haya estado un tiempo en internet habra oido hablar de este titulo en mas de una ocasion, un juego cuyo apartado tecnico siendo un completo desastre ayudo a que se convirtiera en un titulo de culto y principalmente su gran historia y personajes.
Jugar Deadly Premonition sin duda es una experiencia que a muchos resultara extraña e incomodo muchas veces debido a lo ya mencionado pobre de su apartado tecnico que llega a tal punto de pensar que los enemigos y los ""bosses"" solo estan ahi como excusa de hacer algo entre cada mision. Llegado el momento de jugarlo donde realmente logra brillar es en su gran historia y personajes, los cuales no tiene miedo en tomarse un tiempo en presentarnos toda su ambientacion y desarrollo cargado de guiños y simbolismos que incluso llegan a romper la cuarta pared. Este mismo desarrollo tambien lo podes ver en casi todos sus personajes desde los principales hasta los secundarios llevados de manera excelente a la par con su historia, la cual increiblemente nos dara momentos de todo tipo incluso llegando a lo mas bizarro.

La historia nos pondra en la papel del agente del FBI Francis York Morgan el cual es enviado al pueblo de Greenville a investigar el asesinato de una joven la cual se aparentemente se encuentra relacionado con casos previos de su investigacion y que guarda relacion con el mito cultural del pueblo acerca del asesino del impermeable rojo.

Deadly Premonition es una obra como pocas que ahora que lo he jugado he podido comprobar el porque de su renombre, una experencia tan rara pero a la vez muy gratificante e interesante que sin duda si eres amante de los videojuegos deberias probarlo aunque sea una vez a pesar de lo molesto de su port en esta plataforma.

You're better off getting one of the console versions (which will be just as buggy, but won't crash) or watching the game off Youtube from someone suffering through the port jobs for the sake of having a ""Twin Peaks"" game.

Hopefully the eventual Premonition 2 PC port is better done/done by Swery himself. But I'm not going to hold my breath on that.

Auf der einen Seite mag ich solche etwas chaotischen und durchgedrehten Spiele wie u.a. ""Killer is Dead"" oder ""Shadows of the Damned"", aber hier nerven mich Kleinigkeiten weitaus mehr als bei all anderen Spielen. Fangen wir mal bei der Grafik an. Diese ist, bescheiden gesagt, einfach nur beschissen. Die Texturen sind auf miesem PS3-Niveau, die Charaktere wirken auch etwas steif und die Gesichtsanimationen sind auch nicht grade ausdrucksstark. Trotz erzwungener Kantenglättung flimmert grade der Wald enorm. Auch die Weitsicht ist kaum gegeben. Es ploppen grade während der Fahrt gerne mal Gegenstände, Autos oder auch Tiere in unmittelbarer Nähe auf. Grade während der Fahrt muss man aufpassen, dass man niemandem rammt. 

Kommen wir jetzt mal zu Steuerung. Diese ist auch nicht so gut. Grade das Autofahren ist da manchmal echt ne Qual. Dies ist auch der etwas hakeligen Kamera und den lahmen Karosserien geschuldet. Apropos Autofahren. Die Karte ist hier der grösste Krampf. Diese dreht sich auch im Menü mit, was dank nicht vorhandener Navigationspunkte noch frickeliger ist. Man muss sich also immer die Strecke genau einprägen, wenn man dringend (also unter Zeitdruck) mal wohin muss. Die Minimap ist da keinen Deut besser. Zwar lässt sich ein grösserer Abschnitt per Tastendruck während der Fahrt einblenden, aber dieser ist eben dank fehlender Navigationspunkte nicht viel hilfreicher. Hinzu kam auch mal ein Bug, der die Karte verschwinden lies und dies lies sich nur durch einen Neustart beseitigen. 

Nun nochmal zurück zur Technik. Da das Spiel schon nicht gut aussieht, sollte es zumindest problemlos (auf einem für das Spiel mehr als starken PC) gut laufen, oder? Leider nein! Grade während der Fahrt bricht die Framerate gerne mal ein. Kommt dann noch ein Gewitter hinzu, geht sie noch mehr in die Knie. Und das trotz geringer Auslastung der Hardware. Und ja, ich hab den DPFix verwendet, der das Spiel, nicht wie ursprünglich nur in 720p und 30Fps, sondern in Full HD und 60Fps laufen lässt. Aber allzu viel kann hier auch die Modding-Community nicht retten. Der Port ist einfach nur eine Frechheit. Hier würde ich auf jeden Fall auf nen Sale warten und das Spiel nicht für 25€ kaufen. Für das Geld gibt es echt bessere Spiele. 

Hinzu kamen bislang auch ein paar Abstürze, welche entweder bereits im Hauptmenü passierten oder erst vollkommen zufällig mitten im Spiel. Dies könnte aber natürlich auch den beiden Mods geschuldet sein, die ich installiert habe. 

Kommen wir noch zu guter Letzt zur Musik. Diese ist zwar nicht schlecht, aber sie passt in manchen Augenblicken so gar nicht. Mir ist es nämlich passiert, dass während dem Besuch des Tatorts plötzlich diese fröhliche Musik wieder einsetzte, was echt die schön düstere Stimmung zunichte machte. Und während der teilweise langen Fahrt von mehreren Minuten von A nach B düdelt auch immer die gleiche Mukke. Da hätte ich mir echt ein Radio gewünscht. 

So, und nun zum Schluss noch die Dinge, die mir an dem Spiel durchaus gefallen. Da wäre zum einen der schrullige Agent York Morgan, der sich auch gut mit Filmen auskennt, was mich als kleiner Cineast durchaus erfreut. Auch die anderen Charaktere sind durchaus interessant. Das Gleiche gilt auch für die Story. 

Fazit: Das hier ist echt ein Spiel, das man schon wirklich mögen muss, um Spass zu haben. Es ist somit nicht für jeden geeignet.",1570218102,1570218102,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

La historia de este juego es su punto fuerte que compensa otras carencias como los gráficos y el gameplay. La historia se desarrolla en un pequeño pueblo ficticio del Norte de Estados Unidos que tiene fama de ser tranquilo. Debido al asesinato de una mujer, el agente York, el protagonista y agente del FBI, es enviado al pueblo a investigar. Durante el transcurso de la historia, tendrás la compañía de Emily y George, dos policías de dicho pueblo que te ayudarán en la investigación del asesinato y también establecerás vínculos con ellos. 
Además de eso, conocerás a todos los habitantes del pueblo y de paso, visitarás bastantes lugares del mismo, todo ello con un ambiente de misterio bien conseguido. Sin lugar a dudas, cogerás simpatía con varios personaje del juego que son el punto fuerte de la historia. Además de eso, la investigación provoca bastante interés debido a la rareza del asesinato y los personajes poseen un aura de misterio con el que desearás saber más de cada uno de ellos. 
Los enemigos casi siempre suelen ser bestias paranormales de aspecto humano. El juego no explica nada de su existencia, no sé ni por qué aparecen. Da la sensación de que están hechos para forzar la acción. Literalmente, no hay ningún diálogo en el juego que hable sobre estas bestias. 
Inesperadamente, el juego tiene algunas situaciones ""cómicas"" muy bien conseguidas. 

El juego gráficamente es pobre pero tiene su encanto, consigue crear esa ambientación de pueblo ""pequeño"" y crear escenarios frios. El juego en principio iba a salir para PS2, pero en mitad del desarrollo decidieron sacarlo para consolas de la siguiente generación, por eso tiene gráficos mejores que PS2, pero que no llegan al nivel de PS3. Algunas animaciones faciales resultan bastante robóticas, pero una vez que te acostumbras lo ignoras. El juego tiene algunas piezas musicales bastante buenas así como algunas canciones, sin dudas, el soundtrack está muy bien conseguido y es digno de recordar.

Respecto al gameplay, los movimientos son algo robóticos y rígidos debido a la lentitud de los personajes. En escenas de acción en el que hay que disparar o esquivar objetos es fácil cometer algún error. La dificultad de este videojuego no es elevada, solo he muerto unas 10 veces antes de completar el juego, 7 de ellas debido a fallar en Quick Time Event. Hay pocos puzzles que no son difíciles de superar. Gran parte el juego la pasarás en coches de policías conduciendo por el gran mapa que tiene. La conducción se hace algo molesta, no sé el qué es precisamente pero es muy fácil chocarse a pesar del poco tráfico. El mapa es muy grande y poco denso. Las misiones se resumen en ve a X lugar a hablar con algún personaje o a investigar. Parecen simple, pero el misterio del juego y el interés que provoca la historia hace que completar estas misiones sean todo lo contrario a una molestia. El juego tiene un sistema de dia/noche, de sueño y comida. Aunque tampoco influye mucho debido a que en cualquier lugar hay una cama o algo para comer. Eso sí, hay misiones que son exclusivas de X hora, por lo que tendrás que estar atento al tiempo.
Una vez completado el juego, hay bastantes cosas que hacer como hacer, coleccionar cromos, otros coleccionables e investigar sobre algunos habitantes y lugares del pueblo.

If you have some time, let me tell you the story about what I had to endure in order to finish this broken mess of a PC port.

It all started 3 years ago when I was gifted the game. It was instantly intriguing to me, and rightly so! It is a really weird but all in all very fun game...when it works. Well for me the fun stopped quite quickly back then, when I encountered a game breaking bug in chapter 3. This of course led me to search for solutions online. What I found were mostly reports of more and more bugs that could occur later in the game. I didn’t want to take the risk of putting a lot of time into playing it only to get stuck somewhere in the middle or even the end. So I decided not to keep playing even if there was a fix for my bug.

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago when I somehow really felt like playing some more Deadly Premonition. I have absolutely no idea what drove me that day. So I did some research first and found this great community guide that really sparked some hope within me that, with the right precautions, the game could be finished without to much of a hassle.

So I installed it, installed what is known as DPfix and did some other minor stuff that was recommended to me. And it worked like a charm. Chapter 3? No problem there at all, buddy! The next 2 chapters? Some wonky bugs and a few crashes. Annoying but nothing serious.

Then came chapter 6. In chapter 6 you have to enter a specific building in order to progress the story. The game crashed EVERY SINGLE TIME I tried to open the f****** door. And of course none of the potential solutions I found online worked for me.
Well lucky me I thought, I own a PC and an old laptop. So I installed the game on my laptop copied over my savefile and voilà; it would barely run the game but it was good enough to enter the building, progress a little and save. I copied the savefile back to my PC and continued playing. For a while. Because this kind of bug started to become more and more frequent.

Do this: Crash!
Go there: Crash!

And every single time I had to copy the savefile over to my laptop, play with sub 20 FPS until it let me save again and copy the file back. Absolutely ridiculous! So I said f*** it, let’s just get this over with and keep playing on my laptop. It would probably be the end of it, as death of overheating was imminent but I had come quite far by now. I couldn’t accept defeat and I certainly wasn’t going to constantly copy my savefile back and forth another million times. So I play the game on my laptop and it’s not really fun with this framerate but at least it’s mostly stable.

Enter chapter 14. Another building, another f****** glitchy door that this time also manages to defeat my laptop. So I go back to my PC. There is a slim chance it might work over there, right? No. Wrong. It didn’t. And again neither did any of the solutions I found online. 

After crying a little I decided that this still would not be my defeat. So I looked for help on a forum and found a really nice person who was willing to load up my save, go through that stupid a** door for me, save again as soon as possible and send the file back to me. Awesome. 

So I’m inside the building and the first story related thing I have to interact with crashes the game. On both systems. Every time. So I asked my new friend if he would be willing to simply play that entire chapter for me. And he did. Very awesome!

Chapter 15. The horror continues. So I’m finally away from this f****** unstable mansion, play a little bit and then I hear the words: “Go back to the mansion” No. Please lord make it stop.

Same door, same crash. So at this point I have fully gone from exchanging a savefile between my 2 computers to exchanging a savefile with some poor dude I met on a forum. Basically he was now playing the game for me. As far as I know that’s not how it should be, right?

Well after the mansion there came 2 stable chapters at some other locations. But you see by that time I had searched a walkthrough for the word “mansion”. It came up 6 more times. 6!!! This is where I’m at now. I know the next level will be a mansion level. I’m scared. I don’t want to go there :’(

I will update this once the game, or me, is defeated. Pray for me.

Update: Of course it crashes. What did you think? Im done with this game for now. Maybe I can get my hands on a third computer somehow and maybe it will work there. Until then I can't be bothered anymore by this a**-backwards s***.

Anyway...I am absolutely certain that, would I have gone to work in the time I tried to fix this crappy portjob, I could have bought a PS3 and the game and I could play it without an issue. So that’s what you should do. Don’t buy this here. I’m dead f****** serious. If you buy this game on/for steam after reading this you are officially a masochist and you deserve it.

Update 2: I just beat the game. My buddy from the forum finished one last chapter for me and I was able to do the rest by myself. Lots of crashes of course but more random than before and not at specific points. 
I really liked the final chapters and the bad taste this port left in my mouth really is a shame. If you are curious about the game I'd say go for it and get it...just not the PC version.",1569072317,1569940449,False,13,0,0.60459667444229126,1,False,True,False,False,,,

С технической точки зрения это одна из худших игр на моей памяти. В ней ужасно буквально всё: управление, графика, анимация, улыбка Йорка (которая будет сниться вам в кошмарах), звук, перестрелки, управление машиной, QTE, мини-игры... Судя по всему, бюджет игры был равен приблизительно бутылке саке и двум роллам ""Самурай-маки"", а кодингом (и не только им, судя по всему) занимался слепой однорукий индус, страдающий эпилепсией. Нетерпеливые люди, привыкшие к YOBA-AAA-шутерам с непрерывным экшеном, выключат эту ""срань"" через 10 секунд, вынесут компьютер на пустырь, обольют керосином и сожгут к херам собачьим (во славу Сатане, разумеется). 

А вот те, кому интересен сюжет и атмосфера, эту игру должны оценить по достоинству. Насколько эта игра ужасна снаружи, настолько же прекрасна она изнутри. Ведь тут, ни много, ни мало, полноценная дань уважения Дэвиду Линчу в целом и его ""Твин Пиксу"" в частности. Если вы видели трейлер 2007-го года, то явно увидели совсем уж очевидные сходства с упомянутым выше сериалом. Релизная же версия несколько отличается от ранее показанного, но мало чем ему уступает. Смотрите сами: агент ФБР на месте, загадочное жестокое убийство на месте, куча местных жителей со своими причудами на месте, постоянные намеки и тайны на месте, нестандартный и запутанный сюжет тоже на месте. Сложно описать словами, на самом деле. Достаточно посмотреть Твин Пикс, а затем поиграть в Deadly Premonition - и ассоциации попрут ""автоматом"". 

Крайне противоречивая игра. От того и какую-то оценку ей дать тоже затруднительно. Как нарративное произведение - это просто 10/10, на кончиках пальцев, потрясающий экспириенс и прочее дерьмо. Серьезно, второй такой игры со схожим сюжетом не увидите. Тут есть место и драме, и юмору, и жестокости. Всё это очень органично и своевременно подается, отчего не надоедает ни на секунду.

That's why I still gotta recommend it to anyone with an open mind about performance and storytelling.

This game gained a strong reputation and cult following over the years just due how presents its story. Unfortunately everything else is debatable.

The elephant in the room is the fact the PC port is terrible in more than one aspect, requiring a fanmade patch to fix most or few of the issues, so if anything you could try to play it on 360 or Switch instead. Once that's solved comes the rest of problems for some players such as wonky action segments (Which to be fair they were forced to be in it) and aged graphics that were already not that mesmerizing on its debut. On the other hand, such flaws were also the reason why the game gradually became more popular as time passed.

This game is in a very odd spot when comes to being a full recommendation. It's plot is undoubtly one of the most unique you can find in any media, ranging from odd characters and awkward situations to the UI and graphics further flavoring the experience. On the other hand, the nefarious PC port that is barely functional even with fan patches, and some obvious negatives that made it gain bad reviews on its launch, makes it a very complicated game to offer at the average player.

Абсолютно неудобное управление. Юзабилити меню и прочих интерфейсов - ещё хуже. Хотя казалось бы, не может быть что-то более неудобное, чем абсолютно неудобное.
Управление постоянно отбирается на бессмысленные короткие катсцены.
Ну и конечно же в ""лучших"" традициях консольщины предполагается, что у тебя нет нормальных способов управления, поэтому игра пытается тебе ""помогать"" и делать некоторые вещи за тебя. Например, выравнивать камеру так, что ты всегда смотришь прямо, и никогда не смотришь вверх или вниз. Если не дай бог ты попытался оглядеться и сдвинул камеру вверх или вниз - нужно срочно вернуть камеру в горизонтальное положение потому что ты ж не способен осознанно менять направление камеры по вертикали - это слишком сложно!

Невозможность задать разрешение экрана.
И я не знаю, как они умудрились, но при том, что счётчик фпс показывает 60, по ощущениям - там их 30.
Отсутствие возможности сохраняться.
QTE - я точно не уверен поскольку вот этот весь трэш я смог терпеть минут 15, и встретил QTE только один раз, но раз он там есть один раз, значит, скорее всего будет ещё.

Про сюжет сложно что-то сказать потому что долго играть в этот трэш я не смог.

Il m'en a fallu du temps pour me mettre à Deadly Premonition! J'ai toujours été repoussé par la réputation sulfureuse du titre, tant au niveau du gameplay que la technique.

Quand je l'ai enfin commencé, je m'en suis voulu de ne pas avoir découvert ce bijou bien plus tôt.

Oui, Deadly Premonition est devenu instantanément l'un de mes jeux cultes.

Dire pourquoi au détour de quelques lignes est pratiquement impossible, tant le titre de Swery se vit plutôt qu'il ne se raconte.

Alors si je devais mettre en avant des qualités, je parlerais de sa bande-son, exceptionnelle. Certaines pistes restent en tête et entêtent, comme ""The Woods and The Goddess"" ou ""Life is Beautiful"".

D'une manière générale, toute la partie sonore est une brillante réussite, de la B.O. aux dialogues.

Je parlerai également du scénario, à mi-chemin entre Twin Peaks et Silent Hill, découpé en chapitres façon série télé et ici aussi, d'une maîtrise rarement vue dans un jeu vidéo. Tous les personnages sont haut en couleurs, et avec un background qui accompagne l'immersion.

Je ne compte même plus les scènes cultes, dont la très énervante pêche à l'attaché-case, la trop longue scierie, les Crawling Shadows (très Silent Hill-esque pour le coup), les bossfight (oui, tous), la révélation du tueur et bien sûr les courses poursuite (pour le coup pas frustrantes) avec le tueur à l'imper.

Vrai-faux open world avec une conduite atroce et quelques allers-retours laborieux, Deadly Premonition testait tout un tas de mécaniques assez inhabituelles pour l'époque (s'alimenter, la gestion du temps bien que déjà vue dans Shenmue).

La partie ""action"" du jeu (que Swery ne voulait pas, il voulait au contraire un jeu 100% narratif) emprunte ici aussi énormément à Silent Hill, jusque dans la gestion de l'inventaire voire même des bruitages. Armes de mêlée cassables, armes à feu à munitions limitées, créatures flippantes et c'est à peu près tout. Encore une fois, l'intérêt du jeu se trouve dans toute la partie exploration et enquête, facilement 70% du jeu.

Alors oui, il n'est vraiment pas très beau  (mais la direction artistique est à tomber), la maniabilité donne envie de se mettre les doigts dans la prise et la scène QTE précédant le boss final est atroce, mais en s'arrêtant à ça, vous passeriez, comme moi, à côté d'une vraie pépite méconnue. Il faut également ne pas être insensible au WTF.

Je n'ai pas joué à Deadly Premonition, j'ai littéralement fait partie de Greenvale et du quotidien de ses habitants durant une vingtaine d'heures, heures qui me marqueront à jamais. C'est un jeu que j'aime d'amour.

Attention toutefois à la version Steam, jamais patchée, qui ne reconnaît pas, officiellement, les pads. Et autant dire que c'est pratiquement injouable au clavier-souris. Attention également à quelques bugs plus ou moins dérangeants vers la fin du jeu (mais rien qui ne résiste au backup de sauvegarde).

TLDR
-The meme story makes this game a classic worth all the shit you go through to experience it
-You will have to screw around to get your game and controller working properly
-Run an external save backup script and save religiously
-Run the game in compatibility mode a handful of times for unavoidable crashes
-Don't buy this at full price, garbage ports shouldn't be supported

I spent about 4 hours fucking with this game trying to get it to run properly until I realised that everything I read about running compatibility mode was bs and the only way you will get more that 15 fps is to run standard win 10.

I had to set controllers as the priority usb device by pressing the windows key and searching controllers. 
Dpfix stopped my controller working so ended up not using it which wasn't so bad since my 2nd 'monitor' (old tv) is 720 the default resolution of the game.

Aside from this initial screw around I had a stable 60fps the whole time

Crashes were: 
Twice In the generals junk yard after starting a quest
After a cutscene when entering the art gallery through the back <- this one is really bad because you have to sit through a 10 minute 'chase' at 15km per hour
Cutscene after going to harry's mansion the first time
Randomly at the end of a chapter when the game tries to auto save
After I got 100% and finished watching the last cutscene it save failed and crashed lol

Crash solution is to run the game in compatibility for xp or vista, it will run like shit but get you past the crash, every crash I had there was a save nearby so you can take it out of compatibility 

I highly recommend running a backup script, my save did corrupt but because I had backups I only lost 2 minutes of game time. I'll link you the one I used if you want, or just search backup on the 'discussions' tab",1562367776,1562367776,True,13,1,0.673643648624420166,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Хидетака Суэхиро он же Swery65. Человек, который был известен в узких кругах благадоря играм Extermination и Spy Fiction, выходившие эксклюзивно на PS2. И вот начиная с 2004-го он со своей командой из Access Games решил сделать игру, которая представляла из себя ""дань уважения"" культовому сериалу ""Твин Пикс"". И вот всё завертелось, но у создателей возникли большие проблемы одной из которых были авторские права из-за чего после первого трейлера показаного на Tokyo Game Show 2007 было принято решение о переделке игры. Однако у разработчиков позднее возникли проблемы с технологией Phyx от Nvidia, но в итоге перемеинованая из Rainy Woods в Deadly Premonition или в Японии известная как Red Seeds Profile увидела свет в конце февраля 2010 на Xbox 360 и PS3. И получила довольно смешанные отзывы от игровой прессы. Одни ставили 2 другие 9, одни говорили что игра тихий ужас в который невозможно играть, а другие хвалили её за отличный сюжет. А игроки приняли её с любовью. Так в чём же секрет данной игры? Сейчас разберёмся. Так что погнали.

[h1]Маленький городок в котором у каждого есть свои секреты[/h1]
История рассказывает о том, как специальный агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган или просто Йорк прибывает в городок Гринвейл дабы расследовать убийство местной красотки Анны Грэм. В процессе знакомства с шерифом и его напарником он с помощью своего метода называемого [u]""профилированием""[/u] пытается востановить картину проишествия. В итоге он узнает о неком ""убийце в дождевике"", а после вкрытия обнаруживает в теле Анны некие [u]""Красные семена""[/u] с которыми бравому агенту довелось столкнутся не раз. Про сюжет дальше говорить не имеет смысла, так как могу рассказать много лишнего. Но в целом - он вышел отличным. С причудливой и загадочной атмосферой тихого городка, колоритными, но чертовски странными персонажами и ноткой японского абсурда. Но в тоже время у игры есть ворох проблем, но я начну с того что мне понравилось.

Во-первых разработчики хорошо поработали над системой смены дня и ночи, основной фишкой которой является 24-х жизненный цикл NPC. Во-вторых отлично проработаны побочные задания, которые из простых поручений превращаются в цело расследование или нечто забавное. Так же мне понравилось, то что нам дают следить за состоянием главного героя и в определёный момент подовлять его голод, если индикатор падёт к низу. Однако есть то, что мне усложнило прохождения, а именно: техническая реализация, которая порой давала о себе знать, вылеты, которые происходили рандомно, графические баги и проблема с освещение в целом. Так же затянутость в плане геймплея (эпизоды с отстрелом врагов в паранормальном мире тому подтверждение). Но не смотря на это мне не было скучно проходить, но у меня осталось чувство что игру делали в спешке и многие моменты не смогли довести до ума.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
Не смотря на все проблемы которые присутствуют в игре она мне очень понравилась. Отличная история, с яркими персонажами не оставит равнодушной даже самого скептичного игрока и если бы над игрой чуть дольше поработали, то возможно она не получилась такой ""кривой"". Ну и я бы ""любезно спросил"" тех, кто делал Director's Cut - как они так накосячили с технической стороной. Ну и печалит, что игра не стала успешной. Но не смотря на это Swery продолжил творить и подтверждением этому является D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die. А DP я считаю его признанием любви к творчеству Дэвида Линча и сериалу ""Твин Пикс"". Так что рекомендую. (P.S. Может мне вернуться к просмотру ""Твин Пикса"", как считаешь [b][u]Зак?[/u][/b])

Но... увы, то, что это старый кривой порт очень мешает насладиться ей в полной мере.
Собственно, все недостатки этой игры как раз проистекают из того, что она крайне кривая и забагованная.
Впрочем, если таки продраться сквозь дебри запуска, то получаешь великолепную игру в духе Alan Wake, хотя сначала мне показалось, что похоже на Silent Hill.
Правда, сюжетная часть довольно короткая - точно не скажу, но мне кажется, где-то часов на 5-7. Однако, тут очень много дополнительных миссий. Разумеется, проходить их не обязательно, но во-первых, как мне кажется, без них игра потеряет львиную долю своего шарма (как говорит один местный NPC - ""Спешка нужна только при ловле блох""), а во-вторых, за эти миссии дают крайне полезные вещи, которые сильно облегчают и прохождение основного сюжета (как говорит тот же NPC - ""Однажды это спасет тебе жизнь"").
Геймплей весьма разнообразен - тут и стрельба, и поездки на автомобиле, и беседы, и вообще, все как в жизни - нужно есть (а еду еще и покупать), спать, менять одежду и т.п.
Сюжет не сказать, чтобы сильно оригинальный, но закручен довольно-таки неплохо - мои первоначальные предположения подтвердились лишь частично, и интерес в процессе игры не угасает, наоборот, иногда даже не терпится бросить все посторонние дела и ехать уже к нужному месту.
Все пройденные главы можно переиграть, но в процессе перепрохождения нельзя сохраниться до самого конца главы, поэтому если проходить дополнительные миссии, то лучше делать это в процессе основного прохождения, пока дают сохраняться.
В общем, если ради прекрасной игры вы готовы дополнительно пару-тройку раз пройти еще крайне увлекательный БДСМ-квест ""Заставь Deadly Premonition работать"", то однозначно надо брать (особенно, если на игру будет скидка).",1558103324,1558103324,True,7,0,0.591614723205566406,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With that said though, this port is ABYSMAL. It almost shouldn't be allowed to be for sale. At best it legally gives us the game with steamworks features, but it barely even runs properly without a community made fix and various compatibility modes not to mention some other possible unforseen random issues you may have to troubleshoot depending on if it likes your system or not. Oh and It also has random bugs that corrupt your save file, hurray. Shoutout for only being able to have 1 save file. Backup your save frequently!

The best place to optimally play Deadly Premonition is on Xbox 360, If you're feeling particularly ballsy and don't care though or just love the game enough (like me), you can try your luck at the PC port and hope for the best. I managed to 100% it on PC through the myriad of issues, If you're determined to play this on Steam then I have a few tips from my own experiences:

- Use this guide. It saved my bacon many times. DPfix and the 4 GB patch were sufficient enough for me to get the game playable
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=594875543

- Absolutely use Windows compatibility mode on DP.exe I found that Windows 98 compatibility mode worked best for me, but results may vary. Other compatibility modes gave me a bug where I couldn't aim around, if you get this on every compatibility mode, I don't think you'll have a very enjoyable experience since the only work around is to spam the auto lock-on key in combat, thankfully that wasn't the case for me...

- At the Art Gallery when you first meet a character named Diane (after entering a keypad), skip every cutscene until you're back outside with Emily. The chapter transition here WILL 100% corrupt your save if you don't skip it. I learned the hard way. (The guide I linked above supplies a save file in case). Just look up a YouTube video to see the cutscene you missed.

- If you're ever crashing constantly during any cutscenes, the solution is generally to skip them unfortunately then look them up.

- Save ONLY at phones, never after chapters when it prompts you to. There's a random chance of it crashing if you do so and likely corrupting the save in the process.

Saves get corrupted often which has led me to  importing saves with different progress for each chapter, and using S.A.M to unlock achievements because the triggers break as well. Even better is if you use a save with further progress the you, and use the replay chapter function you CANT save at all, and need to finish it all in one sitting, which also  means you need to hope the game doesn't crash, which is highly unlikely. Other than constant crashing the game has massive performance issues, textures will stop working in the middle of cutscenes leaving you nothing to stare at other than the color black. The game does not even include a proper settings menu, so you're forced to use a community patch just for that, and even then it barely fixes any of the game's issues. 
This version is  worth it literally [i]only[/i] if it's free, and even then it's still up to debate. Play/emulate it on PS3/360 or watch it online.

All the gameplay systems are clunky,and music plays in points where it doesn't really make sense however, that adds a certain quirky charm to the game alongside the characters & writing. Excluding this port Deadly Premonition is pure kino, and I wholly recommend it.

Should you play, let alone buy it on Steam? Depends largely on what you're expecting. It has become somewhat of a cult classic, as far as I understand, and, like many of those, it is not everyone's cup of tea.

Let me get this out of the way: if you choose to play this, downloading the user made patches is mandatory. Even then, expect to wrestle with a few gamebreaking bugs along the way. I had to download a save file from the internet because mine became corrupted and no way in hell I was going to play it all the way again. Consider youself warned.

The game is largely a homage to Twin Peaks that plays more as interactive fiction than a true detective game. You assume the role of Francis York Morgan, a FBI agent sent to small town to investigate the brutal murder of a young girl by the so called Rain Coat Killer. The gameplay is basically divided into two sections: driving around the town of Greenvale and interacting with the locals, completing sidequests or following the main storyline, and action segments which play out as a poor man's Resident Evil 4. 

The first aspect of gameplay is the bread and butter of the game and can be compared to a GTA type of affair with less vehicular homicide. Main quests consist of being at X place at Y time to watch a cutscene that moves the plot forward. Between these, you're free to roam around Greenvale to find sidequests (identified by the notebook marker next to the NPC's name in the map screen), which are mostly fetch quests rewarded with itens, such as weapons or a fast-travel walkie-talkie (do yourself a favor and get this one as soon as possible), improvements for your car or simply a closer look at the local lore of Greenvale. The map layout is quite realistic for a small town, which is a plus, but after a while you'll get tired of driving the long distances that separates your points of interest. The game is divided in chapters, each representing a day of the investigation, and each chapter is subdivided into episodes, true to the TV show that inspired it. Certain sidequests can only be completed on a certain period of time, so you can easily miss a lot of them the first time around. That gives the game a bit of replay value, I guess.

The action segments, which are part of the main story, take place in some sort of dark, twisted shadow version of Greenvale where York has to defend himself against ghost/zombies, reminiscent of japanese horror tropes (think of movies like Ju-On and Ringu), and find ""clues"" to make sense of York's profiling efforts. In terms of pure gameplay, you simply navigate through a linear map, shooting enemies, collecting itens and watching cutscenes, much like Resident Evil 4, as mentioned above. The game makes no effort to explain why it abruptly goes Silent Hill on you and why is there a shadow version of Greenvale  that only York seems to be able to interact or take notice of. That's not a bad thing per se, because it leaves the interpretation of what the hell is going on to the player. There's actually some debate among the fans on whether there is anything truly supernatural going on or not. Personally, I believe that York is feeling the killer's psychosphere, physically represented in this shadow version of Greenvale.  If you think that these action parts seem out of place, that's because they were kind of shoehorned in because the japanese developers assumed the western audience would be more interested in the game if they could shoot stuff.

The story, as interesting as it is, has that distinct japanese flavor to it. The mood oscilates between goofy humour and macabre horror, and by the end, you'll be wondering if you're playing a Resident Evil title. Since it's so linear, there is very little thinking required to complete the game, so if you're looking that a game that really forces you to think like a detective in order to move the investigation forward, look elsewhere. The newer Sherlock Holmes games have neat little investigation system that have you connect the dots by yourself, meaning you can fuck up the case if you're not paying attention. Deadly Premonition is the complete opposite of that; that's why I said it plays more like an interactive fiction story than anything else.

If you really want to try it by yourself, buy it at a sale. Watching the game on youtube will probably be just as satisfying, really, due to it's unapologetically linear nature. Still, I recommend it because the narrative, which is the core of the game, left a good taste afterwards. Thumbs up.",1557084743,1557084994,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,1,True,False,False,False,,,

As FBI Detective Francis York Morgan, you are sent to Greenvale to investigate the murder of Anna Graham, a young and beloved teenager who met her end at the hands of someone known only as The Raincoat Killer. To say it borrows from Twin Peaks is an understatement- it has the same quirky tone, a large and likable/ interesting cast of characters that really grow on you, and more than several elements that border on plagerism, such as the fact that York (everyone calls him that, so you should call him that, too) speaks to someone the audience doesn't see named Zach and a mysterious room that seems to exist outside reality that york returns to regularly. You explore the town, interacting with the townsfolk, and can take the time to tread off the beaten path. There's an in game clock, and missions are only available during certain times, but the time frames are almost always generous enough to allow for exploration.

And here's the thing about this game. Or, rather,many things. The graphics are, speaking generously, dated as all hell. Animations, particularly facial ones, are laughable at best and leads to more than a few scenes of unintentional hilarity. The music, while actually really good in and of itself, is often used at horribly inappropriate times, particularly a very well known theme involving someone whistling. The ""open world,"" such as it is, while containing a few places of interest throughout and packed with short side quests, still feels lifeless and barren. Almost no cars on the road, no one to just bump in to. The hunger and tiredness meters feel superfluous at best- they affect the game so little since finding food and sleep is easy as hell that I wonder why they were even put in the game at all. The driving is incredibly wonky. More often than not, you'll flip your car hilariously over on its roof by bumping into absolutely nothing. Or you might just flip it turning a bend. In one instance, I glitched through the ground a millimeter and this resulted in all of my car's health instantly falling to 0. The combat is RE4 if RE4 fell down some stairs. Extremely basic and imprecise over the shoulder angle that is only challenging because aiming feels so floaty and tough to nail down. The overall sound design outside of the music and voice acting (which is for the most part rock solid, particularly York) is incredibly weak, with guns sounding like someone shooting a spitball and enemies making moans like they just woke up from a nap. And, to top all of this off, the most challenging part of the game is getting around its myriad game crashing bugs. The game itself is extremely easy, but throughout my play time, I experience several hard crashes that resulted in me having to run the game in Windows 98 compatibility and more often than not still required me to restart my laptop. Mind you, this is something almost everyone with this edition has experienced. 

And yet.

Despite all of those problems.

I still recommend this game. Not just recommend. But heartily recommend it. Glowingly. Enthusiastically. Elatedly. 

See, this game defines more than the sum of its parts. Despite how weak most of the individual elements are, this is still a thoroughly engaging mystery that is, yes, fun to play. And this is thanks in large part to the script. This game would be barely playable if the writing in it wasn't so damn strong. The mystery starts off exactly like Twin Peaks, and yes, while this game does owe a great deal to that show, and there are elements that border on plagirism, it eventually reveals itself to be a separate beast entirely from the beloved cult TV show. It has a knack for building its central mystery expertly, and unlike Twin Peaks, every facet of it pays off wonderfully. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Twin Peaks and its ambiguity (even the batshit insane Season 3). And that's where the brilliance of this game's story lies- it uses the very familiar setup to tell its own, stand alone, cohesive story where everything ties together in an emotionally resonant and immensely satisfying way. It cannot be understated what a huge impact the script has on this game. The fact that every character is quirky and interesting makes you want to explore the world just to see what kind of strange situation you'll be thrown into next. It almost reaches a Majora's Mask level of marrying its gameplay and story together, and that is something I almost never say. Exploring its world enhances the main story in that you come to know and care for the residents, which only bring the stakes higher and higher. It all leads to one of the most emotional finales I've ever seen in a game, and it's sure to be one that resonates with anyone that sees it through to the end.

And the thing is that, even though elements like the combat aren't amazing, the game is paced in a way that really helps break things up. Just as you might be getting tired of wandering around town, you can go into the game's otherworldly combat sections and spend an hour or so shooting dumb ghosts. And just as those get tiring, you're back to exploring the world, where you can do a few side missions, buy new suits, chat it up with the locals, or partake in one of a few mini games. The ambition on display here is rather astounding, and even though it doesn't always reach what it sets out to do, it's still admirable and interesting.

This game is, in every sense of the word, a deeply flawed masterpiece. It's not always necessarily enjoyable, the production values are all over the place, and crashes are never not annoying. But the story is so strong and interwoven into the very fabric of its mediocre gameplay that it transcends its individual elements and becomes something wholly unique and unlike anything else in gaming. It would be interesting to see what could have been done with a bigger budget, but as it is, many of its flaws only add to the offbeat charm of its cast and atmosphere (including those godawful facial animations). Yes, there are many annoying parts that drag, and it sometimes feels undercooked.

But at the end of the day, if you told me you were forced to choose between something like this and, let's say, Just Cause 3 (a very fun and enjoyable open world game) I would pick this game. In fact, I would pick this as an open world game above most others. There's nothing else like it and it's absolutely worth experiencing, warts and all.",1553218419,1553218419,True,2,0,0.547014415264129639,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Deadly Premonition is a genuinely bizarre game. From a technical standpoint it is a mess. Constant crashing, controls not working, audio bugs, you name it - it will probably break at some point. That being said, [b]this is truly one of the best games I have ever played.[/b]

The graphics are nothing to look at, and the controls are less than optimal, but the story is gripping - and the characters are some of the strangest & most interesting you can find in a game. The game just [b]oozes[/b] weirdness. Inappropriately timed jazz, awkward dialogue reactions, a plethora of cheesy lines (especially near the end), as well as weird in-game mechanics and visual bugs. (You will come to love the unexpected weirdness). Initially you WILL have problems getting it to run properly. However, once you do get it up and running, you won't want to stop playing. It's just such an incredibly interesting game that nothing you do in the game feels like a chore. Everything you do in the game is so unique and otherwordly that you will never say ""oh boy this again?"" Even if you don't play it - watch a playthrough of it just to [b][i]experience[/i][/b] it. No, really, it's [b]THAT[/b] good. [b]It also goes on sale relatively often for less than 4$.[/b]

Deadly Premonition is a third-person action game with horror elements.  Personae dramatis of this story is an FBI agent by the name of Francis York Morgan, a gentleman in his 30s, who quickly turns out to be a rather eccentric individual in the most charitable of terms. The player takes control of the character as he travels to the remote city of Greenvale to investigate a possible lead in a case involving a mysterious series of murders. Deadly Premonition is a unique criminal story-driven game. The pacing of the intrigue is slow, it gradually grows on the player over time along with an introduction of the diverse cast of characters that are Greenvale’s denizens. Be it Miss Polly, an old lady who runs a hotel that could fit an army, all on her own, or Mr. Stewart, a crippled mysterious millionaire who goes around the town always wearing a gas mask, having a servant by his side to speak for him. York is by no means the odd one out, bizarre at first, interactions of the player with the others in the city succeed in creating awkward chemistry that encourages the player to get to know them all better. Everything about Greenvale is somehow odd yet in spite of its, often self-conscious, absurdity it puzzlingly manages to fit the pieces into a coherent whole.  Deadly Premonition requires certain patience to fully appreciate. To me the payoff was a sensation of playing through a crime novel. Not an interactive movie experience of a Telltale Studios game, but a proper book somehow molded to fit into the video game medium.

[i] An unexpected error occurred: the review will resume shortly after a technical break, please standby [/i]

No matter how fond of the game you might become, it cannot be omitted that it is an absolute mess from a technical standpoint. Deadly Premonition is a slightly extended version of the game that was initially released on Xbox 360 and only later ported to the PC. Sadly it was [i] that [/i] kind of port which I can only speculate must’ve involved the use of blunt objects first and programming second. Frequent crashes, randomly extending loading times and graphics glitches only open the list. There are numerous threads regarding issues with the PC version of the game often divided into Deadly Premonition not running at all or crashing at a certain point never to load past a cutscene. In my case, it was the latter, after running smoothly all the way up a whopping quarter of the game it simply died on me. Given that DP runs only on a single save via checkpoints there are no means to work around it within the game itself. Luckily the community came to the rescue with fan-made fixes available on the internet. “Patching” did allow me to complete the game, though even then the crash counter went well past 30. While problems with running the game are not a given, it is more likely to misbehave than not. Honest warning. Don’t buy the game unless you are willing to run the risk of putting up with aforementioned hiccups.

[b] Low settings, cutscenes, and driving lessons [/b]
In the end, I resolved to judge the game by its own merits rather than its instability. Thus here we are, at the launcher of the game which offers “settings”, a grandiose term considering it essentially consists of keybindings. Furthermore Deadly Premonition’s initial release took place in 2010 and it wasn’t an eye candy the day it came out. Graphics seem blurry and light is almost blinding on sunny days. What is more every change of the location requires a quite lengthy loading screen.  Mediocre graphics are relevant, as they constitute one of 3 core elements of the game - cutscenes, the others being driving and combat. Deadly Premonition makes heavy use of cutscenes in both action heavy and more leisurely paced sections of the game. Despite action elements being heavily interrupted by cinematics, it doesn’t disrupt the general flow of the game too much. Regardless the game’s overall looks, lengthy clips are enjoyable to watch, as they often present the full scope of oddity that is character interaction. As for open world gameplay,  you might as well end up completing a side quest just to see one.

Ah yes, Deadly Premonition features a fairly vast open world for such a game and mundane driving from place to place will be a vast part of the playtime. There is no quick travel feature and many key locations tend to be in rather secluded places. Several main story sections consist simply of driving around talking to characters accompanying you on the way. Driving around everywhere is a relevant element of establishing the pace of the game and is made fairly entertaining by agent York’s remarkable knowledge of B-class cinematography he eagerly shares with the player. Too bad that driving model is quite terrible, though you better get used to it, especially if you get hooked into the game enough to start doing side quests. There is quite a lot of them and you gradually unlock more as you progress through the game. Some provide little but further insight into the city of Greenvale, while others can get you a better car or a weapon. Don’t take too much time before you start exploring though, with a serial killer on the loose some quest givers might not make it to the epilogue.

[b] Resident Evil wants its camera back [/b]
Combat is probably the most prominent part of the game, though like everything else it has a few quirks of its own. Majority of the time we view York from a third-person camera placed over the agent’s right shoulder. From the very beginning, the player is being assaulted by eerie zombie-like creatures that shamble erratically towards the protagonist. You can either shoot them or run, though you can’t move while aiming. Luckily, York’s trusty pistol is enough to dispatch them and there are better weapons available further down the line. 

Paranormal themes are heavily present throughout the game and Francis York Morgan shifts to a haunted dimension at numerous times throughout the game, having to battle his way through to the evidence at each respective crime site. It’s easy to forget it at times but Deadly Premonition is considered a survival horror for a reason. Enemies are twitching backwards with their backs broken, trying to shove their arms down player’s throat, this combined with distorted music and interiors reminiscent of Silent Hill series, create a genuinely dreadful atmosphere. Unfortunately, combat sections also feature the quick time events rather frequently. While not all of them lead to an instant death, you are likely to load quite a few times within starting chapters of the game alone. Even if the player does survive a QTE, they definitely butcher any sense of unease the game might’ve set beforehand.

[b] ""Don’t ask me about Zach, it’s personal"" [/b]
Deadly Premonition’s approach to the 4th wall is a thing deserving its own separate mention. It’s hardly a wall but more of a door kept wide open. Agent York himself considers the player his partner, naming you “Zach” and frequently addressing player throughout the game. Examples of which is telling stories addressed directly to Zach or complementing the player on landing a headshot.

In the end, Deadly Premonition truly is an experience filled with mixed feelings. In its insanity, it delivers charmingly absurd characters and tells a thrilling criminal story. At the same time, the plot just might be its only strength with essentially every other part of the game being mediocre or plain bad. Its conflicting nature seems to have developed into something of a defining trait as Deadly Premonition holds Guinness World Record for oddly specific “most critically polarizing survival horror game”. For me, the good outweighed the bad, even with the extra weight of technical difficulties. Frankly, there isn’t quite any other game like this, beside other works of SWERY, and thus I can only recommend experiencing the game first-hand.

Но и тут потусторонний мир зовёт агента Купера... то есть Йорка в свои лабиринты.

А агент Йорк ищет в своём утреннем кофе предсказания, улики и намёки и частенько их находит, постоянно консультируясь со своим напарником - Заком (извини, Диана), расследуя убийство юной красавицы.

Местный шериф и его очаровательная заместитель так же под подозрением, как и любой житель городка - семейная пара из забегаловки, где работала погибшая; или прикованный к инвалидному креслу местный богач, скупивший практически весь город; или глава художественной галереи, очень вовремя уехавшая из города сразу же после убийства.

How do you NOT play that game? Well, after starting and aborting it four times over the last six years before ultimately completing it...my personal verdict is that it's well deserving of that record.

Don't get me wrong, I love this game. And I usually fucking hate pros and cons lists, but this game is a rare exception. 

PROS: 

The protagonist is one of the best in all of video game-dom. My personal favorite, actually. He's a chain-smoking FBI agent who has developed an alter ego with whom he openly converses. When the ""two"" of them are alone, they mostly talk about movie trivia. He congratulates and compliments himself when he hits his targets. Just a fun goddamn character on all levels. 

The side characters are no less interesting. They all have distinct personalities and quirks.

The town of Greenvale is one of the more realistic maps out there. It's sparsely populated by NPC's who keep actual schedules; they could be at home, work, or elsewhere depending on the time of day. There is no fast-travel, and you can't set waypoint markers, so unless you want to pause to check the map every fifteen seconds, it's just in your best interest to memorize the roads. 

The story is fun. 

CONS: 

I've really just got one gripe, but it was the deal-breaker all three times I quit playing: the combat sequences just suck. I have nothing good to say about them. They're repetitive, dull, simplistic, tiresome, and the mechanics suck. They're completely out of tune with the feel of the rest of the game, which is otherwise very lighthearted. Initially, they're somewhat stressful, as your standard-issue pistol is incredibly weak and ineffective. But once you upgrade to literally any other weapon, the sequences become over-the-top easy and just an overall waste of time. Most enemies just come at you at an unmenacingly slow pace. Certain enemies and bosses have patterns that you have to follow in order to kill them. But those patterns are comically simple, and ultimately just time consuming. Busy work.

Every time there's an interesting development in the plot, it's accompanied by a pointless action sequence. Each time I sigh heavily and remind myself that it doesn't matter. Just power through it. Once I got in the mode of just thinking of the combat sequences as commercial breaks, it made them more bearable. 

***

The game also has a few elements that are either really annoying if you're not feeling them, or lovably quirky if you are. Best example is the music. There are only like four music cues in the whole game. I personally found them effective, and kind of thought of the limited playlist as being a nod to Twin Peaks (from which this game draws heavy influences), which also only has a handful of music cues.

Similarly, there are only like five or six stock animations that any given character model draws from. So their mannerisms and expressivity are pretty limited. Similar to the music, though, I personally found this endearing.",1544396005,1605035487,True,5,0,0.536631166934967041,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And you know what? It all just works! At face value you would look at this game and think that it's just a survival horror that doesnt take itself seriously and part of that thinking is right. But there is something more to this game, something charming that made me love it.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
Graphics-wise it is outdated, textures look like it came from the PS2 era with the mouth movement-dialogue not synching, low res textures, and pretty funny animations and special effects similar to a 1950's movie special effects. Yes it is that bad, compared to anything else released during the 2010s.

[h1] GAMEPLAY[/h1] 
Gameplay is pretty much the same as any other survival horror with an overworld-realworld to traverse in to: The MC adventures in the real world and the MC deals with enemies in the overworld when York is in profiling mode. In Deadly Premonition you can play with the open-world feature when youre in the real world; You can do side quests, explore the country-side, drive a couple of cop car models, or pretty much partake in whichever activity you like concerning some of the townsfolk like drink in a bar / buy guns / play darts and much more. I'm warning you though before buying this game that the driving in this game is a chore and is one (if not only) of the more tedious aspects of the game. Cars doesnt have the feeling of weight to them, and cop cars (which are the only cars you can drive) are limited to a speed of 60 mph. And what is an open world game without a shadowing mission where you follow a target not too close or not too far or else you get gameover? 

Combat is pretty basic, it reminds me of RE4 combat without movement when aiming with a firearm. You can press Ctrl to lock on the nearest enemy and it helps out when you're surrounded by a horde of enemies. Melee weapons degrade after a bunch of uses from it. That's about it for DP's combat: nothing new added to the survival horror genre and nothing taken away either. You know what they say; if it's not broken, don't fix it! 

[h1] SOUND DESIGN [/h1] 
This is one of the charms of the game. A lot of the dialogue pokes fun on B movies but a lot of the sound effects all came from generic B movies (from the characters' shook sound to explosion sounds) that is what makes the game hilariously good. Let me tell you though that the music made for this game is one of the absolute best. The whistle theme is one of the comfiest soundtracks ive ever heard in a survival horror. It is so out of place that it actually blends so good with a segment of the game when it comes up.

Story and plot is what made this game. From the quirky characters and funny dialogues, the game has some deep dark undertones accompanying it. There wasn't a lot but a couple of segments really cemented this game as an actual horror game and those few segments alone is so good that it puts the silent hill and resident evil franchise to shame.

[h1] FINAL VERDICT [/h1] 
Past the random crashes, clunky controls, bad graphics, there is a hidden gem shining brightly in Deadly Premonition. I don't want to spoil anything and i suggest you experience one of the best games in history for yourself.

If you modify them you get input lag in many cases. The camera is wobbly and at an exceedingly awkward angle. It crashes willy-nilly.

[b]Cons:[/b]

1) You can suddenly fall through the textures(I met this bug only once at the beginning of the game)
2) The map resolution is very limited. You're not able to see the whole way and put your markers or remove the old (Spiritual map, for example).
3) Soundtrack. Music is often picked up strangely and because of this you never take what is happening on the screen seriously. Maybe it was intentional. At the end of the game, I started to hate 'Miss stiletto heels'.  
4)  All events are available at a certain time. It's not annoying, but I had some trouble completing the quests for Emily and Michael. 
6)Shooting part. I didn't notice anything off-putting, but for other players it was an obvious minus.
7)  Animation. It's broken and it looks funny, but I didn't pay much attention to it. 
8)  A small number of enemy types. 
9)  Fishing. It's pure random.
10)  Final fight with a dude who had sex with two hot chicks [spoiler]and you hadn't, lol[/spoiler]. The quick time event is not so important for the game, and the creators could just make some epic scene in the best traditions of Devil May Cry 3. But no. Run, Forrest, run.
11)  You'll never figure out  what's in Sigourney's pot. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

1)  York. He is gorgeous, I somehow fell in love with him at the end of the game.
2) Self-Irony and humor. Not every game creators could make fun of their own shortcomings. 
3) Plot. He is very unpredictable and interesting. It's like you're watching a good detective series. The strongest part of the game.
4) Hints in dialogues and objects about the real murderer. You might feel like a real detective, eh, Zach?
5) Cute dogs, sent from heaven by Sheogorath.
6) Driving. It's epic. The creators of Fast & Furious should take note.  
7) Breaking the fourth wall, which was brilliantly explained.

Żeby mimo tego ukończyć grę polecam:
1. Bardzo częste zapisywanie gry.
2. Jeżeli gra crashuje się cały czas w tym samym momencie, to można spróbować przyśpieszyć czas i przeczekać kilka godzin w grze poprzez palenie papierosów - możliwe, że przy kolejnym podejściu gra puści dalej.

Jeżeli mimo tego wstępu nadal czytasz recenzję, to znaczy, że łatwo się nie zniechęcasz i jest spora szansa, że dotrwasz do momentu, w którym dostrzeżesz wartość Deadly Premonition.

Deadly Premonition zaczyna się intrygująco - w małej, oddalonej od wielkiego świata mieścinie - Greenvale - zostaje zamordowana kobieta. Okoliczności śmierci są na tyle nietypowe, że do miasta zostaje ściągnięty agent specjalny York. 
Po dobrym początku zaczynają się jednak schody. Otwarty świat, który oferuje gra wydaje się pusty. Dostępne aktywności wyglądają jak typowe ""zapchajdziury"", nie wnoszące nic istotnego do gry. Przestrzeń gry zdaje się niepotrzebnie duża, szczególnie, że samochody, którymi porusza się York na tym etapie gry są powolne.

Problemem tutaj jednak nie jest gra, tylko gracz. Wystarczy zmienić podejście do gry i - tak jak w RPG'ach - wczuć się w rolę i zacząć myśleć jak agent specjalny. Skoro została zamordowana kobieta z Greenvale, to jedną z pierwszych rzeczy, które by zrobił, to odwiedzenie domu, w którym mieszkała. Skoro kobieta tu mieszkała, to powinna mieć znajomych - należałoby więc ich znaleźć i dowiedzieć się czegoś więcej o ofierze. Grając w ten sposób, okazuje się, że jednak jest sporo do zrobienia. Okazuje się, że świat tętni życiem, że jest wielowarstwowy.

Wielowarstwowość to duży atut Deadly Premonition. Grając odsłania się kolejne warstwy: globalne - związane z całym miasteczkiem, jak i lokalne - związane z konkretną postacią z gry. Przykład: autopsji zamordowanej kobiety dokonuje lekarz Ushah Johnson. Podczas sekcji zwłok wykazuje on przesadnie dużą inicjatywę. Lekarz lubi gry (stąd wynika, że lubi też rywalizację). Po jakimś czasie od innej postaci dowiadujemy się, że Ushah jest bardzo bogaty. Takie dawkowanie informacji sprawia, że gracz zaczyna dopowiadać sobie resztę, pojawiają się podjerzenia. W Greenvale jest sporo postaci/podejrzanych, a każda z nich stanowi małą tajemnicę.

Kolejnym atutem gry są zadania poboczne. Nie zawsze ich treść jest interesująca, ale za to nagrody już są. Stanowią one remedium na pierwsze wrażenie jakie robi gra. Tu nie ma absurdów typu ""1 punkt doświadczenia za ukończenie zadania"" (patrz Wiedźmin 3). Nagrody są wartościowe, bo ułatwiają rozgrywkę. 

Reżyser Hidetaka Suehiro (Swery65) z wyczuciem tworzy więzi emocjonalne gracza z postaciami z gry. To jest unikatowa rzecz, rzadko pojawiająca się w grach. Więzi te Swery65 wykorzystuje, jak maniakalny, szalony naukowiec, który chce poznać granice wytrzymałości badanego obiektu. Obiektem tym jest gracz, którego czeka emocjonalny roller coaster z katartycznym, ale smutnym finałem.

Świetna gra!

Несмотря на это игра всё равно рандомно вылетает без каких-либо видимых причин.

Поначалу меня подкупила загадочность и абсурдность, даже вспомнил мор. утопию. Но потом началась консольная поебота, я даже не знаю с чего начать, почти всё плохо: тупейший геймплей в стиле алана вейка, невозможность нормально прицелиться, езда на автомобиле с уёбищной физикой, диалоги и сюжет уровня аниме для двенадцатилеток и конечно же открытый мир, который по большей части обман. Да, сначала кажется, что мир не пустой и как будто бы тут есть чем заняться помимо основной линии сюжета, я даже умудрился сделать несколько сайд-квестов, но где-то после третьего эпизода эта свобода пропадает и ты тупо идёшь по бесконечным коридорам, приправленных тупорылыми катсценами, и выполняешь рутинные действия. 

Дропнул где-то в конце шестого. Только что. Не смог убить ласт босса, нужно целиться в мелкий элемент жирной туши, но прицеливание не работает так, как должно, даже после очередных ковыряний в совместимости. И, по всей видимости, даже убей я того босса, мне уже не дали бы возможности побродить по городу и поделать квесты. Наверное, по мнению разработчиков, у меня дар ясновидения, я должен был угадать, что после третьего эпизода свободы действий нет.

Game crashes a lot
If you want to play with a controller its a pain just to make it work.

-Gameplay is realy, REALY clunky
You feel almost no impact from any attack with any weapon
QTEs give you very little time to react
Game has poor enemy variation, and most of them are pretty easy to deal with, so there is not much of a challenge
There is quite a few things to do in the open world, but not many of the side quests are interesting to do

-Driving is a problem on its own
It is terrible in every aspect, it takes some time for you to learn how to make turns without flipping your car, the game gives no directions to objectives besides an marker on the horizon with the distance to get there, you pretty much cant zoom out of the map, so you have to trace the routes manualy, and with the amount of dead end streets this game has, its terrible to navigate.

-Graphics are far from good, but I have to say, it has its charm

-The soundtrack is actualy realy good

-And finaly, the story is where the game shines
Characters are realy interesting, knowing more about them is one of the only things that makes side quests worth it.
The mistery is very well made, and it develops in a good pacing.

Японцы славятся своими кривыми портами и странными решениями в управлении, Deadly Premonition одна из таких японских игр. С начала может показаться, что она вышла еще где-то в 2004-2005, но нет, это 2010, а в стиме находится уже доделанная Director Cut версия. Конечно, доделанности вы не заметите, потому что графически она устарела, анимации топорны, а стрельба и того хуже. Но есть кое-что, что всегда привлекает в некоторых японских играх, это сюжет. И правда, если вы фанат или любитель триллеров и, в особенности, Twin Peaks, то повествование затянет вас надолго, возможно, вы даже можете перестать обращать внимание на дубовость всего.

+ Интересный и продуманный сюжет
+ Дух классических триллеров
+ Яркие персонажи, каждый со своей интересной историей
+ Симуляция жизни, у каждого NPC есть своё расписания дня
[h1] Огорчило	[/h1]
- Плохая графика на момент выхода
- Деревянные анимации
- Танцы с бубном над оптимизацией
- Затягивание сюжета с помощью длинных кат-сцен, в которых ничего не происходит, и некоторых геймплейных моментов
- Странные способы взятия побочных квестов
[h1] Сюжет	[/h1]
Наш персонаж Йорк работает в ФБР и уже какой год расследует странные убийства, в которых постоянно фигурируют красные семена. Очередной вызов приводит его туда, где всё началось. Сюжет и правда интригует, закидывая странную паранормальщину, которая правда не раскрывается в игре вообще, она просто есть и додуматься до ответа можно, но будет ли он правильный? Каждый момент в сюжете немного раскрывает личность настоящего убийцы, игра может даже начать водить за нос игрока, заставив его сомневаться в невинности многих персонажей, но увы игра линейна и вы не можете обвинять кого попало, всё произойдет по сюжету, а вам нужно просто дойти до конца.

Причислить игру к сурвайвал хоррор можно только при первом рассмотрение, но потом открываются все возможности и становится реально трудно определить жанр. Тебе выдают открытый мир, в котором можно ездить на машине, у каждого магазина и персонажа есть свое расписание, город буквально живёт на фоне, пока игрок расследует убийство. Если вы играли в Resident Evil 4, то вы примерно должны понимать как тут всё работает. Разработчики видимо пытались скопировать главную механику, но она не очень хороша, чтобы ей восхищаться. Для того чтобы ударить или выстрелить в противника, вам нужно сначало встать в стойку готовности и только потом, после того как вы нацелетесь, можно стрелять. Противники тоже не блещут разнообразием, 5-6 моделек прямоходящих или согнутых зомби, которые могут быть либо с оружием, либо без, также есть типичные ползающие по потолку существа, похожие на девочку из Звонка, которые появляются только в нескольких местах за всю игру.

Вообще, стоит начать с того, что это не игра. Это неплохая детективная история и чем больше ты в нее погружаешься, тем больше удовольствия получаешь. Однако от игрового процесса ты напротив с каждым лишним часом игры страдаешь все больше. Играя задумываешься о целесообразности различных ""игровых фишек"" реализованных тут (но не доведенных до ума) которые мало на что влияют, либо мешают в полной мере насладится действием разворачивающимся на экране.

Кроме истории, больших плюсов в игре нет, все остальное на любителя.

П.С.
Рандомные и циклические вылеты игры в некоторых местах лечатся запуском от имени администратора и установкой совместимости с windows 95, однако из-за этого игра будет очень медленно загружаться и немного подтормаживать, поэтому советую прибегать к данным настройкам только в моменты вылета. Соответственно вы часто сохраняетесь, как только наткнулись на вылете в определенном месте - меняете настройки, проходите момент, сохраняетесь и возвращаете настройки обратно.

Not to mention that the beginning is painfully slow (what amounts to a long cutscene, interrupted by brief moments of gameplay and quick-time events). It's a buggy port, so it requires a handful of fixes (of which are fortunately readily available and easy to install). The combat is a slog, which I think is something the publisher forced onto the devs when this was originally published. Thankfully, they made the enemies much weaker in the Director's Cut, so you can bypass most of them pretty easily. The gunplay is your typical third-person action shooter, with a lock-on system for faster aiming. The lighting in this game seems to be having problems frequently, and there still seem to be issues where the game can crash at certain chapters and corrupt your save (you'll have to download a backup save for that, which is in the included game fixes collection). The driving part of this game is also a chore. You're given a large map (admittedly nice looking, when the draw distance isn't freaking out). However, it can be hard to navigate because your map ROTATES with you, and you can't really view the entire map at once without slowly scrolling through it. What's more, you have to keep an eye on your gas while driving, but the police car you're going to be driving for a while chugs gas like a frat boy on a Saturday night. Nothing like having to stop what you're doing to try and find the nearest gas station. There seem to be a lot of sidequests, so there's that.

Overall, this game definitely earned its ""so bad it's good"" reputation, but I just didn't feel like finishing past the first chapter. If you have the patience for a slow and janky game that might make up for it with its storyline, this game could serve you (when it's on sale for $3 like it frequently is).",1541911426,1541911495,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

We played up to the hospital segment of the game and it crashed, we tried multiple times but it would not continue on from that point without crashing. So I decided to do a complete reinstall of the game but that only made matters worse. controller input stopped working, the frame rate droped to 5 frames per second if we were lucky enough to get pass the opening menu of the game before it crashed. I tried multiple fixes like DPfix. Now DPfix did stop the crashing from happening however the game still had a massive framerate drop that would not improve, making this game impossible to play.

if you do decide to buy this game on steam, here's the glitches i found and how i overcame them (may not work for you). it should be noted i played the entirety of the game in windowed mode and used the dpfix for most of it.

- launcher doesn't work
open the game with the .exe file

- crash on chapter 9, 14, etc 
set compatibility for both the .exe and launcher to windows 98. windows 98 makes the game framey so 
you can save and reopen it normally once you get through the chapter.

- aiming is heavily restricted 
windows 98 mode also fixes this, but you can get around it by pressing ctrl, releasing it while still aiming, then moving the cursor to hit what you need to. it's only reallynecessary in some boss fights and notoriously the very final boss. you can hit the last boss even with the restricted aiming, you just have to spam the ctrl method and get a little lucky.

imo, this game deserves to be played in spite of the glitches. nothing i love more than a good steam game except having to fix it myself :)",1541496382,1541496382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В ней ужасно практически всё. Но давайте по порядку.

Думаю в обзоре на данную игру стоит начать именно с минусов.

- В игре очень плохая графика. Я-то привывык к ней довольно быстро, но она и правда ужасна. Начиная с окружения и заканчивая анимациями.
- В игре отвратительная оптимизация. Если Вы не потомственный шаман в 5 поколении, то лишь удача позволит Вам играть в эту игру.
- В игре довольно таки скудный саундтрек. Готовьтесь слушать одни и те же музыкальные композиции десятки, а может и сотни раз.
- В игре довольно примитивная боевая система, да и разнообразия противников особо и нет.

Но почему же я рекомендую игру, раз у неё так много минусов, причём критических для любой игры? А всё дело в сюжете и атмосфере в целом. Каким-то образом игра цепляет и не отпускает до самого конца. Это одна из действительно немногих игр, которую я прошёл на 100%. Каким-то образом сюжет и атмосфера в целом перевешивают все минусы. Это поистине уникальный случай, напомнивший мне историю с Alpha Protocol, в которой тоже лишь 1 элемент в самом деле вытягивал всю игру.

With nearly 30 hours of experience with the game, I finished the game feeling happy and satisfied with my experience. 

I will start off with the one thing people HAVE to know about before considering purchasing this game, the PC port is horrendous, if you have a PS3 or a Xbox 360 I recommend that you play the game on those platforms. The game without any mods installed will automatically runs at 720p with the lowest graphical settings possible, luckily there are mods to fix all of those issues, but this ultimately leads to another serious issue, the crashes. This is the one game I've played where I felt that I had to save every chance I was allowed, because the frequent crashes are unpredictable and can ruin your experience severely. In my first ever playthrough, my game crashed at a specific point in the game, and this caused my save file to corrupt and I couldn't find a fix for it. This game, from a technical standpoint, is a piece of shit in these regards, if any of this stuff is bothersome I would recommend staying away from the game.

Onto the good part, due to the unfortunate crashes I experienced, I had to restart my progress 3 times, and on the third time I was finally given the opportuity to complete the game, and I did just that. The game itself is far from spectacular, the combat is, in simple terms, bad. Why is it bad? Spacebar is the aim button, that's really all I have to say to explain why it's bad, but it doesn't take away from the game too much. What really made me engrossed with this game was the story, the town of Greenvale, and it's various characters. Honestly, the main protagonist of the story, that being Agent Francis York Morgan, ends up being one of my favorite characters in a video game in recent memory. There have been a couple of scenes in the game, especially the ""Sinner Sandwich"" cutscene which have had me laughing quite a lot, and it's primary because of how interesting of a character York is, and his relationship with Zach being unique and intriguing to follow.

But what's also great about this game is that it's an absurd game. It takes the small town murder investigation trope and adds this weird vibe to the game that makes you want to keep playing. I thought the opening hours of the game were a bit boring for me, but as I kept playing, I grew fond of the game and I became invested in the story. Before I beat the game, I would listen to the soundtrack of the game from time to time, and at the time I thought it was pretty bad. After I beat the game however, I had a greater appreciation for the music as I understood how it was supposed to be taken in and enjoyed, like for instance, there's a song called ""Miss Stiletto Heels"" which I didn't like in the beginning, but when it was finally introduced into the game, I started to like the song more because I understood the song's purpose. 

Before writing this review, I saw another review that claimed this game to be ""The Room"" or video games, and I honestly couldn't agree more. 

I wouldn't buy the game at it's current pricepoint of $25, wait for it to go on sale, I think I got my copy for $4 while it was on sale.",1538853163,1579327000,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Dependiendo de que lado estes... este jueguito o lo amas o lo odias, no tiene un punto medio (en mi particular caso, es de mis favoritos~♥ lo jugue hace como 4 años en ps3 y hoy en dia lo ando revisitando, porque es hermoso xD)

>A grandes rasgos: pues este jueguito es un ""survival horror"" que no tiene mucho de survival, ni de horror, pero hermosamente guionado donde manejamos a York un agente del FBI que se le encarga la busqueda de un asesino en serie en un pueblito. Llegando a este se encuentra con fenomenos paranormales que le estan advirtiendo algo.

>Lo bueno:
-Pues es un buen thriller de juego
-el gameplay es decente (no es un resident 4 pero se acerca bastante a los survival horrors viejitos)
-el desarrollo y plot twist son un win en este juego.
-es como si jugaras a ser sherlock

>Lo malo:
-No muchos entenderan la grandiosidad de este jueguito xD
-tienes que jugar mucho con tu mando; para configurarlo bien.
-no es de los mejores ports (la version de ps3 le gana por mucho)

Francis York, agent du FBI, notre héros, la copie conforme de Dale Cooper de Twin Peaks, un scénario tordu et géré d'une main de maître, agrémenté de second degrès donnant du relief à toute cette histoire qui, vous l'aurez compris, traitera de disparitions, de mystique et bien plus encore.
J'avais à l'époque fait une recherche sur le net pour trouver un jeu similaire à Twin Peaks en termes d'ambiance et d'histoire alors P U T A I N, j'étais prêt à subir toutes les douleurs et supplices pour y jouer, tant l'engouement des notes sur les sites spécialisés sortaient de l'ordinaire et prenant en compte mon amour pour la série mythique de David Lynch.
Il me suffisait de regarder les notes sur l'internet pour comprendre qu'il se passait un truc de pas clair, du genre soit le jeu est noté 0/20 soit 20/20. Le fils bâtard de Shenmue et de Twin Peaks, perdu dans l'esprit dingue et délirant de l'agent York. C'est édifiant.

Côté Gameplay, on passe du coq à light en un rien de temps et on en redemande. Tel le divin Shenmue, on mène parfois l'enquête, on rend des services, on tisse des relations et on apprend à faire partie de ce monde ouvert sachant déborder de détails à sa manière. En effet, les PNJ s'adonnent à leurs occupations selon l'heure, le jour ou la nuit. Vous pouvez vous raser, vous doucher, faire des filatures (un exploit vu la lourdeur des controles), tirer sur des bestioles qui ressemblent à des MST qui ont pris vie, simplement vous balader et flâner, explorer, vous addoner à des quêtes secondaires toutes plus débiles les unes que les autres.

Que l'on aime ou non ce genre de jeu, il est indéniable que celui ci possède une âme, une ambiance, un contexte rendant le sacrifice de couille de Hidetaka Suehiro légitime et le canonisant au panthéon des mecs loués par les Dieux.
Le prix est dérisoire et vous pouvez vous faire votre avis en regardant les multiples stream disponibles.

[h1]Review:[/h1]
Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut is a 2013 HD upgrade of the “[url=http://shshatteredmemories.com/greenvale/hey-deadly-premonition-is-inguiness-world/]Most Critically Polarizing survival horror game ever made[/url]” Deadly Premonition.

The game follows the eccentric FBI Agent [strike]Coop[/strike] Francis York Morgan with his imaginary friend “Zach” as he investigates the grisly murder of the popular [strike]Laur[/strike] Anna Graham in the small town logging town of [strike]Twin P[/strike] Greenvale.  Anna’s death appears to have a connection to the “Red Seeds” killer York has been tracking across the country, will his search finally come to an end in this small town?

To say [url=http://fkinthecoffee.com]I love this game would be an understament.[/url] Yes, the game has outdated controls and PS2-era graphics but what Deadly Premonition lacks in the technical department it more than makes up for with its endearing characters, charming dialogue, and an engaging yet strange story that’s a bizarre mix of drama, horror, and comedy wrapped in an [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZV_ijKaPN8]earworm of a tune[/url] you’ll find yourself humming days on end.

It's actually kind of mind boggling how much detail has been packed into this little game... once you take a closer look that is. Part of why I love this game so much is the amount of work that went into making Greenvale a living breathing town. Each resident has their own schedules and character interactions independent of the main story and can even change depending on the current weather.

If you just stick to the main missions you are going to miss a lot of the small details that make this game great. I've been playing the game since the original 360 game release 8 years ago and I'm still surprised by ""new"" conversations I never encountered before before because I neglected to speak to a certain character at a certain time, place, and weather condition! You can actually learn a lot about the townfolk during these optional conversations, not revealed during the main mission stuff, so taking your time to explore the town really adds to the game experience in my opinion. This is a mystery game afterall so it's actually possible to even catch a few of the characters acting quite suspciously when they think they aren't being watched! 

With all this said I caution anyone interested in visiting Greenvale to [b]PLEASE WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO GO ON SALE AND DO NOT PAY $30 for this PC port.[/b] It's [b]EXTREMELY[/b] buggy even with all the fan patches available and depending on your PC your experience may vary from only experiencing minor crashes now and then to being completely unplayable right from the get go. 

This game will most likely be a nightmare for you to get to run properly. I've owned this PC port since it's 2013 release and have played it on both Windows 7 and Windows 10 operating systems. It wasn't until a just a few months ago that it [i]wasn't[/i] a struggle for me to get the game to run sans crashes for hours at a time. I don't quite understand why but it's been running decently for me the last few months with little to no crashes at 60fps...but I know that this could quickly change in a Windows Update lol. Just know going in that you are going to have to put in some work to get the game to run and keep this guide handy to help solve a majority of game breaking issues you will most likely encounter: [url=https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut]PC Gaming Wiki: Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut[/url]

Here's a small list of problems and work arounds I've run into over the years though your milage may vary with your PC. Stuff that worked for me in the past hasn't always worked for others :(

[list]
    [*] [b]Problem[/b]: Toolbox unusable, I can't properly select items in the game inventory, or general framerate lag 

[b]Solution[/b]: Restart your PC. Really. Restarting you PC and the the game actually will solve a lot of weird play issues.

    [*] [b]Problem[/b]: Game crashes after an hour of gameplay due to memory leakage.

        [b]Solution[/b]: install the 4GB patch available [url=https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371]HERE[/url] to make dp.exe aware of large addresses. Run the game through dp.exe only and disable Steam overlay as well.

    [*] [b]Problem[/b]: York can't aim up with his gun!

[b]Solution[/b]: Set DP.exe to run in compatibility mode for Windows 98. Play the game then restart again without compatibility mode.
 
    [*] [b]Problem[/b]: Windows 10 PC and the controller analog sticks refuse to work unless I'm in Window 98 compatibility mode and the lag is atrocious. 

[b]Solution[/b]: Disable DPFix. This happened to me after the 2018 May Windows 10 Feature Update. Once I disabled DP fix my controller worked like normal and I haven't experienced a major game crash in months. I'm actually wondering if there's some sort of conflict with Windows 10 and DPFix right now because I had also be experiencing awful cutscene game crashes for weeks with it DPFix enabled as well. 
[/list]

If you want a more reliable way to experience Greenvale I recommend the original 360 release (it's even a backwards compatible title with XBOX ONE!). The drawbacks? Worse controls, lower resolution graphics, and lack of additional cutscenes and DLC.

If you are really keen to experience the DLC, extra cutscenes, and improved graphic and controls offered in the Director's Cut the PS3 Director's Cut may be the way to go if you don't want to deal with getting this to run on the PC. The drawbacks? Unlike this PC port all the DLC has to be purchased individually from the Playstation store and you will have to deal with some wonky framerates. But hey, at least you know it won't crash on you 9 times out of 10!

Side note! It pains me to see that people have gone through this game with out realizing these very usual game mechanics:

[list]
    [*] [b]You can fast forward time[/b]: You can move forward time any amount just by smoking a cigarette. You need to talk to a character at 18:00 and it's 13:00? Just smoke for 5 hours. You don't have to sit around and wait for the in game clock or constantly take naps. Please note the amount of time you can move forward at any given moment depends on how tired or hungry York is. If he's full and well rested he can easily move the game 12 hours ahead. If you are outside however your smoke break will always upruptly end at 00:00 and 06:00 so you can view Greenvale's...er... Nightlife begin and end.

    [*] [b]There is fast travel in the game![/b]: The radio allows York to instantly travel to locations he’s visited once before. To get this item you need to first complete Side Mission #4 Lost Arnold while you make you first visit to the Sheriff Department. On the way to Anna’s autopsy, on Muffler Road, be sure to pull over and grab a flower that only appears when it’s raining so you can complete Side Mission #5 Nameless Flower and receive the radio from George when he's home in the evening (usually after 21:00).

    [*] [b]There are no consequences for missing a main story mission time limit[/b]: The game may tell you that you need to go see Anna's autopsy before the hospital closes but you can put that mission off for days and talk to people or complete side missions instead if you want. The days events will reset every new day so whenever you decide to start a main story mission the at the appropriate time it will resume as if you made it there on time in the first place.

Deadly Premonition ist sehr stark durch die Horrorfilme aus dem 20. Jahrhundert inspiriert, wie zum Beispiel ""Der weiße Hai"".

Zur Hauptstory: Man spielt den FBI-Agenten Francis York Morgan, der in die Kleinstadt Greenvale geschickt wird, um herauszufinden, wer für eine Mordserie, die mit roten Samen in verbindung steht, ist und bekommt es bald mit dem Übernatürlichen zu tun. Dabei steht ihm Zach zur Seite, ein Freund, den er seit der Kindheit kennt. Außerdem helfen im George, der Sheriff von Greenvale, sowie sein Hilfssheriff Emily. Neben der interessanten Hauptstory gibt es außerdem 50 Nebenquests, die Abwechselung bieten und in denen York die Bevölkerung besser kennenlernt.

Einen Haken hat dieses geniale Spiel jedoch: Die Optimierung. Das Spiel stürzt teilweise ohne Grund ab.

The game is a B class one, so I didn't expect spectacular graphics nor the best gameplay additions that a AAA game could have them. With those standards in mind.

PROS:
- The main character is mysterious and charismatic, also adds a touch of fun for his invisible friend.
- The story is also nice, researching brutal murders around the town. Something bizarre indeed (quite a Japaneese touch). 
- The ambience, despite their low graphics, is enjoyable to explore the red nightmare worlds. (Alternative version of the reality full of monsters and red tree roots).

CONS:
Tons of bugs and crashes that can literally stops the game. It's not due a poor PC requirement, but the opossite, the game show more problems in modern computers. (Is a shabby port from the console game). And are not isolated issues, are things that happened many times through the game.
- Unabilty to aim vertically, this made impossible to defeat the final boss as the last shot, you have to strictly aim down. The way to solve this, is executing the .exe in compatibility with Windows 98.
- Loose of textures playing in compatibility mode. If you play sessions with a lot of progress and in compatibility mode, there are moments when the textures memory get full, and characters and graphics starts to appear as black squares. (Cinematics are rendered with game engine, so this problem happens there too). The way to fix it, quit the game and run it again.
- Stuck on loading screens, difficult to unforsee, the game risks to stuck on loading screens after some cinematics, forcing to exit the game and run again loading the last game saved. Theres no way avoid these problems, but they can be reduced with a mod made by fans ""DPfix"", as well as trying to play the game in compatibility mode.

Those bugs, broke the game experience a lot (are problems that hapenned very frequently) and if you were not aware of them at the begginig, even worst, (because when you know them you can prepare for them but on the other case...).

Leaving bugs on a side, there are other lesser things I dislike of the game.

- The awful use of the Quick Time Events (QTE), many of them appearing suddently during the gamepley and leading to instant kill. (The player hasn't got many skills, so to dodge attacks he depends of those QTE).  Also, there are some QTE where you have to smash A and D many times during long time to make the character run away from an enemy, I found those scenes too tedious.  (and you have to push more different QTEs in the middle).  Indeed, this is my best BAD example of how to do QTEs.
- The Slow pacing of the game. Not a very exciting one.  Its pros is the mystery and humour, but it lacks of ""emotion"" in most part of it.
- The ending... with the director's cut version, they tried to fix it a bit, but... meh... 

Conclusion:
It is not the best of its type, and it is neither a great missed experience if you avoid it. But if you decide to play it, Deadly Premonition can be an entertaining experience if you like these kind of games, (survival horror and sandbox games travelling A to B to complete secondary missions and collecting objects). 

But due to its multiples bugs and bad game design choices, I generally do NOT recomend this game. If you are doubting, don't buy it.

I got this game on sale, it was 2 dollars for me. For this price I would reccomend it- no problem Its worth more in my mind. 
However, I would never pay anything more than 20$ for this port. The game itself is wonderful, but this PC version has some major flaws.  Most significantly, the aiming system is reworked *broken?* and makes some parts of the game needlessly hard and almost impossible.

I also had a few soft crashes (to desktop), causing me to lose progress. Setting compatibility to win98/me
 fixed the crashes, but harmed frames during play. 

This is a awesome game, hindered by a horrendous port and some of the worst boss fights the modern age has known.
If you like a really strange story, with awkward humorous flare- then I would say buy this title on sale. 
I got roughly 30hrs, and I did not do all of the side events available. Do not buy this port for anything less than 20$.
I would feel like its good money spent at the 5-10$ range. I just got really lucky and scooped it up for 2$. 

If they ever fix the aiming, and make it behave more like the console version, id say 35-40$ is a decent buy- but not this specific port. The game itself however was fun enough to slog through the issues.

I've tried playing this game on two different laptops.

The cutscenes lagged using both. In-game, it ran smoothly so I ended up skipping cutscenes. There's really no reason for a DX9 game with dated Dreamcast-like graphics like these to run so horribly.

Then what else is there? Why would I recommend this? The story.
This is the quirkiest story with the weirdest characters and everything about it just has that aura of Japanese developers trying to make an American game.

The combat mechanics are stiff and clunky, kinda remind me of resident evil, if it was too baked to aim properly. Even has the same mechanic of either aiming and shooting, or being able to walk. In defense, from what I understood about this game, the developers didn't actually want to add combat mechanics but did so for the publishers as it was heavily advised to do so, and hence we can all agree: the developers were right.

Driving: it exists. But I think I spend about 75% driving normally and 25% either on the side or upside down because the ""DLC"" car is too fast and turns too sharp (and yet still a better experience than big rigs). Though my favourite part of the road trips are listening to York talk about movies, which are all real and seem to have actual facts about them, though this was pretty cool.

Main Story: Twin Peaks, but like you are trying to circumvent a copyright. I actually played this first and then watched the series... and boy are the resemblances uncanny. 
- Pretty white girl dies and sends big city agent to middle of nowhere: check.
- Agent that uses unorthodox techniques to solve the case: check.
- Red room: check.
- Crazy log lady: somehow check.

If you have no idea what I am on about, then watch at least season one. Then get the game if you liked it.
Replay-ability: yes and no. There are plenty of sidequests that are done in certain chapters and not others so there's that, but I replayed it a lot because I just love the main story. So it's pretty linear with a proper ending hence most players may not find it as enjoyable so hence it's a bit iffy on that.

Ci sono talmente tanti bug che, per quanto riguarda la mia esperienza, è praticamente impossibile avanzare nel gioco.
Sono fermo al capitolo 1 (al momento di uscire dall'ospedale): appena parte la cutscene, il gioco va in crash. Ho ripetuto la sequenza svariate volte tentando differenti configurazioni (far partire il gioco come amministratore, compatibilità con Windows 98 (?), dpfix disabilitato e abilitato) ma il risultato è sempre lo stesso.

Tra l'altro pure il menù è buggato. La selezione degli oggetti funziona in maniera casuale: spesso l'oggetto apparentemente selezionato non corrisponde a quello effettivamente selezionato. Ovvero, per capire quale oggetto è realmente selezionato, bisogna controllare il nome in descrizione e mai affidarsi all'immagine relativa... Davvero complimenti.

Anche il gameplay presenta alcune deficienze: il movimento del mirino tutt'altro che fluido e comodo da gestire, i nemici che, oltre ad essere lentissimi, talvolta scompaiono, la guida dell'auto che definire ""arcade"" è un eufemismo...
Ma almeno alcune di queste"" caratteristiche"" bilanciano una difficoltà che altrimenti sarebbe fin troppo tarata verso il basso.

Il comparto tecnico è abbastanza scadente se si considera che dovrebbe essere un gioco della PS3, mentre ricoda un prodotto di inzio generazione precedente. Per me comunque questo non è un grosso problema, così come non lo è, la risoluzione fissa a 720p. Fossero solo questi i problemi di questa ""produzione""...

Si salva solo l'atmosfera del gioco (fortemente debitrice a Twin Peaks) e forse la trama (dico forse perchè, non riuscendo a giocarci, posso solo immaginarlo da quel poco che ho visto).

A mio avviso non vale i 3 euro spesi grazie allo sconto Steam del 90% (cioè senza sconto costerebbe sui 25-30 euro...).",1529843215,1529843215,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, this game is wonderfully weird in a way that only a Japanese product trying to emulate American fiction can be.
I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and their interactions, and the story is gripping and interesting.

HOWEVER:
Rarely have I come across a game that has shown it's age as harshly as this. There are ""action"" sequences, where you get to freeze in place like a turret if you want to take a shot at enemies that take 6 shots each to take down. Soon, you begin sprinting past any encounter just to save yourself time and boredom. However, since the enemies have giant hitboxes, they often end up blocking your path so you need to hammer away at the mouse and keyboard with no enjoyment whatsoever.

Puzzles are simple fetchquests most of the time, with their solutions being so easy that you feel no sense of accomplishment whatsoever. It feels like something that was simply put there to slow down your progress, not challenge you.

Story pieces are connected by driving. I would love to put in words how horrendous the driving is, but it is something that cannot be related by speech. Trust me, it's bad. And don't get me started on navigation.

After playing it for a few hours and really getting into the story, I sadly have to put this down. I just can't bring myself to slog through all of the horrible sections just to enjoy the wonderful parts inbetween. Seeing as this is ""The Director's Cut"", I feel as if the Director could have done a lot more cutting.

И это вполне оправдано, так как многие люди начинают делать выводы с первых секунд и минут процесса. Поиграв в нее полчаса- цепануло, поигрв в нее 90 минут, понял, что гг хоть и крут, но даун, потому что в роликах в игре, когда на него идут враги- зомби ( а вообще я хз кто эт вообще), он вместо того, чтобы дать отпор или хотя б сбежать- не нервно курит в эпицентре надвигающегося пи***ца и улыбается, как уе**н. 

Теперь серьезно ( нет )
Минусы игры:
-Деревянная графика, просто убожество. Розовая пантера на ПС1 была и то куда красочнее и заваленней текстурами. 
-Как и графика, деревянный- крутой гг.
-Тупая боевка, которая напоминает ""Проект Зомбойд"". Кстати, мобов можно тупо оббегать- они тупые, как половина создателей этой игры.
-Ходил с пончиком х*р знает сколько- не пропал, а когда я его юзанул- вполне не плохо для своего срока годности отюзал мне НР
-Отстрелы в авто, там вообще отдельная тема. Я как будто перенесся в старые- добрые- говенные дальнобойщики. 

Плюсы:
-Игру не рекомендует никакая вера, поэтому зайдет всем атеистам или сатанистам.
-Радует, что на улицах нет людей, я просто представляю с ними картину и молюсь.
-Чер*ова ( почему стим блочит это слово?!) сохранялка напоминает мне о THE EVIL WITHIN-e.
-Столько кофе я видел только в аниме ""Токийский гуль"".
-Единственное место в моей жизни, где я побрился.
-П*дик- ментик в первой главе этого ""Недошедевра"" так бегает, что напоминает мага из Линейки. Я прослезился, когда увидел это.
-""Игру сохранил- доллар должен"" (Не все поймут)
-В разуме гг твориться что- то с чем- то. Напоминает рублевскую мусорку из Нашей Раши: тупо телек, камин и (спасибо креативному отделу) две каких- то е**чих двери, которые ведут никуда. 


В общем, в игре- что минусов, что плюсов- практически одинаково, но я рекомендую, потому что эту игру можно использовать, как средство пытки владельцев топ-пк.

[u]Посему продолжу обзор ""лестными"" словами о технической реализации.[/u]
При каждом запуске игры перед нами предстает лаунчер. В нем можно изменить назначение кнопок управления клавиатуры и выбрать язык. Плохой дефолтный выбор только у кнопок прокрутки оружия - PgUp и PgDn; переназначить кнопки мыши нельзя, как и увидеть, за что они отвечают.
Отправляемся в настройки уже в игре и понимаем, что подкрутить графику под себя нельзя - никаких опции изменения разрешения или метода сглаживания нет, можно лишь отключить кровищу.
Откровенно говоря, общая картинка напоминает лучшие времена жизни PS2, акцент в моделировании сделан только на главных персонажах. 
Во время прохождения я столкнулся с такими странностями:
- свободное прицеливание при каждом запуске игры ограничено недвижимым невидимым прямоугольником в треть экрана (лечится альттабированием в паузе);
- две дефолтные полицейские машины управляются в сотню раз лучше, чем перекаченный маслкар главного героя;
- машина, заглоченная текстурами (впоследствии и сам угодил в эту ловушку);
- галстук/кусок одежды проходит сквозь персонажа, нож самопроизвольно подергивается в колене у генерала;
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1388923251
- можно застрять в здании, т.к. иконка кнопки выхода не подсвечивается;
- текстуры долго подгружаются;
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1385809902
- предметы инициализируются с погрешностью, из-за чего порой невозможно выполнить задание;

[u]Немного об игровом процессе.[/u]
Играть нам предстоит от третьего лица в открытом мирке, часто переключаясь на прохождение серий комнат с нежитью внутри зданий.
Мир здесь чересчур закрытый - два десятка широких пустынных городских улиц, парочка открытых полей и лесных участков, все остальное - огороженные кишки дорог или тропинок.
Ориентироваться по нему мешает автоматически поворачивающаяся с игроком карта (что мини-карта, что полноразмерная).
Перемещение осуществляется либо на своих двоих, либо на транспорте органов правопорядка, который нужно постоянно подзаправлять, либо через использование рации для быстрых перемещений (дается за побочный квест).
Вся возможная игровая активность:
- задания основной сюжетной линии, которые можно переигрывать в упрощенном виде;
- 50 дополнительных квестов, которые не навязываются и за выполнение которых выдают предметы для облегчения дальнейшего прохождения; 
- рыбалка за предметами для инвентаря;
- три одиночные ""гонки"" на время под плохо замаскированную композицию American Idiot группы Green Day;
- собирание карточек для ачивок или светового меча.
Также необходимо вовремя отправляться в кроватку и насыщать желудок, чтобы не помереть от истощения.
Стоит отметить, что за несколько дней без бритья у героя вырастает борода, а над тухлым костюмом, который не менялся неделю, начинают виться мухи.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1387772385
Инвентарь тоже есть, но вот быстрого доступа к нему или к его элементам посредством горячих клавиш у игрока нет. Приходится ставить игру на паузу, ждать пару секунд его прогрузки, выбрать нужный пункт, выбрать нужный подпункт инвентаря, выбрать нужный предмет, выбранть нужное действие - этот процесс довольно долгий. 
Видимо, из-за общего качества порта уже в начале игры у нас имеется оружие с бесконечным боезапасом, делающее прохождение эпизодов с врагами рутинной пострелушкой в тире. Да, тут есть возможность медленного и тихого обхода супостатов, но гораздо быстрее и проще просто оббежать их, ибо за пределы своих комнат они не выходят. Еще и [strike]автоприцеливание[/strike] захват цели присутствует.
""Поднапрячься"" придется только три раза при встрече с боссом с последующими догонялками.
За всю игру я умер всего пару раз на второй встрече с убийцей, не успев разглядеть и нажать на нужную кнопку уклонения, а также разбив неуправляемую в дождь машину.

[u]Еще меньше слов о сюжете.[/u]
Специальный агент Фрэнсис Йорк Морган ведет расследование жестокого убийства молодой красотки из города Гринвэйл. На фоне величественных гор, пышных хвойных лесов и тихого американского пригорода Йорк должен раскрыть тайну серийных убийств и остаться в живых прежде, чем сверхъестественные существа и таинственный убийца в плаще доберутся до него.
Спойлерить не буду - основной сюжет цельный и ровный, не то, что невероятно нудная бредятина в последних сезонах ""Твин Пикс"". Финал игры можно было бы обозвать ""японщиной"", если бы не история из прошлого Йорка, которую можно подогнать под происходящее.
Однако присутствие монстров из ""Звонка"" никакой историей не подкрепляется. И это тоже можно было бы подогнать под случай из прошлого главного героя, если бы этих чудищ не видел другой, более адекватный персонаж. Выглядит всё это так, будто весь процесс прохождения через комнаты с монстрами нужен лишь для того, чтобы разбавить езду от одного места с сюжетными кат-сценами к другому.
Атмосферные сюжетные ролики с диалогами о преступлениях часто тяжело серьезно воспринимать, т.к. во время них играет дурацкая бравурная мелодия аля детективы ранних 80-х или веселое и беззаботное деревенское насвистывание.

[b]ИТОГИ[/b]
Техническая реализация: 4/10.
Игровой процесс: 6/10.
Сюжет: 8/10.
Общая оценка: 6/10.

Строго-настрого рекомендую лишь любителям сюжетно-ориентированных проектов, потому что только принимать участие в игровом процессе Deadly Premonition довольно скучно, а порой и вовсе невозможно.

I started it, played the entire playtime I have in the game in one sitting. It never crashed, no bugs, no technical issues at all.

However...

This is just not a very fun game. 
You spend much of the game driving. The driving controls are overly sensitive, the car is easy to flip (I managed to flip it going 20 mph), and the car is terribly slow moving. Add to it that every location is huge distances away from each other, you can spend upwards of 10 minutes driving from one forced location to the next, taking the fastest route.

The gameplay, other than driving there really isn't much. There are some pretty minor shooting sections that are super linear. The enemies are easy to kill, they don't do much damage to you (if you ever even manage to get hit) and only take 2-3 hits from your gun with infinite ammo.

Now, to the actual detective parts, these play mostly without player interaction. There's a part where your at the community center and even if you can't find each town person to talk to (that's all you have to do in this section), the game automatically proceeds you to each of the events without you. Much of the other parts of the game are exactly the same. It's an automatic event that doesn't involve the player.

Audio. Oh boy, audio. The music, great stuff. I really liked the music. It had good and memorable tunes. However the voice acting... The voice acting is pretty terrible. The acting in general is pretty sub-par, but then the balance is way off. Some lines are loud, some quiet. Some lines have better audio quality then other lines. It's just everywhere and all bad. A complete mess.

Overall, this is a rather boring experience where you spend very little time actually playing. I was expecting a corny, but quirky and fun, survival horror. I just got bored instead.",1526755580,1526755580,False,5,2,0.551402449607849121,3,False,False,False,False,,,

It's also the game I've probably jumped through the most hoops to simply play. I think there are two camps when they think about the quality of the games they play. They either don't think about it too much and just play what's currently trending or they dig deep into the level design, mechanics, controls and the technicals like stability, graphics and performance. 

Deadly Premonition is sort of a failure on all fronts, but manages to be one of the most memorable games I've ever played. This port specifically is a mess, and near unplayable without Durante's DPfix. Even with the fix you'll likely experience irregular crashing, and will likely have to play through one or two segments twice because you lost all progress to a crash. This is setting aside the plethora of bugs the game is plagued with.

The gameplay is sort of a mishmash of Grand Theft Auto and Resident Evil 4. Where you explore a town and talk to its peculiar inhabitants to discover the mystery behind a small town murder. The plot, setting and characters are straight out of Twin Peaks. The combat is horribly clunky, stupidly easy, and according to interviews with the game's director, Swery, was only included because the publisher wouldn't let them release the game with no combat. Most players do the side mission to obtain the unbreakable wrench, which defeats almost all enemies in one hit, and abuse it through the entirety of the game. The pause menu's map rotates, making navigation as confusing as possible.

The side missions are an utter nightmare, and only can be started during particular hours of the day, fitting a particular characters daily schedule. It often involves tracking a specific character throughout their day to find the point in time where their side mission begins. The side mission is usually something completely asinine and inconsequential. The intended effect from the director was to have the player immerse themselves in the town by familiarizing the player with the daily routine of its inhabitants much like Majora's Mask. Some side missions are reliant on others being completed, so navigating the intricate web of side missions will only lead to loss of sanity.

As terribly designed and programmed as Deadly Premonition is, it is also a game filled with unmatched character, pointless detail, and charm. The voice acting is so incredibly and hilariously amateurish, but also has very deliberate delivery, clearly communicating the personalities of the characters. The voice of the main character, Francis York Morgan should be commended for breathing life into one my favorite game protagonists. The soundtrack is so scarce, featuring maybe 10 tracks that get more mileage than should be legal, yet you'll happily whistle Life is Beautiful months after you've completed the game. The pointless feature of York's facial hair management, keeping your clothes clean, the hands-down best driving dialogue in any game, the attention to setting atmosphere, the serene, yet poorly rendered small town, one of the most quotable game scripts ever, the hunger and tired meter all add so much personality to such a poorly made game, that you can't put it down.

The plot is an amalgamation of striking bizarre imagery and eccentric characters, where every line is an ingeniusly crafted head-scratcher. I don't think I've ever laughed at a game more than this one. It even has an out-of-nowhere, unironically well thought out final act. The good qualities of Deadly Premonition can't be deliberately manufactured or reproduced, they have to come from an extremely untalented (or talented depending on your perspective) creator's passion, honest effort and creativity resulting in game that completely defies the standards of what most consider a good game. Deadly Premonition will quite possibly be one of your new favorites if you give it a shot.",1525448896,1525448992,True,7,0,0.622262001037597656,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Да, предупрежу, что в ней много минусов, но все они относятся только к технической части игры, в остальном же — это, как минимум, очень неординарная и оригинальная игра, которая цепляет своим глубоким сюжетом(где нашлось место даже мистическим ноткам), а также стилистикой, подачей повествования и тщательно проработанными персонажами. 

И сразу к персонажам:  чего только стоит главный герой - агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган. Он харизматичен, объективен, прозорлив и очень циничен, а ещё часто разговаривает со своим ""напарником"" Заком, о котором вы узнаете в самой игре. Остальные же персонажи чувствуются живыми, включая даже персонажей второго плана. У всех свой характер, каждый из которых не похож друг на друга, что позволяет им выделяться и запоминаться. А сцены с ними смотреть одно удовольствие, пусть и для игры был выбран не самый лучший движок. 

Стоит уделить отдельное внимание саундтреку – он великолепен и подобран, я бы сказал, очень грамотно.

Также нельзя не упомянуть о сходстве игры с сериалом  «Твин Пикс», да и с творчеством Дэвида Линча в целом, ибо его ""рука"" чувствуется во всем: от режиссуры до места действия, присущей ему мистике, чудоковатости персонажей и прочих мелочей. Тут даже присутствуют сцены, явно похожие на те, что были в сериале, а Йорк так вообще сошел с Купера, только со своими ""тараканами"". Но это далеко не минус, ибо вдохновление Линчем приправленно японским колоритом, что в итоге сказалось отлично на самой атмосфере и сюжете в целом. 

А теперь о самой концепции игры. Она состоит, в основном, из мирных действий: катание на машине, расследование убийств, допросы свидетелей, поиск улик и т.д., а когда Йорк захочет есть, то мы спокойно можем пойти по закусочным. Тут даже нужно следить за внешним видом, включая бритье и стирку одежды. В остальном, мы будем общаться с персонажами, у которых будут второстепенные и порой даже оригинальные задания.
Но стоит отметить, что так будет далеко не всегда, ибо в игре нас ждет и смена реальности, в которой всё вокруг преображается, подобно игровой серии Silent Hill, а там нам явно будут не рады.

В итоге мы имеем игру с хорошей подачей сюжета, не очевидными сюжетными поворотами, отличными персонажами, но ужасной технической составляющей.  Но мне кажется, что если игра вас, как минимум, заинтригует, то на все технические недостатки вы уже не будете обращать внимания, а история маленького городка Гринвейл поглотит вас целиком и не оставит равнодушным.",1525189896,1615632178,True,14,0,0.636915087699890137,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Commençons d’abord par les bons points, et comment ne pas mentionner le héros du jeu, Francis York Morgan, vraiment la classe, puis ses discussions avec Zach sont vraiment savoureuses parfois. Un personnage totalement décalé (ses paroles à propos de son café xD) par moment et vraiment extravagant, ses réflexions sont un pur délice par moment. D’ailleurs, je dois avouer qu’à la fin du jeu, le fait qu’on quitte l’agent du FBI m’a fait un petit pincement au coeur. Quel dommage qu’ils n’aient jamais donner de suite avec ce personnage.

Ensuite, l’ambiance en général est très bien retranscrite, tout ça mener par une direction artistique vraiment bien, j’ai adoré cette ville (même si c’est vraiment mort côté animation) entourée de forêt et de montagne. La soundtrack y joue également pour beaucoup, d’ailleurs, y a plusieurs piste qui nous reste longtemps en mémoire (notamment le thème principal), elle était vraiment de qualité.

Au début du jeu, j’avais trouvé qu’il voulait être trop réaliste (manger, dormir, se changer etc.) mais au final on s’y habitue très vite et on fait les petits trucs de chaque jours presque instinctivement. Même si c’est chiant de voir des mouches autour de nous quand on a pas une valise à portée de main.

Et enfin, son scénario dans sa globalité, il nous tient vraiment en haleine de bout en bout, digne des meilleurs thrillers (à noter que je n’ai pas encore regarder Twin Peaks donc je n’ai pas trop vu les multiples références) et pas mal de rebondissement. Encore un point que j’ai adoré.

Maintenant les défauts… je dirais à peu près tout le reste. Déjà l’ergonomie, mon dieu, ou est l’ergonomie ? Alors certes, l’inventaire est bien fait, mais la carte, c’est une catastrophique, quand on veut l’agrandir en roulant, on ne voit pratiquement plus rien tellement ça prend de la place. Alors, la plupart du temps, on se contente de suivre la flèche jusqu’à arriver dans un cul de sac et devoir faire demi-tour. Bref, la carte, vraiment un calvaire, même dans l’inventaire, car quand on veut trouver un endroit en particulier, on cherche pendant dix minutes jusqu’à tomber dessus par hasard, et à ce moment-là, on ne sait même plus dans quelle direction aller. D’ailleurs, ça me fait penser, les balades en voiture… c’est pire que de diriger un tractopelle, jusqu’à ce qu’on débloque toutes les améliorations, et là, on a l’impression de rouler sur une route de mayonnaise.

Pourquoi il y a des combats ? C’était vraiment un aspect inutile du jeu, ils sont mou, et la plupart des monstres ne font que rester à leur place si on s’en approche pas, ce qui permet de les tuer a distance… avec un pistolet à munition illimités. On aurait pu se contenter des séquences en QTE… s’ils avaient été mieux gérer parce que purée qu’est-ce qu’ils sont difficile. Le temps qu’on nous laisse pour appuyer sur les bonnes touches est tellement faible que à certaines séquences (la scierie…), je suis mort à quasiment chaque fois pour réussir à connaître en avance les touches à appuyer. Un gros problème sur ce coup là alors qu’au début c’était vraiment une bonne idée je trouvais.

Et enfin, LE plus gros problème : Les bugs… je sais pas si c’est comme ça pour toutes les versions mais la version Steam est truffée de bug, c’est absolument scandaleux d’avoir publier un jeu comme ça. Quand on restait plus d’une heure, j’avais un bug runtime, parfois le jeu s’arrêtait sans raison et le truc qui m’a bien fait chier et que j’ai dus chercher pendant longtemps une manière de contourner ces bugs, c’est le fait qu’à certaines cinématiques qui se déroulaient à certaines heures, bah le jeu buggait et il était impossible d’aller plus loin. Heureusement que j’ai trouvé des moyens de détourner ça.

Bref, au final, je le note [b]10/20[/b] car même si ses bons côtés m’ont vraiment fait passer un bon moment, il y a trop de truc qui m’a ruiner un peu l’expérience. Je dirais que c’est l’exemple même du jeu qui mériterait un remake pour gommer tous ces défauts. Et je n’ai même pas parler d’une technique qui date de la playstation 2 (certaines cinématiques donnent l’impression d’avoir été fait sous The Movie) mais bon, ça, personnellement, ça ne m’a pas trop déranger car je suis passer outre, mais je comprends les gens que ça rebute. Je conseillerai au final ce jeu mais uniquement dans sa version Xbox 360 qui semble avoir beaucoup moins de bug que la version Steam. Donc voilà, ne vous arrêtez surtout à la note que j’ai mis, car ce jeu (ou plutôt cette expérience) va bien au-delà d’une simple note sur 20.",1522956500,1522956500,True,1,0,0.513677835464477539,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Usually we get well-made games with good graphics. But they were like books with good covers but without a storyline. In this particular time we have a book with well-written story but with bad clumsy cover. Because the story here is really good. But the rest of the game...

Let's start with advantages: a lot of Twin Peaks references (the beggining; York is the copy of Agent Dale Cooper; coffee method of predicting; unusual characters like Sigourney with a bloody  pot (another Twin Peaks reference)); the plot containes couple of plot twists and thrill; features like  eating, sleep, shaving, suit changing, Phantom cigarettes (before they've been invented by Kojimba-san); well-develeped and memorable characters with their own charisma and jobes; good directing; soundtrack is good but poor; and easy achievements (I got them all).

Unfortunately, there are a lot of disadvanteges: really awfull optimization, graphics, shadows, animation (especially faces are the worst) and really bad FPS (considering that it's already 20!8, they haven't fixed them at all since 2013. I had to install Durante's fix but it didn't save me from f*ckin crashes every f*ckin 30 minutes); plot holes tied with Red coat Killer; AN ENORMOUS OPEN WORLD but it's been made without a solid reason; and we have to cross it with so called ""cars"" but trully it's an irons with wheels; quests with their own rules (for example, in particular part, in the evening while rain from 6 pm till 8 pm drive to Emily's house, take the quest, go to groccery store, buy the thing she needs, drive back and give it to her, but rain goes not othen and the store only opens at 8 am to 6 pm, u can't do the rest of her quests in the same part, so u have to have this thing before starting her quest BUT GAME CAN CHEAT AND NOT LET YOU TAKE THE FREAKIN QUEST OR CRASH WHILE DOING IT, AND YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH THIS F*CKING HELL AGAIN!); game is really long (if u do quests); major part of the quest and the rewards are strange; controls are bad, especially aim (you can aim with your mouse only on 30 degree vertically); zero replayability because if you play the first time game would impress you but the second would be bad, really bad; and zero difficulty.

So we have a very controversial game. Those who programmed it should play it themselves or be sticked on a low designed icepick. But it deserves a single walkthrough. Not quite othen appeares the game which combines detective, survival horror and Sims genres.

The final verdict is:
6,5 Thomas's biscuits/10

""Deadly Premonition - кривой порт предчуствую я""

Вот чаще всего мы встречаем игры сделаные красиво и качественно, но это по сути были красивые фантики без конфет. В этом случае получилось наоборот: очень вкусная конфета в помятой, грязной и плохой обёртке. Потому что история, которую нам здесь рассказывают получилось действительно очень годная. Но вот всё остальное...

Пройдусь по плюсам: немереное количество отсылок к Линчу с его Твин Пиксом (начало истории, Йорк вылитый агент Купер,  гадание по кофе и необычные персонажи, например Сигурни с её грёбаным горшком); сама история получилась на уровне: есть интрига, неожиданные повороты; малочисленые детали типа фантомных сигар до изобретения оных Коджимбой, нужде есть, спать, менять костюмы; графики поведения людей ну и запоминающиеся персонажи; есть неплохая режессура некоторых моментов; саундтрек хоть и не богат, но запоминается; очень лёгкие ачивки (выбил все).

Но, к сожалению, минусов вышло много: очень плохая графика, тени, анимация (в особенности лицевая), оптимизация на ПК, учитывая что на дворе уже 20!8 (Мало того что разработчики не исправили баги, мне пришлось ставить фикс от Durante, но не спасал от вылетов каждые мать их 30 минут!) и очень ужасный FPS; сюжет хоть и вышел хорошим, но сюжетные дыры, связаные с Убийцей в красном плаще, в нём просто неимоверные; НЕОПРАВДАНО огромный открытый мир; а перемещаемся мы по этому миру на совершенно убогих утюгах, которые здесь называют машинами; условия получения и выполнения квестов просто изуверские, например в определённой главе, во время дождя, вечером поедь домой к Эмили, возьми у неё квест на продукты, при этом у тебя должен находится с собой этот предмет, а дождь здесь довольно не часто встречаешь, если не спать, и к ней ты можешь попасть только между 18:00 и 20:00, ПРИЧЁМ ПОРОЙ ЭТИ САМЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ ХОТЬ И ВЫПОЛНЕНЫ, НО ИЗ-ЗА ТОГО ЧТО ИГРУ ДЕЛАЛИ КАКИЕ-ТО ШАКАЛЫ, КВЕСТ НЕ АКТИВИРУЕТСЯ, + МОЖЕТ НА ВНЕЗАПНОМ МОМЕНТЕ ИГРА КРАШНУТСЯ И ОПЯТЬ ПРОХОДИТЬ ЭТОТ ЕБУЧ ИЙ АД; продолжительность у игры прям супер длинная (если выполнять побочные квесты); сами квесты порой попадаются странные, а награда за них чаще всего ещё более странные; управление очень тугое, а при прицеливании ты можешь поднимать и опускать прицел только на 30 градусов; реиграбельность у игры никакая, потому что на первое прохождение тебе заходит, а при прохождении заново это просто кошмар длиною в жизнь; сложности вообще нет, просто НОЛЬ. 

В итоге мы имеем очень спорную игру. Тех, кто програмировал эту игру, надо на кол низкополигональный посадить. А так одного прохождения она стоит. Не часто появляются игры, скрещивающие детектив, выживание и симс.

А в данном случае - еще и кривой-косой технической стороны. Последняя проблема стала для меня самой главной и бесячей. И отнюдь не только для меня - нет ничего удивительного, что на эту игру здесь много отрицательных обзоров. Вспоминается идентичный случай с Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth - там тоже понаставили немало отрицательных оценок именно из-за скверной технической стороны игры. Но в том случае это было несколько менее оправданно - все же, пошаманив немного, вполне реально было запустить ""Зов Ктулху"" практически без проблем. В случае же со ""Смертельным предчувствием"" все заметно хуже, как это ни печально. Пройти игру без серьезных проблем и нередких вылетов удастся лишь в случае немалого везенья.

В геймплейном плане игра, как я уже сказал, довольно противоречива. 
С одной стороны, есть куча неоправданно затянутых и нудных моментов. К примеру, в игре есть одна (к счастью, лишь одна) миссия по преследованию на машине. Многим в принципе не по нраву такие миссии, но лично я обычно ничего не имею против, Но в этой игре это просто адские десять минут уныния! Худшее впечатление на меня произвел только неустранимый вылет после начала 9 главы - пришлось качать чужое сохранение. Город Гринвейл сделали неоправданно большого масштаба, в результате чего поездки туда-сюда еще дольше и нуднее, чем беготня от Термитника до Горнов в Мор.Утопии. И прибавьте к этому еще возможность вылета по дороге... Экшеновая часть с зомбями и поисками улик рано или поздно приедается - но это еще терпимо. Другое дело, что прицеливание в игре настолько через одно место, насколько это возможно. [spoiler]На последнем боссе это было особенно ощутимо.[/spoiler]
Но не так все плохо. Многие вещи очень приятно радуют. Например, есть редкая в играх фишка, когда у всех значимых персонажей есть свой распорядок дня, причем не в стиле ""пошел туда - вернулся обратно"", а куда более разнообразный. И диалоги с ними могут меняться в зависимости от их местонахождения. Такого я даже в Готике (где присутствует похожая штука) не встречал) Есть в игре также симулятор рыбалки, с разными видами червяков) Есть интересные (по большей части) побочные миссии - за некоторые из них можно получить очень полезные вещи, а некоторые дополняют основной сюжет.

Ну а сюжет является настоящей жемчужиной данного проекта. Особенно для такого любителя японских странных и запутанных историй, как я) Именно он является главной причиной того, чтобы поиграть в эту игру, несмотря на все препоны, описанные мной выше. Он по-настоящему проникает в душу и способен даже вызвать слезы. Контраст комедийных, мрачных, безумных, трагичных, ужасающих моментов, веьсма и весьма неожиданные сюжетные повороты - это производит поистине глубокое впечатление!

В общем, советую всем поиграть в эту игру и пройти ее до конца - пусть даже временами вам будет хотеться бросить это дело)",1521489149,1521489149,True,5,0,0.544712722301483154,2,False,False,False,False,,,

A young woman is found murdered in a small Washington town full of quirky individuals, so an FBI agent with a thing for coffee and the supernatural who has been following similar cases arrives to investigate alongside the local police force.

Jokes aside, this game was definitely inspired by Twin Peaks, but it does have its own thing going on.

Anything you've heard about this game? It's true.

Bad graphics even considering when it was released? Yes.
Music playing during cutscenes that doesn't necessarily fit what's going on? Yes.
Awkward shooting sections that make some parts frustrating to get through? Yes.
Random crashes and bugs? YES.

I actually encountered a potentially game-breaking bug when I needed to follow someone in a car, and he just drove in circles. No, I don't mean he was driving around the block over and over; he literally drove in a circle in the same spot. Thankfully it eventually fixed itself somehow.

So, why does my review have a big thumbs-up next to it?
Personally, I felt that the experience as a whole made all the frustrations that came with trying to get it to run properly worth it. It's really something you need to experience to believe. The bad graphics and questionable music? For me, they added to the B-movie feel of said experience.

Plus, that big thumbs-up comes with a big ""but"" after it (come on, Steam; let us write ""mixed"" reviews).

その気になれば一日ストーキング出来る。なんとも作り込みの細かい……その労力をテストに当ててくれても良かったんだがね。

次に、アトラクションの多さだ。
一日の始まりはコーヒーからという方も多いだろう。
なんと、今日一日をコーヒーで占うことが出来るんだ。
ソレだけじゃない。捜査中だというのに事件をほったらかして釣りをしたり、トレジャーハンティングに興じても良い。
本当にこれはミステリーものなのかと言うぐらい出来ることが多いのだ。

最後に、ヨークのセリフまわしがイチイチ気障ったらしくて好きだ。
俺はFBI！という部分を前面に押し出して認めるまで顔面にグリグリ擦り付けるような、FBIの人間を誤解させる一因となるようなキャラクターは妙な中毒性があり、ついつい真似をしてみたくなる。
真似をすると友達は減るだろうがね。ああ、そもそも私には友達が居なかったな。

ここまで読んでなおこのゲームを知りたいなら、買ってみるのもアリだ。

A FBI agent goes to the countryside to investigate the murder of a young lady (It ain't Agent Cooper, but it could be) then, he finds out that the case in question has more to do with his previous ones and even his personal life. 

The story is just beautiful. The construction of characters psyche and side-stories are wonderful and you just can feel the personality of each one of them (and there are many). If you like psychology, it's just for you.

Nothing like go out on a ride talking to your ""imaginary"" friend (who is, on the most part, you, the player) about punk rock and 80's b-movies, while you laugh at each reference (""There's a friend of mine whose hair turned out white from night to day 'cause of stress."").

Each plot-twist, each victim, each new discovery just makes you go deeper into the story, making the game grow inside of you.

This game is for you.

This port is in NO WAY worth the full price, you should wait until it goes on sale for 90% off (fairly often). You're going to have difficulty getting it to run for the first time so don't expect to be able to refund it... and it's going to crash often. I highly recommend getting one of the other versions instead.

EDIT: Just an FYI, here are the differences for the other versions, should you decide to pick it up elsewhere:

Xbox 360
-Stable driving
-No crashes
-Some weird tank control sections for no reason

PS3 Director's Cut
-Stable driving
-No crashes
-Extra cutscenes

Origins Switch version
-Minor crashes
-Fastest driving, can be a little wacky, but I enjoy this version's driving the most
-Fastest version to speedrun (WR is a literal 40 mins faster)

PC Port
-Needs DPfix by Durante to play
-Crashes!
-Crash during Chapter 9, most people need to skip this cutscene and/or smoke before this chapter to progress
-Extra cutscenes
-Driving is wacky, as driving speed is tied to FPS. Anything over 60 FPS will make your driving unbearable.",1518298516,1613043314,True,16,3,0.672958135604858398,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a console game thrown onto the PC, which isn't a bad thing but it surely shows as the game barely wants to run half the time. 

At the hospital, after killing zombies: *crash*
Runs it in compatibility mode: seems fine.
Gets to the mill: *crash*
Downloads the patch: launcher no longer works. So, because of this, the resolution wouldn't change and I had to use Borderless Gaming just to get fullscreen. Which made the game look even worse.
Uses map: the background changes to the key and crashes after a bit of driving.

Sad thing is, I like the game despite the flaws but these crashes are irritating. Don't buy it unless you can get it on sale or fix the crashes. Fixing the crashing takes a shitload of time that could be used for enjoying this damn game.

Also, another compliant I have is the fact York runs like a fucking snail/doesn't run [spoiler] in the chase scene with the Red Raincoat Killer [/spoiler] despite me hammering down on the A and D buttons like they are drums. 

If anyone can offer suggestions to fix my crashes, that would be lovely but my review still stands. They should have this crap sorted out if the PC port was released in 2013! 

Besides all the frusturation, the story is meh, York is a goofball, and everything seems too silly to be a horror game but I like it, nonetheless.

I give this game a recommended score because for the most part I absoulutely loved this game. The first half or hell 3 quarters of this game are great, its slow paced & mysterious and filled with fantastic characters, I mean York alone may be one of my favourite video game protagonists of all time after playing this game. My favourite aspect of this game was living the day to day life of an FBI agent in a small country town tracking down a murderer, I'm aware this comparison is made alot (and rightly so) but it really felt like the Twin Peaks experience from the view of Dale Cooper, except we got to see Coopers day to day life. 

The investigative aspect of this game, where you start your day off in the hotel with a coffee and breakfast, where you drive your car into Greenvale following up on leads and in the down time stop by the sheriffs station for lunch or hitting up possible suspects was fantastic, and I loved every minute of it. But to me this game has a fatal flaw. Towards the end Deadly Premontion became too much of a videogame.

By this I mean that on the approach towards the climax everything in this game became so, dumbed-down? You go from a slow detective mystery to fighting a huge ripped dude throwing giant axes at you, and are constantly bombarded by survival horror sections where you fight souls of the damned (or something akin to that). I mean, it just feels like such a different experience and personally, I dont enjoy it.

So now I will reveal the shocking truth, I havent finished this game, honestly because I couldnt bring myself to do it. I just found the action sequences so uninteresting, the little snippets of dialogue and story we get inbetween are fantastic as they are throughout the whole game but at this stage I honestly cannot bring myself to complete the game. Perhaps I will come back to it.

On another note, feel free to correct me on this all you Deadly P fans but I feel as if all the action and especially the survival horror aspects are more a problem of the studio as opposed to Swery (developer of the game), perhaps it was assumed that people wouldnt want a slow paced detective game and action scenes were shoe-horned into the production. To further elaborate on this it is for this reason that I am looking foward to Swerys next title The Good Life. From what we've seen it seems to play more like the slow paced detective mystery I love so much and perhaps without the studio pressure Swery will be able to follow his vision more clearly.

But who am I to say what Swerys vision is, on my final note I would like to say I still recomend this game even though this review largely focuses on what I dont like. I would buy the game even if I knew what happens towards the end because the slow-paced mystery experience early game is fantastic and the writing too is on the same level. As I've said York is a great character and Greenvale is charming and simultaneously dark and uncanny. Although alot of people compare this game to Twin Peaks, I really feel as if Deadly Premonition stands as its own product. Get this game but just understand what you may be getting yourself into if you dont like more action focused games (like me).

[b]The Good[/b]

[b]Interesting Characters[/b]: The game presents a host of unique characters, each with their distinctive personalities, unique/quirky traits and hints about their mysterious pasts. The people of Greenvale truly lend an appealing aura of intrigue to the game.

[b]Great Storyline[/b]: The story is the true gem of DP. The plot unfolds gradually, keeping you engaged until the very end. No additional comments needed. The story of the game speaks for itself.

[b]Exploration and Side Quests[/b]: The game offers a semi-open world that you can explore alongside main quests. Some areas are only accessible after completing certain chapters, offering a sense of progression. The side quests offer insights into the lives of Greenvale's citizens and reward you with new items/cards. Some of the side quests may seem unrealistic or far-fetched, but their quirky nature adds an element of humor, making them enjoyable regardless of how ridiculous or absurd they are.

[b]The Bad[/b]

[b]Combat System[/b]: Unfortunately, the combat system of DP detracts from its overall quality. The Silent Hill-inspired design feels tedious, repetitive, and somewhat superfluous to the main storyline. A portion of the combat interactions, which requires correct key presses, is somewhat enjoyable. But these instances comprise a small fraction of the total combat experience. To me, the combat feels more like a distraction than a complimentary element except for boss fights.

[b]Frame Rate Issues[/b]: DP is infamous for its low frame rate. I spent over two hours trying to improve the frame rate from 15 to 60 FPS, yet it seemed stuck at around 20 FPS. Even if I gradually got accustomed to the sluggish frame rate, it is worthy to point out, even if its obvious, that many players will identify it as a major issue. 

Regardless of the frame rate issues, the game managed to captivate and motivate me to complete the game 100%, leading me to rate it [b]4/5[/b].

While the game's technical faults are almost impossible to ignore for most systems, they somehow contribute to a unique gaming experience, at least for me. DP combines a thrilling story and interesting characters with its performance issues to create a unique experience that most people have not experienced before. Joking asides, the performance issues might be the only bad issue that the game has.",1512328579,1709762206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Знакомясь с жителями, у каждого из которых свои, вполне обыденные, проблемы и погружаясь в сонную атмосферу этого спокойного города начинаешь забывать, что ты играешь в хоррор. И тем сильнее эффект очередного ""хоррорного"" момента, который разбивает тихую повседневность и заставляет ощутить напряжение и страх, поверив в происходящее на экране. Все это великолепие сопровождается одним из лучших саундтреков за всю историю игроиндустрии, который усиливает впечатление от игры.

One of the weirdest games i've played so far. Deadly Premonition is an action adventure with mysterious/weird characters and an interesting story about the ""Red Seed Killers"".

It's touched by series like ""Twin Peaks"".

You are investigating about the murders, talking to people, doing (optional Sidequests) and driving through the town (which has no useful map!) mostly. That's the ""fun"" and interesting part about the game.
The other, not so ""fun"" part: From time to time you have to fight against zombie-like enemies. The controls are... ""not good"". You'll get used to it, but it's something worth mentioning. Also the ""Quick Time Events"" can be a pain the a**.
Both, the ""gun gameplay"" and the QTE's are feeling forced in the game. I believe, i read an article where the developer mentioned, they planed the game without this, but the Publisher wanted them to be in, because of the Call of Duty-trend.

Also the graphics are very outdatet. It looks and feels technically like an old PS2-Game.
I only can recommend this game to gamers, who like ""weird and trashy"" games with a bigger focus on the Story than the gameplay. You also should be able to bear the technical problems the game has.

The gameplay, the graphics, and almost every single facet of this game is so poorly done to the point where every frame of this game is questionable. And yet, this game is one of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences I have ever had in the medium of video games. I sit alone in my bed some nights desperately searching for the answer of ""Why did I have so much damn fun with this game, and why am I spending $30 on this awful game I already beat in 2010?"". I can never truly come up with a definitive answer. 

The gameplay is awful. There is no other way to put it. The gameplay consists of the third-person, survival horror-action gameplay popurized and prototyped by the fantastic Resident Evil 4. The gunplay of this game is anything but fantastic though. The aiming is awful and sluggish, enemies are bullet sponges, and the boss fights are devoid of fun. 

However, the gameplay is kind of serviceable outside of the action aspects. The game is an open-world (not exactly world, more like small town? open-hamlet?) game. There are plenty of side missions to keep you busy for up to 20+ hours. However, you may have guessed these side missions are some of the most menial and uninspired tasks in any video game ever. You also have a vehicle to get you from one objective to the next, and boy oh boy... You will learn to dread the cars in this game. Trying to tame these cars is like holding a rabid dog on a molasses soaked leash. In other words, Forza has nothing on this game.

Despite all these gripes with the gameplay, I enjoyed playing this game. The menial tasks were fun in a mindless way. The gunplay was truly awful, yet I found myself having fun with it near the end. And the driving? Well, that was just bad.

Furthermore, the graphics are just atrocious. I remember playing this back in 2010 and being absolutely floored. I could not believe video games could look this awful in 2010. The graphics were decent for a game released in the middle years of the PS2's life span. The graphics in this game truly shock the senses, and yet, I find something charming about them. When the main character makes his awkward, constipated grin, the game seemingly pauses on this face for a second, so the player can soak the glory all up. 

What exactly redeems this game? I suppose it is the humor of it all. The story is a cobbled, convoluted mess of tropes, yet there is something undeniably interesting to it. The essential premise is you play as an FBI detective exploring a murder mystery in a small town. Along the way, you meet a wide assortment of characters. The characters are so oddball and off-their-rocker to the point of being instantly memorable. The crux of the humor comes from the interaction with these characters, where the gameplay, plot, and graphics collide into a beautiful mess. The ""F.K. in the Coffee"" scene succintly sums up this unholy union in one absolutely, show-stoppingly funny scene. 

This game truly revels in its absurdity. Deadly Premonition is not a good game by any means. The plot has more holes than a nice wheel of swiss cheese, the graphics are indescribably bad, and the gameplay is appalling. Yet, those three facets were truly memorable, and even outright hilarous. Deadly Premonition is quite possibly the first ""so bad, it's good"" video game. There are many that would claim that title; Earth Defense Force is one that comes to mind. Yet, even that game is pretty decent on a pure gameplay standpoint. Deadly Premonition is a game that should not work, but it does in some kind of magical way. You may not like this game, but you will remember it

Gameplay is weird and probably not great, but it doesn't get on your way, it just gets really easy. Some buggy animations on some kind of QTE but nothing that impede my progression.

This game is flawed, mostly in technical aspects which is a real shame, but if you can make it launch, even with the issues i encountered you have a game with some really interesting storytelling, a engaging story with interesting characters. This game is a combo of weird, is that B movie that is great but you can still tell it is a B movie.

I recommend giving it a try, play some hours, at first it may seem that is going nowhere, but beleive me, you soon will want to know who is the killer, who is the raincoat killer and what the hell is wrong with this town.

Inoltre ha molte citazioni e ""parodie"" di altri giochi Horror (come ad esempio una delle primissime quest in cui bisogna cercare un chiave nella stazione di polizia con chiavi diverse in ogni dove) ma anche idee originali.

1) story - check
2) music - check
3) gameplay - check

As for the smaller things;
-characters - They are quirky and memorable 
-bugs/preformance - Not the best but not bad
-Dev/Pub - Not EA or Ubisoft - check

Usually when I find something bad, I just go through it for the laughs: this is not one of those bad-but-f#cking-hilarious games. Not a piece of sh#t, just a whole sh#t. Doesn't mean that it doesn't have any redeeming qualities, but that the negatives far outweight the positives, one to ten. As I usually do I'm gonna start with the negative stuff, and I feel like I've got plenty to talk about.

First and foremost, this is a horrible port. Now, I'm pretty sure there are fan-made fixes and all of that bollocks but just bother to read the title. ""The Director's Cut"", right? Director's Cut my #ss, this is broken as all hell. If you release a game with that in the title, it has to mean it's the definitive edition, however what you get is a lazily put together port that becomes a nightmare. This ain't like the Dark Souls 1 port to PC (at least not the Games For Windows Live one), mainly because Dark Souls 1 was a good game beyond the sh#t quality port that was eventually somewhat fixed. Keyboard controls suck, the fps rarely either stay consistent or beyond 18, can't lower the sound of cutscenes (which might blast your ears off), there's only one bad resolution available by default, it even dares to have quick time events on scenes that barely run at all. The game is a technical mess.

Second is the sound department. This game has one of the weirdest and most awkward voice acting I've heard in a looooong time. They don't feel at all like they're in the same conversation, or even living in the same damn universe. The main character has to be the biggest example, as he has some of the most unnatural reactions to things while also casually talking to what probably is his imaginary friend. And I'm still totally convinced that the zombies scream ""Welcome to die"" when killed, and for some reasons the squirrels sound like monkeys, something that had me confused for a while.

Some of the animations also kinda bugged me out the completely wrong way, for one specific reason: they don't seem consistent. You have the main character who has good facial animations (but stupidly creepy and unnatural smiles), then you have characters that neither move their mouths, move their eyes or even blink during conversations. They look like motherf#cking Garry's Mod ragdolls, for f#ck sake.

Also, I feel obligated to comment on how so many elements from Resident Evil are in here, feels like they went wild with ""taking inspiration"" and just copied elements as they went on. I'm honest, the first 20 or so minutes of the game feel like a poorly done Resident Evil 4 clone.

Last thing is the story, however as you might remember, I haven't complete it. So I'll just talk about the story as far as I got: It was a clusterf#ck of awkward crap that didn't make any sense with a weird mix between comically upbeat moments and mediocre to decent horror elements. It was way too hard to take seriously, specially when the cutscenes are so loud I decided to just skip them entirely for the safety of my ears and I don't even think that would've helped much when the characters themselves act in such unnatural and robotic ways, as if they're not even in the same game.

Now, does the game have good things? Yeah, plenty.

First of all, the atmosphere of the game was quite well done. The forest at the beginning? Quite well done. Sure the sh#t dialogue kinda took me out of the moment, but I do see that good effort was put on it. The town itself was also alright, way more open that I would've expected.

The game also mixes both a horror-like story with an open-world setup, which is... Creative, actually. I feel like it could've made the game amazing if it wasn't made by actual [strike]squirrels[/strike] monkeys. Sure I didn't get a look at it for too long but I do see that there was an effort to make the town your hub, to call it something meaningful, where you would be between the main story missions. Kind of a shame that many horror games just go the linear-dull way.

The story itself is actually alright. I bothered to look it up in wikies and shit, and it ain't too bad, however the sh#tty dialogue, the bugs and the poor state of this port will give you the wrong idea. I'll probably never touch this game ever again, but the story was at least enjoyable to read (specially as it didn't have those horribly acted voices behind it).

Lastly, the car and other minigames the game has are kinda fun. I sure as f#ck wasn't expecting the game to have a God-damn fishing minigame, but hey. It is confusing though that the game puts those dumb medals that work as currency behind things to break but other times it randomly takes money away from you for ""vandalism"". Dude, you either reward me for driving like a jack#ss or you don't, there's no gray area.

In the end, do I recommend this game? Ultimately, yes. But not on PC. No way, not here. I don't care if there's mod that fix it, the devs don't deserve to get paid for such a poorly put together port that seems like it's on the verge of crashing your whole computer at any moment. Instead, try to play it in any other platform the game came out. And maybe play it on it's original dub with subtitles instead of hearing the sh#t english voices, holy mother of f#ck they suck nuclear #ss.

TL;DR Edition: The f#ck did I just play. This is a really bad port of a game with some of the worst dubs I've had the displeasure of hearing. However, I think the game itself is average, so playing it on a platform where the port ain't a horrible piece of crap might actually be worth it. On PC though? Just no.

Also, I kinda made a video about my first impressions of the game. You're free to watch it if you feel like it, though be aware that it might spoil parts of the first act of the game.

Представляет собой приключение в условно открытом мире, но с линейным сюжетом.
Знающие проведут параллели между игрой и сериалом ""Twin Peaks"". Оттуда частично позаимствованы атмосфера, некоторые персонажи (включая главного героя) и локации.
Самое интересное, пожалуй, происходит между основными миссиями, ты можешь заниматься исследованием мира, знакомиться с персонажами, играть в мини-игры и решать второстепенные квесты.
В игре идет свое время, есть смена погоды. На этом и сюжетных поворотах выстроена симуляция жизни города: в заданные промежутки времени NPC работают, спят, гуляют, перемещаются из одной точки в другую (в дождь, например, могут сидеть дома).
По городу имеет смысл перемещаться не пешком, а на машине. У автомобилей есть показатели прочности и полноты бака.
Сторонние мини игры вредят атмосфере. Рыбалка еще более-менее, но гонка на машине - бред.
Город небольшой, со всеми ключевыми фигурами знакомишься в ходе основного квеста. Каждый персонаж по своему интересен, со своими тараканами в голове (например, главный герой постоянно размышляет в слух, обращаясь к некоему Заку, создается эффект ""ломки четвертой стены"").
Игроку нужно следить за показателями здоровья, сердцебиением, уровнями усталости и голода, внешним видом. Усталость компенсируется сном и энергетиками, голод - едой, внешний вид - бритьем (щетина растет) и сменой костюмов, здоровье - аптечками. Сердцебиение - ненужный параметр, за которым можно не следить (недоработка геймдизайна).
В игре есть торговля (только покупка), а следовательно - у героя есть деньги. Тратить их нужно в магазинах, ресторанах, на бензозаправке, можно даже покупать автомобили.
Игровая музыка хороша, после прохождения игры можно слушать отдельно в главном меню.
Сюжет по началу действительно интригует, показанная чернуха в духе ""Silent Hill"" наводит на мысли о метафоре, что это отображение мыслительного процесса главного героя.
Игра необычна и интересна, но содержит множество критических недостатков, которые не позволяют ее рекомендовать.
Множество технических проблем (вылеты, просадка FPS, пропажа текстур), и это при общих низких уровнях графики и физики!
Многие игровые механики выглядят инородно, в целом все игровые аспекты некачественно реализованы. Управление в лучших традициях японского игропрома (ужасное), сражения скучны и вызывают раздражение как неизбежное зло. Но самое неприятное - это постепенный слив сюжета! Сюрреалистичный мистический детектив скатывается в непотребство, а логика происходящего теряется окончательно (что-то можно оправдать безумием конкретных персонажей, но не может быть СТОЛЬКО двинутых в одном месте)!
[spoiler]Шериф получил в детстве психологическую травму, хочет бессмертия, страдает от неразделенной любви. Кейсен - военный (ученый?) преследует какие-то свои непонятные цели по выращиванию семян, при этом он перестал быть человеком (даже если отбросить его превращение в монстра (может метафора?), то его фигура на фотографии 50-летней давности намекает, что он не обычный человек). Но остальные персонажи? Томас и жертвы шерифа, почему они позволяли делать с собою такое? Почему отец героя застрелился (даже если он знал о бессмертии Кейсена, получается, что он осмысленно оставил своего сына сиротой)?[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Когда Кейсен распылил газ, жители города ""обратились"". Связано ли это с тенями, с которыми герой сражается на протяжении игры? Если потусторонний мир - метафора, то почему в эпизоде Эмили она сражается с тенями? Неужели потому, что таким себе представляет ее похождения главный герой?[/spoiler]
Сражения с боссами сначала вызывает кривую улыбку от своего качества, а потом скрежет зубов (долго и скучно). Вероятно это можно для себя оправдать тем, что игра - рассказ деда-маразматика, который все выдумал как смог.

Ein Mord. Die schöne Anna wurde in ihrem Heimatort Greenvale an einem Baum gekreuzigt. Ihr Bauch wurde aufgeschlitzt. Wir sind Francis York Morgan, ein FBI-Agent, der in diesem mysteriösen Mordfall zu ermitteln hat. Offenbar handelt es sich um einen äußerst brutalen Serienkiller. Im Laufe unserer Ermittlungen treffen wir auf Übersinnliches, Parallelwelten, Zombies, aber isr das alles wahr oder nur ein Hirngespinst.

""Deadly Premonition"" ist ein extrem schwieriger Fall, ein Vertreter von himmelhochjauchzend und zu Tode betrübt, von grandios und grottig. Und das meist gleichzeitig.

Das Game ist ganz eindeuting angelehnt an David Lynch ""Twin Peaks"", wobei angelehnt noch freundlich formuliert ist. ""Deadly Premonition"" wirkt oft wie eine Indie B-Movie Version des großen Vorbildes. Am ehesten vergleichen läßt sich das Game vielleicht mit japanischen Horrofilmen, die sich gerne mal aus allen Genres bedienen, gleichzeitig erschreckend und ihre eigene Parodie sein können und sich gerne in irgendeine Absurdität verbeißend.

Im Gameplay laufen oder fahren wir durch das Städtchen und die Umgegend sprechen mit Leuten, suchen Schlüssel und andere Dinge, sehen uns massig viele Cutscenes an und müssen auch immer wieder kämpfen. Dabei latschen wir meist durch Schlauchlevel und schießen oder schlagen auf dumpfe Zombies. Auch Bossfights sind am Start. 

Das Problem dabei: das Gameplay ist unfaßbar furchtbar, die Kontrollierbarkeit grottig. Im Kampf schwimmen wir und unser Fadenkreuz ebenso wie unsere Karre auf der trockenen Straße. Auch wenn die Kontrollen in der Directors Edition verbessert wurden, bleiben sie doch so ziemlich die übelsten der Spielegeschichte. Aber immerhin kann man auch fischen gehen.

Das Personal des Games ist absurd abstrus. So treffen wir zum Beispiel einen Mann im Rollstuhl mit Gasmaske dessen Pfleger nur in Reimen spricht. Die Charakterauswahl führt zu Konversationen, die stets zwischen Parodie und Horror changieren, uns irritieren und zum Lachen bringen. Wir selber sind anscheinend auch nicht ganz chappi, denn wir sprechen immer mit einem Mann in unserem Kopf.

Darauf aufbauend ist die Story gleichzeitig eine der schlechtesten, plattesten, dümmsten aller Zeiten, aber auch eine der überraschendsten. Das liegt daran, daß immer wenn man meint, die Spur verstanden zu haben, zu wissen, in welchem Genre und in welchem Erzählstrang wir uns befinden, das Spiel sich komplett dreht, einen anderen Ton anschlägt oder die Story mal eben wendet. 

Und in dem Ganzen kriegen wir (sehr konsolig) Geld fürs Rasieren oder müssen in der Gegend schwebende Orden aufsammeln. 

Wer es noch nicht gemerkt hat: ""Deadly Premonition"" ist Trash. Totaler Trash. Bester Trash. Trash, der sich an nichts hält auch wenn er vordergründig eine 08/15-FBI Mystery Story erzählt. Grandios cineastische Cutscenes stehen neben technisch amateurhaftem Gameplay. 

Überhaupt ist der technische Zustand trotz Überarbeitung immer noch grottig. Die Grafik ist so schwammig, daß sie den ganzen Bodensee aufsaugen könnte, Sounds spielen nicht oder falsch ab, die Animationen sind absurd, Glitches und Abstürze sind an der Tagesordnung. Und das Alles bei Frameraten, die zu einem einzigen Ruckelfest führen.

Wenn man denn das Spiel überhaupt zum Laufen bringt. Dafür muß man nämlich in der .exe was ändern (steht in den Community-Guides). Bei mir lief es erst gar nicht, dann - vor einigen Monaten - lief es eine Zeit lang recht stabil, im Moment stürzt es wieder nach dem Intro ab und ist unspielbar, trotz aller Fixes, die ich nach den Guides gemacht habe.

I do tego jeszcze ten Director's Cut w tytule.... to  już wręcz arogancka obelga dla graczy. To ma być poprawiona wersja reżyserska? Ta gra crashuje się już na samym starcie, a jak już uda  się jakimś cudem Wam to naprawić, to potem pojawiają się kolejne bugi wywalające grę do pulpitu. Brzydka, zepsuta, zabugowana do absurdu.... Taka jest Deadly Premonition i nie ocali jej fakt, że mnawiązuje do klimatu kultowego Silent Hilla...

Plusy: 

+ fajny klimat a la Silent Hill połączony z Twin Peaks
+ dość zróżnicowana muzyka budująca klimat 
+ fajna biedronka w introdukcji do gry ;)

Minusy: 

- obrzydliwa grafika (ciekawe jak wyglądała pierwsza wersja tej gry) 
- gra niegrywalna (crashuje, wywala błędy i wyrzuca do pulpitu)
- zepsuta implementacja PhysX (po cholerę w ogóle PhysX grze z tak prymitywną grafiką???)
- wyjątkowo koszmarna optymalizacja i okropna konwersja z konsoli
- miliony, naprawdę miliony bugów i crashy
- dość przeciętne intro

Komu polecam? / Komu odradzam?

+ polecam fanom klimatów Silent Hill i Twin Peaks, którzy są gotowi walczyć z bugami 
- odradzam graczom, którzy na poważnie traktują słowa Director's Cut

Rada 1: 

Zamiast męczyć się z Deadly Premonition lepiej zainstalować sobie inne stare, dobre japońskie hity z PS2 czyli Silent Hilla lub Resident Evil.

Rada 2:

Do deweloperów - jak już robicie Director's Cut jakiejś gry, to róbcie to porządnie. Jakoś jeszcze starszy Resident Evil HD Remaster można było wykonać na wysokim poziomie i jest naprawdę znakomicie dopracowany.

Damals war mein Eindruck, eines der schlechtesten Spiele zu spielen, das sich selbst als ""award-winning sensation"" beschreibt.

Die Grafik ist einer Vorzeit des 3D-Spielens entflohen, die Animation schlicht bis schlecht, die Steuerung ist abgründig, die Geschichte, wohl eine Twin-Peaks-Variante, blieb unverständlich.

    放假熬了两天通了这个游戏，只做了主线，总计20h。游戏虽然画质糟糕，但是却有谜一样的醍醐味，让人欲罢不能，于是赶快写篇总结回味一下，删掉游戏远离欲望，阿弥陀佛。。。

[b]·  游戏版本[/b]
    游戏最早的版本叫做《Rainy Woods》，是Access Games在2007 年在东京电玩展揭露的项目，原预定于08年发售。后因游戏内容和知名电视剧《Twin Peaks》的高度雷同以及主角肖像酷似明星等侵权问题没有通过欧洲方面的审核，整个项目在08年10月份被冻结。修改了一些主角的设定（确切的来讲，只修改了约克和警长的设定）之后 ，09年项目重启，更名为《Deadly Premonition》，在日发行版本更名为《Reed Seed Profile》

有人统计过《Deadly Premonition》和《Twin Peaks》的相似点，如下：
https://archive.fo/tLmu1
[i]TP VS DP - Planet Redwood[/i]
你会发现，不只是游戏的一些设计元素，整个游戏本身从剧本、演员，乃至台词、歌曲全部从《Twin Peaks》“借鉴”了一遍，整个就是一大卫·林奇大杂烩，甚至整改后的人设女主仍然长着一张Naomi Watts的脸（而这个女主角甚至还叫Emily Watts）。
这是何等的同人精神！也不难想象这个作品为什么会大暴死。

[b]·  剧情背景[/b]
    主角York，FBI特派员，负责到小镇GreenVale调查一起离奇杀人事件，各种证据表明，这和各地发生的一系列“红色种子”杀人事件有着密切的关联...
//没错，就是《Twin Peaks》的翻版

此外有一些比较有趣的元素，比如主角会从咖啡里获取破案的灵感，雨衣杀手传说一类的新奇元素这个就需要玩家自己体会了。

[b]·  游戏核心系统[/b]
    对于这么一个大型同人游戏，同样介于IGN2.0的超低评分，我对它的期望更多在于剧情方面
出乎意料地，游戏的核心玩法却不是简单的过剧情 //虽然对我来说是这样

主线往往有固定的时间，其他的时间自由支配，这意味着你需要花式kill time，而杀时间的方式包括但不限于：
飙车
饭馆
赌博
支线
钓鱼(？)
你确定这是一个恐怖游戏？为什么给我一种“persona 345, go go happy life”的感觉？？？
在飙车的路上听zach//Emily//George闲聊，你确实能体会到细节之美。

生活元素的引入也是这部作品比《Silent Hill》优异的一点，寂静岭系列创造的氛围就是封闭封闭再封闭，最后压抑到人根本不想玩了。

此外游戏会出现Licker一类的怪物，同样还有喜闻乐见的BOSS战，可见游戏的野心是比较大的，或者至少制作组在游戏的可玩性上确实下了一番心血，只是成果不是很令人满意，so sad!这也是游戏评价比较两极的原因，它确实想做些什么改变，只是各方面都差强人意。


[b]·  推荐指数[/b]
    如何推荐这个游戏？

    我认为这个游戏适合对设计和艺术有着特殊品味的玩家。上面已经说过，游戏核心来源于大卫·林奇独特的设计美学和神秘主义。刨除了游戏背后的设计元素以及讽刺寓意，整个游戏剧情只是一个单纯的刑侦案件，因此推荐这个游戏给热爱cult精神的广大观影群众。

游戏剧本存在着割裂的现象，你能明显得感受到前三章和后四章在份量和质量上的不一样，所有新奇的要素基本都在前三章展现出来了，后四章只是单纯的叙述元素叠加。在与harry会谈之后整个剧情的走向就十分明朗了，之前的神秘气质也就淡然无存了。剧情上也存在着人物性格转变过大的问题，黑化的完全没有理由，其实就是人物塑造崩溃。这也是整个游戏我只能给3星的原因，一方面涉及到侵权问题，此外游戏性以及剧情完善程度都是减分项。

    抛开大卫·林奇，游戏中独特的创意在于zach和york之间的关系，这也是整部戏的抒情纽带，是剧情上指的称赞的一点。

总体上来讲，我是推荐这款游戏的，因为这款游戏足够cult，操作也还可以，价格方面尤其是进包或者特价的时候平均也就几块钱，游戏本身的素质可远超这个价格。

[b]·  卡关//崩溃建议[/b]
    IGN评价2.0的游戏版本是最初发行的xbox版本，造成低分的原因就是因为各种bug。现在steam上的导演剪辑版已经修复大量bug，游戏崩溃问题基本得到了解决。

    我在游戏中一共遇到一次崩溃，相比很多人抱怨的问题，可以说是非常smooth了。你要知道SWERY的另一部作品D4我根本连游戏都进不去，搁置了半年左右才进去的游戏。。。

    遇到崩溃的问题，请参考社区详细的解决方案：
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=727264321

    同样推荐社区各章存档，以防意外crush：
https://steamcommunity.com/app/247660/discussions/0/535151589909485793/
//尽量选用各章对应的存档，使用回看章节选项无法存档

    另外游戏中请关闭中文输入法，很明显游戏中在get的时候没做长度检查，会导致缓冲区溢出崩溃。

[b]·  题外话——同人与版权？[/b]
    这个话题，希望创作者们予以重视。某些日本AVG类游戏根本就是版权的重灾区，包括但不限于：
打越刚太郎“借鉴”森博嗣《そして二人だけになった》核心诡计
innocent grey全篇“借鉴”京极堂系列
etc
etc
我这里倒不是主要在说“借鉴”之于版权如何如何，而是部分创作者根本不思进取。没错，说的就是你打越刚太郎，20年前靠着森博嗣的核心诡计当上了知名制作人，20年间写的东西竟然都是同样的核心诡计，垃圾就是垃圾，希望粉丝们少些跪舔。

想想看，森博嗣40岁才出道在推理圈本身就受到鄙视，结果游戏圈有个人靠着森博嗣的创意连续写了20年毫无营养的作品却备受推崇了？所以说用鄙视链的眼光来看待问题还是有一定好处的。

至于innocent grey靠着对京极堂系列的“借鉴”一度成为GAL业界翘楚，版权税肯定一分没付过，只能说社会社会。无论杉菜水姬你再怎么喜欢昭和时代，也不能二话不说就把别人的作品拿过来“借鉴”一番对不对？这种行为说实话非常令人厌恶，明明是别人的创意，却拿来当成自己的，还靠着这个混了个知名制作人的头衔，真是非常恶心！
“我理解你了，你肯定也理解我了”这种思维逻辑是行不通的，it just doesn't work，O.K.？

回到这个游戏本身，SWERY的这部作品毫无疑问大量引用了大卫·林奇影视作品中的知名元素，这也是他能靠这部作品当上知名制作人的原因。我们依据事实讨论，他之前的作品确实没有什么值得称道的地方，让广大玩家认识他的，靠的还是这部Lynchian元素作品。

本作毫无疑问是个大型同人，是在大卫·林奇原有影视素材上进行的二次创作，而且没付任何版权税，这也是大暴死的原因——发行商拒绝接手，你说同人谁懂啊，欧美又没这种东西，老老实实付版权税啊！但SWERY的优点是他的作品确实是在不断进步的。D4和the good life就彻底摆脱了大卫·林奇的影子，也证明确实SWERY形成了他自己独特的创作风格，不过这两作都没能做成完整的作品，在此表示遗憾。

Deadly Premonition
The PC port was bad and buggy. The graphics looks like they were from a launch title on the PS2. The cutscenes were long and way too drawn out.

Since the cons outweigh the pros, this is a non-recommendation. Let's look at the bright side first:

PROS
+ The main character, Special Agent Francis ""York"" Morgan, is really cool and well voiced. He's quirky in a good way and remains collected in the face of danger. And he's a film buff and likes punk rock to boot _ I got a little emotional when he tells us that he saw the Ramones play at the CBGB!
+ Makes references to ""Twin Peaks"", ""Psycho"", ""Don't Look Now!"" and other great stuff. 
+ Xbox 360 controller worked fine.
+ Not short. My playthrough lasted almost 42 hours, with 65% of the achievements. 
+ Emily is beautiful. The only beautiful thing in the game. 

CONS
- Gameplay is atrocious. Combat, driving, QTEs, minigames, everything sucks.  
- The map is abismal. And you'll spend a lot of the time looking at it, trying to figure it out. 
- Sidequests are easily missable. You can replay game chapters afterwards, but who would want to do that?
- Soundtrack is bad in its majority. And it can be very repetitive. 
- Normally I don't care much about graphics, but these are hideous. Animations are also terrible.
- Story makes very little sense. 
- Only one difficulty setting: very easy. 
- Confusing boss fights.",1506042701,1619719544,False,5,0,0.560633659362792969,1,False,False,False,False,,,

What does the game have (speaking positively)?  It's got a great horror/murder mystery storyline with 3-dimensional characters.  If you're a gamer who loves good stories, a fan of crime drama/murder mysteries, and/or you enjoy the more psychological, atmospheric horror of games like Silent Hill, then you're in the right place.  If you liked David Lynch's short TV series, ""Twin Peaks,"" then you'll probably like this game, altough there are some fans of Twin Peaks who felt like this game was ripping it off and didn't appreciate that (personally, I found it to be more along the lines of a loving tribute to Twin Peaks, however, I'll admit that, with all the similarities, I can understand where those that called it a rip-off were coming from).

That said, what is the game lacking?  For the most part, I'd say the game is weak in it's main gameplay mechanics, but I didn't find it to be TERRIBLE.  It's a fairly simple 3rd-person action/shooter style game that implements elements of realism (eating when you are hungry, sleeping when you've been up for a certain amount of time, ect.).  The control scheme is somewhat clunky and not as polished as it should be, but once you get used to it, it doesn't take too much away from the overall experience.  

Gameplay isn't all a big negative either - there was a pretty big positive element having nothing to do with the main gameplay mechanics: the game's open-world with lots of optional sidequests.  Some people don't like it as much, but I had tremendous fun collecting weapons, cash, and other helpful items for the main game by doing the errands, jobs, and other plentiful optional tasks that are available to you throughout the game.  If you're a sidequest lover (especially of the open-world/sandbox variety), then getting enjoyment from playing the game shouldn't be a problem for you as you are enjoying the storyline (and it makes for lots of extra gameplay hours, making the game feel more like it earned your money).

Overall, I loved this game, but I will say this: if you're not easily gripped by a game's storyline and/or you absolutely NEED a 3rd-person action/adventure/sandbox game to have well-honed controls and an intuitive, unique style of gameplay that stays fresh and exciting at every turn, then you might want to look elsewhere.

According to this quote taken directly from the game itself, Deadly Premonition probably shouldn't exist either. The graphics are horrible, the sounds are cheap, the controls are clunky and you'll encounter lots of crashes and freezes along the way... yet it still manages to be one of my favourite games of all time!

So I'd rather say ""If you really, truly love something, you'll stick with it - no matter what!""

Plot
FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone does that!) is sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate a murder case.
It doesn't take long until strange things start to happen and more people are getting killed. Who or what is responsible and who is ""Zach"" York keeps talking to? An imaginary friend? You, the player?
If you've ever watched Twin Peaks, you'll feel right at home with lots of similarities, especially a huge number of eccentric characters.

Graphics
Well, it doesn't look too bad for a Dreamcast title, does it? Except that it isn't a Dreamcast title...
Originally the resolution is fixed to 720p, but just google ""DPfix"" for that. This mod allows you to raise the resolution and add a few improvements, but it will still look like a PS2 title. The textures are rather simplistic, the animations are stiff and sometimes hilariously bad, especially some face animations, objects tend to pop up right in front of you and sometimes shadows will be displayed wrong or might be missing alltogether. Well, it just looks horrible.
But you will get used to it and even consider it as one of the game's charming features, I kid you not! In fact, you will start to notice that indeed a lot of detail and effort have been put into the visual presentation - at times, at least. The environments are diverse and plentyful and there certainly is a high level of detail considering the insides of rooms etc. Small things like different posters, objects etc. make every place look and feel different and unique.
It's just that it never really looks convincing from a technical standpoint. In fact, Deadly Premonition is an ugly game, but you won't mind that anymore after a while, right, Zach?

Music & Sound
The music is really weird. Some tracks feel completely out of place, sometimes the music might even drown out the dialogue during cutscenes and sometimes it will be annoying to have to listen to the same short track loop over and over again... but you'll start to love and appreciate that! It's almost like hypnosis and the tracks tend to become real earworms over time. A couple of hours in, you'll be humming and whistling along the melodies and be purchasing the game's soundtrack too, if you haven't already. I know it sounds weird, but you'll end up loving the game's music and it really fits the title's quirky mood.
The sound effects are... well... pretty bare bones, actually. It's like only the most important events actually even have sound. And there's not much variety. A steel door opening will sound just the same like a wooden door opening, the gunshots are more like ""pew pew"" and the car sounds are laughably cheap. If you've never had to laugh simply because how things sounded or didn't make sound at all... Deadly Premonition will change that!

Gameplay
Basically, Deadly Premonition is an open world 3rd person adventure with a lot of driving. You'll talk to people, collect evidence, investigate, navigate through the town, solve a few (simple) riddles here and there and when you don't want to progress further with the main story, you can roam around freely, go fishing, play darts, have a few drinks, go shopping, shave, or start doing some of the numerous sidequests, which happen to be interesting short stories with sometimes great rewards.
At certain points, the game will transport you to the ""Otherworld"" where everything is dark and gloomy and you'll be fighting some strange zombie-like creatures. Think about a cheap version of silent hill which still manages to feel scary and foreboding at times. Luckily, those segments aren't really very hard, which makes up for the overall clunky controls. You even have unlimited ammo for your pistol and most enemies will go down after 1-2 hits with melee weapons as well. The latter ones will break and become unable to use after a couple of strikes, but you'll find plenty of them lying around anyways. While there hardly is any real sense of dread during those segments, at least there's also no frustration and even people inexpierienced with combat mechanics in games should be able to finish the title. Ironically, those passages still manage to convey a dreadful and creepy atmosphere and absolutely justify calling Deadly Premonition a horror game.
There are even some quick time events and hide-and-seek segments in the game, but those are few and far between, plus there's usually a checkpoint right in front of them, keeping frustration from failing those to a minimum.

Controls
Imagine performing a heart surgery with a spoon... while wearing winter gloves! The controls feel awkward and unprecise most of the time, but then again, the game doesn't even need you to be precise most of the time. So you'll somewhat get used to it. It certainly doesn't feel as natural and smooth as other 3rd person games, the driving physics are hilarious and you'll be fumbling around a lot, but it's actually more awkward in a funny way than frustrating.

Bugs
Yes, this has to be adressed. The game is definitely prone to crashes and freezes, and you will have to play around a little with DPfix, the 4GB Patch (google this one as well!) and compatibility modes. Once you've figured out a setup which works for you, you should be able to play the game pretty much without any crashes and freezes. But consider saving a lot, just to be safe.
There will also be a lot of non-gamebreaking bugs, but those are actually fun and will even add to the overall enjoyment. Let's just say that you'll probably encounter lots of crazy and unexpected things during your playthrough... One might even assume that some of those bugs would have been added on purpose!

This sounds quite horrible so far! Then why do I even like the game, let alone consider it one of my favourite games of all times?
First, it's really unique and feels extremely ""honest"". It doesn't even try to cover its technical flaws.
Then there's lots of of extremely likeable and weird characters. The game will surprise you by throwing weird stuff and memorable dialogues at you all the time. Even the lesser important characters are created with lots of detail, unique backstorys, daily routines, etc. which makes Greenvale really come to life and feel like a real (albeit weird) place.
York himself is probably one of the greatest videogame characters of all time. He's eccentric, weird and you never know how even the seemingly most mundane dialogues will play out and in what direction he will take them, making each and every interaction quite memorable.
The story itself is also great and intriguing. Without spoiling anything, what starts out as a simple murder mystery starts to get more and more complex and interesting. You'll be starting to make your own assumptions, have your own suspects and will want to see everything unfold.
And that's the most important thing about Deadly Premonition and why people who like it actually like it: The way the story progresses, the quirky, loveable and memorable characters, the whole weird and sometimes even meditation-like feel of the game and the true and honest emotions it triggers in the player. Over the course of the game, you will laugh, cringe, even cry, be shocked, be on the edge of your seat, feel relaxed...
Despite all the technical flaws, Deadly Premonition is one of the few games that will keep you emotionally engaged during the whole time and stick with you long after playing - if you give it the chance to do so!",1505429043,1505429043,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Original Review: 
Not a particularly great game, but a game that has definitely become a cult classic, thanks to the main character and Swery's reputation. If you've recently become interested in The Good Life (which is going through crowdfunding at the moment) you may be interested in checking out Deadly Premonition as well as D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die. Each game has a murder mystery at the heart of it, and filled to the brim with fluff and ""neat little things"". The only reason to downvote this game is that it's quite unplayable on modern systems, or any systems in general, without downloading patches and fixes created by the community. I suggest turning auto-save on, because this game WILL crash. Just the other day, I drove across the entire map, ruining a car and nearly running out of gas a second time in order to reach the motel just to have the game crash as I was walking inside the building.

As you can see from my playtime, I certainly do like this game. However fair warning - this game has problems. BIG problems of a technical nature. It is prone to crashing, glitchhing and general prefromance issues. 

For some the fixes for these issues work, for others they don't. Some people can play without problem, others get hit with crash after crash. It's totally random as to what experience you will have.

And yes it is also true the combat is pretty average, and sometimes even dull. And yes there are some awful quicktime events thanks to its console heritage. Oh and the graphics were considered ugly even when it was released. Also the driving is bad, and gunplay bugged (use alt tab to get your crosshair working). 

So why do I like it?

Well apart from the obvious 'Twin peaks' homage, the game tries to do a lot, has a great story and good characters. The voice acting is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent. The map is large and nice to explore and the games pacing is great, with plenty of little side missions to achieve outside of the main story. 

 If you can live with the possible technical frustrations this is one of the best story driven games available IMHO.  Becuase of those issues I do recommend that you may want to wait for a sale unless your a major twin peaks fan.",1504796300,1504796356,True,2,0,0.531477153301239014,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Рекомендовать эту игру можно только за СЮЖЕТ. Он здесь потрясающий, интригующий, держит в напряжении и дает пищу для размышлений. Вспомнились не только сериал Twin Peaks, но и визуальная новелла Kara no Shoujo (по духу похоже). Возможно, авторам действительно стоило сделать DP визуальной новеллой, потому что играть в нее НЕВОЗМОЖНО. 
Если вы прошли все доп. квесты и собрали карточки, можете смело ставить себе памятник. В техническом плане тут все ужасно. 
Отстреливать врагов - НЕТ. Это неудобно и скучно, хорошо, что есть кнопка автоприцела. И вообще - 90% врагов можно пробежать. Что я и сделала.
Изучать окрестности - НЕТ. Машина ездит по дороге так, будто Йорк мертвецки пьян, а карта сделана совершенно не юзерфрендли. Сориентироваться по ней - задачка не легких, мало того что нельзя посмотреть полную карту, она еще и вертится вокруг своей оси! 
Расследовать убийство - НЕТ. Сбор улик происходит посредством беготни по альтернативному миру [strike] Сайлент-хилла [/strike], отстрелом врагов и унылыми побегушками нажми-вовремя-кнопку-а-то-тебя-зарубят. 
Любоваться видами - НЕТ. Графика вырвиглаз, а про автомобильные покатушки я уже написала. Настроек нет.
Плюс - у меня игра часто висла и вылетала, а на любые попытки исправить положение отказывалась запускаться совсем.
Так все же - почему я рекомендую эту игру? Как я написала выше - СЮЖЕТ здесь решает. Персонажи привлекательные, злодеи по-настоящему отвратительные редиски. Отдельное спасибо за 25 главу - думаю, я не одна, кто порадовался. =D А над концовкой возможно кто-то захочет всплакнуть. У меня вот глаза все еще пощипывает. 
Короче, если вы гордитесь своим терпением и хотите погрузиться в крутую и жуткую историю - поиграйте, если нет - найдите хорошее прохождение и посмотрите его.

I decided to revisit the game and whatever ""updates"" they applied to the game completely broke it. It no longer plays in full screen, their controller support doesn't exist and everything runs like shit. I am glad I still got my Switch version, which runs a million times better than this crap. 

This is really something special. Take a mix of B-Horror films, mix in a bit of comedy, creative writing, survival horror, life simulation, life management and open world and  you have  Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut.

You play as autastic FBI agent Morgan as he wanders around, makes weird comments and observations, while talking to his imaginary friend ""Zack"" (I assume that's the player). While exploring the town of Greenvale, you'll need to keep Morgan well fed, make sure he sleeps enough, makes it on time to his appointments and more. Things like having to shave, clean his clothes or buy new outfits adds just enough depth to make the game even more intresting. 

I have no problems with the controls. Others may be playing with a keyboard and mouse, but the game was clearly designed to be played with a controller, which I have been using myself. It's pretty much your run of the mill tank controls ala Resident Evil, with an auto-aim assist that comes in handy at times. 

I think my biggest complaint with the game so far is the driving segments. Driving in this game tends to be clunky at best and eventually because tedious and frustrating. Some sort of quick travel feature would have been *really* nice for this game. 

The game is clearly showing it's age, it doesn't look nearly as good as modern day games, but what do you expect for a port of a 7th generation console game?

On a side note, I guess lots of people are having issues with the performance of the game. Since I am all too aware of how problematic PC games can be when running on different hardware, I am not discounting other users' problems. But, I must be lucky, because this game installed and ran just fine without any major issues or difficulties. I am unsure if the poor reviews for this game are based around technical problems other users are having, but I simply don't see why it is being judged so poorly.

-Пожалуй минусы заглючаются больше всего в геймплее и в убийствах врагов, ибо порой бывают такие враги, которых хочешь верь, хочешь нет, убивать нудно, скучно, не интересно; впринципе я потом забил на то чтоб их убивать))) ну можно же пробежать мимо них)

-Ненужный открытый мир: он там впринципе не нужный, порой приходится страдать фигней чтоб там скоротать время, благо есть гостинница и сараи где ты можешь поспать, и скоротать время))

-Пожалуй самым большим плюсом является очень интересный и интригующий сюжет держит тебя в напряжении всю игру.
-Очень интересные персонажи. (тоже немало важный плюс)
-Достаточно огнестрельного оружия и орудий ближнего боя, не скажу чтовсего много, но есть (рубить интересней чем стрелять xD)
-Прикольне фичи типа, бриться, заправляться, и так далее (забыл еще какие есть xD)
-Диалоги классные, в плане каждый персонаж (из основных по крайней мере) можетподелиться с тобой о своем прошлом

First, this is a remarkably unstable / poor port - you will run into a lot of issues getting it to run at all (due to a variety of compatibility issues), and even past that getting it to be stable, sporting a memory leak that will cause crashes after every 1-2 hours of play (unless corrected through some settings).

There's also an aiming issue with controllers that makes aiming up and down beyond a certain range impossible (this gets in the way of playing in only a couple of spots, most notably in the coup-de-grace at the final boss).

All of that can be worked around (PC Gaming Wiki outlines all of the issues and workarounds in good detail: https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut) but is not super acceptable.

Second, the game itself is not exactly _good_. It's extremely rough around the edges - combat is both annoying and boring, driving is a chore, the enviornments and characters don't look very good (even with some of the fixes/tweaks available), the world is way too spread out for its own good, the 'other world' (combat) sections are over-long for what they bring to the table. There are good quality of life upgrades you can unlock (the radio, infinite weapons, etc) that are a chore to unlock, espccially without a walkthrough, I could go on and on with complaints like that.

With all of that said... I love Deadly Premonition. If you can look past the (myriad) problems, you get bizarre and really endearing characters (especcially your player-character, Agent Francis York Morgan), a sense of style (borrowed VERY liberally from Twin Peaks), a compelling plot full of bonkers twists, charming and dumb cutscenes, and a very unique and interesting open world mechanics. 

If you're willing to put up with a lot to get at something really one-of-a-kind and weird, it's well worth it. 

(Probably easier to recommend the PS3/360 versions, as they avoid many of the technical issues present in the PC release -- although the 360 release lacks the control upgrades present here or in the PS3 versions).",1502557639,1502557639,True,2,0,0.536905586719512939,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The port is bad but not unplayable, remember to install the dpfix and apply a 4gb patch on the executable, by doing this the game will run for about 3-4 hours before it crashes, at least that was my experience. Additionally if viewing ram and vram usage through rivaturner, you will be able to see when the memory leak is about to crash the game and save beforehand.

I recommend it because no matter what system u have available, its worth playing if story is important to you in games, this is a game that will stick with you, that’s why I’m here playing it yet again, 7 years after my 1st run on the xb360.

В техническом и геймплейном плане всё печально, тут тебе и частые вылеты и разрешение экрана без [b]Full HD[/b], вдобавок кривое прицеливание и много чего ещё. Но обо всём по порядку.

[h1][b]Маленькое вступление[/b][/h1]
Главный герой – специальный агент ФБР [b]Фрэнсис Йорк Морган[/b], агент он не простой, со своими причудами и жутким прошлым. Часто обращается к Заку *в голове*, который по словам Йорка является его другом с детства, однако отвечать и вести диалоги с Йорком он не будет (точнее самого Зака не слышно), например, как это было в [b]Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones[/b]. Иногда приходится выступать в роли этого самого Зака и дать ответ Йорку на его вопрос (в основном, это сюжетные развилки), выбрать один из двух вариантов или вовремя нажать кнопку действия. Что самое интересное, Йорк может заговорить с Заком в любое время, когда ему вздумается, казалось бы, его не засмущала бы даже стоящая рядом группа психиатров. Задумка интересная, хоть и не нова, тут обыграна по-своему хорошо. Этого причудливого агента отправляют на расследование убийства девушки в маленьком городке под названием [b]Гринвейл (Greenvale)[/b]. Название говорит само за себя (зеленая долина), всюду сплошь зелень и горы. В общем-то с этого и начинается история.

[h1][b]Коридорный свободный мир[/b][/h1]
Со стороны кажется, что DP коридорная, но это так лишь отчасти. Здесь имеется достаточно таки большой и не проработанный город по которому можно свободно перемещаться, и здания с коридорчиками (места преступления), в них движется сюжет, в то время как город играет роль декорации. Создателям стоило уменьшить его в размерах в пользу большей проработки деталей. На деле же: растянутые текстуры газона, лесные деревья [Ctrl+C – Ctrl+V] и просто-напросто пустой городок. Свободно путешествовать пешком или на транспорте можно сразу после эпилога, управление автомобилем тут не ахти, на большой скорости и поворотах машина запросто переворачивается, после чего останется надеяться как бы она не взорвалась, иначе штраф и восстановление с последнего сохранения. Ко всему прочему, в игре дают возможность быстрого перемещения с помощью рации в ранее посещенные места. Удобная штука, годится на случай, когда необходимо добраться в другой конец города, только выдается рация за квестовое задание.

[h1][b]Враги как медленно движущиеся мишени для стрельбы[/b][/h1]
Противники ничем особенным не выделяются и никакой угрозы не представляют, да и вызывают смех и недоумение. Вся игра состоит из мычащих болванчиков, которые медленно передвигаются в позе моста в сторону агента Йорка, пытаясь убить железной трубой, огнестрелом или более изощрёнными способами, например, по локоть засунуть руку в рот. Потом появляется баба, ползающая по потолку и стенам, настолько оригинальной показалось она разработчикам, что они решили впихнуть её через каждый шаг главного героя, благо лишь в одной главе. Есть и боссы, в игре они тоже для галочки и особой трудности в победе над ними не возникнет, разве что последний босс заставит насиловать вашу клавиатуру частыми нажатиями одних и тех же кнопок. Единственным значимым разнообразием будет убийца в красном дождевике, с ним и в прятки можно поиграть и в [b]«догони меня топор»[/b].

[h1][b]Видимо за основной сюжет и квесты отвечали разные люди[/b][/h1]
Половина квестовых заданий можно вырезать и игра от этого абсолютно ничего не потеряет. Нет никаких сомнений в том, что если не возить пять раз бабушку с остывающей кастрюлей до дома на безумной скорости или трижды убираться на складе продуктового магазина за спасибо, игра станет от этого хуже. Подобных заданий уйма, и, кому как, а мне они нисколько не понравились, только отвлекали от сюжетной линии. Выполнять их, конечно же, никто не заставляет и на сюжет они никак не влияют, но лучше бы их не было, правда.

[h1][b]Гениальные идеи и прочие радости[/b][/h1]
Помимо квестов, здесь ещё много другого мусорного контента. Разработчикам не удалось выдержать золотой середины, взять все идеи, решить, что будет к месту, а что лучше выпилить. В итоге пичкали всё самое ""лучшее"", дабы игроки не скучали и потерялись в игре на незабываемые 50 часов к ряду. Именно потерялись, долго придется разбираться куда ехать, как доехать, потом ещё квесты на главы поделены, их можно переиграть, но нельзя сохраняться. Одним словом – боль. И кто же так делает, когда игра на каждом повороте вылеты выдает. Куда интереснее были бы квесты о тайнах города, второстепенные расследования (квесты на покупные карты почти близки к этому) и прочее. Необходимость кушать, спать и частенько менять костюм, дабы вокруг агента не летала стая мух, тоже не лучшая идея. Все это есть в жизни, зачем это в игре, выглядит как какая-то неудачная попытка сделать из игры симулятор агента, по факту же пустая трата времени.

[h1][b]Саундтрек[/b][/h1]
Японцы в написании саундтрека очень хороши, всегда какая-нибудь да композиция врежется в память и будет стоять на повторе в плеере долгое время. Лично выделю три композиции: [b]Greenvale[/b], [b]York and Zach[/b] и [b]The Woods and the Goddess[/b], остальные просто дополняют процесс игры в зависимости от ситуации, но получается это не всегда. Проблема в том, что кому-то в голову пришла интересная идея вставлять радостную музыку в моменты, где по идее должна звучать грустная и в то же время напряженная композиция. В неожиданные (типа страшные) моменты звучит эффект саспенса, такой очень часто в комедии и смешные видео добавляют, из-за этого серьезно относится к ситуации просто нереально, атмосфера сразу смывается в унитаз.


[b]Deadly Premonition[/b] – это хорошая история, именно история, потому что как игру в техническом плане её абсолютно не за что похвалить. Она совершенно точно придется по душе тем, у кого на первом плане сюжетная составляющая, нежели геймплейная, просто выпустили её не в своё время и в придачу с ворохом проблем. Прежде чем начать, советую ознакомиться с руководствами по игре, на первом месте увидите не гайд по достижениям, а как решить кучу проблем, которые разработчики оставили игрокам. Из личного опыта: чтобы полностью пройти мне приходилось часто менять совместимость игры и её лаунчера на [b]Windows XP[/b], затем на [b]Windows 95[/b] для свободного прицеливания, потому что на операционках выше 95 работает только автоприцеливание, на 95 ужасно долгие загрузки и более частые вылеты. Вот так вот приходилось прыгать с одной совместимости на другую, отключать оверлей Стима и ставить оконный режим в разрешении 800×600, вылетать, перезаходить снова и снова. Стоит ли ради сюжетки играть в такую криво собранную игру (или её порт), без каких-либо интересных геймплейных фишек, даже пропуская утомительно-бредовые квестовые задания, решать вам. Также могу сказать точно, что стиль подачи и общая атмсофера DP понравится не каждому, поэтому, прежде чем врываться в этот безумный мир настоятельно рекомендую подумать несколько раз. Тут была бы уместна нейтральная [b](серая)[/b] рецензия, но так как в Стиме такого нет, остается лишь палец вверх за сценарий, на который, по всей видимости ушли все силы и бюджет.

The sections are as follows . 
 1 why you should not buy this  game 
 
 2   The  reasons   people give positive reviews to this game  
 3 some tips for those who have already purchased the game  
 
 
 
 
 1 why you should not buy this game . 


I will get straight to the point here  This game  does not run properly   It did  not run properly    when it was made had and still does have  various game breaking   bugs .  
some of which cause the game to suddenly crash others of which will prevent you from saving your game or to keep an item you already got in the game which is  needed to advance the story line  
 The  game play is like this . 
 
You go thorough  a map in the game where you  have to get past a bunch of   zombie  type enemy's   assuming your game does not crash  when you have completed the  map , This is usually followed by a quick time event  and assuming you complete the quick time event and all the various buttons that you need to push show up on screen  . After which you need to move your character  to a location in the game . in order to  get a cut scene which starts the next round of   killing zombies  and searching for the objects needed to start the next quick time event and cut scene .  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 2 why people give positive reviews to this game 

. I really do not want to go to much into this but . Here is a part of a paragraph from a game guide that i will give the link to .  
 Read  Rausk whole paragraph in the game guide so you know what you are getting yourself into and the emotional reasons as to why people  give the game positive reviews this is from  that guide . 
 
 
 
 
 
The game was originally supposed to be released on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 
and even had a trailer, when it was originally called ""Rainy Woods"", released 
in 2007. But the similarities to ""Twin Peaks"" was so strong that Access Games 
was forced to change a lot of things which caused a considerable delay and 
even came close to cancelation. 
 
However, the limited budget wouldn't allow them to upgrade everything to the 
level they needed to be for release on the next generation consoles which 
resulted in the many technical flaws the game has. 
 
So the game designer, Hidetaka Suehiro (aka SWERY), decided to focus on the 
story, characters, and the game world which is where the game shines. Many 
game critics have praised the game for its unique world and the characters 
that inhabit it.

 3 some tips for those who have already purchased the game  
  
 
missing animations  
 
you should be aware of  
if you are unable to do something in the game   like  a certain action  such as shooting the apples in the tree in the art gallery or killing an enemy  
 
It may be because the game developer has Olney provided one animation of that thing happening in one way and from one camera angle olny  .  For example you can not kill an enemy that is emerging from a wall or floor because the game developer did not make an animation of the  enemy   dying when they  emerge from a wall or floor.  
 
 
 
 things that may help  
 
1 remove the steam overlay  
2 download the patch  in the developers posting on the   comunity  hub page  
 
3 run it in compatibility mode for windows 95 . 
 
you still may get crashes just not as many .

Разрешение 720p, исправляется только DPFix'ом.
После установки DPFix'а игра держит 60 фпс, но после каждой загрузки фпс падает, вплоть до 10 кадров. Чтобы это исправить, игру приходится перезапускать каждые полчаса. Если перезапуск игры не помогает, то помогает перезапуск компьютера (я вообще первый раз вижу, чтобы фреймрейт исправлялся перезагрузкой ПК).
Спустя 8 часов игры, игра вылетела на катсцене, и, похоже, повредился сейв-файл, а он тут единственный: нет возможности загрузить более ранний сейв, если вы не делали бэкапа. Вылет был на 9-ой главе, как и у многих. В целом вылеты были примерно каждые полчаса-час, и каждый из них мог потенциально запороть сейв.
В общем, пройти игру можно, но для этого вы должны делать бэкап сейвов, регулярно.

Каким-то чудом смог исправить проблемы и пройти игру, в итоге не разочарован.
Рецепт чуда примерно такой (для NVIDIA):
1) удаляете текущую версию PhysX из системы;
2) устанавливаете DirectX, vcredist и PhysX из папки redist в директории игры;
3) на игру устанавливаете сторонний патч DPFix, настраиваете там нужные параметры, согласно README, включаете возможность перезаписи текстур (texture override);
4) поищите в гайдах сообщества ссылки на HD шрифты и установите их;
5) в DPFix включите оконный режим + без рамки (windowed, borderless);
6) установите RivaTuner, добавьте DP.exe в список и включите Frame Limit в 60 фпс;
7) в свойствах DP.exe на вкладке Совместимость выберите режим совместимости с Windows 98, переопределите режим масштабирования как Приложение, и поставьте галочку на опции ""Отключить оптимизацию во весь экран"" (у меня Windows 10, часть опций может у вас отсутствовать);
8) перезагрузите компьютер, убедитесь, что RivaTuner остался запущенным;

Если вы ранее запускали игру, то удалите сейв в папке игры savedata/dp.sav и начните новую игру. Это необходимо, чтобы гарантировать, что ваш save-файл не был поврежден.

А теперь по поводу самих сейвов. Игра имеет свойства регулярно запарывать save-файл: после любого вылета есть вероятность, что вы НЕ СМОЖЕТЕ пройти игру.

Как жить с такой проблемой:
1) после каждого телефона (или хотя бы раз в полчаса) делайте копию файла savedata/db.sav, я их именовал с цифрой, в итоге прошел игру, сделав 62 копии save-файла.
2) если игра вылетела, высока вероятность, что сейв был запорот - удаляйте dp.sav и копируйте последнюю версию из бэкапов.
Конечно, иногда вы будете терять где-то 10-20 минут геймплея и их придется перепроходить, со мной такое случалось примерно раза 3 за прохождение. Но зато вы не потеряете ВЕСЬ ВАШ ПРОГРЕСС.

После прохождения не забудьте переустановить видеодрайвер и вместе с ним последнюю версию PhysX.

I played this game a few years ago on the xbox 360 and loved it, so I was thrilled to find it on the PC when I switched over to PC gaming. This game, however, is plagued with bugs. Occasionally, the game will crash when playing the opening cutscene. Severe, unhandled crashes can also happen during loading screens. Some very specific events can also trigger crashes (don't go outside at 14:00 during mission 6). Finally, there appears to be a memory leak, as my FPS would slowly drop while I play. The game does not handle high FPS well either, as button prompts will flash and the menu may freeze at a high FPS. Finally, if you play with a controller, the game cannot handle two triggers being pressed at the same time. That means shooting cannot be mapped to LT and RT. And after getting through all these bugs, the truth is the game is just average overall. If you're brave enough to consider buying this game despite these problems, here's some of the pros and cons:

Pros:
+Quirky, memorable dialog
+Unique characters
+Huge variety of side missions, most with a unique reward
+Surprising attention to detail -- grow beard in real time, people treat you badly if you wear old clothes, side missions depend on weather patterns, etc.
+A decent mystery
+A sort of surrealist style
+Fun music (though it sometimes plays at strange times)

Cons:
-A horror game that isn't scary (outside of the constant fear of a crash)
-Terrible driving controls (and you have to drive a lot)
-Combat consists of just putting the cursor at head level and racking up headshots. Imagine playing RE4 except all the enemies come at you one at a time, they're much slower and dumber, and there's barely any enemy variety.
-Pretty bad graphics. I don't mean bad as in outdated, I mean it looks like the 3d modelers and texture artists were still learning their job while making the game.
-The animations are bad, and basically just cycle between neutral, laughing, and scared. The only exceptions are during cutscenes when generic animations simply wouldn't work.

To summarize, imagine if you had a book, but someone has defecated between all the pages. The story of this book is pretty good, but you have to get through a lot of nasty s**t to get to it. That book is Deadly Premonition. Now, if you don't like s**t, you'd probably be better off watching a YouTube video of somebody with a higher tolerance to s**t go through it.

Sin duda la particular historia y narrativa de éste juego es la principal atraccion para jugarlo, los personajes son divertidos e interesantes, los monologos del agente con su personalidad alternativa ""Zach"" le dan un toque de surrealismo a la forma de interactuar con los otros personajes e incluso el jugador; el humor del juego va desde lo cómico pasando por el drama y culminando en horror; el gameplay cumple muy escuetamente, el aspecto grafico claramente pudo ser mejor. 

El juego mantiene un buen balance de mecanicas y sidequests para mantenerte entretenido, al ser de mapa abierto se pueden ir pasando las misiones de la historia al ritmo que se quiera.

Claramente es un titulo para los que les gustan los juegos ""raros"" ya que es una amalgama de muchos elementos mas o menos bien ensamblada, aderezado con un monton de referencias a la cultura pop y una historia genuinamente interesante; curiosamente inspirada en la magistral serie de television de los 80's ""Twin Peaks"" creada por el célebre David Lynch.

Es conveniente advertir que se necesita tiempo y paciencia para lidiar con los problemas tecnicos que tiene ésta version del juego, aún con éstos problemas te lo recomiendo ampliamente; es uno de esos titulos que reafirmó mi idea de que los juegos son una forma de arte.

(nah but in seriousness, this is probably one of the more interesting and unique games I've played in a while. It sports plenty of bizarre and memorable characters, and the last hour or so makes up probably one of the best endings I've seen in a video game in years.

My biggest issue with the game, though, is that I feel like it's ultimately too derivative of the media it takes influence of. The obvious one is Twin Peaks, and I actually wanna talk about that for a moment. I'm not a particularly big fan of Twin Peaks, but one of my favorite things about it is how Lynch manages to spin a uniquely nuanced style of surrealism that can create some truly artful and memorable moments (the deer head scene in the pilot is one of the most inexplicably hilarious gags I've ever seen in a television show).

As much influence as Deadly Premonition takes from Twin Peaks, it rarely ever manages to strike the same level of creativity that Twin Peaks has. There's a few good parts, especially towards the end, but the game tends to rely too much on ""weird/awkward for the sake of being weird/awkward""-type comedy and overt references to other media (the ""pot lady""? really?), without innovating much beyond that.

If I had to give this game a numerical rating, I'd probably give it something like a 7/10. It's a shame that my feelings toward it are somewhat lukewarm compared to others, but I still have a lot of respect for it. It's clearly got a lot of heart, and the fact that something like this was even managed to be developed to fruition (and, even further, released to positive reception) really gives me a lot of hope for the future of video games.)",1499057642,1499057642,True,3,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For those looking for an interesting game, this could potentially appeal to you.

While I personally enjoyed what I could get through so far, the amount of glitch and bugs that I have come accross makes playing the game not very enjoyable.

For instance;
- Game crash at startup (Fixed by re-installing some Nvidea setting that are located in the game installation folder)
- Sound glitch while driving (Only way to fix it was to use some old speakers as my current headset made the car sound glitch)
- Frequent freezes during cutscenes (When it happened, the only way I could go through them was to hit ""ESC"", but then I would also miss all the content
- Random game crashes

Тщательно взболтать безумными японскими руками и поставить вариться на очень медленном огне, чтобы игра выглядела как пришелец из эры PS2. Получается Deadly Premonition, где Агент Френсис ""Йорк"" Морган со своим воображаемым другом Заком расследуют убийство девушки в тихом (на первый взгляд) провинциальном городке Гринвейл.

DP даже по японским меркам довольно странная штука, сочетающая в себе детективный триллер (с элементами фарса) и открытый мир. 

Начну сразу с плохого: в игре ужасное управление, паршивая графика, посредственный геймплей и надоедающее со временем музыкальное оформление (треков очень мало, и они очень часто повторяются, пусть сами по себе и красивые).

Что же хорошего? Прежде всего, необычный сюжет и персонажи. И еще мир. Он действительно кажется живым, пусть и схематичным, да и приставка “открытый” не кажется надуманной. У персонажей есть свое расписание дня. Продавцы в магазинах днем проводят за прилавком, а вечером садятся в машину и едут к себе домой. Владельцы баров отдыхают днем, а вечером открывают свои заведения

Почти у каждого встречного есть для Йорка какое-либо задание, выполнив которые мы получим деньги, полезный предмет и заодно узнаем о городе и его населении чуть больше. Сами жители Гринвейла неплохо проработаны, у многих есть определенный бэкграунд и интересные истории для нас. В наличии даже безумная старушка, разговаривающая с кастрюлей (явная отсылка к Log Lady).

Для расследования убийств нам придется сражаться с потусторонними силами, будучи запертыми в локациях, где по сюжету ищем улики для раскрытия дела. Экшен часть тут откровенно корявая, и если бы ее сократили в 2-3 раза - было бы только лучше. А QTE сцены и вовсе стоило убрать. Вообще, в игре довольно много странных фич. Например, если не бриться, то у героя растет потихоньку борода, если не менять пару дней одежду - вокруг начинают летать мухи) 

Даже с установкой всех фиксов игра любит вывалиться с ошибкой после какой-нибудь кат-сцены. Или вдруг сохранение может испортиться...  Хорошо, что все это лечится установкой исполняемому файлу (DP.exe) совместимости с Windows98\Me, а то я бы ее забросил. Ну и surround sound тут сломанный, приходится каждый раз переключать колонки на 2.0, иначе езда на машине превращается в ад для ушей.

Deadly Premonition stars you as an FBI agent investigating a murder in a countryside town. It is intriguing, cheesy and witty all at the same time.

However, there are so many things wrong with the game; Technical issues are paramount. Enemy hitboxes don't seem to align very well, making combat sluggish. Aiming with weapons is slow and clunky, driving is tedious, with NPCs driving about 15mph even on main roads! 

But the main problem with the game, is even with fanpatches, it just simply isn't stable enough. The game crashes relentlessly, sometimes because it screws up loading an area, sometimes because it decides cutscenes are too much hassle, other times because it just doesn't want to work anymore.

You need to save religiously just to get through the story alone. I've clocked 25ish hours on Steam, however my in-game save file is a mere 11hours at time of writing. That's 14 hours of progress lost from crashes, requiring me to re-load a save and go through it again.

Worth it? Absolutely not. Not even on sale.

Deadly Premonition is an amazing experience, chock full of memorable characters and a very enjoyable story but Rising Star Games took no part in the original release other than publishing it in Europe and paying them for this release (rewarding them for creating the Director's Cut) is wrong.
the Director's Cut is a massive downgrade from the original 360 release back in 2010. Rising Star Games (the publisher) decided to hire a contractor (TOYBOX Inc.) rather than get the original developers to create the Director's Cut. Not only did they massively downgrade the visuals from the original 2010 release (many missing effects, color grading completely removed [resulting in some of the ugliest visuals I've seen in any game ever]) but they also added a massive amount of bugs and crashes (memory leaks, unavoidable crashes that always happen in particular sections and much more).
Oh, and if you think the PS3 version is much better, trust me, it's not. While the game crashes less often and isn't quite as buggy as the PC release it rarely runs faster than 20FPS and often drops below that.

In the end, if you really want to play Deadly Premonition you might be able to get past all the crashes in this version and finish the game. But fuck Rising Star Games for taking such a wonderfully unique game and shitting not only all over it but all over its fans as well. Fuck Rising Star Games for ruining Deadly Premonition to such a degree that new players will abandon it after the first 30 minutes after experiencing multiple game crashes or never even try it in the first place because RSG has created such a terrible reputation for the game.

They don't care about the consumer, they don't care about anything other than getting the most profit out of the least investment. I can only hope someday that someone wrestles the rights out of RSG's grubby little mitts and creates an actual port of Deadly Premonition. But until then, the only way you can experience Deadly Premonition is by dragging out a 12 year old console or playing through the massively inferior version by Rising Star Games and TOYBOX Inc.

Bugs are one thing, but crashes are an entirely more disgusting beast. The game routinely crashes anywhere from 20-40 minutes of play, which means that in my 20 hours so far it has crashed upwards of 40 times. It can crash at any point completely randomly, so you cannot mitigate this in any way.

Crucially, the game will not let you save during chapter replays, which are needed to complete several side quests, so you will undoubtedly have to redo large sections of the game many, many times to progress.

The DPFix mod you can download online cleans up the graphics and seems to reduce the amount of crashes, but does not completely eliminate them.

Add to this a known game-breaking bug concerning item disappearances that forces you to restart the entire game from the beginning, a wealth of technical issues, long loading times, and poor PC optimization means you should stay far away from this port.

I will say this though: if you aren't much of a completionist and just wish to experience the main story, you can save regularly throughout the campaign and mostly ignore the open world, which will mean that the crashes will affect you a bit less. Having said that, some of the most useful items in the game (including the entire fast travel system) are unlocked through side quests, so they are pretty essential for anyone not wanting to spend too much time wrestling with the game's atrocious driving physics. I would suggest using a guide to seek these few items out early on in the campaign and then ignoring the rest of the filler material. (The side quests are mostly awful anyway: incidental to the plot, hard to find without a guide, and requiring lots of wasted time manipulating the game's time passage and weather mechanics to make certain NPCs appear.)

If you have a PS3, I would still recommend checking the game out on a more stable platform. Or hell, just watch a cutscene compilation online and save yourself the hassle of actually playing the damn thing. It would be disingenuous to call this a ""good"" game, but no one is expecting that at this point. We all know it's a quirky B-game that is borderline unplayable. My standards aren't high, and I'm willing to forgive how bad the foundation is because the world, story, and characters are pretty interesting.

But the game needs to run. This port, unfortunately, is in a completely unacceptable state and should frankly be pulled from the Steam store.

But as we all know, Steam Quality Control isn't a thing that exists.



*******************************************************************************************************
ADDENDUM: Concerning the story.

Usually when I neg a game, my review gets negged in turn, so thank you for all of the positive feedback.

When I wrote my initial review, it was strictly to call out the technical issues. However, if any of you are still on the fence because you feel like you still may get a decent story experience despite the technical apocalypse, I thought I would write a quick spoiler-free addendum about the plot and give you further reason to avoid the game. This is at the risk of contradicting my earlier statement that the story is interesting, but what we have here is an example of a well-written journey with a flat payoff.

There are many examples in modern fiction where the plot twists can be unpredictable because they are poorly crafted. Deadly Premonition is one such example. You are very unlikely to construct the game's full plot in your mind before the final act's sequence of revelations lays it bare, but this doesn't mean that the game was smarter than you.

Whodunnits are tough to write, since any astute gamer will have processed every character at least once as a potential suspect, and thus actual surprise needs to be very clever. The way this game deflects suspicion is by essentially creating two different culprits: the one you interact with, and the true self.

This is immediately apparent in the voice acting: the pre- and post-twist voices are delivered completely differently, as if the actor had been hired for two separate games. This is problematic because deranged sociopaths and serial killers will usually exhibit some form of their identity when interacting with other people, but Deadly Premonition is straight out of the 90s Scream-style horror playbook - you cannot begin to suspect anybody because the liars so perfectly masquerade as normal people.

Although most characterization is shallow, there is still some really good writing here...for a video game. But dialogue and plot are two different things, and it's in the plot where the game flounders.

It's frustrating because there is no cathartic wide-eyed moment where you realize you've been hoodwinked by clever plot construction. Instead, it's as if characters you scratched off your suspect list long ago suddenly become different people, and the resulting reaction is something along the lines of, ""Oh, I guess this person is a bad guy now."" In fact, you may wind up crafting more elaborate theories about what's going on due to the sheer amount of mysteries involved, whereas the truth is much less exciting.

It doesn't help that the plot winds up having holes you could fly a 747 through. There are several discrepancies between the evidence you collect and the end result, and many of the clues remain unexplained at the end. Furthermore, there are many tenuous backstory elements that just don't make any sense - unrelated characters portrayed together in scenes without any context to explain their proximity, and a macguffin that serves two discrepant functions.

Psychological thrillers are at their best when examining the characters' mindstates and developing them as complex individuals. Deadly Premonition's one saving grace is that your player character is very interesting, almost to the point where he is able to carry the entire game and lift it from the dregs of pulp fiction. The game's final act incorporates his own backstory and psyche into the plot in an organic way, and it's safe to say that the moments where we are exploring him are where the storytelling is at its best. Unfortunately, it's not enough to hang a 20-40 hour bad game on (depending on the number of side quests and crashes you experience, of course), and the supporting cast of characters do nothing to deepen the plot's complexity. It's a shame - had every character been as well developed as the lead, we might have had something truly special here.

I feel like I could only recommend a playthrough to those who study games as an artform, rather than those seeking to be entertained (i.e. most of us). And even then, I would strongly encourage those few to seek out the PS3 version and avoid the incessant crashes.",1498070145,1499540032,False,50,0,0.816346645355224609,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Try to do side missions 4 and 5 as soon as possible to get [spoiler]fast travel[/spoiler]. All the shops are closed when it rains but that makes it easier to visit characters at their houses.

A história do jogo é interessante e intrigante; tem um mapa grande para ser explorado; side-quests; mundo aberto; tem detalhes realistas como combustível, fome, sono e uso do horário para ativar as quests; imersivo; o jogo e os personagens tem o charme do estilo japonês (humor, sistema de pontuação, estilo de terror, expressões corporais, etc).

Negativo:
O principal motivo para eu não recomendar a compra desse jogo é porque todos os pontos positivos do jogo não podem ser aproveitados em sua integridade por causa dos constantes travamentos somados com o sistema de save limitado, você só pode salvar em pontos específicos do jogo, então se o jogo travar (muito provavelmente vai, como ocorreu comigo e outros vários consumidores, mesmo após a aplicação de patchs não oficiais) você perde todo o seu progresso a partir do seu último ponto de salvamento.

Também tem outros pontos negativos, que eu relevaria completamente para poder continuar a jogar, que são típicos dos jogos japoneses dessa época, são detalhes que desaceleram o ritmo e atrapalham a qualidade de vida do jogador, vou citar só um: Quando você executa uma ação o jogo você perde o controle do personagem e tem que assistir uma animação específica para aquela situação (ex: abrir uma porta), isso é especialmente cansativo em relação a obtenção de itens, pois quando você pega um item você vai para uma tela preta mostrando o item por uns 4 segundos, pode parecer pouco, mas imagine ter que pegar 10 itens no chão ou ter que comprar o limite de pirulitos (20)...

Эти тайны ему необходимо разгадать, чтобы раскрыть преступление.
Сюжет у игры довольно хорош и качественный. Это самая сильная составляющая игры.
В нём есть непредсказуемость, некие недоговорённости, и даже неожиданные повороты.
Дважды пройдя игру, я не нашёл в сюжете ни одного косяка. А я старался ! 
Диалоги персонажей тоже проработаны на отлично, юмора столько - хоть отбавляй.
Ключевые персонажи в игре живут своей жизнью: ходят на работу, копаються в саду, посещают кафешки, вечером отправляються по домам, а некоторые в ночной клуб.
Причём тут не как в GTA, как только персонаж уходит с поля зрения, он исчезает. Тут они реально занимаются своими делами и их можно отследить по карте, что привносит в игру некую иллюзию жизни. Однако это немного мешает выполнять побочные задания, так как один даёт задание только в дождливую погоду, второй только тогда, когда находится дома и т.д. Но я порекомендовал бы читателю, для полного погружения в игру, да и вообще, чтобы лучше познакомиться с персонажами и заодно посмеяться над диалогами, не отлынивать от их выполнения. Так от прохождения игры вы получите гораздо больше ощущений.

По прибытию в  Гринвейл игроку предоставляется некая свобода.  Можно не спешить выполнять задания, а заняться исследованием города. Если не придти на задание в указанное время, то ничего за это не будет. Можно придти хоть на следующий день, хоть через неделю.
Графика в игре приемлимая, и если ещё в помещениях полно всяких деталей на которые можно посмотреть, то на улице всё гораздо хуже.
Стрельба сделана паршиво, но к ней ещё можно привыкнуть в отличии от физики вождения автомобиля. Какую машину не возьми, то она разворачивается резко, то заваливается на бок. А если хорошенько разогнаться и наехать на какую нибудь кочку, то машина полетит словно брошенный башмак по полу.

Ну а про обилие технических проблем я вообще молчу.
Лучше прочтите руководство одного товарища. Благодаря ему более менее комфортно поиграть таки удалось. Ну и заодно, там же найдёте ссылку на русскую локализацию.

  A Japanese love letter to Twin Peaks - this is a gaming experience second to none.

  This isn't something that you play because the gameplay is incredible. In fact the worst part of this game in many ways is the ""gameplay"" itself. Shooting, driving, and moving the camera can all be terrible at times - but it's worth it because you can't help but want to know what happens to Detective York Peppermint Patty next.

   It sinks it's hooks in with it's characters, dialogue, and the way it always seems to ask one more question than it answers. The graphics aren't anything dazzling, but the music (again, HEAVILY inspired by Twin Peaks) is fantastic as it is unusual. You'll know within the first hour of playing if it's right for you - so if in doubt go in bravely with Steam refund at your  back.",1494811545,1534752687,True,3,1,0.535507619380950928,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's true, virtually nobody played it...and it's also important.

Nobody played it because it has little more than cult status in the world of gaming and in keeping with the tradition of Japanese game development from the mid to late 90s and early 2000s (it actually looks like a game from that time period), it has interesting gameplay mechanics, a bizarre storyline and quirky character presentation, so it's easy to see why SWERY's game ranks right up there with the likes of Suda51 games, such as Lollipop Chainsaw and Shadows of the Damned (please Steam, add these games to your store) or lesser known games like Mr. Mosquito, Incredible Crisis, the Siren series (arguably much more popular but still a series largely forgotten or that nobody really cared about), the Choaniki series, etc.

It's important because of the aforementioned cult status and Japanese quirkiness - they simply don't make games like this anymore, or at least nowhere near as often as they used to. It's also important because it pays homage to Twin Peaks and because it was actually awarded a Guinness record for most polarizing game, meaning that gamer reviews, and especially critical reviews, held it in either very high esteem, praising it for what it was, or utterly trashing it for what it wasn't (a good game) - there was absolutely no gray area by which to even things out.

I believe this was a budget game at the time of its release back on Xbox 360 and then again on PS3 with the exclusive director's cut (so it was $20 or thereabouts) and it's regularly the same price on Steam, except when it goes on sale for 90% off (which frequently happens).

Borrowing heavily from David Lynch's phenomenal television show, Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called in to investigate the murder of a young woman in the sleepy mountain town of Greenvale. Along the way he meets various colorful and unique characters that add more to the allure and mystery of his investigation. 

PROS:
Fantastic story - A very deep and amazing story with many shocking developments and plot twists. One of the best written and presented stories I have ever seen in a video game.
Unique characters - Every character in Deadly Premonition is different and bursting with personality. A lot of care was put into every person's back story and quirks to make each one stand out.
Plenty to do - There are points in the story where you can go fully open world. Inside Greenvale are plenty of side quests and activities to take part in. Some activities you can only do at certain times of the day or before or after particular story events.
Genuinely creepy - The game starts off like a typical horror game, but slowly begins to twist and contort into a more unsettling and disturbing tale.

CONS:
Odd controls - Some of the games controls are a bit sluggish, especially the driving controls. Every car feels like a tank and will randomly spin off the road for no reason.
PC Version plagued with technical issues - If you play Deadly Premonition on PC, be prepared to fight with it. The game has loads of technical problems from random crashing and freezing, to frame rate and graphical errors. It's a miracle if you can get the game to run for more than 10 minutes without it crashing. There are workarounds, but it's upsetting to see how little care went into the PC port.
Maybe a little too weird - Deadly Premonitions charm lies in it's quirky characters and twisting story. A lot of crazy things happen throughout and the narrative can be a little weird for some. Not a game for people who like a more straightforward story.

If you can see past all the technicaly problems with the PC port, Deadly Premonition is a superb action/horror game with one of the best stories I have ever witnessed. If you can, I highly recommend getting the PS3 version since it is more stable and less likely to give you problems.",1494494201,1494494201,True,14,1,0.684060096740722656,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play an FBI Agent who is tasked to investigate an unusual murder in a small town.
Let's start with the wrong. This is the most crash-prone PC game I've ever played in my life. And that's saying a lot, because I've played many crash-prone games. There were several parts of the game where the only way to advance without crashing was to switch to a windowed mode (using Win 98 compatibility). There were other parts where I had to disable all the cores and logical processors of my CPU (except one). There were parts where restarting the computer was the only way.
The graphics are also pretty bad for a game released in 2010. It's locked to 720p resolution, and offers no graphics settings whatsoever.
So what made me like it? The highlights of this game are the story, characters, and setting. These are what kept me playing for over 20 hours, all the way to the end. The voice acting was pretty good too (especially the main character), which is surprising, given how poor the production values are in general.
As for gameplay: it is described as an open world game, which is technically true. However, aside from some boring side quests, there's very little reason to explore the town too much. The gameplay is simple: you go where you are told, get in location X, explore, go through linear hallways, pick up objects, etc... Often, you'll encounter enemies (zombie-like creatures who appear out of nowhere) that you can kill with guns and other weapons. It's never all that challenging, which is a good thing because the controls are so awful the combat would've been very frustrating if it were a real challenge.
The other thing the game does very well (but is underutilized) is that the townspeople go about their own lives independently of what you're doing. They wake up, go to work, then go out to a restaurant or go drinking, then go back home, then sleep. Sometimes, I see some of the characters is an unexpected location, and it's a nice surprise, and gives the town an extra feeling of authenticity. I haven't seen this done so well since all the way back to The Last Express in 1997.
Finally, I always felt that with a ton of tweaks and polishing, this could have been one of the greatest games ever made. But in its current state, it's not even close. Fix the bugs, update the graphics, make the story less absurd (though it was intriguing all the way through, it got way too bizarre for me in the end), and you've got yourself a great game.",1494085359,1494085359,True,4,0,0.585151493549346924,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Se sono le somiglianze con Twin Peaks a tenervi alla larga da questo titolo sappiate che non è tutto ciò che il gioco ha da offrire, anzi, Deadly Premonition è un miscuglio di generi, c'è dentro anche l'horror e lo splatter (tra le altre cose). E se non siete fan di Twin Peaks nessun problema, anzi forse ve lo saprete godere di più.
Ma cominciamo dai difetti, altro elemento di cui questo gioco soffre ed è rinomato:
1)LA GRAFICA:
è datata, ovviamente ci sono stati degli intoppi che hanno portato a rimandare continuamente l'uscita del gioco, che palesemente sarebbe dovuto uscire nell'epoca ps2. Ma è un fatto assai trascurabile se non siete nati l'altro ieri, inoltre ci sono diverse scene che anche con questo livello tecnico sapranno a lasciarvi a bocca aperta.
2)LE ANIMAZIONI: 
Spesso ridicole, ma i giapponesi sono soliti metterle, quindi...
3)L'AUDIO:
capita spesso che le voci registrate siano sotto tono o addirittura troppo alte. Anche questo nulla di che;
4)I COMANDI:
Come shooter siamo su uno stile tipo Resident Evil 4. Anche con pad 360 si spara coi pulsanti dorsali (non i grilletti, ma RB e LB), cercare di ottenere headshot col pad vi stuferà ben presto.
5)LA FISICA DEI VEICOLI:
Improponibile, una delle cose peggiori del gioco, e dovrete guidare parecchio in questo titolo. In particolare quando dovrete raggiungere due specifiche località in alta montagna vedrete i sorci verdi;
6)I BUG IN GENERALE:
Crash repentini del gioco (meno male che i salvataggi sono istantanei, quindi non c'è rischio di corrompere il proprio savegame) e dopo metà gioco vi troverete qualche strada in cui gli pneumatici dell'auto finiranno sotto il livello del terreno, portando l'auto a rallentare di molto se non addirittura quasi a fermarsi.
7)LA LOCALIZZAZIONE IN ITALIANO:
Difetto non imputabile agli sviluppatori (non completamente almeno). L'audio è in inglese con sottotitoli in italiano, ma se la vostra conoscenza della prima non vi consente di capire cosa viene detto, la vostra comprensione dei dialoghi nonché della storia quindi, ne soffrirà, e molto. Io leggevo i sottotitoli e al contempo ascoltavo i dialoghi, e vi posso dire che ci sono molti errori, traduzioni che potrebbero sviarvi o confondervi. Addirittura alcuni obiettivi di steam hanno i nomi in spagnolo e una volta in una quest secondaria un paio di frasi erano sottotitolate in tedesco!

Non inserisco l'orologio tra i difetti perché semplicemente non lo è. Vi viene l'orticaria all'idea di avere le missioni a tempo? Uccelli vostri sarebbe la risposta che per prima mi viene in mente, ma qui il fattore tempo è abbastanza relativo. Se arriverete ""tardi"" ad una missione non la fallirete. Facciamo un esempio: dovete trovarvi in un luogo tra le 10 e le 17, arrivate alle 16:30 e non riuscite a finirla prima delle 17 (come il sottoscritto), non c'è problema. Ci riproverete il giorno dopo sempre tra le 10 e le 17. (Questo era solo un esempio, non tutte le missioni devono terminare in una fascia oraria prestabilita)
Se vi interessa completare il gioco al 100% allora il discorso cambia leggermente. Le quest secondarie sono più difficili in termini di tempo, ma comunque il fallimento ""causa orologio"" non esiste in questo gioco. 
Vi interessa solo la storia principale? Benissimo, ci sono ben due metodi per mandare il tempo avanti veloce: dormire o fumare. Sì le sigarette non vi faranno accorgere del tempo scorre, letteralmente.

Passiamo quindi alla parte più ardua (almeno da descrivere) del titolo, i pregi:
1)LA TRAMA:
Come sopra, non è solo Twin Peaks. Posso dirvi altro senza spoilerare? A parte che è scritta molto meglio della maggior parte dei giochi, non posso aggiungere altro.
2)I PERSONAGGI:
Tra i migliori personaggi mai incontrati in un gioco. Vi affezionerete a loro e al loro carattere.
3)LE MUSICHE:
Molte (non tutte) sono davvero gradevoli. Ad un certo punto del gioco sarete in grado di comprare dei veicoli, ognuno di essi avrà un brano diverso che partirà quando salirete nell'auto.
4)IL GAMEPLAY:
Fate finta che questo punto sia anche nella lista dei difetti (fisica veicoli e fasi di shooting), ma lo metto anche qui perché in questo gioco si possono fare molte cose. È un mix di generi non solo nella trama ma anche nelle parti giocate. È uno shooter horror, un investigativo, ha qualche elemento di GTA, qualcuno di Silent Hill, e molto altro.
Potrete sapere in qualunque momento dove saranno gli abitanti della cittadina guardando la mappa, potrete spiarli al lavoro o a casa. Potete andare a pesca, leggere fondi di caffé per prevedere il futuro, svolgere quest secondarie, cambiarvi d'abito (se non volete avere nubi di mosche attorno), farvi la barba (o farvela crescere!), completare una collezione di carte (NON LEGGETENE LE DESCRIZIONI, SPOILERANO LA TRAMA!), giocare a freccette, pranzare coi colleghi (o da soli all'albergo), e molto altro. 
5)I DETTAGLI:
Per essere un gioco ""epoca ps2"" ha molte chicche. Quando supererete un auto col buio, i suoi fari da dietro vi abbaglieranno per un istante, c'è un navigatore ""abbozzato"" nel veicolo che guidate (palesemente incompiuto: indizio che con più tempo e fondi avrebbero potuto fare molto di più a quello che già c'è, forse?), le auto hanno anche frecce e tergicristalli funzionanti (e voi direte: a che mi serve? Io vi dico che era da Driver che non vedevo le frecce utilizzabili), hanno anche la benzina e i danni da tenere d'occhio, dovete cambiarvi d'abito per non puzzare, farvi la barba (lo so, queste 2 le ho messe anche sopra, ma sono comunque chicche di cui tener conto). L'orologio non è lì solo per le missioni principali, difatto i negozi apriranno o chiuderanno in base all'ora (i locali aprono la sera, mentre il supermercato chiude), dovrete tenere d'occhio i livelli di fame e di sonno del protagonista (soddisfabili in maniere diverse).

I highly reccommend anyone picking this game up if your willing to go through a little trouble fixing.",1493945823,1493945823,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Это определенно игра не для всех. В ней тяжело разобраться, она неприятна снаружи и обладает скверным характером. Техническое несовершенство будет бесить вас практически все время, которое вы за ней проведете. Звуки взлетающих птиц похожи на вертолет или серию выстрелов из духового ружья, а топот детских ног по полу напоминает топот дрессированных коней на параде, цокающих подковами по мостовой. Графическая составляющая отталкивает, а физика управления автомобилями вообще заставляет истерически смеяться. Как управлять этим неврастеническим корытом на колесах?

""Deadly Premonition"" позволяет себе вообще ничего никому не объяснять, не подсказывать и плевать она на все хотела. Дополнительные миссии иногда превращаются в форменное издевательство. Вам нужно принести ингредиенты для готовки одному из главных персонажей, Эмили. Но сейчас уже 8 вечера. Дверь дома закрыта. Вернемся завтра после сна на большой кровати в собственном доме. На следующий день в 6 часов вечера выясняется, что должен идти дождь. И вы снова злой отправляетесь спать. После этого, в шесть, во время дождя вы стучитесь в дверь, с ужасом понимая, что несколько часов назад случайно съели ветчину, необходимый для квеста ингредиент. Не беда, сходим в магазин и купим. Однако магазин никогда не работает в дождь, и вам снова нужно вылавливать необходимые условия. Геймпад летит в окно, а ""Deadly Premonition"" вылетает на рабочий стол.

В этой игре вообще много чего можно делать - спать, есть, бриться, ездить на машинах, рыбачить, курить, вызывать полицейскую машину, менять костюмы под настроение, а когда они становятся грязные отправлять их в химчистку, гадать на кофе, ходить по магазинам, выполнять кучу второстепенных миссий, раскрывающих детали сюжета и характеры жителей города. Вы учитесь всем этим оперировать, использовать правильно и в нужное для определенной ситуации время.
Однако. Стоит только перетерпеть все это, и вы понимаете - внутри скрывалась невероятно глубокая история с уникальным, очень интересным сюжетом, великолепно проработанными персонажами и сильнейшей атмосферой, напоминающей творения Линча, в первую очередь его ""Твин Пикс"", смешанный с внешностью Наоми Уоттс и Джоэля Осмента в лицах главных героев.

Именно последнее - сюжет и персонажи просто не оставляют выбора между терпеть или не играть. Играть хочется. Каждую минуту вы готовы идти вперед, прорываясь через любые препятствия. Только бы узнать кто же из жителей Гринвейла тот самый маньяк с топором в дождевом плаще, сводящий воедино искусство и убийства. Кто дергает за ниточки и что вообще тут происходит. Шикарный главный герой, с которым вы себя олицетворяете, будет продираться через это вместе с вами, но никогда не опустит нос и не потеряет свое фирменное чувство юмора. Не так ли Зак?
Уникальный проект для людей, которые готовы принять эту интереснейшую игру такой, какая она есть.

Other than that the gameplay is sub par, the quick time events tedious and the graphics look really bad especially considering that this game came out in 2013. Music can get a bit boring as there are just a handful of tracks you'll keep hearing over and over again and the audio effects aren't very special.

Personally I think they should just remake this game on another more powerful engine so that it can shine. It is well worth the pain of constantly restarting the game and running with various compatibility options and admin priviledges to go thru the story but I wish I didn't have to.

You ever thought the biggest enemy in a game would be a boss right? Or perhaps a really cryptic level that has no online solution? Well, with this little gem of a game the biggest foe you'll have to face is the actual game itself.

Deadly Premonition was made by SWERY 65, a man whose name must be inspired at least in part by the legendary Suda51 (F***ing rip-off... I think). In this game you play as Agent Francis York Morgan who's been assigned by the FBI to assist in a murder that has occurred in the quiet, quaint, and mysterious town of Greenvale. Along the way, you meet demons, zany town residents, and the most random usable in-game items ever. Really, Morgan? You're going to take some salmon from a demonic locker and eat it to restore your hunger? You disgust me.

The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition is that it really wants to suck the c*** of Twin Peaks more than any other game I've ever played. Francis York Morgan acts in a very similar manner to Agent Dale Cooper, there's tons of supernatual dream imagery represented in red, and personalities in the police officers that mirrors the behavior of the police department of Twin Peaks. And... that's fine, I suppose, but between Deadly Premoniton and Twin Peaks, Twin Peaks is clearly the superior form of entertainment for several reasons.

The story in Deadly Premoniton isn't particularly written that well. The over-the-top characters are so ridiculous and unbelievable that it's hard to take anything within the game seriously. There's seriously a guy who rolls around in a wheelchair and his assistant speaks in rhymes after listening to his boss whisper in his ear... every... single... time.. he talks!

The game's presentation also doesn't help it much. The game was made for PS3 and that's what it looks like it was made for... very EARLY PS3 at least. Textures on characters and backgrounds are very basic. And characters animate and gesticulate so robotically and their voice actors put so little effort in that every cutscene is either a blast to watch or  more draining than the sewer great I poured my victim's blood into.

Wait... what?

The game handles... alright. The driving is very jerky and uncontrollable at times, and the cover shooting is nonsensical. You can walk freely but to aim at enemies or reload your gun you have to hold the Space bar- which locks you immediately in one space, leaving you unable to move- and you aim with your mouse. It's very clunky and confusing as to why the designers had such an outdated third-person shooter mechanic in the game. But other than that, the game is pretty responsive. But the driving and shooting take up so much that it really is a drawback for the experience.

Now, of all the things that irritate me in this game, I'd say the biggest offender would be the bugs and crashed. My God, I haven't played anything this bad since... Well, actually Fallout: New Vegas. But that game would still run just find after I'd reboot it. There are several parts of the game that most people on threads complain about equally for crashing. Hell, even one of my favorite let's-players had his game freeze up on him mid-session. If this is such a big problem, why haven't the developers ever released a new patch for the PC port? I got to a point in my game where Iliterally could not progress no matter what advice I took, so I decided to look up the rest of the story online and call it quits.

But despite my qualms with Deadly Premonition... I was still charmed by it (oddly enough). Despite all the awkwardness and irritating crashes, I enjoyed the over-the-top cheesey quirkiness of the game, because it seemed to have a self-awareness to it at least. Does it save it from a thumbs down? Of course not! But I thought it was worth mentioning.

Deadly Premonition is a game with a lot of effort put into it, but executed very horribly. I will warn any potential buyers now, this game WILL crash on you. You will have to fight it constantly to get it to work, and even when it does you'll remain nervous about when it could possible crash again. I think that makes this game not worth recommending. You want some good horror and 3rd person cover shooting? Play Spec Ops: The Line.

By that I mean that this game astounded me from start to finish, both in good ways, and in bad ways. For example, the characters, story and development of everything in the game are among the best I've ever seen. BUT the game can't really run at a stable 60/30 fps, tends to dip randomly after long periods of play and has occasional crashes.

I was lucky to only have the above problems, sound problems, constant crashes, extreme fps issues, things just not working in general among many, many other issues plague this port, and probably most of the original game as well. If somehow, somewhere this game were to be fixed/re-ported I would not doubt this game to be a GOTY contender at all. Even if its kind of culty. And Awesome.

Because the port and everything else are so bad I can't recommend this game. If you want to give it a shot you'll be able to tell in the first 2 hours if your pc can run it relatively well. If so, enjoy this diamond. If not, sorry but its just more dirt to tread on (and return).

A yes no system can't explain this at all... I like the game and would probably say its an EXTREMELY rare (for me at least) 8.8/10. I didn't have enough problems to really hate the tech side of the game, but it is a port. A bad port at that and not something you'd want if it doesn't work...

Ignoring the fact that this is one atrocious port that constantly crashes and is very unstable at the best of times, and has wild fps rates, Deadly Premonition is an amazing experience. Inspired by the series Twin Peaks, it bases itself around a small town where a bunch of murders have happened. You play as Agent York, solving the crimes and uncovering secrets as you go. 

-The game has comedic value; some intentional and others not so much (character idle poses are so stupid they are funny) which gives it some charm and somewhat detracts from the pain of getting it to run. 
-QTEs are a nightmare sometimes, so prepare to die! 
-Car controls are very clunky and steering is on a whole different level. 
-Similar to Silent Hill, there are sections which are nightmarish and a seperate reality from the current part of the game. You find enemies here which you have to fight (or run past if you really wanted to). Combat controls very much like an old Resident Evil title and work well.
-The soundtrack is very unique and fits the game brilliantly

I have probably NEVER seen a storyline compared to it.

Whether the Rewards are worth it or not is a matter of taste. The whole World feels so alive as well as the characters. Even the side Characters are memorable!

But what of the negatives? Well there are a MASSIVE amount of issues here, which is a huge shame, since this game could be sooooo freaking amazing! here are my biggest parts, starting off easy:

as already said, the map rotation is a heavy pain in the a$$.
Driving mechanics.... OMG..... think your a cool kid for doing a 360 degree spin? thats a joke compared to what you can expect here! if you do 2x complete spins + half a flip by simply driving straight ahead on a flat road and VERY SLIGHTLY move your steering wheel..... yeah great mechanics....
Awful pc port that needs patching (around 30 min) with the game still beeing unstable. (playing in windowed mode via DPfix (mod) drastically reduced crashes at the cost of a grey bar at the bottom - i gladly sacrifice a tiny bit of view for much better stability.) on a side note: i could play 12H straight without crashing, but thats different for everyone
BUT the true Horror i had during gameplay are those FU**ING Quick time events! there are way too much in the game. that crap really ruins the whole fun and in fact is like the only way of dying in this game.

I would totally recommend this masterpiece at 50€ if the said issues weren't present, but as it stands out..... try your luck when it's discounted. or if you don't want a crashy game WATCH A LETS PLAY! it's really a great story!

My score as is: 6/10
+1 for better port
+3 without those freaking QTE's

I see that people are having trouble with the game crashing. It happened to me too so you have to be patient though. Just save the game regularly.

Since you can read what the story is about, I'll leave that part (you'll enjoy it if you love Twin peaks and other small town detective stories.) Let me tell you what you can do in this game.

- You can explore the whole town!! It's actually a nice place with many restaurants and bars

- Unique characters (japanese devs always make the most interesting characters)

- Hunger and sleep meter which you'll have to take care of. (lunch at your hotel? or at some diner in town)

- So many side quests to do though it'll help if you use a guide. (Cause navigating in this game is kinda hard)

- In game time which you'll have to keep track of to do some certain quests. (idk why but this game reminds me of harvest moon. The town people walks all over the town. You will even pass by their car sometimes. They have their own daily routine so it helps if you know them too haha)

- Fishing spots

- Filling gas at a gas station

- Weather system (don't forget to turn your wiper on while driving in the rain!)

- The otherworld (This is where most of your main missons take place. Be warned. Ghosts! hold your breath so that they can't see you!)

- Quick time events (kinda hard though)

- Shave or grow a beard

- Change your clothes regularly or you'll attract flies




Cons:

- Enemies are too annoying. They will start spawning everywhere in the otherworld missions. (You had to shoot a lot of them in the prologue before you reach the town)

- Map is hard to navigate. But i guess that makes the game more realistic?

- crashing

- The otherworld missions are too long T_T One cannot stay inside a world where there are full of ghosts for too long.

Buyer beware: This game is buggy as all hell. It crashes randomly. There is a workaround but you need patience to play it.
 
That said this is one hell of an interesting game the dialogue and characters are unique and strange. Like David Lynch made a Twin Peaks game. One mission has you racing a woman home before her pot cools down. Pot as in soup pot.

The gameplay is pretty bad though. Enemies are more annoying than dangerous. You spend a large part of the game driving around and you get very little clue as to where and when the side quests take place.

It was buggy though I had to use DPfix atfirst. Then I had to remove it because I got an Aiming glitch that only works by alt-tabbing out of fullscreen mode. Which with DPfix makes you crash. Instead I downloaded sweetfx and kept the game in 720p. For the crashing I used the CFF_Explorer fix, if it was a really bad crash that happened consistently I used compatibility mode windows98/ME.

A lot of the negative reviews it gets are about the PC port being buggy - I hate to be that ""works on my machine"" guy but I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, there were a few glitches but honestly I found them pretty funny (like people floating outside their cars), and they didn't impede my progress at all. Admittedly it did crash once (and kept doing so at that point), but for some reason putting it in windowed mode fixed it (and I switched back after).

That aside, the actual game is great. Great music, setting, story and characters. Gameplay is a bit wonky but you get used to it. There's also a lot of side missions to let you know more about the side characters and the town, and lots of cool (and useful) things you can find/buy. The only gripes I have are that some sections could drag on for a bit too long, and were quite tedious, like following someone who's driving painstakingly slowly for ages. Also the driving controls are terrible, let's not dance around that. Early cars barely turn at all, and later cars go way too fast and turn too sharply, making them flip over and spin wildly out of control. Lastly, there are extended QTE sequences that are also pretty tedious, and you usually die immediately if you mess up, having to go back and start the entire sequence again.

However, even with all that, this game is one of the few these days that made me actually want to come back and keep playing, and see the story through to the end. The characters felt realistic and had depth instead of being generic flat characters like in most other games.

I don't even know what genre this game would be. It isn't really a horror game, and it's not really a murder mystery either, it sort of combines elements from lots of different genres, and has a wacky humorous theme mixed in with darker elements. It's sort of like a weirder Japanese version of Twin Peaks.

tl;dr I had a lot of fun playing this. It was a great game from start to finish, even with some iffy patches along the way. Contrary to what most of the negative reviews say, it's not ""unplayable"". It runs pretty well on my mid-tier PC, and has setting adjustment options.

Just try it out if it looks like something you'd enjoy, and don't worry about all the horror stories about the PC port. They're mainly gross exaggeration.",1485213011,1485215300,True,3,0,0.522066414356231689,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Like, why the hell does the map rotate in the map-menu? It's confusing as hell, you can't find anything because of that. Oh and why do I have to look at it so closely? Why is the game using the music so strangely? It sometimes feels like there are four tracks and it's using some of them in the weirdest moments. Why are does survival/shooting session so boring and tedious, and why aren't they integrated better in the rest of the game? Why is the car so slow and why is the steering angle so narrow?Why...?

You would think that ""what the f*ck?"" would be a better question to go along the strange nature of the game. But at first, you'll be far too busy questionning every decision made during the development process, to really, thoroughly pay attention to how much the game is up there in its head. You are probably going to hate it for a while. But you are going to stick with it, wanting to come back.

At first, the main character makes you stay. He talks to himself, to you maybe. And you'll want to hear what he has to say when you'll first him talk to you about ""Jaws"". Then you are going to stay for the plot, ripping off Twin Peaks so amazingly well and with its very own quirks, with a whole new level of bizarre, that you won't even be able to say that it is plagiarism, when it obviously is plagiarism. Then you are going to understand the crappy controls, deal with it, and actually explore the map, talk to every character and learn about there great and diverse personalities, even with the poor navigation help that the game gives you (it's hard to find anything with the game this ugly). And hopefully, you are going to be touched, creeped out and amused (a lot) by the story, amazed by the twists and turns, the gameplay even, not in it's execution, but in its structure and ideas that wan and will works (sometimes not, let's be honest). And hopefully, you are going to LOVE IT.

That's what happened to me. That's what happened to all my friends who enjoyed it. Give it six hours. Give it the time to lead you to the big reunion in the community center. At that point, you'll be far too concern about the plot to let the amazingly low production value steer you away from the game. Hell, you'll probably even enjoy the game despite AND because of that poor production value that, somehow, adds to the game's personality.

I do realize that I shouldn't recommand that PC version because it is really unstable. I only played 11 hours so far and already had a three or four crashes. But hear me out; DPfix for the resolution and windowed without border mode + controller patch from the devs, and you can do this. Save often! If you can't play it on Xbox 360 (the best version) or on PS3 (same but with new cutscenes and a framerate from hell), go for this one. It's not great, but it's just passable enough not to ruin the game (IF YOU SAVE OFTEN).


TL;DR
The cult following doesn't come out nowhere. This one is a giver and a taker. You'll need patience, sure. But once you are in, the game won't let you go and there is a big chance it will become one of your favorites. Unfortunatley, it is a really (really) poor port on PC, but of the greatest diamond in the rough I have ever played. I recommend the game wholeheartedly. And if you can't have it another way, I recommend the PC version...reluctantly.",1485130828,1492650862,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Попасть в нее игра может по разным причинам: излишняя жестокость, спецефичность геймплея или излишняя психоделичность и непонятность происходящего на экране.

De ezt meg kell tennem...

Ez a játék egyszerűen fantasztikus! Osztozom azon honfitársaim véleményén, mely szerint az elejétől a végéig teljesen leköti a felhasználót, s közben élvezi minden egyes percét. Várja, hogy mi fog történni a következő percben, vajon hogyan fogják csavarni a történetet? S ki egyáltalána  gyilkos? Mindezen kérdésekre folyamatosan fogjuk kapni a meglepő impulzusokat, ahogy haladunk előre a nyomozásban.

Ami a leginkább tetszett s egyben meg is lepett, hogy a játék nyílt világú. Ilyen a mostani nyomozós játékokban nem nagyon van, ritka hollónak számít e tekintetben a DP. Egyszerűen oda megyünk, ahova akarunk, mehetünk enni, pecázni, aludni, inni-enni, interakcióba léphetünk emberekkel, illetve a nyomozásunk során gyanusítottnak kikiáltott személyekkel is.

A történet: már bevezetőmben is utaltam rá, hogy olyan, mintha egy hosszabb thrillert néznénk. Érdekes koncepció, de sokak számára ismerős lehet jó néhány eleme a '90-es évek sorozatából, a Twin Peaksből. Itt is kapunk egy FBI-ügynököt, akinek van némi skizofrén hajlama, ahol a nyomozás során igen csak vicces helyzeteket, párbeszédeket produkál. Adva van egy gyilkos, aki igen kegyetlen módon végzi ki áldozatát s ebben örömét is leli benne. Megismerhetjük a kisváros főbb embereit, akiknek fel tudjuk fedni nem éppen makulátlan előéletüket. Mindenki sáros valamiben, ami hozzáad a főtörténetszál megértéséhez és további spekulációkra adhat okot a gyilkost kilétének illetően. A másik legjobb s leginkább megadja a játék ízét az a ,,Másvilág"". Mivel egy nyílt világú horrorjátékról van szó, s a nyomozás során ,,elutazunk"" e különös s rendkívül sötét atmoszférájú helyre, ahol különös lények, az ,,árnyékok"" vadásznak ránk a legkülönfélébb módon. Ez a ,,Másvilág"" gyakorlatilag abból áll, hogy a nyomozás helyszíne a valóságbeli méretei teljesen átalakulnak, újabb helyiségek jönnek létre - ezzel megadva egy jelentősebb paráztatási időnek és hangulatnak -, amelyek az eredeti helyszín egy eltorzult, elhagyatott világát festik elénk, ahol nem minden az, aminek látszik. Ezen adalékok szolgálnak arra, hogy a egy-egy nyomot teljes egészében összerakjunk, s kapjunk az adott történetszálhoz egy kis mozaikot, ahol a végén minden egyes mozaikdarabka egy nagy egésszé rendeződik, ezzel megtudva ki is a gyilkos, akit oly hevesen kutatunk s aki rettegésben tartja e barátságosnak látszó, eldugott kisvárost. 

Bár lassúnak indul a történet, kb. a felénél rendesen rákapcsolnak, egy perc nyugtunk sem lesz, amíg meg nem oldjuk az ügyet. A program törődik azzal, hogy a játékos ne unatkozzon, folyton rátesz egy lapáttal a meghökkentő történésekre. Abszolúte nem kiszámítható, hogy ki a gyilkos, az ember folyton töprengeni fog rajta, s minél inkább többet gondolkodik rajta, annál meglepőbben fogja a program ráébreszteni arra, hogy eleddig rossz nyomon járt. A folyamatos csavarok, meglepettséget garantálni fogja, ezt 100%-ig bizton állítom. Nem akartam elhagyni e rejtélyes kisvárost, de sajnos mégis kénytelen voltam. Egyszer mindennek vége szakad...

A zene: kiemelkedő munka, ami egyes jelenetekhez nagyon jól megkomponált. Hangulatos, szívbemarkoló, elgondolkodtató. Tán sokszor ismétlődik egy-egy szám, ám ha az ember folyamatosan játszik vele, idővel rájön, hogy ez a sok számismétlés mennyire jól passzol bizonyos jelenetek, szituációk közben.

Ami a negatívumot illeti... Bár a játék eredetileg konzolra lett tervezve, ami meg is látszik rajta, azt kell mondjam, nagyon szépen kidolgozott s jól irányítható. Talán az egyik legidegesítőbb az a célzás: nehézkesen lehet mozgatni, ami több ellenség likvidálásnál azért igen csak bosszantó. A másik negatívum, hogy az ellenfelekből nem sok van. Többnyire van egy darab, aminek 3-4 variációja létezik. Ám hangulatba, illetve néhány alkalommal az emberre rá tudják hozni a frászt. A harmadik, hogy a játék néha ismeretlen okból kifagy, ezért érdemes majdnem minden lehetséges mozdulatnál menteni.

E hiányosságok nélkül nagyon ajánlom, aki szereti a rejtélyes gondolkoztató, feszültséget mindvégig fenntartó játékot, amely a legvégsőkig izgalomban tartja a felhasználókat. Sűrűn szokott akcióban lenni, 2,5 euróért simán megéri e nagyszerű kaland végigjátszása.

Кровь текла из глаз, но я делала скидку на год издания (2004). Здесь же 2010. Возможно, причины кроются в том, что Deadly Premonition выходила первоначально на консолях. Но поверьте, даже несмотря на такой ""ужас"", сюжет затянет вас настолько сильно, что вы перестанете обращать внимание на такие мелочи, как кривые задники и плохую мимику персонажей.
    [*]У меня игра [u]дважды зависала, раз пять вылетала[/u]. Сохраняйтесь как можно чаще. Так же есть отличный гайд, как побороть проблемы технического характера.

Боялась сказать лишнего в обзоре, чтобы не спойлернуть. Но могу сказать точно, что буду советовать эту игру своим друзьям, как хороший образец  необычной игры. У меня потекла ностальгическая слеза.

The game certainly has a peculiar, low-budget charm to it. The combination of Twin Peaks weirdness, Silent Hill otherworldliness, and cheesy TV sitcom-inspired humor is ridiculous...but it works. At least, it works when it's not crashing.

And boy, does it crash! Crashes occur so frequently that I'm often unable to reach another save point between CTDs. I've lost progress so many times now that I really just can't force myself to give it another shot. After 18 hours, I can truthfully say that I made a serious effort to enjoy this game, but I'm done.

Look, I have a fairly high tolerance for the shortcomings of low-budget games; I can generally shrug off outdated graphics, minor bugs, bad voiceovers, clunky controls, etc. But 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay between crashes? Not even I'm willing to put up with that.

I wish I could recommend Deadly Premonitions...I just can't. The story and characters are often highly amusing, but the crashes are not. For what it's worth, if a stability patch ever comes out for this game then I'll happily give it another go and revise my rating.

This is a FANTASTIC game, but the PC version is butchered beyond belief. It REALLY is as bad as people say. Heed everybody's warning.

I bought it cheap for about 2 dollars before really realizing what I was getting in to. Simply seeing ""this is a bad port,"" wasn't enough to deter me. I've seen these comments elsewhere for games I really enjoyed playing the PC port of and thought, ""It can't be THAT bad."" But when your game immediately crashes on start up, you know you're going to have a bad time. 

This port is so butchered that somebody (independant from the company) made a patch to try and fix most of the issues that the game has. With the patch installed, I was able to get past the start-up screen. But, it still crashed. 

After much trial and error, I got this shit load of fuck to run in Windowed Mode in Windows 98 compatibiity (fullscreen makes the game crash even harder). Even then, the MAX amount of gameplay I would get at a time without it crashing was about 45 minutes. With that being said, I'm one of the lucky ones who actually got to play it with crashes that I could overcome. And I don't even know if I'd call that luck. 

The crashing isn't even consistant. Sometimes it's during a load screen, other times, it's when you're going to use an item out of the inventory. Sometimes, it's simply right in the middle of walking.. or when you're mid combat. The crashing also seems to intensify during rainy weather. It really ruins the game experience for me when I have to just hope and pray that the game doesn't crash on the next load screen. When I have to constantly say to myself, ""Dear god, I hope there's a phone coming up soon."" 

Your only hope is to save constantly. But the problem is that you can only save at phones, and if you are doing a Chapter Replay, you cannot save AT ALL. This is a huge problem if you're a completionist, or you want to just go back and do sidequests that are more useful (like the one for the radio). I lost so many man hours because the game would crash during a Chapter Replay, and all of my progress that I just made was gone. 

The game looks okay (graphically), but the frame rate is crappy. Sometimes York will have that ""stutter"" run because the game just can't keep up. In combat, I wasn't able to use the Grecotch (OP weapon that carries you through most of the game) because I just couldn't land a hit. Even while standing RIGHT in front of an enemy, hitting it from different angles, etc. Hits just weren't connecting, or it was delayed... I really don't know what the problem is. But in any case, every aspect of this game is ruined simply because it functions like garbage. I would have asked for my Steam refund, but it was already past the date in which I could return it, and I had poured so many ""play"" time in to it just trying to get the thing to work.. disappointing.

[h1]3/10 A good game, sadly a terrible port[/h1]
For quite some time now, serial killers across the United States of America have been putting red tree seeds into the mouths of young women & displaying their dead bodies in the shape of the Algiz rune (ᛉ), sometimes referred to as the “life rune”. The most recent case in the (fictional) town of Greenvale, Washington is no different. Anna Graham, an 18-year-old teenager dreaming of making it big in the city, was brutally murdered, her tongue bitten out, her carcass disemboweled, & then hung up on a tree. This calls FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to the scene. Though an expert in homicide cases, this eccentric investigator, who only confides in his imaginary partner Zach, proceeds to turn the entire town upside down with his outspoken nature & unconventional methods.

[h1]About the Game[/h1]
Deadly Premonition is a game with an outright cult following, but also, sadly, a rather problematic PC port. Its initial development started in 2004, but had to be halted in 2007. Eventually, production continued & it was released in 2010. By that time, several of its assets looked outdated, which surprisingly works in the title’s favor. The uncanny visuals, stellar framing, awkward animations, & at times strange voiceover all contribute to a slightly eerie atmosphere, whereas the funny dialogs & outright hilarious sound effects alleviate the mood just enough to not take the game too seriously.

The whole production was also so strongly influenced by David Lynch’s & Mark Frost’s Twin Peaks that it can feel like playing a video game adaptation. The series, like Deadly Premonition, takes place in a small, seemingly idyllic U.S. town where an FBI agent investigates a homicide case of a young girl &, in doing so, unravels a deep & dark secret surrounding the inhabitants while also engaging with ominous entities. In so far, Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro, feels like an homage to Lynch’s series, albeit with some prominent Japanese characteristics & tropes.

[h1]The PC Port[/h1]
Sadly, the PC port of this cut suffers greatly under several issues, which buyers should know about beforehand. First of all, getting the game to work can be quite a chore & it won’t run on many a machine. I played this on a 32-bit, Windows Vista Home Premium, Intel Core 2 CPU, Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT, 3070 MB RAM, DX 11 & I know that it runs on a Lenovo G50-80E5 laptop with Windows 10. Despite that, Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut only has a 1280×720 p resolution with washed out colors. During sunny days in Greenvale, everything looks almost sepia. Apart from that, it occasionally struggles to keep a steady 30 fps. The situation became worrisome when, after fishing out some documents in Ep 3, Ch 17 & heading out to Harry’s mansion, Deadly Premonition started to suffer greatly with the frame rate dropping down & staying around 9 fps with my peer’s Lenovo laptop heating up from a temperature of 41°C (105,8°F) to 105°C (221°F). Verifying the integrity of the game cache, rebooting the game, or turning the machine off & on did not help, & the situation stayed this way up until entering the Galaxy of Terror pub in Ep 3, Ch 20. The only way the story could be continued at that time was to hurry to some objective, save, shut down the game, wait, start playing again, save, & so on.

Other bugs included one where the game had to be restarted, because a key item disappeared from the inventory, one where weapons could not be selected, York walking through a door heading towards Polly’s room in the Great Deer Yard Hotel & falling through the floor, the character of Quint driving be- instead of inside his car & glitching in & out of Richard’s trailer, the game crashing whenever trying to leave the A&G Diner in Ep 1, Ch 9, Nick Cormack’s car not moving during Ep 2, Ch 12, & frequent crashes throughout. One method to reduce the likability of the last one is, of course, to play the game in compatibility mode, but that increases loading times to almost a minute & it does not help against the memory leak, which will inadvertently cause a crash. The game also comes with previous DLC included, but they will often not be activated in-game. Lastly, the PC port is also supposed to have controller support, but has issues recognizing these.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall, apart from the driving, the crashes, the bugs, & the overheating, I enjoyed most of Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut. I believe that, provided readers have a platform where the game immediately works as intended, they will have a good time with this game. The characters are fun, the story overall intriguing (apart from the ending), & the premonitions truly work in the game’s favor. Nevertheless, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend a PC port that is this problematic & that might fry one’s computer. Even though I like it per se, I adviseto stay away from the PC port.",1482538447,1482598481,False,12,0,0.530364453792572021,3,False,True,False,False,,,

Не могу не вспомнить, как был проработан каждый диалог, и всё это было вперемешку с интригующим сюжетом. Особенно мне понравилось игра Ребекки Винк, она озвучивала Эмили… А Гарри, помнишь его? Его загадки просто сносили мне крышу! Никак не мог понять бредит он или играет со мной. А помнишь, как мы собирали карточки, и проходили побочные квесты? Было здорово, тебе особенно нравились миссии с ездой, а я предпочитал задания замешанных на всяких мини играх. Это был интересный опыт… 

Наверное, именно таких игр сейчас не хватает. Но куда же без ложки дёгтя, верно Зак? Стоит упомянуть, что специальную PC версию сделали слишком лёгкой. Из-за этого экшен в игре стал более простым, однако в компенсацию этому они добавили вырезанные сцены, чтобы расширить сюжет. Это хорошо, но всё же, я бы предпочёл более сложный игровой процесс.
Знаешь Зак, я бы, пожалуй, сыграл в неё ещё раз… Интересно у SWERY будут ещё подобные проекты? Если да то, наверное, не скоро. Буду ждать его возвращения в игровую индустрию.""[/i]",1480376079,1662838154,True,8,0,0.606314182281494141,1,False,False,False,False,,,

It doesn't look very good. It controls poorly. The combat, hiding, and evasion scenes are even poorly designed, before you get to controlling them. I've had it crash several times. I've only played a short bit on PC to see how it would run, after completiting it on Xbox 360, and I've had force-quits multiple times. I've even heard of bugs that can prevent you from completing the game, which is the entire reason to play the game.  

But this game is enchanting. The story and characters, as much as you can say they are stolen from Twin Peaks, are fascinating and engaging. You will likely have numerous fits of laughter as you experience the quirky animations and dialogue. And the plot goes into perhaps even stranger and disturbing depths than Twin Peaks did. It's worth your time to stick with the game, even if the game is not to your liking, because the story is not to be missed.

That said, if a game that has numerous technical issues is going to bother you, then you shouldn't play it. You can experience the story elsewhere, and get most of the enjoyment from watching it as you would playing it, without having to struggle through what most people would consider a negative experience of completing the game's often tedious ""dungeon"" segments. 

(EDIT: There are more fixes popping up over time, such as CFF Explorer being able to edit the .exe file to improve performance, making the game large address aware to do the same, mods to improve or customize the appearance of the game, and fixes to controller support. Overall, it's not the mess it was 5 years ago, but it's still very rough. And it still crashes, even with every fix you might try. Runtime errors still plague the game, at least for me. Check the PCGamingWiki before you even start it, just to know the amount of problems this port has. I still can't recommend it at full price. Get the Xbox 360 version, or the Switch version, which are more stable. Or wait for a discount to $5 or less, unless you're willing to risk running out of time to refund it if you can't find a fix.)

I would say to absolutely wait for sales, even if you really want the game, and know you will enjoy it. This game goes on sale for as much as 90% off fairly regularly, such that I've purchased extra copies for others on several different occasions in the last few years, so you won't have to wait long to get a deal. I first purchased it for $15, as the original release on the Xbox 360, and didn't regret it one bit, but not everyone will get that same enjoyment, or have the same feelings. I can't recommend it at normal price, but cannot recommend it enough for $2.50-$5. Games like this make the binary recommendation system so difficult.

Entweder man läuft/fährt während der FBI-Ermittlung durch die Gegend oder man wird in eine Schattenwelt geworfen in der man mit Waffen die Zombie/Geist-Gegner niedermäht.

Action Gameplay ist eintönig, und viele Rätsel wirken wie aus nem billigen Adventure. Die Steuerung ist teils widerspenstig (Zielen mit der Waffe), teils sehr sensibel (Autofahrten).

Die Grafik is unterdurchschnittlich, die Animationen oft unfreiwillig komisch. Gesichtszüge schwanken meistens zw. festgefahrenem Grinsen, arroganter Selbstsicherheit oder erstaunten bis entsetzten Blick. 

Die Musikgestaltung besteht größtenteils aus 4-5 Lieder. Die Hintergrundmusik wechselt meist von einem einfachen Ohrwurm zu einer einfachen Action/Gruselthematik. Es gibt aber auch ein paar besondere musikalische Untermalungen.

[b][u]Warum also empfehle ich dieses Spiel?[/u][/b]

Deadly Premonition hat einfach eine der besten mitreißenden Mystery-Mörder Stories die man erleben sollte. Wer Twin Peaks mag, wird wahrscheinlich auch diese Story mögen (oder sich wegen den ganzen Anleihen die Haare raufen). Die Geschichte ist blutig und geht in die Extreme sodass man stellenweise sogar froh über die grobe veraltete Grafik sein kann.

Die Erzählung hat ihre Schwächen, gerade wenn auflockernde Szenen eingestreut sind wirkt das oft surreal, schlecht übersetzt oder so als hätten die Autoren überhaupt keine Ahnung wie Menschen humorvoll miteinander umgehen. Dies wird durch die Traumsequenzen, Mörderszenen und der generellen Hintergrundgeschichte aber mehr als ausgeglichen.

Gespielt wird in Kapiteln. Je nach Kapitel kann man sich unterschiedlich weit von der Haupterzählung entfernen. Dies betrifft dann das Erkunden von Greenvale und das Einsammeln von nicht gerade dezent platzierten Sammelobjekten. Ebenfalls kann man auch den wenigen Bürgern von Greenvale bei ihrem Tagwerk zuschauen oder deren Miniquests erledigen.

Dennoch schafft es dieser recht einfache Spielaufbau einen nach und nach die Personnen von Greenvale näherzubringen und man fühlt sich immer wieder mitgerissen wenn sich eine neue Erkenntnis im Fall vom Regenmantelmörder ergibt.

Tal vez,  pero desde mi humilde opinión  y experiencia  es uno de los videojuegos con una de las mejores tramas que jamás haya disfrutado porque eso es lo que sucedió que disfrute mucho de este título.

-Lo bueno: todo lo relacionado a la trama, dígase personajes, locación, ambientación  y por supuesto la estructura de dicha trama el planteamiento, desarrollo y desenlace (y vaya desenlace), la música genial el soundtrack.

-Lo malo: 1- la jugabilidad, estrictamente en  el manejo del personaje,  ya sea a pie en vehículo o en combate  bastante rustica por así decirlo.  2- los problemas técnicos, iluminación, sombras  y “crasheos” principalmente.

+Consejo: tus mejores amigos para disfrutar y avanzar en este juego son, los puntos de guardado, la compatibilidad con win 98 y el modo ventana, con esas tres cosas podrás avanzar en la historia si te llegas a quedar estancado.

+Conclusión: a pesar de todo lo malo que puede tener este juego, lo bueno del mismo vale 100 veces más. ¿lo recomendaría?

A very different game which is strange is a good way. The gameplay is very quirky and sometimes glitchy but somehow it fits the style of the game. Overall it benifits from its unique blend of comedy and ""horror"". The story and its progression are well done and keep you engaged and coming back despite the other technical issues with the game (crashs and corrupt saves). I would recommend backing up saves every chance you get. In all, I really enjoyed the experience and it has come to be a game that I will never forget. I purchased the game on sale for about $2.79CDN but I would have been happy with paying a little more.

Overall, it is an extremely unique game that is unlike anything I have experienced before. It has made a lasting impression on me that I will not be forgetting anytime soon.",1480124406,1511485228,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Constant crashes
- Wonky and buggy driving physics

1. Go to where the game is installed on your PC. For me it's at C > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut
2. Open the redist file and double-click the application called PhysX_SystemSoftware (.msi)

4. When that's finished, launch the game again.

che dire...un capolavoro assoluto!
di solito non mi sbilancio nelle recensioni ma questo titolo...bhe è qualcosa di unico.
La storia di ""Deadly Premonition"" ci vede coinvolti in una indagine in un piccolo paese di montagna in America, dove strani omicidi attirano l'attenzione del nostro agente del FBI Francis York Morgan, caffeinomane dalle spiccate doti investigative.
Subito l'impatto visivo ci fa immergere in un ""twin peaks "" giocabile...l'estro del personaggio, gli omicidi e i personaggi secondari sono così perfettamente incastrati tra loro che sembra di vivere la storia mentre si sta attaccati ore e ore per sbloccare ogni singolo achievement (cosa non per niente facile).

Ma tecnicamente come lo descriveremmo questo titolo?
è si un open world, ma è anche un survival horror e anche un'avventura grafica...è la summa dei giochi a mio parere!
Certo la grafica è quella di un gioco del 2010 e i comandi sono legnosi (Resident Evil 0 like) ma niente, niente può mettere in cattiva luce questo gioco perchè semplicemente : TI DIVERTE, LO AMI E QUANDO LO FINISCI I DISCORSI DI fRANCIS TI MANCHERANNO.

(Review updated 11/23/2016)
I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half. 
I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters. 

This is a wonderful game with a deep story.  VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues.  Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  
This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it. 

There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that)
It is called DPfix 0.9.5 ( http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up. 
Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

I nominated it for  the ""Game within a game"" Award because this game has so many things to do in it.  You can fish, drive around and a few other silly things that makes the game a little less spooky without taking away from the gem that it is. 

If you ever liked Twin Peaks.. you might like this game!
If you tried the game and hated it... Give it another chance. Go in excepting nothing. you might be surprised how much you like it. 

If you loved the game, Go check out Twin Peaks.

was like falling out of an airplane midflight, only to land safely in a hot tub at the Playboy Mansion

To be sure, there's a definite influence from the tv show Twin Peaks (I've only seen the first episode
of the show and can safely make this claim), but the supernatural story, the memorable weird and 
unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, the twists, open world to explore, humor,
atmosphere, and adventure that bleeds its own distinct charm, this is one I'll always remember.

(Note: Nominated for the ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award and not just because it's the first time I've ever seen a squirrel in a video game scream like a monkey, thought that scene definitely helped)

Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical  discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt. 

- Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy ""nightmare"" levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels.
You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).

- Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around.
(The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)

- Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic. 

- Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).

- Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that. 
The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer. 

- Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.",1479936850,1479980977,True,0,0,0.4847908616065979,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Но тот дух американской глубинки, которым славился первоисточник, передан здесь превосходно. Ведь в перерывах между миссиями здесь очень уж хочется зайти в кафе, заказать кофе и поболтать с местными аборигенами, а то и помочь им в чем-либо. Конечно, слепого следования по тропам Твин Пикса ждать здесь не стоит, но завязка здесь точь-в-точь, а главный герой - такой же экстравагантный агент ФБР и любитель кофе, как и Дейл Купер.

비주얼이나 그래픽적 느낌은 서양게임 느낌이 물씬나고

보이스도 일판도 영문 보이스 only를 깔고 가는 게임

스토리는 2~3류 애니메이션에서 볼수있는 스토리입니다.

연출도 그래요, 특히 브금자체도 일상 개그 애니에서 쓸법한것을 자꾸 깔아대서

영미권 비주얼 캐릭터들이 영어로 일본특유의 만담개그를 하며

일본 애니메이션 틱한 브금이 깔리면 그만큼 괴악한게 없었습니다

개인적으로 개그 파트에서 불쾌한 골짜기 현상을 많이 겪었네요

이럴꺼면 그래픽이나 일본어 성우로 애니틱하게 만들던가...

특히 브금 만든놈 면상 한번 갈기고 싶을정도로

듣기 불편하면서 힘 쭉 빠지는 브금을 반복해서 틀어줍니다.

그 미연시에 나오는 브금있잖아요 딱 그거..

아무튼 서양적 비주얼에 어울리는 스토리와 연출은 아닙니다.

After finishing Deadly Premonition I must say that this was a very unique and very interesting experience. Game has a very good atmosphere, and somewhat creepy. I felt kinda odd at the beginning. Characters are very interesting too, and the voice acting is great. As for story, well it's a very interesting and a good story about some detective who comes to a small town to investigate the recent murder. Can't remember the last time when I played the game with such an interesting story. There is a supernatural stuff to the story too, in my opinion kinda more supernatural stuff than it was actually needed, but still good story overall, except for ending which is really bad and stupid. I expected some good closure, but got terrible. As for gameplay, well gameplay is pretty bad and repetitive, but still I found it fun at first. Good enough for this game anyway. While playing with keyboard, you can't aim with the mouse. With default controls you need to press space to go into the aim mode. Driving cars was actually fun and driving controls were fine. There are also a bunch of side missions that you can do in that town. You can fast travel too, however only if you complete some side mission and since I didn't know about that I went everywhere with a car.

Now for the quality of the port. This truly is a bad port. You need dpfix to be able to play the game without most issues. You can get dpfix here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix You just need to extract this to your game directory, and you can edit dpfix after that if you want. Without it, you won't be able to have resolution above 1280x720 I think. Also problems with crashes etc. I still did have crashes, but only in two episodes. So I just used save files that I found somehwere on the forum to be able to progress, since my game was constantly crashing at the same moments during these episodes. As for performances, I had a few minor issues.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] Amazing atmosphere, somewhat creepy, very interesting and a good story with some good characters and the voice acting. Pretty bad port, but most issues can be fixed by using dpfix. I definitely recommend playing this game though, since it's a very unique experience and quite the good one.

Even after following a lengthy list of instructions and applying the DPFIx, DP: Directors' Cut features a butchered, shoddy port that is prone to frequent crashing, weird speed ups and slow downs, bizarre physics mishaps, corrupted saves, and a really, really weird issue where playing for more than two hours in one sitting can result in some... interesting... consequences for the engine.

And even if the game wasn't completely broken, it still suffers from a myriad of problems. The combat is abysmal. Not only does it feel tacked on, it literally is tacked on, as confirmed by Swery65, who explained that his publisher forced the decision in an effort to garner more sales. The combat is tedious, featuring only two distinct enemies: ones that die quickly with no effort and ones that take up five minutes of your time in pure tedium bullshit. If the combat is supposed to provoke a challenge, it is easily negated by how easily you can cheese the gameplay by acquiring infinite ammo and durability weapons early in the game, but not even instakill weapons can save you from a never ending supply of quicktime events.

Disregarding the gameplay, the graphics are incredibly poor. I'm not one to turn my nose at dated graphics, as some of my favorite games are before Steam was even a thing, yet Deadly Premonition released in 2010, the same year as Red Dead Redemption, Halo Reach, and Mass Effect 2. Going up against these games graphically is a bit ridiculous when the game looks like it came out in... 2006, but whatever.

At this point, you may be wondering why there's a postive thumbs up next to my review, since I've done nothing but trash Deadly Premonition. Well, the truth is that this game is the best worst game I've ever played. Like I've pointed out, there's just so much wrong with DP: DC, and yet, it's an incredible experience. All of the characters are well written and lovable, and all form a cohesive, believable community and setting. Dialogue is as bizarre as it is hilarious, and trust me, there is plenty of writing to enjoy. Weird quirks dominate the scene, such as having every single character follow a routine and schedule based on a variety of factors, and allowing sidequests only when the time is right, and pulling those sidequests away from you if you're too slow to grab them. Additionally, Deadly Premonition has care in weird areas that I've not seen in other games before, like letting you use your turn signal in a vehicle, or having your character be able to grow a beard and shave it regularly, or most unique of all, having your character sleep under the fucking blankets.

Name me one game that lets you sleep under the covers besides Deadly Premonition.

... *Ahem*

All in all, Deadly Premonition is a bizarre, flawed, hilarious, witty, diamond in the rough. It has a ton of bad, but if you're willing to put up with the bad and push through, you'll discover a truly unique experience that no other game will ever deliver quite the same.",1479169585,1479169585,True,2,0,0.540347278118133545,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Я готов был простить ей все: кривизну игрового процесса, устаревшую графику, огромный, но при этом абсолютно пустой и скучный открытый мир, если бы не одно «но» — постоянные технические сбои: зависания, пропажа сохранений, вылеты. Вылеты — ключевое слово в описании этой игры. Случаются они крайне часто — примерно каждые полчаса. Иногда игра вовсе вылетает на одном и том же месте раз за разом — у меня такое было порядка четырех-пяти раз. В таком случае, каждый раз приходится искать решение конкретной проблемы и подолгу настраивать игру, чтобы она просто-напросто запустилась. Все это сильно подпортило мои впечатления от довольно неплохой игры, доставившей мне немало удовольствия.

«Deadly Premonition» («Предчувствие Смерти») — инди-разработка студии «Rising Star Games». Она представляет из себя бюджетную смесь из «Grand Theft Auto», «Resident Evil» и сериала «Твин Пикс», созданного американским режиссером Дэвидом Линчем. Хоть как-то охарактеризовать игру достаточно проблематично, ибо это тот случай, когда проект прекрасен и ужасен примерно в равной степени.

Сюжет копирует мистически-фарсовый сериал «Твин Пикс», созданный в конце 80-х годов американским режиссером Дэвидом Линчем, известным сюрреалистом, уделяющим в своем творчестве особое внимание эзотеричным и оккультным тематикам. Действительно, описывать сюжет видеоигры нет ни малейшего смысла — в чем-то он, конечно, отличается от «Твин Пикса», но в общем и целом следует ему досконально: типажи всех персонажей, сюжетные ходы, манера повествования, атмосфера и место действия взяты именно оттуда. Но не подумайте, что «Предчувствие смерти» — глупая «копипаста». Сюжет — один из главных плюсов игры. Именно благодаря ему вам захочется продолжать играть, раз за разом, скрипя зубами, устраняя проблемы кривой оптимизации.

Атмосфера — второй весомый плюс игры. Маленький провинциальный городок, расположившийся в дали от цивилизации, местные обычаи, люди, знающие друг друга в лицо, таинственные оккультные убийства — «Твин Пикс» ощущается в полной мере. Авторам действительно удалось с головой погрузить игрока в процесс, даже не смотря на устаревшую графику: текстуры, 3D-модели, анимацию движений — абсолютно все графические элементы. Но несмотря на то, что графика в «Предчувствии Смерти» не может похвастаться чем-то выдающимся или хотя-бы приемлемым по современным меркам (игра вышла в 2013-м году), называть ее отвратной было бы неправильно. 

В игре, как ни странно, присутствует открытый мир. Конечно, его попытались разнообразить разными заведениями, которые можно посещать, собирательством, но в целом он пуст и примитивен, состоит в основном из пустынных полей, длиннющих дорог и домов-коробок: как сюжетных локаций, вроде больницы, полицейского участка, заброшенной лесопилки или мотеля, так и дополнительных — для сайд-квестов, которые можно получить у некоторых жителей города. Геймплей же состоит в основном из «боевки» и решения головоломок. Первое позаимствовано из хоррор-серии «Resident Evil», второе — из приключенческих боевиков а-ля «Tomb Raider». «Боевка» крайне неудобная: во-первых, чтобы стрелять или бить оружием ближнего боя, нужно постоянно зажимать «пробел», во-вторых, монстры «лаганутые» — могут перемещаться с места на место, проходить сквозь стены, а подбираются с такой скоростью, что не успеваешь на это среагировать. С головоломками все обстоит примерно также: они либо предельно просты, угадываются за секунду, либо настолько сложны, что для их решения приходиться подолгу бегать по зданию в поисках какой-либо важной бумажки.",1478640863,1655065349,False,3,0,0.533767282962799072,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Heureusement que des fans se sont acharnés pour résoudre les problèmes de réalisation du titre.

******** POUR RESOUDRE LES BUGS ET AMELIORER LES GRAPHISMES ********
Les choses que je vous recommande de faire:

1- Une fois le jeu installé je vous encourage a aller sur ce site ci-dessous pour installer DPfix + improved textures + SweetFX afin de résoudre les problemes de graphismes ( résolution, texture et couleurs ) :
http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director's_Cut

Dans les règlages de DPfix choisissez l'option pour mettre le jeu en fenetré sans bordures à la place du plein écran et dans le launcheur du jeu desactivez le plein écran. Vous eviterez un crash au demarrage et des plantages si vous voulez retourner vite fait sous windows avec alt+tab.

2- Une fois le jeu démarré vous vous rendrez compte que le clavier est inutilisable car le jeu n'est programmé que pour les claviers en qwerty et qu'il est impossible de changer les touches principales.
Donc quand votre jeu est démarré appuyez en même temps sur Alt+Maj et votre clavier passera en mode qwerty. En sortant du jeu soit votre clavier est repassé automatiquement en azerty, soit il vous suffit de refaire Alt+Maj pour changer. 

3- Pour evitez des bugs sonores et notament en voiture faites ceci sous windows ( j'ai win7 )
->clic droit sur le haut parleur en bas a droite a coté de l'heure
->choisir peripherique de lecture
-> selctionner haut-parleurs dans la liste et cliquer sur configurer
->choisir le mode stereo et valider
( Apparement les moders multicanaux font planter le son dans le jeu, ça marche chez pas mal de monde pour enlever le bug mais pas sur toutes les config )

Vous venez de passer 3 plombes à finir votre install , bravo vous allez enfin plonger dans cette histoire hallucinatoire.
N'oubliez pas d'aller mettre le jeu en francais pour changer les sous titres.

Derniere chose , pour utiliser une arme : une fois l'arme selectionnée il faut maintenir enfoncé la touche espace si on veut utiliser la touche pour tirer ou recharger. ( c'est pas un bug, c'est le gameplay ^^ )

I think the story is amazing. It's a very well-written game with interesting and well developed characters. Yorke is wonderfully entertaining especially when you're just driving around and he's talking to his alter ego Zach about 80s movies. A lot of the mini stories are fun and the action is very tense and can be really scary at times. I'm serious this game can be pretty horrifying. I enjoyed every part that didn't involve...well uh... ok...
The controls. 
I've read some other reviews and apparently the console versions controls were a lot smoother but the PC controls leave much to be desired. Yorke kinda controls like a tank (which would be fine in a point and click game) but this is a horror shooter so it's a little clunky and awkward.
The real time events are uh... a little difficult. Now I'm slightly biased as real time events are the bane of my existence but Deadly Premonitions are something very special indeed. In most games the real time event keeps the same pattern so that you can kinda power through it after several tries. This game changes the pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. So it's a little difficult. Though I feel someone with good reflexes could get through it no sweat, I'm just slow af. 
When you drive you feel like you're driving on black ice though I will admit it's very fun when you drive really, really fast and crash into stuff. 
Also if you're playing on PC be aware this game might crash, several times. It did for me a lot. You can have several days without crashing and it could play smoothly until one day it's like NOPE and crashes on you during a scary part, and oh boy you forgot to save so time to go back into the scary tunnel again with those wall crawlers that take a dozen hits with a shotgun again! 
And yet... after all this... I still love it. It's like Taco Bell, even though it hurts and might even be morally wrong you just keep coming back for more. I really do think it's the characters, story, atmosphere, Twin Peaks-vibe, challenging puzzles and fun shooting segments that keep me coming back.

Enough bugs and glitches to make the game almost need to be called Deadly Premonition Unity
And just a touch of Red Dead Redemption near the end

Honestly, I enjoyed 90% of this game, but no game made in 2013 should need to be run in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode if you want to beat the final boss (who, by the way, is so completely out of place from the rest of this game that it's half the reason I'm not recommending it).  I had to spend most of the time in XP Compatibility, but that still crashed occasionally and prevents you from aiming up and down properly which is needed rarely, but when it's needed it's needed.  When it was crashing or aiming was required I switched to 98 which had enough load times that my hair turned grey.  Occassional... dungeons?... are full of QTE which is thankfully only in those specific chase sequemces.  The driving of any car faster than the free cop car involves spinning 360 degrees if you hit a pebble as 90% of vehicles handle like turbo charged bath tubs.  
On the other handle, I liked the story and characters.  Once I finished with the atrocious final boss I went back and finished all the side quests to learn more about the citizens of Greenvale (hence my 56+ hours of play).  Of course, a bug involving quest items and replaying missions caused me to have to restart the entire game to get the second last achievement and the last one won't unlock despite patch notes saying the issue was fixed.

Imagine a really bad restaurant. It has terrible service, terrible decor, smells bad, looks bad and is just generally unpleasant. It shows no promise at all. And yet....

...They serve about the best main course money can buy.

Deadly Premonition's main dish is it's completely captivating story, which is brought to life by some excellent voice acting. The main characters are really well written; I found them quirky, utterly charming, charismatic and lovable and wanted to know everything about them.

If you have seen Twin Peaks, you will not fail to notice this game has derived A LOT of inspiration from that show. Luckily it does so in an interesting and often suprising way so  never feels like a bland ripoff. Beyond the Twin Peaks influence, it's also pretty obvious the game designer, Swery, likes David Lynch's wider canon of work too, to the point that the game could be mistaken as a collaboration. Being a Lynch fan, that's not a bad thing in my book; I think other Lynch fans will love this too. 

So what's not so good? I'm afraid there are quite a lot of niggles that takes the shine off the Deadly Premonition experience.

Here we go: 

- My experience was massively hurt by technical problems. The game crashed constantly unless put into ME/98 compatibility+admin mode. Alas, this had the side of effect of gradually bringing frame rates down from 60fps to 10fps within 15 minutes of continued play. Repeated reboots were required to maintain a playable frame rate. 
- In compatibility mode, a slew of minor bugs arose, such as gun-aiming glitches, which made the game annoying.
- To unlock the 60fps is required an unofficial hack (called DPfix) is required (grr)
- Graphics are poor  - the palette is washed out, textures rough , and 3D models very ropey at times.
- Driving is really tedious. It takes too long to get anywhere.
- The core 3rd person survival horror game is not very enjoyable. 
- The RPG mechanics (health, hunger, tiredness, inventory management) are completely superflous
- Time lapse mechanic is frustrating. You have to wait around for certain events to happen. Time can be sped up, but the mechanic means that you can end up passing TOO much time and missing your appointment. 
- The game is littered with tedious mandatory mini-games, such as waggling the thumbstick to run away from danger, or hiding from an enemy to escape danger. 
- boss battles are a chore
- not scary in the slightest. (even the bits I think were meant to be scary)
- Dull fetch side quests.
- The game is not challenging in the slightest.
- Production values  are not great. Very rough around the edges. Wonky transitions between scenes and parts of the musical score. 
- Story got so ridiculous it was immersion-breaking. (A mad story isn't necessarily a problem, but there needs to be some sort of underlying internal logic to make the suprises and twists truly matter) 
- no steamcloud

In short, the core game is just not very good. 

That's enough criticism; I don't want to put anyone off from giving this a go, because DAMN, the story and characters and atmosphere are SO SO good....Good enough that I can forgive that massive list of faults.

But would I recommend it to you?

Now, that is a tough question. I have to give a somewhat nuanced answer here. I'd have to ask:

- How tolerant are you of bad ports? This is one of the worst I have experienced.
- Do you like brilliant stories so much you can put up with a subpar game which is very rough around the edges? 
- Do you appreciate great voice acting, atmosphere, superb characters, and perhaps David Lynch's work too? 

If you said to the above go for it. You won't regret it. 

If you veer the other way....stay WELL clear. 

I few things to add: the game is supported by a deliciously quirky soundtrack, and features one of the most charismatic protaganists I have yet encountered in a video game: Francis York Morgan (who is up their with Garrus from Mass Effect for me) 

I LOVE this game, despite its numerous faults, and I can't think of a game so in need of a modern remaster that polishes the rough edges, gives it a nice, glossy coat of paint, and improves the core game so it can be experienced by a wider audience.

Déjà, quand il a refusé de se lancer les premières fois, ça m'a mise dans l'ambiance : il faut le laisser installer sa petite version de directX, sa petite version de ceci et cela, et même après ça, il ne démarre pas, non : il faut REDEMARRER le PC pour que tout soit pris en compte, et là, il daignera enfin afficher le 1er de ses écrans.

L'écran en question constitue déjà à lui seul une insulte. Non seulement les options qu'il propose d'ajuster sont dérisoires, [i](zéro option graphique je précise - même pas la rez)[/i], mais en plus, le contrôle au pad est inexplicablement indisponible alors qu'un pad est branché. (De modèle ultra courant: XB-360 je précise). Amusez vous à le brancher / débrancher dans tous les ports USB de votre PC, le pad ne sera jamais reconnu bien que l'option ""gamepad"" soit là, sous vos yeux, à rester bêtement grisée... La mention ""support mannette complet"" qu'affiche la page du magasin est donc mensongère, et soit vous jouerez au clavier, soit vous irez vous faire foutre.

Boooon. On va jouer au clavier. Mais?? MAIS !!!???!!! Ah! La bonne blague : c'est bien sur UNIQUEMENT en qwerty! Et les touches ne sont naturellement PAS remappables. Ça propose une localisation française, mais ça oublie de localiser les contrôles... Balèzes les mecs. [i](Détends toi Cammy! Pense à toutes ces bonnes évals qui expliquent à quel point ce jeu est trop super si on prend la peine de rentrer dedans! Persévère un peu!)[/i]
Alleeez, je fais donc ""Shift+Alt"" pour passer en qwerty, et c'est parti. (Déjà 15 bonnes minutes de perdues rien que pour arriver à le lancer, on allait quand même pas abandonner maintenant!)

Le jeu démarre en énumérant à l'unité et sans se presser 5 ou 6 logos inzappables (alors que même un singe aurait eu l'idée de les réunir tous sur 1 seul écran pour faire gagner du temps).
Puis ça démarre enfin, avec diverses séquences d'intro aux ambiances carrément réussies je dois dire. On sent bien que le jeu a un bon ""fond"" - mais mon dieu, pour la forme, quelle horreur... Les décors et les animations ridicules me rappellent très sincèrement ""House of the dead 2"" sur Dreamcast. (1998). Mêmes [i]""bruits de pas sur carrelages & moquettes""[/i] que ceux du premier ""Resident Evil"" (1996), à la différence qu'ici, ils ne sont pas correctement calés avec la marche ou la course du perso. Miraculeusement, les visages des protagonistes sont bien réussis en dépit de l'horreur esthétique grotesque des modélisations plus que grossières couvertes de textures absolument dégueulasses. Techniquement, ce jeu est une honte.
Quant à la trad française, outre diverses erreurs, elle remplace les ""ç"" par des ""é"", n'affiche carrément pas les ""Œ"", et hésite un peu trop souvent sur tout ce qui porte un accent... Ce qui est un peu pénible, même si ça ne nuit pas trop à la compréhension...

Concernant le gameplay, il est rigide au delà du descriptible, et là encore très proche de la maniabilité complètement obsolète des tout premiers Resident Evil. Mais avec en prime une visée beaucoup plus capricieuse malgré la souris (pourtant sensée être mathématiquement plus précise), un système de mise en joue parfaitement désagréable, et une ergonomie aberrante manifestement élaborée par un débile léger...

Bon. On se remotive et on persévère! Les 1ers combats arrivent. Nuls. Y'a pas d'autre mot. Pourtant, je le répète, malgré la réalisation pathétique, l'ambiance est là, qui donne envie...Je traverse donc le niveau avec comme principale ennemie la jouabilité complètement naze. Le level design? Un couloir dont il faudra déverrouiller basiquement les embranchements avec des ""énigmes"" éculées genre boite à fusible/générateur... Vous voyez le genre.

Arrive le 1er QTE. Je le rate une fois. (Bon). Puis la seconde, puis une 3e (P'tain, mais j'ai pourtant appuyé là où il me dit!) et encore et encore jusqu'à ce que je me souvienne que ce jeu pourri est en QWERTY, et que par conséquent, les touches sur lesquelles on me demandera de taper ne CORRESPONDRONT PAS à celles de mon clavier, et qu'il faudra deviner leur emplacement! ^^
Et là, c'est bon, je décroche. J'ai ""joué"" une heure et demie, jusqu'à boucler le premier chapitre - j'estime que je lui ai largement laissé sa chance. Je rédige donc cette éval pour vous INTERDIRE catégoriquement d'approcher cette malhonnête arnaque (surtout au prix exorbitant de 25€!!!!)
[i]En tant que ""jeu""[/i], Deadly Premonition se fout ouvertement de notre gueule sur absolument TOUS les plans. Et me semble impossible à conseiller à qui que ce soit, même si sincèrement, je crois que je comprends finalement bien pourquoi tellement de gens ""aiment"" son ambiance malgré ses [u]impardonnables[/u] tares... Raison pour laquelle [b]en revanche[/b], il est certainement bien plus sympa à regarder [i]en tant que vidéo[/i] - ce que je vais d'ailleurs faire sans plus tarder.

Ce n'est pas parce qu'une poignée de talentueux scénaristes/dialoguistes/metteurs en scène assez inspirés ont été se compromettre avec les programmeurs/graphistes/game designers [u]les plus POUILLEUX de la terre[/u] que je dois m'infliger de [strike]jouer[/strike] lutter contre ce misérable étron pour profiter d'un scénar et d'une atmosphère réussie. [i](Et aussi du travail d'écriture sur les personnages - qui semble également être l'un des rares trucs à sauver de ce désastre).[/i]

Donc si tout comme moi vous préférez économiser beaucoup de votre patience (et par la même occase, de votre argent) sans passer à côté de l'ambiance particulière et prenante de cette intrigue, rendez-vous service :

What exactly is this game? That is a really good question. If you really want a better review just [url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-deadly-premonition-165168.phtml] read [/url] this. 

This is supposed to be a survival horror game, is it though? It's a murder mystery, you play as York (everyone calls him that) an fbi agent that investigate a serial killer leading to a small town. Once you start this game, you'll know that this game is bad. The story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is horrible, the cutscenes are attrocious, the gameplay are horrendous, the control is the worst. But it is also a wonderful experience that you'll never forget. 

You'll dread the shooting so much with all the bullet sponge enemies, You'll accidentally press the a button and see the 'get out of car' animation a million times. You will also ask questions, a lot of questions. Why is the raincoat killer stopped chasing me after i evade one time? Why is there an old dude on a wheelchair wearing a gas mask? Why is there a jazz playing while i examined a body? Who is whistling that mario theme?!? [i] please get it out of my head. [/i] And also [spoiler] Who is zach? [/spoiler]
Not all of that question will be answered. At the end of the game, the character will grow on you, you'll no longer ask the unecessary question, because it's deadly premonition. 

But if it's all so bad, what makes it a good game, you ask. Deadly premonition knows that it is a bad B-movie and made it their strength. Sure you will be frustated, but that frustation is wiped by the laugh that you'll get. You'll laugh at it, thinking that it's bad, but that's also what makes it so good. It's also possible that you will hate it with passion, that is also fine. Because you gotta have a truly twisted mind to enjoy it. It's a genius of swery.

How exactly are we supposed to enjoy this game, ironically? Unironically? That is a question that will never be answered.

Deadly Premonition a eu un effet sur moi que je n'aurais jamais imaginé. Car au-delà d'une lancinante douleur au cul, j'en suis sorti exténué, retourné et habité par la ferme intention de vouloir partager cette expérience avec autrui ; et qui sait faire naître des envies. Si je vous dis que le jeu vaut surtout pour son dénouement (et 5 minutes une fois toutes les 2 heures) et qu'au delà de ça c'est juste une gigantesque purge. Vous la sentez l'envie monter en vous ? Ok, là c'est normal. Mais si je vous dis que malgré tous ses défauts (on est pas loin du crime contre l'humanité à ce stade), je pense que c'est un jeu unique que vous devez absolument faire ? Ah, voilà c'est ça. Un jeu unique. Mais unique comment ? Unique comme un truc qui va tellement à l'encontre du jeu vidéo, du bon sens et du bon goût que ça en devient génial. En fait, c'est tellement aberrant sur certains aspects qu'on finit petit à petit par prendre tout ça au 11ème degré. C'est bien simple : ludiquement, je n'ai jamais vu ça. C'est même pas nul, c'est beaucoup plus que cela.

Au début, je me voyais déjà jouer à un truc du genre Killer 7 (en un peu plus naze), mais là où le titre de Suda51 se laisse tout de même jouer, là pas du tout. C'est pas juste bancal - non - je dirais plutôt que c'est presque de l'anti-jeu. J'en suis donc venu à penser que cette quasi-souffrance à évoluer dans l'univers était voulue. Comme une métaphore du personnage principal qui peine à progresser dans cette ville qu'il ne connait pas. Ouais, non, en fait je raconte n'importe quoi, mais au final je dirais presque que ce non-gameplay a renforcé mon expérience de jeu. En fait, toutes les tares du jeu ne gâchent pas l'aventure, mais la renforce. C'est bizarre. Ce n'est pas comme si les défauts venaient gâcher quoi que ce soit puisque le jeu lui-même est un gigantesque défaut. Mais dans ce cas, comment expliquer le fait que j'y ai joué 20 heures en deux jours sans m'arrêter ?  Je dirais que le jeu parvient toujours à surprendre. Surprendre par les dialogues, par les situations, mais également parce qu'on se dit que ""nan, là vraiment c'est juste n'importe quoi"" avec l'envie de voir jusqu'où les mecs vont aller dans le grotesque.

Car je n'ai pas encore parlé de l'intrigue, ni des personnages, mais c'est pourtant pour cela que l'on joue (et termine) Deadly Premonition. J'ai lu un peu partout qu'il y avait du Twin Peaks là-dedans, mais comme je n'ai jamais regardé de série de ma vie, j'y ai seulement vu un thriller comico-tragique. Comique parce qu'on se marre quand même pas mal et tragique parce que c'est souvent très glauque (viol, meurtres, ambiance cradingue). Pour faire court, vous êtes un mec du FBI qui débarque dans une petite bourgade (Greenvale) où on a retrouvé une gonzesse éventrée accrochée à un arbre façon JC. Il va donc falloir faire équipe avec les flics du coin pour résoudre cette enquête. Au départ assez convenu, le scénario va au fil des heures verser dans le grand n'importe quoi. Véritable pot-pourri blindé de scènes mi-cultes mi-ridicules (ridiculte donc), le jeu joue avec nous bien plus que le contraire. Reste qu'en tant que thriller, le tout fonctionne à merveille et il est d'ailleurs impossible d'imaginer une seule seconde tout le lol qui vous attend vers la fin.

En effet, ça a beau partir dans toutes les directions avec un héros cinéphile accro à la clope qui semble s'adresser à nous (Zack) pendant toute l'aventure, un flic homosexuel, un super saiyan, une histoire de signe de paix inversé, des zombis, des arbres, des graines rouges, des salles blanches, un FDP en imperméable, une vieille qui promène son fait-tout, des meurtres en série les jours de pluie, un handicapé masqué; et bien tout ça a un sens. Enfin quand je dis un sens, je veux dire que ça peut s'expliquer. Après, je ne dis pas que vous allez forcément adhérer. Nan, parce que ça reste assez perché quand même dans l'ensemble. Il n'empêche que le tout reste cohérent. Peut-être même que le jeu ne m'aurait pas autant perturbé si le fond n'avait pas aussi bien collé à la forme. Et quelle forme ! Mon dieu que c'est laid ! Je ne parle pas ici uniquement de l'aspect technique (bug, scintillements, ralentissements, clipping, textures dégueulasses, syndrome du ""je-suis-sous-la-pluie-donc-je-deviens-un-être-mi-homme-mi-bump-mapping""), mais de l'esthétique globale. Ici le mauvais goût est élevé au rang d'art et devient un style à part entière que l'on finit presque par apprécier. Oh !  Et je vous ai parlé du level design ? Vous saviez que dans le jeu, il y a un hôtel avec des couloirs sans portes ? Un couloir qui est juste là pour qu'un joueur avance dedans et puis rien.

I see some people have claimed to get the game running albeit with glitches and crashes.  More power to them.  It's not like this port ISN'T notorious afterall.  

But I can't in good conscience say anybody should risk buying this game on the gamble it MIGHT work or not.  I've been called a ""whiny douchebag"" for stating that Rising Star games should be ashamed of themselves for knowingly releasing the game in this broken state and dumbly expecting to patch it up later, only to come back with the pathetic excuse that since the game didn't sell well enough, the developers weren't going to patch it anymore.  A very brittle excuse.  

One particular person went so far as to defend the practice saying ""HOW THE HELL CAN THEY PATCH IT IF THE GAME DOESN'T SELL?""  First of all, that's not my problem.  It's not the consumer's job to help fund the repair of faulty products.  Secondly, it probably didn't sell well due to the rampant complaints of glitches, crashing, and overall poor work on the port.  

Finally, (and this probably should have been continued from my first point, oh well) are video games sales not a business?  Is there not supposed to be an inherent trust between company and consumer?  If I buy a new car, and it immediately breaks down the very day I take it home; is it acceptable for the dealership to say ""Sorry we haven't made enough profits in car sales this year, we're not going to fix or replace that brand new car we just sold you.""?  If somebody goes to a burger joint and order the Triple Colostomizer with extra Victim Sauce, but are then served an Unhappy Meal with a cold burger that has a bite taken out of it with some floor sweeping compound (MST3K REFERENCE!); does one simply allow the manager to say ""We haven't sold enough burgers this year, you're not getting a refund.""  The answer to all those examples SHOULD (hopefully) be NO.  Bottomline:  Other industries don't get away with selling defective merchandise, why should the video game industry be any different?

Она очень красивая, несмотря на устаревшую графику. Небольшой провинциальный город, эти кафешки, магазинчики, частные дома, поля, леса, реки, горы создают отличную атмосферу. В игре есть элемент нелинейности. Между сюжетными заданиями можно ездить по городу, говорить с людьми, выполнять их просьбы и открывать дополнительные детали расследования. Различные особенности, вроде необходимости заправлять и чинить машину, периодически есть и спать, возможность рыбачить добавляют ощущения присутствия в игре. Она действительно отлично детализирована. Можно сказать, что ты не ""проходишь"", а будто ""проживаешь"" ее.

Сюжет интересный, с элементами мистики. Порой непонятно, то ли дело происходит наяву, то ли это просто сон агента Йорка. Я с детства обычно скипаю заставки в играх, где это можно делать, но здесь я не пропустил ни одной, потому что они хорошо срежиссированы. Для понимания диалогов кстати вполне достаточно знать английский немного выше среднего, так что отсутствие русского языка в комплекте (хотя в стиме вроде есть любительская локализация) не так уж критично.

Боевка в игре несложная, за что отдельное спасибо разработчикам. Порой хочется просто расслабиться и поиграть, а не проходить по пятьдесят раз одно и то же место.

Пожалуй, единственный недостаток игры - это вращающаяся глобальная карта. Когда ее открываешь, она всегда расположена так, что персонаж смотрит на север.

When loading up the game you may aswell spin a wheel to whether it crashes or not. Once loaded you can then enjoy the next bug it decides to throw at you. I got as far as the driving section where I had to listen to the car screech constantly only to learn I had to downgrade my headphones from surround sound to stereo to get rid of that issue.

For Director's Cut on PC, though, you should not pay.
So says Mr. Stewart.

Deadly Premonition is one of my absolute favorite games. The Director's Cut, however, and especially the PC version are something to avoid.

Deadly Premonition was a flawed, but amazing game full of charming personality with every of it's lots of characters. What it needed is some additional polish, some rebalancing, some QTE removal. Ideally an engine port to make the world feel even more complete by removing the loading screens or at least making them less frequent. It needed something that will make the original strange beauty preserved for generations to come.

Instead it got The Director's Cut. A version that is worse in pretty much every regard. With slightly better visuals in some parts, worse in all others. With all the game breaking and lighter glitches, typos, mistranslations and other issues intact. With next to no changes to actual issues. With one non-issue made better (the controls). With pointless DLCs. With horribly voiced and animated new cutscenes that break the flow of the story, spoil things and add nothing of value. And, especially on PC, with countless crashes. Crashes that you cannot avoid no matter what you do, just make them slightly less frequent.

If you can, find the original for 360, play that instead. If you absolutely must play Director's Cut, do it on consoles. But this version? This version is the one to avoid at all cost. It will ruin the game for you. And the game is very much worth it.

Had to cool off before posting this. It's been about 4-5 months. Was going to thumb this game down almost immediately. But over time I remembered some memorable moments, even though this wasn't the Alan Wake experience I was looking for. I give Double Penetration: The Director's Cut a thumbs up, but with a caveat emptor ... it's considering that nothing UGLY happens (which it most likely will on PC/Steam) ...

THE GOOD

DP is a very Japaneseish/Capcomish type of game. The best way to describe it, think of Resident Evil 5 + Devil May Cry 4 + The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and a drop of Grand Theft Auto III.

This is a game that looks like it was released back in 2003. But it was released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The gameplay is even more archaic! Reminiscent of Nintendo 64 games during the late 90's.

What's Japaneseish about it? The finger exclamations! Kinda like when Phoenix Wright, points his finger at someone. Constant FBI badge flashing and hand tapping on chest to signify thinking/pondering.

There's quite some noticeable detail. You can see your character's facial hair growing, to which you can shave it. Or when lighting a cigarette, the very tip (texture) changes to dynamically simulate burning. There is also a mysterious character called Harry Stewart who has a handicap accessible limo for his wheelchair. None of these things are practical. But they are memorable.

THE BAD

You can't zoom out fully on the map screen, not cool since you could do that all them years ago like with GTA: Vice City.

There are annoying mean dog barking sounds when there are none in sight!

QTE's ... funny, but NOT COOL!

Waiting before being able to access an event because of in-game real-time ... STUPID IDEA!

Hallways with many doors and in 1 out of every 15 doors ... they'd actually be a door you can open and walk into.

Non-stop enemy spawn points: I don't think I've seen this in over a decade! It's one of those situations when you see an enemy, you shoot it! Another pops out. You shoot it again, your bullets go down but the enemy keeps spawning out like a turd that won't flush! But for whatever reason, with most of the game, when you kill an enemy, they usually stay dead.

Being told that you can't go back during some campaign once you go through a particular door or whatever. And then it actually tells you whether you want to proceed or not. WHY!? Don't ever make the player have to think about this!

THE UGLY

For a PC/Steam port I honestly feel lucky to have been able to finish this game. Deadly Premonition is plagued with bugs.

When you drive a vehicle, the engine makes a high pitched sudden brake/screeching sound mixed with telecommunications beeping every 2 seconds.

The dialogue sounds during cinematic sequences is reversed. So when someone is shouting on the right side of the screen, you hear it through the left speaker.

There are guaranteed random crashes each time you load the game up to play. And I'm using a fairly standard PC setup: Intel i5, Windows 7 ... etc.

There is a bug that stops you from aiming high or low. So if you need to shoot something out of a tree or try to defeat the final boss ... well ... you can't. The fix: Setting both the game executable and launcher to compatibility mode Windows 98 and always making them run with administrator privilege.

The epilogue also kept crashing on load. Apparently I needed to run it in windowed mode. Because for some reason it didn't like playing at my monitor's default full screen resolution of 1920x1200.",1472969548,1472969606,True,2,0,0.504950523376464844,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lo siguiente que quiero comentar es que la gran mayoría de análisis negativos sobre este juego normalmente son sobre el port que se ha hecho a pc y sus problemas. Eso lo comentaré al final.
A mi personalmente este juego me ha encantado, me parece una pequeña maravilla de esas que están escondidas y que encuentras por casualidad. Es una historia rara, muy rara en la que un detective muy particular investiga un asesinato en el típico pueblo un tanto alejado de todo con vecinos únicos y más raros incluso que el protagonista. Si conoceis al director David Lynch o quizá os suena la serie Twin Peaks os podreis hacer una idea de lo que os podeis encontrar en este juego. Quizá una de las peores cosas que tenga este juego sea su comienzo, es una fumada del tipo WTF!!!? (si, un wtf en mayúsculas) que te puede hacer pensar que el juego va a ser más raro que un perro verde y que no va a tener ningún sentido. No es cierto. Es una buena historia de detectives y asesinatos llena de personajes variopintos con historias (secundarias muchas veces) que vale la pena conocer. De hecho recomiendo hacer las secundarias una vez terminado el juego (hay una guía en chino pero tranquilidad, es entendible con las imágenes que lleva y el google translator), te permiten conocer historias de los vecinos, relaciones entre ellos y pequeños secretos. La riqueza que le da las secundarias es uno de los grandes aciertos del juego. Sin hacer spoilers solo comentar una cosa sobre el juego. El prota a veces está en una especie de mundo interior un tanto onírico que sirve para conocer cosas sobre su pasado y otras veces está en el mundo real pero en una dimensión oscura estilo silent hill. El inicio del juego te lleva del mundo onírico a la otra realidad antes de aparecer en el ""mundo real"". Por eso digo que empieza muy raro y te puede llevar a equívoco. A medida que juegas vas viendo el sentido de todo eso.
Para terminar el tema del port. Hay rios de tinta sobre lo malo que es, que si el juego es injugable etc. Os comento mi experiencia personal: después de casi 50 horas de juego he tenido 0 bugs y creo recordar que 6 crasheos, de los cuales uno fue en la pantalla del menú del juego y otros 2 una vez ya lo había acabado (te puede costar fácil 25-30 horas) mientras estaba completando secundarias. Ningún problema al instarlar ni al iniciar, nunca. El único tema es que el teclado apenas es configurable y tienes que moverte con wasd, nada de cursores. A los 10 minutos ya te has olvidado de eso. Habrá gente que no habrá podido jugar o que le petará cada 5 minutos (digo yo, no tengo ni idea) hay guías para evitar en lo posible problemas en el juego etc. En mi caso ha ido perfecto, como la seda, pero tened en cuenta a la hora de comprarlo que el port ha dado muchos problemas a mucha gente. Por mi parte solo puedo recomendar esta pequeña maravilla. Una vez completados todos los logros y quest abandono ya las historias de York, Zach, Emily, George y demás grandes personajes de este juego.

Save your money and buy something else as the devs have not and will not fix this port.

This game seemed like a lot of fun and from what I was able to play, it was fun. But you simply cannot play the PC version of this game at all because of just how broken it is. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC, even if its on sale for $0.99! Get the console version and play it that way.

The problem isn't that the game is not fun, its that its so broken you cannot play it unless you somehow got lucky and avoided the bugs. You have to go out and find a ton of fixes to get it to run, jumping through many hoops and reading a ton of instructions and forum posts in the hopes that your specific issue can be resolved. Normally, ports to the PC can have those problems, but in this case its so bad that even after all the fixes, the game still manages to be broken. Freezes, black screens, CTD, all of these things can occur at any time even after the fixes. Not to mention, this port does not support higher screen resolutions and has a ton of framerate issues. Good luck playing this game. The worst part is that I can't even rate this game for its game play or visuals due to how broken it really is.

Again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC! If you want to play the game, simply buy it on PS3/XBOX360 or get an emulator and play it that way as that is literally the only way this game will ever be played. Rising Star Games should take responsibility and fix their PC port for this game so that we don't have all these problems that require a ton of community fixes just to play part of the game and it still doesn't work. However, that is highly unlikely since Rising Star Games has refused to do anything to address the issues with their game since it was released on Steam and will most likely not fix it.

This is an open world horror (which to me is splendid), which gives you various situations and things to do and explore. The city is fairly large and strongly recommend not to risk walking out because there are several places spread very far corners of the map, and so there are police cars to take you, and no, you are not a ride in this game you must control the car and it is possible both at first and in the third person. Something that caught my attention is the amount of commands to do so, beyond the standards, give arrow and have control over the lights at any time, as well as using the windshield when it is raining because the game there day transition and changes in time. For this reason the various possible locations may not always be available because everything has its time due to happen. There markets, gas station, houses and other various places to explore, and you can fish in certain places, of course with proper equipment to do so.
All of these sites available no atoa, your character beyond the life bar and stamina, there is also the sleep bars and hunger. For this there is a hotel and some houses you have access to sleep in almost any location truth, if not all, it has a bed can rest. About hunger not always have time to go on the market and that is why there are machines where you can buy some food. This also applies to sleep, do not always have a bed available and the way is turn taking cafes stored in inventory. There is gun shop, but perhaps the most interesting is to get the weapons infinite ammunition obtained in side quests.
The game has a police series style several years ago, full of stereotypical characters and cliched situations, the beginning of the keep itself has fragments of what happened in the chapter you are both in photos and with excerpts of speeches. Your character is an FBI agent and called Francis York Morgan, but he always says that it is to call him York, and I've got a ""special"" name if I present myself this way and the other ignores it tends to say this for some reason did not like me. That's what happens when you present to the sheriff of the town of Greenvale, George Woodman calling York ""mrs. Morgan "". This ends up just causing a bad impression. You come to this city because the murder happened it resembles the other which has investigated, and so he joins the local police: the sheriff with his closed way of being, the beautiful Emily Wyatt and sweet Thomas MacLaine (Interpret ""sweet"" as you prefer).
In several game moments you can chat with Zach something or someone who is close to our protagonist, but that would be really someone or is it just a hallucination (a second personality perhaps?). In these conversations with Zach, they talk about various things such as films giving various details about the same as the actors, scenes, who is the director and so follows ... but it is more often when we are in the car, it is You can hear a real dialogue, at other times only York speech, apparently alone and this comes to interrupt others and occasionally other people wonder about such conversations with passengers also take place and it will you should tighten the button to start. Deadly Premonition despite being a horror game, occasionally happens comic scenes, however not all actually have felt in those moments stereotypes given much emphasis. Like when York eating a cookie at the police station and say you need to know where it was purchased because it is delicious at this time Thomas gets all embarrassed and bashful and says it was he who made ... (something that usually happens when the girl gets a compliment someone who finds beautiful or who she likes).
Time failed typically receive punishments already expected to come face to face with the place closed or even end up getting a ""earful"" lack of commitment to the case, as it is possible that the passage of operating time you are invited to remove and this will force you to ""spend time"" in some way, perhaps one of the best ways is smoking (consumable item).

The gameplay takes place in three situations (places) different: the real world, the spiritual world and dreams. In fact, the real world to the spiritual is something reminiscent of ""Silent Hill"", this transition usually occurs when the character you want to do something alone.
On the game mode, it is quite simple, but the sight itself is very difficult to have control, but nevertheless it is possible to ""turn around"" with what he has. The other commands usually respond well.
Something I saw people complaining are the car's controls are terrible and you end up stuck in places, well I never had many problems, perhaps the fact that I always played first-person account for this. The car has also status, nothing else, just the physical condition and the amount of gasoline. However if you are in the middle of nowhere and end up having to leave the car do not worry, use the signal that exists in inventory and it will bring a new car for you (100% / 100%).
The game also has moments of multiple choices and quick time events.

Things that caught my attention in particular:
- The menu in the game which is very interactive}
- Soundtracks that are great and together with the sound effects give a greater strain on the player.
- There are secondary missions of various types: how to make a stretch in less time or find something and give it to someone.
- In certain game moments are informative situations, such as in the car with Zach and they talking about movies or even a part of the beginning with Thomas where you need to find a key with a kind of ""squirrel"" (if I'm not mistaken) of something specific and every key handed it says it is not right that speaks the characteristics of each species.
- There are cards collectibles in the game.
I do not know really say what happened to me, but this was perhaps the only game of this style that I felt committed to continue to play and I just loved it from its beginning until now (but I believe it will continue until its end) . Afraid I was very deceived with the game I was behind other analysis and had a completely different view from mine, I finally found one that was negative, talked about the graphics and gameplay treating them as bad, also spoke to this was a game considered a cult, but that could be seen as a masterpiece depending on the person.

For me will be a milestone in my life, maybe one of those games that I will use as a reference, not for its graphics or the time of the sighting, but throughout the immersion that I have to play this title.

If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version.

По началу игра очень напоминает GTA едак Vice city и... и с атмосферой старого Silent Hill, загадками и тайнами городка из рассказов Стивена Кинга ну или хотя бы Alan Wake. И что самое интересное с этого всего... НЕ СМОТРИТЕ НА ГРАФУ... много игр, и тратить время на что нибудь старенькое времени нет НО попробовав Deadly Premotion скажу только одно. О боги это ШЕДЕВР!!! который почему-то похоже прошел мимо 99% игроков. Берите !!! И вы будете приятно удивленны!
ПЛЮСЫ:
+ Сюжет на удивление отличный
+ Непредсказуемость сюжета 90%!
+ Отличный детектив
+ Транспорт
+ Все персонажи имеют свою историю (и скелеты в шкафах)
+ Юмор на высоте!
+ Играя в эту игру ""наслаждаешься"" процесом (тоесть не пробегаешь а НАСЛАЖДАЕШЬСЯ)
+ Музыка подобрана отлично
Естественно без минусов порта игры на ПК не обошлось
МИНУСЫ:
- Приготовтесь что пробежать игру не выйдет даже если захотите, игра не на один вечер
- Графика хотя и для такой старой игры очень неплоха НО немного напрягает в наше время
- Много диалогов (детектив он и в Африке)
- Портировали игру долгоооо, слишком долго похоже...
- Звук машины... после набора машиной максимальной скорости звук двигателя зацикливается, после 10 часов покатушек на машине начинает просто раздражать (любители FarCry 2 меня поймут).

Spyfiction is one of the other games that is actually a movie in the universe. Forrest (a character in DP) has the same ""actor"" as another character in Spyfiction. 

But onto the review. So while you get bad repetitive music (which is a joke on purpose and actually kind of catchy) and characters that are laughable yet deviously insidious you find yourself caught in a confusion of emotions regarding the game. It catches you and sucks you in with it's hard to take serious yet super serious dialogue. I played this originalyl on Ps3 and i kept laughing out loud at the game because it was so bad... but then i found myself going to houses and asking questions and being a detective because i needed to know what was happening. The numerous time specific side quests that give more insite that are only found by what would seem to be chance give more back ground and much of the games nuance for the story is missed if you avoid them by accident or lack the ability to find them.

You will need a lot of patience to get the game running and to actually play it. Through the steam discussion thread that the dev posted I managed to get the game as stable as it could ever be. It would still occasionally crash after long sessions but it could be solved by saving often and restarting the game every now and then. 
If you cant be bothered fixing the game, buy it on the console or watch a playthrough on youtube. Skipping this game entirely would be a real shame since it has a cast of interesting and weird characters with some cheesy B-movie moments. 

One of the best scenes is the opening scene that shows agent Morgan smoking, on the phone talking about tom and jerry's S&M relationship, reviewing the evidence on his laptop and even holding a bag of evidence in front of his face all while driving through a curvy forest road on a rainy night. 
The absurdity of that moment was one of the things that hooked me.

Without going too much into the story, you play a FBI agent investigating a murder case in a small town. This is the best part of the game since you get to interrogate the weird and interesting townsfolk and the identity of the killer is something that will keep you guessing throughout the game.

The gameplay is nothing special, car controls are bad and so is the map but by the middle of the game I found myself knowing the full town layout. 
Shooting has been improved for the director's cut giving the gun infinite ammo and having a button that centers on the enemy. Yeah it removes some of the horror survival aspect of the game but makes the game way easier and less frustrating since shooting was a weaker part of the game. 
You will need to manage a hunger meter and keep your clothes clean, its pretty trivial and would only become a pain when you try to skip to to do side quests.

Deadly Premonition стала заложницей собственного неудобства — графика в ней устаревшая, управление катастрофически кривое, а все остальное... многим остальное и не важно. Встречают по одежке, так ведь, Зак?
Первое, что нужно обязательно сделать, садясь за Deadly Premonition, — отбросить в сторону логику. Грань между гениальностью и безумием тоньше, чем между добром и злом. В Deadly Premonition непостижимым образом сочетаются очень жестокий психологический триллер в духе «Молчания ягнят», мистический детектив в лучших традициях «Твин Пикс» Дэвида Линча, насыщенная драма, вполне себе сайлент-хилльный хоррор и по-японски абсурдистская комедия. Второй такой игры больше нет. Это факт. Это полностью законченное и самостоятельное произведение, чистый полет авторской мысли. Именно поэтому многим игра может видеться сумасшедшей, это не типично киношный детектив, как Heavy Rain.
Специальный агент Фрэнсис Йорк Морган прибывает в тихий провинциальный городок Гринвейл, чтобы расследовать убийство девушки Анны Грэм. Местные дети обнаружили ее распятой на дереве — живот вспорот, волнистые волосы едва прикрывают обнаженную грудь. Для двух близнецов Анна стала богиней леса, но агент Морган богини леса не увидел. Он увидел лишь еще одну жертву серийного маньяка, отчего-то забравшегося в ничем не примечательный городок Гринвейл. Впрочем, в ходе расследования Йорку еще предстоит пересмотреть свои взгляды на этот тихий омут, в котором водится зло пострашнее каких-то там чертей.
Человеку, начитавшемуся детективов, расследование может показаться несколько... странным, но, как говорил сам агент Морган, серийного убийцу невозможно поймать, действуя в рамках логики. Как и многое другое, боевые сцены в Deadly Premonition следует воспринимать как данность, как препятствие на пути к решению загадки. Враги повторяются, надоедают, стрелять неудобно — всегда проще убежать, если есть возможность. Они тут в первую очередь для того, чтобы утомить, — чтобы игрок плюнул и выключил игру.
Если оценивать Deadly Premonition по стандартным параметрам, много баллов она не получит. С точки зрения геймдизайна, это очень сырая и неудобная игра, местами откровенно неприятная. Но как произведение искусства она заслуживает десять баллов из десяти — это действительно гениальная (или безумная?), ни на что не похожая игра.

Not once I asked myself: ""Why do I have to continue?"" Because even if it worked perfectly, it's very rough around the edges, and the story's ludicrous.

Yet it has style. It has a character. It's very personal and human-like and spread all over.

Not even minding the bugs, the story itself is decent but not even worth the trouble of fixing the game to play, and the interesting characters are the only thing that basically make the game. People say its good because of the many random encounters that dont make sense and the fresh ideas put into the game but the random encounters are not even funny and makes the game look like crap.

I never did a review so I will try to keep it simple and short as I can.
The story is good, like that low budget movie you love even when you know it's a flawed work of art. Kids stay away, but if you're a bit older and able to overlook some stuff you will get to see why so many people love the game. At his core the game has a really good narrative even if it's a bit cheesy at times, but even that cheesy moments have a lot of charm onto them.
The gameplay is simple, somewhat similar to the first realease of Resident Evil 4 or Silent Hill 3. A bit clunky at times, it lacks the speed and action you would expect from a newer game but still it do his work fine. Loading times between areas might be an issue for some, you're gonna need to have some patience with the game.
It looks fine enough, just that.
I didn't have any major technical issues with the game, it crashed 3-4 times but that's it. I played it on Win 7 and didn't installed or did any of the fixes than people might suggest you on the forums.

Es dificil definir Deadly premonition, supongo que podriamos decir que es un ""What if...?"" en plan ¿Como habría sido ""Twin Peaks"" si David Lynch hubiese sido japonés? o ¿como sería Nicholas Cage si fuese un videojuego? y es que este título es a los videojuegos lo que peliculas como ""El vengador Toxico"", ""el ataque de los tomates asesinos"" o ""Zombis paletos"" es al cine, no se puede decir que sean buenas peliculas, pero su cutrismo y su peculiar sentido del humor las hace únicas y uno no puede dejar de recomendarlas.

Pese a que a primera vista muchos piensen que se trata de un survival horror, no es exactamente cierto, si bien hay fases en las que tendremos que abrirnos paso a tiros por escenarios tenebrosos y plagados de seres fantasmagoricos, eso solo es una pequeña parte del juego, y es que la oferta de este juego es mucho mas extensa. De entrada el juego se desarrolla en un mapa abierto que  cubre toda la extensión del pueblo (no es el mapeado de gta5 pero está bien de tamaño) en el que el tiempo transcurre, así que para seguir la trama principal tendremos que estar en alguna parte concreta a una hora concreta, aunque también existe la posibilidad de pasar de todo e ir a completar alguna de las 50 misiones secundarias disponibles o busquedas alternativas por las que seremos generosamente premiados.

Es en eso, en la cantidad de cosas que hacer que nos ofrece el pequeño pueblo de Greenvale, donde radica lo genial de este juego y es que todas y cada una de esas cosas están mal, como si hubiesen querido darle al juego una enorme riqueza en matices y pequeños detalles pero luego se hubiesen rallado y lo fueran dejando todo a medias. hay que comer, dormir, afeitarse y cambiarse de ropa de manera regular, sin embargo apenas se han currado 3 o 4 tipos de enemigos, existen bastantes coches para desbloquear que se estropean con los impactos y consumen combustible por lo que hay que repostar en la gasolinera pero corren menos que un patinete y los controles y la fisica del juego hacen que sea imposible circular recto por un carretera sin dar trompos cada dos por tres, la trama está chula y el prota es el puto amo, pero te encontraras partiendote el ojete en escenas supuestamente dramáticas mientras que otras escenas deliveradamente cómicas te dejarán con el culo torcido, la música esta bien, pero no pega con las escenas ni de coña, los controles mal, los gráficos mal, las físicas mal... todo está tan mal que cuesta creer que es fruto de la casulidad, eso hace intuir una intencionalidad en que todo sea tal cual es.

Con todo eso el juego sigue siendo tremendamente extenso y variado, con infinidad de objetos, armas y desbloqueables, donde podrás perderte y explorar, pegar tiros, hablar con los habitantes del pueblo o incluso ir de pesca o jugar una partida de dardos.

En definitíva  Deadly premonition ofrece una experiencia de juego nunca antes vista que hace que uno piense, ""este juego es una mierda!"" y cinco minutos después pienses ""este juego es la crema"", Que requiere cierto nivel del sentido del humor adecuado y que puede que no sea para todo el mundo. Posiblemente generaciones futuras reivindiquen este juego como un auténtico clásico de la serie B en los videojuegos, sea como sea no deja indiferente a nadie y eso hoy día no es algo fácil de encontrar.

Gioco inclassificabile del game designer Swery65! L'ho giocato due volte, una volta su Xbox360 e un'altra votla su PC. Il Twin Peaks dei videogiochi. L'aggettivo ""weird"" gli calza a pennello. E' pieno di trovate originali e geniali. Il protagonista, un agente dell'FBI ""cinefilo"" che ha una doppia personalità e parla con se stesso, è uno dei migliori character che hanno calcato le scene dei videogiochi. Non a caso l'ho scelto come avatar! E nemmeno gli altri numerosi personaggi ci scherzano in quanto ad originalità e personalità. La storia è molto intrigante; si tratta di una detective story a sfondo horror, tanto che il gioco può essere classificato come survival horror. 

Proprio come nella serie televisiva di David Lynch, l'agente Francis York Morgan seguendo le tracce di un serial killer si ritrova ad indagare su un efferrato omicidio di una ragazza, che sembra una rediviva Laura Palmer, in un tipico paesino della provincia americana, Greenvale. Seguiranno altri omicidi e Morgan cercherà di fare breccia nell'omertà degli abitanti del paese, che sotto la falsa coltre dell'amena e perbenista provincia americana nascondono istinti mal repressi e terribili e oscuri segreti. Nelle ultime fasi di gioco emergono gli eccessi fantasiosi tipici della cultura nipponica e la trama diventa un po' tirata per i capelli, ma per fortuna non perde il suo fascino e la sua originalità. 

Le dinamiche di gioco sono molto varie. Ci si muove liberamente a piedi o in auto in una sorta di mondo aperto zeppo di missioni secondarie e in cui i numerosi protagonisti eseguono delle azioni coordinate e programmate in tempo reale; si entra anche nelle case e negli edifici per effettuare indagini. Ci sono momenti in cui si affrontano zombie in terza persona armati di pistola o di spranga e momenti di originali e suggestivi quick time event in cui si affiancano due diversi punti di vista, quello del serial killer e quello della vittima braccata. 
La figura del Raincoat Killer merita un posto di primo ordine nell'iconografia dell'horror moderno.
Ci sono tantissime cut scene dall'ottimo respiro cinematografico, condite a volte con dialoghi letteralmente fuori dalle righe! Notevole come momenti di vera suspence si intersechino con no chalance con momenti di humor bislacco! 
Fondamentale l'apporto della splendida e ricca colonna sonora originale, in grado di restituire tutte le venature noir, esistenziali, psicologiche e tragicomiche della vicenda. Credo che tutto ciò per un gioco horror fosse abbastanza inedito all'epoca della sua uscita, e credo lo sia ancora oggi; chissà che in futuro non influenzi qualche nuovo capolavoro, si spera con un comparto tecnico migliore. 

Ed ecco la pillola amara: se non fosse per gli evidenti limiti della realizzazione tecnica, sarebbe un capolavoro. Di tali limiti hanno parlato in lungo e in largo tanti recensori, e poi si evidenziano non appena iniziate a giocare, per cui evito di parlarne. Ma anche così è un'esperienza ludica da provare assolutamente.

P.S. Per quanto riguarda i crash su PC, personalmente sono riuscito a risolverli senza problemi seguendo i consigli letti sul web.

[h1]EDIT 7/18/16:[/h1]
I have completed a guide which is a streamlined version of this review and includes the final technical tweaks that I used to make it all the way through the game. Best of luck!

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=727264321
[h1]EDIT 7/9/16:[/h1]
I noticed that running the game in any type of Compatibilty Mode would cause the frame-rate to steadily drop until the point of being unplayable. 

To get past the latest crashes, I re-launched in Windowed mode, with [u]no[/u] Compatibilty Mode and was able to get past each crash the next launch, while windowed.

Fuck that though. I did the following steps, and the game ran at a steady 60 fps and didn't crash within a 5+ hour session, which wasn't possible before:

1. Took DP.exe out of any kind of Compatibility Mode. Ran it normally (Windows 10 being the OS I run).

2. Set DPLauncher.exe to ""Run as Administrator"".

3. Ran DPLauncher.exe, and using Task Manager, set the Affinity of the process to use [u]only[/u] Cores 0-3. With a quad-core, hyperthreading processor, this will mimic a dual-core, which is the game's recommended requirement.

4. While in Task Manager, I also set the DPLauncher.exe process to ""High"" priority.

5. I started the game via the Launcher and verified that the settings I applied to DPLauncher.exe were passed along to DP.exe (they were).

6. I proceeded to play crash-free at 60 fps for over 5 hours straight, which as I said, was a night and day difference to my experience prior to these changes.

Now, the bad news is that if you opt for this route, you have to do steps 3 and 4 each time you launch the game. The good news is it's very quick and easy. I should add too that the first 3 steps below (from my original review), specifically unintalling the LAV filters, were still needed for me to initially get past the intro video. The above steps ^^ wouldn't have gotten me past the crash at the very beginning.

[u][b]If you're installing fresh, here are my final recommendations:[/b][/u] 

Uninstall LAV Filters and VLC Player (if applicable). Make Windows Media Player default. Install the game normally then apply DPfix and SweetFX, if for nothing else than graphical enhancements. Nevermind about Compatibility Mode and simply perform the 6 steps I just mentioned. Then, while in game [u]save often[/u], purely based on principal. I really believe though, with the processor tweaks applied, that the game will run much more stably...dare I say, rock-solid?",1467801527,1468909534,True,23,0,0.740182042121887207,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After sticking with it for a bit, the story becomes incredibly immersive, the characters you meet are funny and eccentric, and you can't help but fall in love with the game. The story is genuinely intriguing, and all the weird quirks (getting paid to peep into people's houses, stuffing your face with an endless supply of lollipops, main character's oddball rants) make the game even better.

upd2. Даже если игра запустилась - это еще ничего не значит: в любой момент очередной синематик может взять и не проиграться с последующим зависанием всей игры, причем постоянно. Помог режим совместимости с ХР. Игра 2013 года. Офигенная поддержка май эс. Правда, просто идите и слейте ее с торрентов, поскольку, что корявый репачек на торренте, что ""это"" - одна фигня. Что до хороших сторон, то они есть: отличная музыка, но 50% случаев не в тему, сюжет с персонажами - ничего.

upd4. Туда же совершенно Y6/\|0DO4HA9 карта: есть всего одна заправка, которая даже не обозначена на карте особым символом, есть бензин, который кончается так быстро, словно бензобак протекает (5,5 км = почти пол бака) и есть карта считай без масштабирования (ну, серьезно, дефолтного ""минимального"" масштабирования хватает за глаза, чтобы рассмотреть карту во всех подробностях, а крупный масштаб введен для того чтобы изучить микрофлору на карте, по всей видимости) и без возможности взглянуть на карту города в целом = без поиска в интернете вы хрен что найдете, а заправка вам уже перед второй поездкой понадобится. Да, главные плюсы игры (сюжет и персонажи) никуда не деваются, но когда с этой ...ной картой и полным незнанием города наш стрелок по ...опам и ...уям задвигает, что будет вести машину сам и отказаться нельзя, его хочется пристрелить, правда-правда.
upd5. @#$%! Какой uDuoT решил, что при повороте машины в одну сторону, будет логичным повернуть камеру почти на 90 градусов к направлению движения? 
upd6. Вот реально жалко: авторов идеи, сценаристов, актеров и прочих людей ответственных за персонажей и сюжет.
upd7. Ох и @#$%! Оказывается заправку не показывали поскольку она была далеко. Афигеть!

As it is I can't recommend this game but I can't recommend it [i]enough[/i] either.

The game is [i]badly[/i] developed on the PC. It basically won't run without using [url=http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix]Durante's dpfix[/url] and even then, with the latest version of that, it has issues like HDR style bloom occasionally flickering and blowing out the screen, an aimbox that doesn't let you aim outside of a [i]tiny[/i] fraction of the screen, a screeching sound loop when you're in a car and crashes ever 25 minutes on the dot. Still, it's a really, [i]really[/i] great story with really solid gameplay. On the one hand, if you have a 360 or PS3 then just pick it up used for one of those systems but, as of the time of this writing, it's on sale on Steam for $2.99 with the soundtrack and the OST [i]alone[/i] is worth that money (listening to it right now). The game's not unplayably broken (with dpfix and compatibility mode for XP SP3/98 set) but it does have enough issues to make it a conditional recommendation even on sale.

Gameplay wise it's an open-world game set in a small town that feels realish. There are two major ""centers"" to the town (downtown and a smaller business/residential area) and a bunch of places off in various parts of the countryside all connected with roads that feel planned rather than designed for sandboxing/gameplay. In many ways Greenvale feels more like a town than any other open-world location that I've played because of that. 

A day-night cycle is present, as you'd expect, but unlike most open-world games it's not just a perfunctory addition that has no gameplay impact. Rather, NPCs have a routine and are available at certain places at certain times and not at all at others. This impacts when you can start sidequests and when missions can be taken. On top of that NPCs actually drive around Greenvale to get to their various locations. The first time I saw this in action I was standing outside a particular main character's house waiting to be able to start a side mission and I saw her drive up, get out of her car, walk into the house via the garage door (and then the mission still wasn't available so I ""peeked"" inside the window and she was in there puttering around).

The story is one of the best told murder mysteries that I've played through. It's got elements of cosmic horror as well as ""good"" old-fashioned depravity. As you progress through the missions you're going to be picking up clues that allow you to ""Profile"" what occurred (basically a cutscene that starts out unclear but clears up as you gather clues) that will eventually lead you to the killer and uncover what the craziness that goes on in the dark, dark hours of the night is all about. 

The shooty gameplay isn't particularly good but, thankfully, it's also not particularly necessary. A standard wrench (that you can get with infinite durability from an early sidequest) will do you well for most of the enemies through most of the game. Shooty wise it harkens back to the Resident Evil style aim and stand mechanics but you'll only hit an enemy if your sight actually crosses them and turns into a reticle. It's not great but it gets the job done and, aside from the three bosses in the late game, it's not really required. Just make sure you do the quests to get a .34 with unlimited ammo before you get to them.

All in all the game is flawed, critically so on the PC, but it's still such a satisfying game with an [i]excellent[/i] story and a soundtrack that is silly, cheerful, haunting, beautiful and sad all at the same time. Definitely give it a shot in some fashion.

Jugar este videojuego es una pesadilla. Sí, tiene una historia increíble, unos personajes memorables, una banda sonora excepcional y, en definitiva, transmite algo especial. Deadly Premonition es un juego diferente, un soplo de aire fresco. Pero...

También es, y con diferencia, uno de los peores títulos que he jugado. Precisamente ahí reside la gran contradicción y su mayor defecto.

Si a Deadly Premonition le quitamos la historia, es una basura. No me malinterpretéis, me ha encantado jugarlo. Pero también he sufrido mucho al hacerlo. El apartado técnico deplorable, las animaciones forzadas, las situaciones patéticas, la jugabilidad tosca, los combates repetitivos, las partes aburridas... Y la estrella del show, la razón por la cuál no recomendaría ni a mi peor enemigo jugar ESTA versión de Deadly Premonition: los crasheos incesantes.

No os engañéis, es imposible arreglar este horrible e insufrible CUTREPORT. Ni con DPFix ni con la mayor de las suertes vas a evitar que el juego se apague, se reinicie o crashee de múltiples maneras y en múltiples situaciones. Y te va a joder, te va a joder...

El Deadly Premonition original es un juego muy digno de disfrutar, aunque hay que tener la mente abierta. Sin embargo, este port para PC no debería existir, al menos no de esta manera. Es horrible.

The bad port comes in the form of horrible graphics settings and crashes. Fortunately I was able to find workarounds for these issues making the game less of a “bad” port, and more of a “decent” port. The first thing you will want to do is download the DPfix mod which will clean up some of the graphics for you. This does not solve the issue with crashing however. My experience with crashing was that the game would always crash at specific parts of the game, usually at the start of a cut scene. By this, I mean that the crashes were not random. The game would crash, I would reload the game, and it would crash at the exact same spot again. I found a workaround, which involved running the game in compatibility mode until you pass the part that crashes then disable compatibility mode after you save past the crash. By doing this I was able to enjoy the game and complete it with only a few technical issues.

Now for the game itself. The game in my opinion has a great story and cast. The characters have developed back stories, and the game keeps you guessing as to who is guilty of murder. The main character is particularly interesting in his mannerism. All in all, this is a case of a great game that didn’t have enough money for that extra polish. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for a good 3D adventure game with an interesting cast and story.

In all seriousness, DP is worth a try. If you're willing to do a little modding, and you grab this game on sale, you can't go wrong. That's what I did, and I don't regret it. I've enjoyed the game so far, and would recommend it.

The PC port is poorly done.

There is a fix you can get by a very talented individual by the name Durante, which unlocks various options for the game such as resolution, anisotropic filtering, SSAO etc and it makes a huuuge difference.

this is an essential fix if you decide to buy :    http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=373

Many people have reported this fix working perfectly and others claim it does improve gfx and lets you set custom resolution but the framerate is still unstable.

My experience was the latter, i have major unstable framerate for the game and my rig can more than handle this game.

I can't recommend the pc version of this game since it requires you to work on it to get it running smoothly, you really shouldn't have to do it after paying money for the game.

Let's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons.
The game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad.
There's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.

During my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.

It was worth it.

[b]2. The Gameplay.[/b]
Deadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee).
During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights.
The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.

The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.

Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.

[b]3. The Story.[/b]
FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game.
The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.

[b]4. The Characters.[/b]
This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms.
The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.

[b]5. The Summary.[/b]
Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned [spoiler](and those that I did not)[/spoiler] - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.

It's easy to imagine that the early design discussions went something like this:


""I have an idea for a game! And by idea, I mean let's copy something. How about we turn that weird 90s TV show by David Lynch into a game!""

""You mean Twin Peaks?""

""Yeah!""

""Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show.""

""Zombies.""

""Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?""

""No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse.""

""So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?""

""Yeah. Head zombies.""

""Got it. So how does the player get around?""

""It's open world.""

""Like GTA? You can drive?""

""Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town.""

""And you can go anywhere?""

""Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere.""

""Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?""

""Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest.""

""Why obscure?""

""Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing [i]dynamic weather[/i].""

""Oooooooooo.""

""Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather.""

""That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?""

""Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!""

""I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies.""

""Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!""

""So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?""

""Exactly!""

""This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it.""

""Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it [i]art[/i].""


On a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.

At one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.

How I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.

The story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.

The game is an open world game set in a city in campain. You are an FBI agent sent there to solve a murder mistery who happened in that city.
The game has a vey nice story, a murder mistery with some fantastic element, since you will mostly fight zombies like enemies born from the mind of the main character.
I can assure you that you will surely play this just for the sake of knowing who the culprit is, but here is some flaw in the gameplay

The game is too easy.

Enemies are always the same slow walking ""zombies"" who takes one or two hits to the head to kill. There is really no challenge at all and the only way to really game over is by either failing some quick-time event or by getting killed by getting hit on purpose. Same thing for the bosses, whose almost every attack can be avoided by quicktime events. Moreover, your weapons are all over powered, from the basic pistol whith infinite ammos to the magnum whose hits can really one shot enemies. why does this game even has melee weapons, don't ask me.
All of this makes the game really boring and doing the secondary missions, which are a lot, becomes something one does just for the achievements.

As if that is not enough the game has some technical flaws with the startup but, at least for me, where not that much of a problem since there are guides on steam who can help with these kind of problems and some random crashes.

On the positive side we have the story, I really enjoyed following it all always wanting to know more about it and every murder it's so particular. But what was really interesting for me was the main character, who suffers from double personality, with a know-it-all behaviour, we really see him change during the game, and the voice act really fits him.

In conclusion I recommend this game only if you like good plots like I do. If you hope for something more FPS like, forget this. If this was a visual novel or a Telltale like game it would have probably been a better purchase. Definetly not to buy at full price and If I should give an objective rate, I would give a 6.5 / 10, although I still enjoyed playing this",1463014454,1592745686,True,2,0,0.439977765083312988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there.
- Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D
- Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player ""go there!...is funny isn't it!?"" for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time!
- The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP).
- The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it.
- OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a ""pro"" but is not a ""con""). 
- The OST is amazing! Point mother fucking period!
- The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now).
- Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding.
- If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details. 
- ""DP Fix"" exist! (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438) As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;)
Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT.
- You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!

[b]Notes:[/b]
- You can find ""Pillow Stains"", the song from the former form of DP called ""Rainny Woods"" check the trailer on YouTube: www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbbhwO7pRHA within the game ;) just explore the map. Song: www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9zfSVmMbjM 
- Don't waste your first playthrough without doing side-quest.
- DP Fix recommendations:
1) Desactivare the DEP for the .exe
2) Create a shortcut of the .exe to achieve the borderless mode.
3) Run the .exe with W98 compatibility and admin rights.
4) If you have some .dll problems just follow the Steam discussions. Every OS is different.
5) You can now use Sweet FX to bring the Xbox 360 grading. 
6) There's a horrible Memory Leak problem within the fullscreen mode. Use borderless as mentioned before to solve this on many cases. This also will solve the issue of the Alt+Tab freeze and the steam overlay.

Debo reconocerle al director del videojuego, que tanto en guion como desarrollo de la aventura, es muy interesante. Me ha encantado. Te enamoras de cada personaje del juego, ya que cada uno tiene un perfil muy bien diseñado, y ademas, parecen que sean reales, porque realiza una vida cotidiana.
El videojuego tiene una calidad grafica aceptable, posee los subtítulos en castellano, cromos y logros Steam. 
No me ha gustado que solo poseyera un nivel de dificultad, haciendo que actividades como esconderse dentro de los armarios para esquivar los fantasmas, se convierta en algo innecesario de realizar, debido a que es mejor hacerles frente, haciendo que el jugador no pase por mucha tensión.
Tampoco no me ha satisfecho, el no ver ciudadanos (salvo protagonistas) por las calles para darle realismo o enfrentarme a otros vehículos en los desafíos de conducción. 
Sobre la historia, como habéis leído en la sinopsis del juego, trata sobre de un agente del FBI con habilidades especiales, que tiene que investigar un asesinato. No cuento mas, para evitar Spoilers.
Ahora viene la causa del porque recomiendo que os penseis mucho, en comprar este juego:
Debido a los MUCHISIMOS BUGS que posee. No os podéis hacer una idea, de la cantidad de fallos técnicos que tiene este juego. Fallos, que pueden provocar que el juego no funcione desde un inicio, o que no funcione a mitad de una partida, o que pierdas todos tus progresos, o que no puedas avanzar, etc. Tienes que estar muy atento para evitar que esos bugs te pasen factura. Y si no me creéis, solo debéis pasar por la zona de Discusiones o de Guías de la Comunidad del juego, para que os hagáis una idea de lo que hablo.
Otro de los fallos, son los carateres de los subtitulos, que algunos no se muestran bien, y debes recurrir a un parche casero, para que estos se muestren perfectamente.
La verdad, es una lastima verme obligado a daros un aviso para que os planteéis muy seriamente, si el comprar o no, este gran juego, pero es que los fallos técnicos son un quebradero de cabeza y no deseo que alguien se lleve el mismo chasco que me encontré al jugarlo. Lo que no me explico, es como un juego con este alto nivel de bugs, se permite comercializar en Steam, es que no lo entiendo.
Deadly Premonition, practicamente puedes ejecutarlo casi completamente bien, en el sistema Operativo Windows 7.
Si el juego te lo encuentras por 1 Euro, en alguno de esos bundles que trae varios juegos, te recomiendo que te lo compres. Si lo encuentras mas caro, ni se te ocurra comprarlo.

P.D.> Me puse en contacto con la empresa del juego, llamada ""Rising Star Games"", y me comunicaron que no pueden realizar un parche de actualizacion, para correguir los fallos del juego, debido a que cerro el estudio responsable de su creacion. Por lo que de momento y durante bastante tiempo, Deadly Premonition no recibira ningun tipo de actualizacion.

MENSAJE PARA LA EMPRESA RISING STAR GAMES

+ Buena trama
+ Buena ambientación
+ Demasiada variedad en este juego: manejar, investigar, matar …fantasmas(?
Contras:
- El sistema de combate es medio torpe, ni con control o mando va bien
- No se pueden cambiar los gráficos, es lo que ves
- Las escenas no pueden ponerse en pausa
- es más fácil cerrar el juego cerrando la ventana que desde el menú
- Tiene varios bugs, entre estos que no puede escucharse en 5.1, solo estéreo, o escucharás un eterno frenazo mientras vas manejando.

En jugabilidad hay más contras que pros, pero es un juego que no podrás dejar de jugar, una vez lo empieces vas a querer más. Lo tuve en mi biblioteca por más de un año, solo porque me dejé llevar por la crítica de los usuarios, no cometan el mismo error. 

Digamos que jugabilidad: 7/10
Gráficos 7/10
Todo lo demás 11/10

(Kein Wunder, die Konsolen Fassung war ja auch nicht die Beste)
Selbst HEUTE nach verdammten 2 1/2 Jahren haben die Entwickler es NICHT auf die Reihe gebracht das Spiel zu optimieren. Lächerliche 720p & keine Grafikeinstellungen.
Dies kann man mit DPfix ausbessern. Aber das kommt nicht von den Entwicklern, haben es aber im HUB angeheftet...
Vllt sind sie zu blöd / faul es selber auf die Reihe zu bekommen.

Nun gut... ich gab das Spiel Ca. 7 Std eine Chance.
Ich werde nicht auf die Geschichte oder Charaktere eingehen, ich komme gleich auf die paar Negativen Aspekte.

1. Der SCHLIMMSTE Punkt vom ganzen Spiel ---> Die ""immer-weiter-sinkenden"" Frames
- Was ich damit sagen will ist, dass bei mir die Frames von Minute zu Minute in den Keller rutschen bis Max. runter auf 20 Fps... warum? Weiß ich selber nicht.
Das Game startet konstant ohne Einbrüche mit 60 Fps. Aber wie gesagt von Minute zu Minute gehen sie runter.
Ich kann so Max. 15-20 Minuten flüssig spielen. 
Selbst NUR im Menü kann man sehen, wie die Frames langsam sinken. Und bis heute wurde nichts gepatcht -.-

Ich habe einen Abend, mehrere Stunden lang im Internet oder hier im Hub nach Lösungen gesucht - Nix.
Bin aber nicht der einzige, mit diesem Problem. Bei vielen scheint es zu funktionieren - bei mir und tausend anderen nicht.

DA kommen wir gleich zu Folgenden Dingen, die ich getan habe aber es nichts gebracht hat:
- Restart PC
- De- und Neuinstallation des Games
- PhysX Deinstalliert und den vom Spiel installiert
- Kompatibilität alle Betriebssysteme durchprobiert
- Als Admin ausführen
- Den Launcher im ordner starten, nicht in Steam
- DPfix installiert (Dadurch hat man Auflösung 1920 x 1080, und kann Grafikeinstellen per Nummern ändern)
- Gefühlte hundert verschiedene Einstellung in der DPfix . ini Datei ausprobiert
- Vsync an / aus
- Mit und Ohne Controller
- Treiber sind alle aktuell! Bin ja nicht doof, falls jmd heute noch mit solch einer Aussage antanzt
uvm.

Ich habe sogut wie alles probiert, was im Internet oder Hub steht. Mich regt das auf -.-
Naja, damit ist das Game für mich aus. Zum Glück nur für Ca. 3 Euro im Sale gekauft.

2. Die Steuerung
- Ich sag nur eins ""KATASTROPHAL"". Egal ob zu Fuß oder beim Auto fahren.
Ich verstehe nicht, warum die Kamera nach Links zeigt, wenn ich im Auto nach RECHTS abbiege? 
Allgemein dreht die kamera in die andere Richtugn, wenn man auch nur kurz lenkt.
Dazu kommt, dass das Auto manchmal gar nicht aus dem Arsch kommt. Und gelegentlich lenkt er einfach viel zu viel und schwupp - Baum geknutscht, was unsichtbare getroffen oder die Spielgrenze.

Mit controller ist es noch schlimmer. Der Fix wegen dem Controller kam später - das merkt man.
Im Kampf *Facepalm* ... sobald man mit einer Waffe zielt, kann man sich nicht bewegen. Ich glaube sowas wie Ausweichen gibt es nicht, oder? Hab nix gemerkt.
Das schwenken mit der Waffe auf den Feind erwies sich Anfangs extrem nervig. Aber mit vielen Stunden und Übung gewöhnt man sich dran.

3. Die ""Stadt"" 
- Das Spiel hat den Tag ""OpenWorld"". Ist es auch, aber die Stadt + Umland ist tot. Es fahren nur paar Autos rum. Gibt kein Gras. Die ""Wiese"" ist einfach nur glatt & Grün. Die Bäume sind alle gleich. Gibt anscheinend nur 1 Modell.
Das Game hat viele Nebenmissionen, die ab Bestimmten Kapiteln und Tageszeit gemacht werden können. 
Auf der Karte gibt es desweiteren noch Fischsymbole. vllt kann man Angeln... wozu? Keine ahnung.
Vllt dachten die sich das, als eine Art ""Nebenbeschäftigung"" - höhöhö.
Es gibt mehr als 60 Sammelkarten, die in der Welt gefunden werden können. 


Wie gesagt, ich würde das Game sehr gerne zocken und die Grafik wäre mir scheißegal, wenn nur die beschissenen FPS konstant auf 60 bleiben würden. Ich habe keine Ahnugn, was ich noch tun könnte :( 

Solltet ihr keine Probleme haben, dann beneide ich euch :D
Falls ihr noch meine PC Daten wissen wollt ---> Schaut in mein Profil.


PS: Es ist mir egal, ob hier viele das Review hier mit einen ""Nicht Hilfreich"" betätigen. Mir geht es hier nicht um Top Review, sondern um MEIN REVIEW! Es kann nicht sein, dass man nach sooovielen Jahren und Monaten es immer noch nichts gefixxt hat.

O game foi desenvolvido pela Rising Star Games e Access Games, lançado em 2010 para PS3 e X360, e três anos mais tarde, relançado para PS3 e PC na edição ""Director's Cut"", uma versão com melhorias gráficas e alguns extras em relação ao original.

Falar de Deadly Premonition com um olhar extremamente crítico é um tanto incoerente, o game estava em desenvolvimento desde 2004, e foi pensado para ser lançado no PS2 com o nome de ""Rainy Woods"", mas em 2007 fora cancelado, e anos mais tarde, o projeto foi retomado. O orçamento foi baixíssimo, e os devs se esforçaram muito para que o game pudesse ser possível.

Enfim, vamos começar pelos pontos negativos: Os gráficos e a jogabilidade.

Que DP foi projetado para o PS2 não é nada difícil de se deduzir, os gráficos são feios, pouco polidos, as expressões faciais dos personagens são de dar dó e os efeitos de tiro são a coisa mais podre que eu já vi em um game, parece que você está atirando com uma arma de chumbinho, nada tem impacto no jogo (carros, tiros, golpes, NADA TE PASSA A SENSAÇÃO DE IMPACTO), a física é tosca a ponto de você rir de desgosto.
E isso nos leva a outro ponto muito negativo, a jogabilidade. Não me refiro às partes de investigação, nessas é só andar e interagir com o cenário, mas é nas partes de survival horror que o jogo te bate com uma cadeira de metal nas costas. Tudo é muito repetitivo e não existe desafio, a ""dificuldade"" é só o numero de tiros que os zumbis precisam para morrer, ou seja, no inicio, você mata um zumbi com 3 tiros, e no final, esse mesmo zumbi precisa de 9 tiros para morrer. Além disso, os momentos que o ""Raincoat Killer"" (basicamente, ele exerce o mesmo papel do Nemesis de RE3, te persegue e é invencível) aparece são IRRITANTES, pelo simples fato de ele ser invencível e seus encontros com ele sempre vão terminar nos quick time events mais sem sentido e confusos possíveis (por exemplo, você fugir dele e PARAR PARA EMPURRAR UMA CAIXA QUE VOCÊ PODE SIMPLESMENTE DAR A VOLTA POR ELA), sempre te obrigando a memorizá-los a cada game over, realmente algo muito maçante e desmotivante.
E a pior parte de tudo, os carros, dirigir em DP (e você vai dirigir MUITO) é uma verdadeira sessão de tortura, o carro parece ser feito de papel, qualquer virada brusca faz ele tombar e fazer uma simples curva é uma tarefa muito difícil.

Mas aí você pensa: ""Esse jogo é uma merda""

Pode ser, mas é uma merda MUITO LEGAL, e por quê?

Apesar de seus defeitos, DP me conquistou pela história, o game começa com o agente especial do FBI Francis York Morgan (chame-o de York, todos fazem isso) e seu amigo Zach (aparentemente um amigo imaginário, com quem York fala alto e na frente das pessoas, sem se importar se vão julgá-lo) analisando casos de assassinato de jovens moças, os quais ele tem um interesse particular, York está à caminho de Greenvale, uma cidadezinha pacata no interior de Washington, que recentemente fora abalada pelo brutal assassinato de Anna Graham, uma linda jovem queridinha de toda a comunidade local. Ao chegar à cidade, York se depara com todo o tipo de bizarrice, seja momentos onde tudo muda de figura, o céu fica escuro e zumbis começam a caminhar, ou até mesmo a peculiar população local, tudo é muito estranho de início e cabe ao jogador explorar a cidade para procurar pistas e solucionar o grande mistério. De início, nada vai fazer sentido e você sentirá que está sempre muito longe da solução do mistério, mas tudo se desenrola bem, e o final é triste, porém, muito satisfatório.
Além da missão principal, existem muitas sidemissions, que completadas, garantem vantagens ao jogador, como melhor desempenho nos carros (tornando-os menos horríveis de se pilotar), um Wakie Talkie que te dá a capacidade de dar fast travel, entre outras coisas que não são necessárias para a trama, mas são uma mão na roda.
O que realmente conquista são os diálogos que, apesar de serem de um jogo de terror/suspense, são carregados de humor escrachado e toneladas de referências à cultura pop dos 80's.

DP possui fortes inspirações em survival horrors old school, e tem até os mesmos problemas que eles, muitas referencias ao cinema e música oitentistas são feitas e até inspirações em Junji Ito podem ser notadas, além disso, o enredo do game é fortemente baseado em Twin Peaks, portanto, quem é fã da série deve muito dar uma conferida.

A trilha sonora do game é autoral, e se encaixa sempre muito bem com as situações, o tema principal do game ficará na sua cabeça e você provavelmente vai pensar em toca-lo no violão.

E por fim, a ambientação do game é ótima, apesar de seus gráficos serem pobres, a experiência de explorar o mundo aberto de Greenvale é ótima, você pode ir pescar no lago da cidade, ir à lanchonete, ao bar, ou até mesmo visitar residentes da cidade, que possuem seus itinerários, cada NPC tem suas tarefas diárias e podem ser interrogados ou não, dependendo da atividade que estão realizando no momento. Além disso, existem inúmeras atividades que podem ser feitas para passar o tempo, além da pescaria você pode ir ao bar e jogar dardos, ou pode ajudar a dona da mercearia a organizar as caixas no estoque num minigame semelhante à um game de caixas. Você realmente sente que está em uma cidadezinha rural dos EUA e que precisa devolver a paz aos cidadãos que nela vivem.

Enfim, Deadly Premonition é um jogo problemático, que se analisado friamente, ponto a ponto, tiraria uma nota digna de Rambo (o game), mas se você colocar na balança seus pontos positivos e conseguir ignorar a jogabilidade porca com gráficos feios, você com certeza aproveitará o que o game tem a oferecer. Um mistério aparentemente insolúvel e um senso de humor simples são o que marcam DP, e se pudesse descrever esse jogo de forma simples, eu o chamaria de ""belo desastre"", que ao mesmo tempo que lhe fará rir de piadas descompromissadas, lhe fará coçar a cabeça em perplexidade com as complexidades e mistérios muito presentes em seu enredo.

Deadly Premonition para mim, é sem dúvida uma masterpiece incompreendida, e facilmente um dos meus games favoritos.

Играя в эту игру я прошел через все стадии негодования: ненависть, отрицание, гнев, смирение. Я хотел забросить ее еще при старте, но мне было жалко потраченных на нее денег.

После того как я наконец таки прошел вступительный сон и нудную первую главу и мне показали все возможности игры она вдруг начала мне нравится. И действительно у игры действительно есть, то чем она может вас заинтересовать.

Интересные персонажи, проработанные диалоги, смешные шутки, открытый мир в виде небольшого городка, интрига преступления, хорошие и не очень сайд-квесты (дополнительные задания не связанные или слабо связанные с основным сюжетом).

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637873927

Играем мы за детектива ФБР Фрэнсиса Йорка с раздвоением личности, (сразу вспоминается Heavy Rain, не так ли?) который приехал в маленький городок расследовать убийство при крайне странных обстоятельствах.

Очень умело сломана “четвертая стена”, так как одна из личностей главного героя, это мы - Зак. К которому главный герой переодически обращяется за советом, помощью или обсуждением очередного фильма, о которых наш герой готов разговаривать сам с собой весь день.

Игра представляет собой этакую смесь Твин Пикс и геймплея resident evil. Маленький городок с большим секретом - для которого ни к селу, ни к огороду привязали отстрел адской нечисти и психоделические сны, которые практически никак не привязаны к сюжету.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640021208

У каждого персонажа свой распорядок дня, персонажи ходят кушать, ездят на работу. Словом симуляция живого городка, достаточно хорошая.

Но у игры все не настолько хорошо и радужно как может показаться, в первую очередь это конечно же невероятно кривой порт с консолей и ужасная оптимизация. Настолько кривой порт я вижу в первые в жизни - игра вылетает, причем достаточно часто.

Практически полное отсутствие каких либо настроек графики и разрешения, долгие загрузки, отсутствие какой либо нормальной физики персонажей, монстров, предметов, ящиков и машин.

Графика просто ужасна… может быть это сойдет для Tokyo Game Show 2007 года, но уж точно не для ПК 2013 года с пометкой режиссерской версии и это за те деньги что за нее хотят.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=633501785

Игра достаточно продолжительная, но если вы хотите в нее сыграть… вам понадобиться потратить очень большое количество времени на танцы с бубном если вы конечно хотите пройти больше чем ⅓ игры.

Так что если вам нравится Твин Пикс, Heavy Rain, геймплей Resident Evil и вы не боитесь покопаться в файлах игры что бы каждый раз ее чинить, то безусловно на нее стоит потратить свое время.

Estoy muy satisfecho y muy orgulloso de haber acabado este juego a pesar de sus defectos tan críticados, DP es una experiencia que no puedes dejar escapar, sobretodo si eres de esos que buscan un gran argumento y un buen desarrollo de los personajes. Para mi, uno de los mejores juegos de la pasada generación.


LO MEJOR:

- El protagonista, derrocha carisma y personalidad por todos lados.
- La evolución y desarrollo de los personajes, la relación entre Emily y York simplemente es de cine.
- El argumento es excelente, profundo e inmersivo, con giros de guión inesperados.
- Muchas actividades y misiones secundarias.
- La banda sonora es muy buena (aunque puede resultar algo repetitiva), el trabajo de doblaje también me parecio muy bueno.
- Es un juego largo, la historia principal nos llevara cerca de 20 horas, a eso le podemos sumar las misiones secundarias, el conseguir los distintos trajes, los cromos... lo que nos da mas de 30 horas de juego.
- El humor presente a lo largo de todo el juego.
- Survival Horror en un mundo abierto con muchas cosas para hacer. (ir de pesca, comer con los compañeros, ir de copas, carreras...)
- Es posible que se este desarrollando una secuela.

LO PEOR:

- Apartado técnico de PS2, mejorable y nada sorprendente.
- Jugabilidad poco pulida, la conducción es pésima.
- Bugs y crasheos en la versión de PC, aunque pueden solucionarse muy fácilmente (si os da crasheo en alguna zona simplemente teneis que hacer que York fume para que pase el tiempo, si se os cuelga en alguna cinemática o fase teneis que poner el juego en compatibilidad Windows 7)
- Poca variedad de enemigos.
- Huecos argumentales.
- En mi caso, tuve un bug en el que una llave se me metio detras de una pared y no podía cogerla, mi única opción era empezar el juego de cero... por suerte logre conseguir una partida guardada de Internet para poder seguir. Cuidado cuando mateis a un enemigo, alejarlo de las paredes.
- Los bugs anteriormente mencionados pueden hacer que mas de un jugador pierda el interes.


A pesar de sus importantes defectos os pido que le deis paciencia y que lo jugueis hasta pasar el capítulo 1, aunque sus gráficos esten anticuados y su jugabilidad sea tosca no es un impedimento para disfrutarlo, la historia compensa todos sus errores, os lo puedo asegurar. El estilo de juego se acerca a los survival horror antiguos, recordando a los viejos SH y RE, que aunque estan anticuados es muy fácil acostumbrarse a su sistema, por eso os animo a que os lo paseis hasta el final.
Lo que esta claro, es que si no llega a ser por el argumento, este juego habría pasado sin pena ni gloria y se habría convertido en un auténtico juego prescindible y para olvidar, sin embargo no ha sido asi. Para los amantes de las buenas historias, recomendado 100%.

С первой же минуты игры меня не покидало ощущения, что я оказался в городке [b]Twin Peaks[/b]. Такой же отрезанный от остального мира  с странными, а порой очень причудливыми жителями и какой-то зловещей тайной, известной только местным старожилам.

[i]Общие впечатления:[/i]
+ [u]Атмосфера[/u] в игре просто изумительна, в лучших традициях того самого [i]Silent Hill[/i] и вышеупомянутого [i]Twin Peaks[/i]. Каждый эпизод все мрачнее, настроение портится с первыми каплями дождя...
+ [u]Сюжет[/u]. Один из главных критериев хорошей одиночной игры. Тут сценаристы постарались на славу, узел завязанный в начале игре, вам предстоит распутывать на протяжении всех эпизодов, плюс добавьте к этому постоянные сюрпризы, которые будет подбрасывать игра. Не буду спойлерить, но сюжет в игре шикарен.
+ [u]Фриплей[/u]. Еще один из плюсов [b]Deadly Premonition[/b]. Первую половину игры вы даже может забудете про основной сюжет, а будете знакомиться с обитателями городка и местными достопримечательностями. Заняться будет чем, можно сходить на рыбалку или поиграть в дартс, выполнить дополнительные квесты героев игры, а их тут под 50 штук, можно поучаствовать в местных гонках и т.д. Причем при прохождении каждого квеста вы лучше узнаете каждого из жителей города, а они здесь все немного чокнутые.
+ [u]Персонажи[/u]. Харизма каждого из персонажей игры просто зашкаливает, а главный герой вылитый [i]Купер[/i], такой же экспрессивный, видит загадочные сны и обладает характерной жестикуляцией. Каждый персонаж в игре по-своему уникален и легко запоминается.
+ [u]Музыка[/u] тоже заслуживает отдельной похвалы. Ничего сверхвыдающегося, но выполнено на высоком уровне.
- [u]Порт[/u]. Игра игрой, простите за каламбур, а порт вышел ужасный. Мало того, что даже не прикрутили разрешение для широкоформатных мониторов, а оставили все в родном 1280х720, так еще и вылеты случаются время от времени. 
- [u]Режим сражений[/u]. Совершенно лишнее в [b]Deadly Premonition[/b]. Бродим по одинаковым коридорам, сражаемся практически с одинаковыми противниками, очень скучно + не сложно, но порой очень долго. Единственное, что может вызвать интерес, так это сражения с боссами, но при должной сноровке их можно пройти всех без единой потери единицы здоровья.

[i]Если вас не отпугивает кривой порт, и вы дадите игре хотя бы пару часиков, то она вас не отпустит до финальных титров. Интригующий мистический сюжет, отличная атмосфера и колоритные персонажи сделают свое дело! Поставил бы игре оценку 8,5 по 10 балльной шкале! Рекомендую к прохождению любителям всего мистического и загадочного, особенно поклонникам сериала [b]Twin Peaks![/b][/i]

Honestly, I don’t know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game it’s not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadn’t discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this I’m glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So what’s good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and it’s easy to see why it’s gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. There’s no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. There’s a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.",1457888185,1457888185,True,6,1,0.588580489158630371,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it.

I love story driven games and this one is nothing less than a Gem. If you are familiar with Twin Peaks you could pretty much relate to this story. You are set out to investigate a series of brutal murders that took place in a small hamlet called GreenVale. Be aware that this game is heavily story driven and loaded with Quick Time events while progressing to it. So if you are not fond of that style of gameplay then this game is not for you. 
This game has an open-world free roaming approach to it that gives us some freedom of exploration  although it fails miserably in rewarding you for doing so. The fact that you have to drive from A to B all the time is dreadful in my opinion and it breaks the momentum. 
The game mechanics alternate from Quick time events to a third person shooter and action game which is appreciated actually. The controls are actually poor and most of the time you can't get your aiming straight however it does not punish you for it as it introduces an auto-aim button anyway. The graphics are substandard - I could not care less tough.

Я редко пишу рецензии на игры, которые очень сильно западают мне в душу, потому что боюсь оказаться предвзятой, но это особый случай. Буду пытаться не перехвалить и максимально абстрагироваться. Итак, по порядку. 

В игре наличествуют: явные параллели с небезызвестным сериалом Твин Пикс; добротное музыкальное сопровождение, за счет чего любым событиям в игре придаются особые, незабываемые настроение и атмосфера; разные, удивительно живые персонажи, каждый со своими ""бзиками"", характерами, личным расписанием и своим отношением к главному герою. (Вообще, когда японцы стараются изображать в играх ""не-японцев"", получается своя особенная народность: яркий пример тому boss fights. Но дело здесь не только в них. Персонажи получаются действительно уникальными.) Игра довольна динамична за счет разннобразной, так скажем, повседневной активности: выпил кофе, поехал в участок, оттуда - захотел на дело, захотел - к странной старухе с поленом. По дороге встретил еще кого-то, он тебе cool story рассказал и отправил в какой-то туннель за призраками гоняться. На следующий день ты идешь с местным шефом полиции на рыбалку, а на следующий - [spoiler]вы друг друга пытаетесь грохнуть[/spoiler]. Заехал к коллеге на ужин, и понял, почему все боятся обсуждать то, как она готовит. Не сменил костюм и не побрился - от тебя воняет что аж мухи вокруг вьются. Мир этой игры очень живой и интересный, и любая реакция на него - правильная, ведь столкнись с подобным в жизни, испытал бы то же самое.

За что игре ставят плохие оценки на Steam? В оснвоном, за кривоватый порт на PC. Иногда может подбешивать управление, кому-то графика не нравится и так далее. Это касается многих игр, и не стоит оценивать и отбраковывать данную конкретную по каким-то общим параметрам. Мой совет - give it a try! Дайте этой игре шанс.

Geschichte

In einer amerikanschen Kleinstadt wird eine junge Frau ermordet aufgefunden. Der FBI Agent Francis York Morgan wird mit dem Fall betraut. War das nur der Anfang einer Mordserie?

Das Spiel kann man auch als ""Twin Peaks - The Game"" bezeichnen. Es nimmt sehr viele Elemte der 90 jahre Serie und vermengt diese zu etwas Neuem. Manche der Charaktere sind beinah 1:1 aus der Serie übernommen. 

Gameplay

Es spielt sich wie Residet evil 4 in einer Open Wolrd. Nur wird der Fokus mehr auf die Aufklärung des Verbrechens gesetzt als auf den Kampf. Die Spielwelt ist groß und des gibt unzählige Nebenaufträge zu erledigen, die einem die Bewohner von der Stadt etwas näher bringen.

Grafik

Die Grafik ist nicht auf dem neusten Stand. Ich hatte allerdings kein Problem damit. Für jeden der sich daran stört, es gibt Mods um das Spiel besser aussehen zu lassen.

Fazit

Deadly Premonition ist ein Game, dass seine Ecken und Kanten hat. Die technischen Mängel kann man schlecht übersehen und die Handlung balanziert gekonnt zwischen Trash- und Arthousefilm. Das ist nichts für jedermann. Ich habe es gemocht und empfehle es jedem weiter der mal etwas abseits von Triple A Titeln spielen will.",1456248824,1456317454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b] Минусы.[/b] 

Так понимаю, во всём виновато крайне плохое портирование на ПК, что приводит к бесконечным вылетам, зависаниям, и прочим проблемам совместимости.
Если с вылетами и зависаниями в некоторых местах еще можно бороться путём пропуска кат-сцен и постоянными сохранениями, то с невозможностью повернуться во время стрельбы довольно проблематично справиться.  [spoiler] (Особенно в финальном бою, когда предстоит попасть в куклу.) [/spoiler]
Без определенных  «танцев с бубном» проблему эту не решить.  

Однозначно советовать эту игру всем не могу, ибо многих потенциальных игроков она способна отпугнуть всеми своими сложностями. Но если вы, как и я, уже запаслись успокоительным и настроились на нужный лад, то всё это покажется лишь незначительными препятствиями на пути к чему-то прекрасному.

[b]Non lo avessi mai fatto.[/b]

Diciamo che il plot mi interessava parecchio, visto che l'intenzione del suo creative director Hidetaka Suehiro, conosciuto come Swery65 era di creare un titolo che omaggiasse la serie cult primi anni novanta Twin Peaks.
E posso dirlo tranquillamente: ci è riuscito in pieno. Non è una scopiazzatura del serial di David Lynch, ma un'opera che brilla di luce propria, mettendo in campo un protagonista estremamente carismatico, personaggi memorabili, e una cittadina del northwest americano dove è accaduto un misterioso delitto..

La trama è assolutamente MAGNIFICA e durante il corso del gioco ci si imbatte in più di qualche colpo di scena. Non bisogna mai dare nulla per scontato a Greenvale. Ed è uno dei motivi che spinge il giocatore a proseguire nell'avventura dell'agente Francis York Morgan, perché purtroppo la grafica, così come il gameplay, sono veramente datati. La prima proviene direttamente dall'era PS2, mentre il gameplay assomiglia grossomodo a quello visto il Resident Evil 4.
Il sonoro, inteso come effetti sonori è tremendo, con dei suoni davvero fuori luogo (la camminata ad esempio sembra un battere con le mani su una tavola di legno), le musiche sono invece particolari, con brani davvero surreali alle volte.

A rincarare la dose ci si mette pure la versione PC: è praticamente impossibile terminare il gioco senza incorrere in uno dei molteplici bug, glitch, crash che affliggono il gioco. In 38 ore di gioco, credo sia crashato almeno un centinaio di volte, e non sto scherzando. Senza contare che dopo tot tempo il framerate crolla, costringendo a salvare/riavviare il gioco.
Fortunatamente ad alcune limitazioni e errori è corso in soccorso Durante e il suo [url=http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix]DPFix[/url]. per completezza [url=http://zombievil.altervista.org/deadly-premonition-savegame.html]allego[/url] anche un archivio contenente la maggior parte di save che ho realizzato per ogni livello o situazione particolare che si presentava (crashava spesso e così ad ogni giro facevo backup del save).

Tutti i difetti comunque passano in secondo piano, perché semplicemente non si può rinunciare a giocare un titolo simile. All'estero ho letto spesso associato a Deadly Premonition la famosa [i]""So bad it's good""[/i], cosa assolutamente falsa, perché DP è veramente un gioco memorabile, bizzarro magari, ma non assolutamente brutto.

Dopo anni ricordo con piacere ogni missione principale o secondaria, i dialoghi surreali con i vari abitanti di Greenvale, il bonus dell'agenzia per essermi fatto la barba o le mosche che girano attorno ad un vestito ormai sporco. Ah e i monologhi sui film anni '80. Buon Dio.
Se questo era l'obiettivo di SWERY, beh, complimenti. DP è uno dei miei giochi preferiti di tutti i tempi, c'è poco da fare.

Você talvez possa odiá-lo por ser um jogo extremamente bugado, até mesmo injogável se nao instalar certos patches fixes de terceiros, por que a produtora do game já até o esqueceu. Pode odiá-lo também por ter gráficos da geração do Playstation 2, algo que pode ser melhorado um pouco com patches de terceiros tambem. Pode odiá-lo inclusive pela jogabilidade, no quesito da dirigibilidade dos veículos que é uma verdadeira m*rd*, esse nem com patche resolve. Mas do outro lado da moeda voce pode amá-lo por ser um jogo com uma história fantástica, que te prende do início ao fim, aliás um dos melhores enredos de jogos que já vi. Pode amá-lo tambem por ser um jogo que possui diversos diálogos estranhos e ao mesmo tempo engraçados, o que deixa o jogo com uma maior imersibilidade, fazendo com que cada npc tenha sua própria história dentro do universo do jogo e que faz com que voce se familiarize com todos. Pode amá-lo inclusive por ser um dos únicos, ou talvez o único, jogo de terror em mundo aberto, onde voce pode visitar vários lugares e ainda cumprir várias side-quests que não estão ligadas com as quests pra finalizar o jogo, com isso aumentando o fator replay.

I'm sure this game is great.  From what I've played of it, it seems brilliant.
Not that I have much to go on, because after a week of working like it should, if randomly decided that I am indeed *not* allowed to use my gamepad.  That leaves me with either using they're half-assed keyboard and mouse controls, which would be torturous enough without the added complication of the fact that I'm on a laptop that this game will overheat when set up in a way that allows for comfortable keyboard and mouse controls.  The other option is third party software to map the keyboard controls to a gamepad, but good luck with that; I thought they were working until I made the ill advised decision of entering a car.  If there exists an arcane enchantment that makes a fine-tuned JoyToKey mapping harmonize perfectly with their crappy launcher's controls that makes the already horrendous cars even slightly drivable, I'm all ears.
But as it stands, I've essentially wasted three hours of my life trying to make someone else's game work.  I'm too dusgusted by the deplorable lack of any sort of quality control here to really care about any workarounds.  Getting the game to even start was already a workaround.  I've already put more time and effort into writing this stupid review than any ""developer"" put into making sure their controller support doesn't just decide to vanish.  I was lucky enough to get this game for free, so I can only give my deepest sympathies to anyone who was suckered into buy it.

Yet I do recommend everyone to play the game at least once. This game must be experienced!

Here are just some examples as to why the game is so bad-

1. It's glitchy, it crashes a lot, and has lengthy loading screens
2. Animations are silly
3. Action is bad
4. Voice acting is meh
5. Gameplay is wonky
6. Too many useless, lengthy driving sections (Driving was a horrible forray!)
7. The map was frustrating to use for any sort of direction
8. The ending after the climax and when everything was said and done really dragged on.

Throughout the game there were multiple annoying, odd, or awkardly hilarious things. For example -

1. I know the game is supposed to be ""open world"" but the world was downright boring.
2. You have frequent conversations with your apparent imaginary friend which range from  hilarious to downright ridiculous.
3. The soundtrack is always oh so appropriate. Especially the whistling song: that one's my favorite. (Sense the sarcasm)
4. There are random big ass flies everywhere!
5. If you use the siren in a police car for too long you get fatigued according to that indicator bar and you cant use the siren again until the bar goes back down. Also, if you leave the car after the bar has been maxed out, you yourself will be fatigued causing you to limp until the bar goes all the way down. I didn't realize it took so much effort to have a siren running in a police car.
6. The dialogue! 

Examples of the aforementioned dialogue. And these are just a few of MANY -

1. ""My coffee warned me about it""
2. ""Who is that one Hollywood writer? Oh yeah, Joel.""
3. Quote from the fat guy in the game, ""Chickening out now would be like leaving after appetizers.""

So much to love here! Now go buy the game and load it up. Here are some tips for when you do -
1. Always run through doors. It takes less time
2. Running the game in compatability mode for windows 98 made the game crash less and it seemed to load faster in-game. Some of the cutscenes became laggy, although.
3. About halfway through the game there's a mission where you follow a suspect in your car. It's super frustrating because driving is horrible. On top of that, the guy you're pursuing fluctuates between going 15-25 mph aka the slowest driver of all time. There is no good way to regulate your speed so you end up in ""stop-and-go"" traffic without any traffic. And here comes the tip... Don't accidentally bump the siren. You'll immediately have to start the mission over after what feels like 20 minutes of following the stupid fuck! GAH!

In a nutshell: This game is so bad it's good.
Overall the story interested me: it kept me playing and wondering who done it... that and all the beautifully horrendous presentation!

Upen launching the game you are faced with and ugly, if simple, launcher. Settings are found here, and a play button. I opted to play at max, fullscreen. When the game started up, it was windowed. I could not make the game fullscreen, even though the option had been present and selected. I noticed the beginning cutscene rendered at 31 fps, which is fine. Many games render the cutscenes at 30, so no issue. The problem was the first gameplay. It is atrocious. Unplayable. Unforgivable. Even though the game ran at what I assume is a capped 60 fps, because honestly I could have been getting 200+ with my rig, the game ran choppy, slow, awful. It looked like about 5 fps. Ridiculous. I tried to run around to see if it would buffer out. But no. Consistantly laughable performance, with no hope at all of ever being played by me again. 
 
So I paused the game, and what? Actual 60 fps performance? The only the thing runs well in this game is the pause menu. That is absolutely the worst. I didn't believe a PC port could be so bad, but this game has shown me that if little enough effort is put into the work, you can truly release a product not worth the title beta.

Виной тому техническая составляющая игры.

     Но если вы соберете волю в кулак и прочитаете пару-тройку гайдов по решению технических проблем, закроете глаза на корявую графику, в итоге вам обеспечена масса положительных впечатлений от прохождения этой игры.
Проект впечатлил меня атмосферой настолько, что я буквально проживал жизнь с героями этой, не побоюсь этого слова, новеллы. 

     В игре представлен разнообразный геймплей, который включает в себя классический survival horror, автомобильные погони, элементы исследования мира, мини игры и загадки.
Открытый мир, который создает впечатление живого городка, где происходят случайные встречи. Каждый без исключения персонаж уникален. Характеры максимально раскрыты их фразами, жестами, поступками.
     В дополнении к основному продолжительному сюжету, в игре есть 60 необязательных, но разнообразных заданий, многие из которых связаны друг с другом. Их по-настоящему интересно и хочется проходить. Даже, казалось бы, рутинные вещи, такие как чистка костюма и бритье (или их отсутствие) влияет не только на внешний вид героя, но и на его коммуникативные способности. Именно внимание авторов к мелким деталям делает погружение во вселенную основательным.
     Не ленитесь и исследуйте мир, чаще общайтесь с персонажами. Вы узнаете много нового и интересного. Многие сайд квесты запросто можно упустить, если не поговорить с определенным персонажем вовремя и возврата к ним уже не будет. А за их выполнение главный герой не редко получает весьма полезные бонусы.

     И мне по настоящему обидно, что эта игра стала жертвой некачественного портирования, отпугнувшего так много игроков, поставивших Deadly Premonition низкие оценки.
Внести небольшой вклад в исправление ситуации попытался и я. На [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/247660/guides/] странице руководств [/url]  вы найдете небольшой гайд, который возможно поможет многим игрокам преодолеть моменты с вылетами игры.

You wanted it, now you've got it – the award-winning cult sensation Deadly Premonition is arriving on PC in an enhanced Director’s Cut package! 

Playing as special agent Francis York Morgan (call him York – everyone else does), it’s your job to investigate the brutal murder of a young local beauty in the town of Greenvale. Amidst the backdrop of soaring mountains and a small American suburb, York must solve the mystery of the Red Seed Murders and stay alive in a place where supernatural creatures and a mysterious raincoat-clad, axe-wielding killer seek to end his investigation for good. 

Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games that will help you solve the murders and uncover Greenvale’s deepest, darkest secrets.

Однако, не все разработчики и издатели хранят верность только консолям — иногда что-то щёлкает в головах этих людей и игры с приставок появляются в [b]Steam[/b].

Повезло с этим и игре [b]Deadly Premonition[/b], которую создала японская студия [i]Access Games[/i], выпустив её сначала на [b]Xbox[/b] и [b]PlayStation[/b], а через три года американцы из [i]Rising Star Games[/i] помогли портировать её и на компьютеры.

Проект представляет собой психологический триллер с открытым миром, вобравший в себя множество прямых и косвенных отсылок к фильмам и сериалам прошлого, преимущественно в этом же жанре. Самой яркой аналогией является, пожалуй, знаменитый американский сериал и фильм [b]Twin Peaks[/b] режиссёра [i]Дэвида Линча[/i]. Игра явно копирует и сам городок и места действия и даже некоторых персонажей. Даже завязка у игры точь-в-точь как у сериала — в городе совершено ужасное преступление, погибла молодая девушка, а главный герой — сотрудник ФБР — Фрэнсис Йорк Морган, прибывает в городок дабы расследовать это дело.

[b]О главном.[/b] Самый бросающийся в глаза минус — это чем страдает большинство игр, которые были перенесены с приставок. А именно портирование, которым занимались американцы. Вот что у них вышло:
Во-первых, ужаснейшая стабильность. Игра невероятно капризна и может вылетать при любом удобном случае, порой кажется, что во время игры лучше вообще не дышать.
Во-вторых, блокировка разрешения на фиксированные [i]720p[/i] и полное отсутствие графических настроек, которые так необходимы играм на [b]PC[/b].
В-третьих, картонное управление автомобилями. Иной раз создаётся ощущение, что машины ничего не весят и вот-вот взлетят.
В-четвёртых, слабенькая графика. Игра вышла в 2010 году и уже по тем временам графическая составляющая игры была крайне слабой.
В-пятых, убийственно долгие загрузки. Не знаю чего там внутри нахимичили, но пока грузится основной городской уровень можно успеть сделать множество домашних дел.

Всё это может сильно оттолкнуть желающих окунуться в запутанную историю убийства молодой девушки в забытом богом городишке. А зря, у игры навалом черт, ради которых стоит погрузиться примерно на 30 часов в эту тёмную и грязную историю.

Не знаю почему, но у японцев часто получается создавать запоминающихся персонажей. [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] не исключение. От первой встречи с полицейскими Эмили и Джорджем на мосту и до самых титров игра будет знакомить нас со множеством тончайших черт основных жителей городка. У каждого человека свой характер, свои проблемы, своя семья, своя запоминающаяся внешность и... свои квесты.
Да-да, игра предлагает помимо основной сюжетной ветки, которую можно быстренько пробежать, еще и побочные задания, ориентированные на поиск предметов, небольшие расследования или даже передвижение тяжестей. За выполнение квестов естественно полагается награда, которая тоже весьма разнообразна. Тут и скидки в магазинах и одежда для Йорка и даже личные автомобили жителей.

Удивительно, но непривлекательная внешне и технически игра таит в себе буйство мелочей, из которых обычно сотканы лучшие игры индустрии. Шутка ли, но герою нужно спать, есть, менять грязные костюмы и даже бриться! На первый взгляд всё это ненужные элементы геймплея, но они так органично вписаны в игру, что этого практически не замечаешь (если не торопишься побыстрее пройти).

Игра позиционирует себя как ужастик, но она почти не страшная, иногда очень однообразная. Одним словом — бюджетная. Но есть в ней что-то такое притягательное, даже сексуальное, взрослое, иногда с великолепным юмором. Разработчики не пытаются вести нас за ручку, пробежав игру можно пропустить огромную кучу мелочей. Похоже, что создатели хотели чтобы мы натуральным образом пожили в Гринвейле, задержались, изучили. И у них это почти получилось. Только добавить бы игре лоска, максимально отполировать и можно вязать праздничный бантик как на подарке.

Чем-то подобным должен был стать [b]Alan Wake[/b], пока его не превратили в хороший, но слишком прямолинейный хоррор с элементами шутера. Если у [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] было бы финское качество и графика уровня [b]Alan Wake[/b], то этот японский проект покорил бы многих и стал бы чем-то вроде культового [b]Silent Hill[/b]. Но, к сожалению, техническая составляющая игры портит практически всё, отталкивая от себя каждого второго игрока.",1453594516,1453594516,True,41,0,0.711831390857696533,3,True,False,False,False,,,

- No son muy frecuentes, pero tiene crashes... incluso puede crashear estando delante del teléfono para salvar la partida
- La navegación por los menu, para utilizar items, cambiar de arma, todo eso... es demasiado consolero... no han sabido adaptarlo a los controles de una PC
- En los momentos en los que hay que conducir, se puede abrir un mapa, pero es muy difícil seguir un camino directo hacia el destino de la misión. Muchas veces uno termina en un camino sin salida y debe retroceder
- Jugando con mouse, puede ser complicado apuntar a los enemigos con armas de fuego... Repito.. el juego es MUY consolero, y eso no me agrada

However, charging 30 Euro for this is overpriced.

Technical problems:
- Crashes and bugs here and there
- Clunky controls
- A fixed 720p 16:9 resolution; there is a mod that changes that, but that will give you more chrashes

While I am accustomed to clunky controls for console ports, the fixed resolution and the crashes are not acceptable.

This game tries to be so much at once, it ends up being not good at anything particular:

- It tries to tell a story, but that story is weird and has too many turnarounds and arbitrary events. Even after the story is finished, you could still turn it around again and no one would mind.
- It tries to be a detective game, but it fails, most detective work is embedded into the story and there is not that much you can do wrong. Lots of suspects, but you don't choose the trail you want to follow, the main mission just guards you through
- It tries to be open world GTA driving around, but fails due to extremely clunky driving, unusable map, and chrashes if you go somewhere where the game didn't expect you to go.
- It tries to simulate real world needs: You have to eat and to sleep and to shave from time to time. But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc.
- It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events
- It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable
- It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city. 
- On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.

The store page tells ""Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)"". Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.

To sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: ""Zach, this is a waste of time!"". Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.",1453122588,1453124169,False,16,0,0.589677035808563232,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Telle est la problématique qu'il vous faudra résoudre avant de jouer à ce jeu.

Tout ce que fait DP, il le fait à coté de la plaque. La liste de défauts de ce jeu est longue, trop longue... bien trop longue à énumerer ici.
La première heure pourra par exemple vous décourager de continuer. 

Mais ne vous y fiez pas: Deadly Premonition est un GRAND JEU, une oeuvre CULTE.

Car malgré les moyens dérisoires alloués et les déboires qu'il a subit pendant son développement, DP respire la passion, le dévouement et la générosité de bout en bout du créateur (SWERY) et son équipe envers leur oeuvre. 

Ce qui nous absorbe, malgré ses innombrables défauts, c'est avant tout son personnage principal: l'agent spécial Francis York Morgan, agent du FBI, limite schizophrène, débarque dans cette petite ville ""open-world"" perdue de Greenvale afin de résoudre une affaire sordide de meurtres perpetrés par le Raincoat Killer, personnage énigmatique dont il faudra découvrir l'identité.
Pour cela, vous serez épaulez par des personnages tous plus étranges les uns que les autres, vous partagerez leurs vies et leurs emplois du temps afin de résoudre cette enquête dans un univers qui n'est pas sans rappeler X-Files ou Twin Peaks de David Lynch dont il s'inspire grandement.

Mais DP a sa propre personnalité, son charme envoutant indescriptible, une des histoires les plus passionnantes et un des meilleurs twist de fin qu'il m'a été de suivre ces dernières années.

Par contre, il faudra consentir à tripatouiller les fichiers du jeu si vous voulez quelque chose de visuellement un peu plus ""potable"" (la résolution d'une part mais aussi ce filtre et cette colorimétrie dont les choix peuvent laisser perplexe) et éviter certains crashes. 
Mais pas de panique, rien d'insurmontable, le premier post du forum Steam répondra à toutes vos attentes.

En esperant qu'un jour, Deadly Premonition puissent jouir un jour d'un remake aux moyens suffisamment importants pour que sa plastique attire enfin le plus grand nombre dans cette univers qui vous retournera le cerveau.

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST: Deadly Premonition's structure and tone are FIFTY-FIFTY. This is two games in one! The first half plays out like a strangely ambitious and in-depth open-world exploration game with personality ridden side quests TO lull the player in. Before it unleashes the linear, sometimes questionable sometimes crazy second half. You will feel INTENSE whiplash and maybe disappointment depending on who you are by hoping for a natural progression of the story. (I have.) This is why I urge you to split it in two to appreciate each halves strengths to the fullest. There are things to love in both halves, that I wouldn't have placed in the same game were it my decision.

It doesn't matter who you are, the tonal whiplash is there for all to behold.
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Full transparency and boldness ahead. 

This is my favorite SWERY game. It is the pure definition of lightning caught in a bottle. Nothing will ever replicate the mishmash of unintentionally confusing/bizarre pseudo survival horror mystery that is this game. It's a parody to so many things with so many questions raised, which we may never get concrete answers to. 

To my knowledge Twin Peaks comparisons are surface level observations at best and a disservice at worst, as this is tonally 95% it's own thing. Even within just the first half alone. I watched Twin Peaks and I did not feel the atmospheres present in this. This just has to be experienced first hand to be properly understood. And you should probably purchase a console version because this port, fought me. Oh it fought me and did not want me to beat it. That this struggle lasted multiple years! Yes! Across multiple pcs and configurations and patches. This was hell. (But when it worked as intended...it was brilliant.) 

I also do not understand the ""jank"" comments people kept making. Maybe I am bias... since I trudge through the indie scene, but it honestly controlled fair and it was never not responsive. Every issue I could think of can be blamed on the porting process itself and not the design decisions made by the dev team. The gameplay choices that were made however contributed to it's quirky factor. Never detracting, always appetizing. 

I rather not make descriptions beyond this, because I want to keep this thing I wrote up people call a ""review"" minimal on spoilers. And to act as purposefully vague imagination fuel while at it.

О, да! Еще как! Её сюжет, колоритные персонажи, музыка, общий характер- идеально вписываются в цену со скидкой.

Все хотелось получить очередную дозу этого интригующего наркотика. Но вернемся к чертовой главе под номером 9. Я сталкивался со многими багами/вылетами в играх, искал решение, пробовал все, что мог. Эта игра просто поразила моё воображение...Ничего не выходит! Ни одно руководство мне не помогло. Ох, как же было обидно! И на таком-то месте! Смотреть прохождения на Ютубе, Зак?

- Вылеты. Думаете, что вас это не коснется? Увы, Зак.
- Абсурдность. Мы тут в детектив-стори играем или где? Почему авторам так доставляет эта странная логика событий? Убийство? Грустная музыка. Вышли из здания с трупом? Веселая музыка! Может нам стоит посетить бар? К черту подозреваемых/улики! Нужно расслабиться! Ах,да! Как насчет рыбалки, Зак? Погодка-то отличная!
- Моменты в игре, где нужно ехать туда-то за ... ярдов. Пару раз можно и прокатиться, благо виды порой красивые попадаются, но на каждой миссии?!
- Лично меня терзает вот какая вещь-сюжет очень интересный, но мистика...местами(особенно в финале)просто не в тему. Зачем все это? Разве не перебор?

To summarize Deadly Premonition, the graphics suck balls. The driving sucks balls. The combat sucks balls. The animations suck balls. In fact the entire control scheme sucks monkey balls. But underneath all this ball sucking lies an absolute gem of a game. 

The plot is great and the script is actually extremely well-written. I dare say these two factors were probably the only driving force behind my decision to see this game to the end. A higher budget and better production values might've done wonders with the game.

This game is one huge package of silliness. A lot of the time it will make you laugh but mostly you will be laughing at the game itself. Deadly Premonition is a game where you see your fortune in the morning cup of coffee. And there's an hour-long level where you're running after a dog. Did I mention that dog had its own rap theme song? 

And just when you think this game couldn't get any stranger, the final two chapters take retardedness to a whole new level. Lovely!

Ahogy mondjuk egy Bud Spencer film sem az. Mégis imádható. Talán sántít a hasonlat, mert bár a játék történetvezetése és a játékelemek helyenként primitív, a koncepció mégis okos. Vagy inkább úgy mondanám törődik avval hogy a játékos jól érezze magát. A játék szeretete a játékon keresztül átsugárzik. Akármilyen hülyén is hangzik. 

Ez a lehetetlen műfaj, a sandbox horror ezzel a szórakoztató bénaság csavarral élvezetessé válik. Ugye volt ilyenből az Alan Wake, komolyan tisztességesen végigcsinált AAA game. Egynek jó, de mégsem sandbox. Aztán az Alone in the Dark 4 vagy 5 már nemtom, az amelyikben rádől New York a taxidra. Az élvezhető volt, nagy térképekkel de az is olyan fejezeteszerű. Na de ebben tényleg oda mész ahova akarsz. Olyan mint egy indie gta klón, ha épp nem horrorpályákon mész keresztül. Mindkét része a játéknak béndzsa, és egy ideig el lehet röhögcsélni rajta, de a kettő együtt tök hangulatos. Amire vágysz egy túlélőhorrorban, hogy legyen már egy hely, ahol meg lehet pihenni, illetve ugyanez a aprajafalvával, hogy egy kicsit már izgulnál, ez a két rész faszán kiegészíti egymást. 
Ugyanúgy röhögtem a jrpg-kből megszokott korlátolt gesztuskészlettel megspékelt béna japó párbeszédeken, és tökjó felüdülés volt időnként egy inteligensen odarakott poént vagy utalást, vagy valami mélylélektani motívumot felfedezni. Arról pl. kéne csinálni egy youtubvideót, ahogy a nyomozó a képzelt barátjának nyolcvanas évekbeli amcsi filmekről beszél. Mert hogy nincs, pedig adja magát. Ezt pl. imádtam.

Я сразу же заинтересовался игрой, но в поиске русификатора так и не добился успехов. Вступил в группу в контике и стал ждать, но не дождался... И спустя очень много времени [i](много тысяч жизней комаров)[/i], я, все-таки, наткнулся на русификатор и теперь можно было приступать к прохождению. И что же? Наткнулся на пост, что с игрой очень много проблем - вылеты, зависания, ужасный порт одним словом. Я-то думал, что хуже 𝐑𝐄4 не может быть, пока не столкнулся с 𝐃𝐏... Что ж, с вылетами и багами я кое-как справился - решением становится частое сохранение [i](или пропуск кат-сцен, как говорят)[/i]. И конечно же, игру так и не удалось пройти до самого финала. Точнее я прошел, около 1,5 часа намучился с последним сражением, а когда победил - игра зависла на заставке.. Так что пришлось досматривать игру на ютюбе... 

А теперь разберемся, почему кривой порт не останавливает людей. 
Загадочный агент ФБР Френсис Морган Йорк, был направлен в небольшой типичный городок в штатах, где произошло необыкновенно странное и зверское убийство одной персоны. Но наш парень не такой уж и простой персонаж. Дело в том, что у него есть голос в голове, некий Зак, с которым он постоянно ведет беседы, советуется и тот для него является единственным другом. Он не стесняется его, а другие, вроде бы и не против. 

Будет ли это единственным убийством? Так уж ли просты мирные горожане этого загадочного городка и тронет ли вас сюжет, что вы будете закрывать глаза на криворукость порта. Это вам и стоит выяснить в ходе прохождения. Я лишь скажу следующее - в игре очень большое количество диалогов, возможность выбирать [i](хоть это и не влияет на сюжет)[/i], необычное видение этого загадочного мира глазами безумных японцев и конечно же - очень и очень хороший сюжет! Да, местами бывает происходят весьма глупые вещи, иногда ты сам решаешь загадку быстрее, чем сам Йорк, но от этого игра хуже не становится. Плюсы перебивают ужасные, беспощадные минусы. 

И еще хочу сказать немного о наболевшем. Это, конечно же, управление... Очень и очень тяжко стрелять, это касается последней сцены [i](точнее двух)[/i], где, чтобы нацелиться, нужно выпить гору успокоительного, ибо будет ЖАРКО... Так что, если вы играете на клаве и мышке, мой вам совет - крепитесь! Насчет геймпада знаю лишь одно - все настройки на него кривые, нужно выставлять все вручную. Но не думаю, что на нем будет легче, ибо косяк в самом управлении - пистолет до неба и до пола ни поднять ни опустить, прежде чем нацелиться - нужно нажать на пробел, зажать пкм, после чего курсор не двигается, затем отпустить пкм и лкм уже управлять вправо-влево, что тоже очень тяжело.... 

Если вы смотрели ролики или если даже не смотрели, то могу сказать, что игра - это смесь разных игр. Во многих обзорах я видел сравнение игры с 𝐆𝐓𝐀 [i](открытый мир, карта, светящиеся предметы)[/i], 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐬 [i](бриться, кушать, спать, переодеваться)[/i], 𝐒𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐥𝐥 [i](атмосфера)[/i] и тд, но, как ни крути - игра получилась хорошей. Мне, даже, напоминала часто 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐅𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐲 некоторыми местами, особенно - саундтреками.

Игра СЛИШКОМ затянута. Видно, что ее создатели специально все сцены очень сильно затягивали, чтобы сдель игру как можно длиннее, однако из-за этого она получилась очень нудной. 

Эту игру нужно было делать интерактивным кино, т.к. элементы шутера здесь не уместны и сделаны очень криво.

Рекомендую ее только потому, что она очень необычная и подобных игр практически больше нет.

　さらに、サイドミッションや収集アイテムなどのやりこみ要素が多いため長く楽しめます。そして釣りなどの様々なアクティビティーがあり、メインストーリーの合間に暇な時間も多く作れるため、その気になれば本当にアメリカの田舎町を旅している気分になれます。

　しかし、システム面では、マウスでも相変わらず狙いづらい照準操作や、行動の時々に挿入されるムービーによるテンポの冗長さ、さらにはタバコや睡眠で時間をスキップしたときなどに睡眠ゲージや空腹ゲージをわざわざポーズメニュー画面を開いて確認しなければならないことなど、不満点もありますが、これらはこのゲームの味として許せてしまいます。きちんと救済措置として雑魚敵の動きが遅かったり、食料や武器などのアイテム無限湧きスポットが随所にあったりしますし。
　しかしどうしても容認しがたい不満点は、車に関する仕様と、ゲームが応答しなくなり進められなくなる致命的なバグの存在です。

　まず車の仕様に関して言います。広い自然が広がる田舎町グリーンヴェイルでは、車は重要な移動手段となります。しかし、このゲームの主人公はあくまで法を守るＦＢＩ捜査官。ＧＴＡのように一般人の車に乗ることはできず、初期状態で乗れる車はパトカーに限られてきます。しかし、道端や駐車場に車を停めておいて(反対車線の路上に停めるときちんと右側車線の路肩にワープするというご丁寧な仕様付き！)、そのあと何らかの施設に入ってからマップに出直すと、ローディングの仕様なのか道端に停めてあったパトカーが消えてしまっているのです！
　町中にもっとパトカーを置いてくれればいいのですが、滅多にパトカーが置かれていないため、自然と４個までしか持てない消耗品であるフレアを使わざるを得ないハメになります。このため、自由行動をしたいならポリーのホテルでフレアを大量に買い込んでおくのが吉です。
　ただし、救済措置として、とあるサイドミッションをクリアするとこれまで訪れた施設に一発でワープできるアイテムが手に入るようにはなっています。しかし、その他細かい場所に移動するにはやっぱり車は必要不可欠なので、停めておいた車が消えてしまうというのは、致命的な欠陥と言わざるを得ません。

　そして、バグに関して言います。僕は今Windows8.1の64bitOSを使っているのですが、エピソード１だけで２回、ゲームが応答しなくなり進行不可能になるバグに直面しました。一回目はチャプター３の病院の常世のエントランスから抜け出すシーンです。ここでは、敵を倒し切った後にアイテムを拾わないことで、偶然にもバグが回避されました。
　そして、今はチャプター６で集会所に入るムービーでのバグに悩まされています。ディレクターズカット完全版を銘打っておいてこれは・・・さらに言い忘れましたが、Steam版には日本語字幕がなく、インターネットで検索しても日本語化Modが見つからないので、英語ができない人はまったく楽しめない状況になっています。とにかく、これらの不満点がなければ、非常に評価できるゲームだと言えるでしょう。ですが長々としたゲームが嫌いといった、気の短い人にはおすすめできません。",1451744451,1488050526,True,4,0,0.498307079076766968,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The PC port of the game is terrible, and I am glad I got to experience it on a console. It was only recently I decided to revisit the game on PC, and the amount of times it just crashes for no reason at all is just silly.

If you are a person that require decent graphics (you know, the visuals), then this game is not for you. In fact, the graphics are so poor for its time in this game that it looks more like it was released during the PS2 era, when it was in fact released during the PS3 era (I am using the PlayStation as a reference because it was on a PS3 I played this game the first time). They aren't particularly good, but if you can overlook this, then you're in for the next challenge.

The controls. Geezus. Who sat down with the driving part of this game and thought ""Yeah, yeah this is perfectly acceptable.""? Regardless of what platform you are playing this game on, the driving itself is way to challenging for its own good. Sure, it makes you laugh a bit the first time your car is suddenly on two wheels and spinning out of the road and into a ditch, or a house, or another car. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentyeth? Not so funny anymore.
And the combat. Ugh. It can't require that much more polishing to actually get the combat controls improved, can it? Because the most challenging part about combat are the controls, rather than the enemies. And that's not the reason you want your game to be a challenge.

But, this aside, I still enjoy this game, and I still recommend this game. Why? Because of the story and the atmosphere. It is so rare to see a game where each and every character you meet feels well thought out and unique. Where the story of the game may not be super original, yet still manages to suck you in and surprise you with its many plot twists. It was my second playthrough recently (though it had been a few years), and I was still surprised by a few of the plot twists. And that's something special. This game is special. And if you like a good story, then this is something you cannot afford to miss.

虽然是我见过的氛围最诡异，内容最奇葩的游戏。但我玩的时候却不知不觉被吸引玩到忘了吃饭。

游戏是第三人称解密，与场景互动解开剧情，附带物品收集。战斗类似生化2，站立后开启瞄准，很多鬼怪必须爆头才能杀死，但手枪子弹无限，战斗因此弱化，但更适合剧情党的体验了，不用被卡关。   地图系统类似寂静岭2，小镇建筑名字，商店名字都标注在小地图上。探索较为自由，可驱车前往小镇各处展开调查，但主线还是要乖乖到达指定地点。
游戏画面过时，帧数却不高，但还不至于让我无法畅玩，人物动作略僵硬，使剧情代入感不足。
整体氛围营造出色，最诡异的就是这气氛，配上神秘诡异的bgm，有种酒吧嗑了药后似幻非幻的感觉。会有相当一部分玩家会不喜欢这气氛。
想玩联机和大作的玩家不用我劝，自己就会把这游戏排除在外。因此，我给好评对于大部分人可能也无所谓了。",1451708672,1451708672,True,57,4,0.819037199020385742,7,True,False,False,False,,,

It is hard to compare this game to any other title... it has some sort of open world, a bit of RPG, a whole lot of an adventure....

But if you aren't afraid of that, you'll find yourself in a great adventure-thriller-detective-horror.... thingy.... o.O

The combat is TERRIBLE and I was not suprised at all to find out it was tacked on at the last minute to try and appeal to ""western gamers"" at the publishers request.

To top it all the optimization is exceptionally poor and will likely require you to download some quickfixes via mods (check forums) to run.

Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.

Here are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game
-download a fan made patch to ""fix"" things
-Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes
-switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes
-lower the resolution to get past crashes
-download save files that are past crash points
-dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes
-turn off steam overlay to stop crashes
-ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points

I couldn't even finish the game.  I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.

I tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.

It sucks because the actual game itself is great & unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.

Lo hace con muy poco talento y el resultado final es un pastiche grotesco sin ningún sentido y que se hace muy pesado.

Lo que queda es aún peor: las escenas de acción, en las que te trasladas a un versión oscura del mundo poblada de zombis, son torpes y repetitivas hasta decir basta. Además de esto, la versión para PC está plagada de problemas que en algunos casos no te dejan jugar, algunos los solucionarás activando el modo de compatibilidad con algún Windows antiguo, otros tendrás que buscar en los foros de Steam hasta hallar alguna solución.

It's polarizing because everything from the voice acting, to the mechanics, to the graphics are mediocre, if not downright terrible, YET, the absolutely addicting story and the kooky, surrealist overtones make this game well worth the money (pro tip: play this game with a controller or not at all; it was never meant to be a PC game).  I don't care how pretentious it sounds, most people just don't understand this game.  It's meant to be a joke on itself in a sense because of how silly and cartoony everything seems to be, but don't let that fool you.  This game has a story of unparalleled depth in terms of video games, 

If you like surrealist art, if you enjoy the Monty Python films and the Flying Circus; if you like getting wasted and listening to The Bends while watching every Wallace and Grommit movie ever made with the volume off so the claymation sheep sound like Thom Yorke, I promise you will love this game more than most members of your family.  

The reason it was never commercially successful was because it is meant for a certain kind of player who's in a certain kind of mood for 8-12 hours every so often.  This game can be fun multiple times through because the combat, while admittedly pretty clumsy mixes things up enough to keep you on your toes, and the various things you can buy and the mini-games make sure the experience doesn't become too heavy.  

To sum things up, don't buy this game if you're looking for a typical shooter or a typical survival horror game, or a typical anything.  This game is truly one of a kind, and if you can learn to appreciate is flaws, you will understand where I'm coming from.  I've never played a game this truly original in my whole 15-odd years as a gamer.  If it weren't for the original KOTOR, this would be my favorite game ever.  10/10.

Пока [strike]мучался[/strike]...проходил, пытаясь насладиться сюжетом, вспомнилось много хороших игр, от которых по чуть-чуть понадергали разрабы.
Это и старенькая Clock Tower, RE, Silent Hill, даже немного Parasite Eve. Это серьезные, интересные игры которые проходились на одном дыхании и порой по нескольку раз.
В DP смешение жанров и откровенная японщина в поведении персонажей превратили , в принципе, неплохо начинавшуюся игру в цирк уродов, с кривляниями, идиотскими боссами
с одного вида которых можно неплохо поржать

а потом уже приводит вас на место, теперь вы имеете представление о времени в DP.

When Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls.  Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.

For everything this game seems to get passable or ""middling"", there's something that makes you smile.  Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it.  You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.

Fans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players.  I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks.  There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series.  The protagonist loves his coffee.  The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.

Sua esquisitice só pode ser assemelhada à da série na qual foi inspirado, e isso é tanto o maior ponto positivo quanto o maior ponto negativo do jogo.
A história, pra quem já viu Twin Peaks, vai soar bastante familiar. Um agente do FBI vai até uma pequena cidade do interior investigar a morte de uma jovem, que pode estar ligada à morte de outras jovens pelo país. O agente é esquisito, não parece proceder como um agente ""normal"" faria, acredita fácil demais em teorias e dicas sobrenaturais, e conversa o tempo todo com uma pessoa no rádio que pode ou não ser imaginária.
Mas é nos detalhes de como essa premissa é abordada que Deadly Premonition de distoa de Twin Peaks. O jogo é muito mais sombrio e violento que a série, e isso se mostra bastante óbvio pelas mortes de personagens que vão acontecendo ao longo do jogo. Não darei spoilers, mas garanto que o nível de bizarrice e de violência aumenta proporcionalmente com o andar da história. Ao mesmo tempo, os personagens e os diálogos são tão ridículos que, em 80% das cutscenes, você estará rindo sozinho de coisas que podem ou não ser cômicas propositalmente. O que só faz dos outros 20% ainda mais medonhos, por distoarem tanto do clima bobo que perpetua no resto do jogo.
No quesito gameplay, o jogo é... Não, não tem como amaciar essa. É ruim, pura e simplesmente ruim. Você tem uma cidade enorme para explorar, combinada com um dos piores controles de direção que eu já vi, se não o pior. Dirigir é simplesmente a tarefa mais tediosa e insatisfatória do jogo, e olha que ele exige que você dirija bastante. Não existe fast travel, não existe seta indicando o caminho, e boa sorte tentando verificar um mapa que não te permite dar zoom out o bastante pra ver você e seu objetivo na mesma tela. Se você decidir fazer as várias sidequests - única forma de conhecer melhor os vários personagens absurdos da cidade - vai precisar ter paciência. Não basta tudo isso acima, os carros também tem gasolina e podem estragar se você bater muito. Ah, e seu personagem não comete crimes, então você não pode ultrapassar o limite de velocidade. Seu personagem também sente fome e sono, e você precisa colecionar comida em um inventário limitado, e arranjar um lugar pra dormir quando estiver cansado. Se ficar muito tempo com a mesma roupa, você vai ficar sujo, feder, e moscas começarão a circular em sua volta. Não faça a barba todo dia, e ela vai crescer, coisa inaceitável para um agente do FBI. 
Ainda assim, a grande maioria dessas coisas é opcional. Se você só fizer a main quest, raramente vai jogar tempo o bastante entre um capítulo e outro pra precisar comer ou dormir (mas ainda precisa fazer a barba), e só vai precisar se preocupar com sua munição e que armas carregar. Nem itens de cura precisa se preocupar muito, pois somente lá pelos últimos capítulos a dificuldade do jogo vai ser boa o bastante pra te fazer perder vida.
O que me leva a outro tópico: combate. Pra um jogo bobo de investigação em uma cidade pequena, a ideia de combate parece ser difícil de encaixar, certo? É aí que entra o conceito mais bizarro do jogo. Seus inimigos são uma espécie de aparições zumbis de pessoas que parecem ter saído de uma vila do século XVIII, que variam entre o ficar parados esperando que você as mate, e se teleportar do outro lado do cenário para a sua frente para te dar um susto. Alguns carregam armas, mas a animação de ataque leva quase 10 segundos, tempo mais que o suficiente pra você atacar. As poucas vezes que fui pego por um dos inimigos sem armas, confesso que foram assustadoras, porque o ataque deles é perturbador. Mas foram duas ou três vezes. A questão é: onde esses inimigos se encaixam na história?
Em lugar nenhum.
É bastante explícito que os combates do jogo, tirando aqueles com bosses, se passam todos dentro da cabeça do personagem, e só estão lá pra acrescentar ação no jogo. Isso ao mesmo tempo é terrível e brilhante, e não faria sentido em nenhum outro jogo. Também não faz sentido nenhum nesse, mas acho que nesse caso isso é um ponto positivo.
O gráfico é, em quase todos os aspectos, atroz. A animação de expressão facial é cruelmente mais assustadora que todos os monstros juntos. O sorriso do personagem principal pode te dar pesadelos. Dá pra baixar o DPfix e mexer no arquivo .ini pra melhorar sombras e outros efeitos. Eu altamente recomendo, não só pela melhoria gráfica, mas também pelo próximo ponto.
O jogo é bugado. Não estou falando de bugs dentro do próprio jogo, não encontrei nenhum. Estou falando de crash e travamentos constantes. Meu save dentro do jogo tem 4 horas a menos do que a Steam diz que eu joguei, porque o restante foram horas perdidas pra crash to desktop. De longe, esse é o único verdadeiro defeito do jogo.
Pera, como assim?
Poisé. Porque é o único defeito que realmente incomoda. Todos os outros, e eu não estou sendo fanboy aqui, eu posso tranquilamente dizer que são ""charme"". Gráficos ruins? Combinam. Gameplay ruim? Combina. Diálogos sem sentido? Combinam. Praticamente todos os defeitos que fariam de qualquer jogo uma completa perda de tempo fazem deste uma experiência única. Eu amei odiar uma missão onde eu tinha que pescar minha próxima pista porque meu personagem viu isso numa xícara de café, e se eu conseguia ou não a pista dependia quase exclusivamente de sorte. A falha me levava a uns bons minutos tendo de rever a animação do detetive se sentindo desapontado e então tentando pescar novamente. E eu sentia raiva e vontade de rir ao mesmo tempo.
Resumindo: pra compensar seus defeitos mais lamentáveis, esse jogo me proporcionou momentos verdadeiramente épicos, e o que eu posso considerar um substituto virtual pro final de Twin Peaks. Isso por si só já é impagável.",1447974762,1447974762,True,61,4,0.873196959495544434,3,True,False,False,False,,,

What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.

The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':

1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).

2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.

3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)

4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.

So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.

Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.

This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.",1447757285,1447757572,False,13,0,0.495431900024414063,1,True,False,False,False,,,

True state of the allegedly insufferably horrible port quality - it's definitely not good, but I don't think it's something overly serious or gamebreaking.

Si te dejas llevar por los gráficos, acabarás decepcionado puesto que dejan mucho que desear, tanto los modelos de los personajes y enemigos como del resto de elementos que nos encontramos a lo largo de la aventura . Cierto que es un juego de 2010, pero por aquella época el aspecto gráfico era igual de flojo que ahora, sólo que algunas texturas y modelos actuales son en HD. Aunque a pesar de todo esto, hay algunas zonas del pueblo realmente maravillosas.
La optimización a PC es casi inexistente. No hay opciones gráficas, está capado a 720p y hay crasheos durante toda la aventura, por lo que siempre es bueno guardar la partida siempre que se pueda. Sin embargo existen guías para optimizar el rendimiento, mejorar algunas texturas o la resolución de pantalla.

Sobre la jugabilidad decir que es otro de los puntos negativos del juego. Realmente es frustrante hasta que te acostumbras. Su sistema de apuntado es simple ya que nuestro personaje no sabe moverse y disparar al mismo tiempo. El control de York es tosco y la conducción de vehículos roza lo absurdo.

En cuanto al sonido tengo sentimientos encontrados. Por un lado el sonido de los vehículos es horrible, los lamentos de los enemigos dan más risa que miedo y algunos efectos sonoros burdos y fuera del lugar donde nos encontramos. Aunque otros efectos naturales como la tormenta o el curso del río rozan a buen nivel. 
Por otro lado la B.S.O es maravillosa, destacar el tema principal ""The Woods and the Goddess"". Y aunque algunos temas se repiten, siguen bien el hilo de la historia con sus momentos de tensión o alegría.

Y llegamos a lo más destacable del juego. Su historia es la principal razón por la que recomiendo el juego. Simplemente derrocha genialidad por todos lados, con giros argumentales, diálogos tronchantes, otros más serios y que te atrapa de principio a fin. 
Destacar también el trabajo de los actores de doblaje, que hacen una labor espectacular, sobre todo con Francis York Morgan, quizás uno de los mejores ""personajes principales"" que te puedes encontrar.
Mención especial a las referencias sobre Twin Peaks, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc y los guiños sobre cine y cultura pop que comparte con su ""compañero"" cuándo viaja en coche, realmente geniales.

La duración de la historia principal es más que aceptable, añadiendo la cantidad de misiones secundarias, cromos, trajes, coches, minijuegos, armas..

I will get this out of the way first - this game is a horrible PC port. It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The director’s cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)

It's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.

You play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.

It is full of weird, cliché (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.

The game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular [i]problem[/i] with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.

It is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.

I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.

It's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the ""feel"" of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.

What's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world ""detective"" game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...

Deadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it. Why? Because it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" kind of games.

It has its moments of absolute brilliance for instance the opening sequence will astound you in how well it is put together.  The dialogue is incredibly silly but it adds to the overall experience. Imagine every silly and funny line in every video game ever and condense it down into one pot, That's what deadly premonition is. It will leave you thinking 'was this all a joke or were they serious when they made this?' If it was a joke they are geniuses, if they are serious they are geniuses.

Auf der anderen Seite empfindet man fast überall die Liebe der Entwickler zu Filmen, TV Serien (wie die für das Spiel prägende Serie ""Twin Peaks"") und Games. Auch die Story strotz nur so von Kuriosem ala Twin Peaks.

What an utter waste of time. After having dealt with constant crashes, stuttering, framerate issues, restarting my computer, etc, I'm finally done. This game wasn't worth the dollar I paid for it. And it seems EVERYONE is having the same problems. How they can call this game released as a ""director's cut"" where they fix things, but its actually more unplayable than the original. Also, its been out over 2 years and nothing has been done to fix it by the devs. There are workarounds but I shouldn't have to start installing and deleting files on my brand new high end comp to run this turd. And what all for? The animations are stiff and terrible, graphics suck, the pace is super slow, the characters are weird and unrealistic, the story is mildly interesting but 2/3 of it doesn't make sense. The combat, controls, and UI are terrible. Limited controller support. Map sucks. Long boring forced driving sections with terrible controls. Positives are waiting the 20 hours for the story to finally finish, which who cares. Avoid it and thank me later.",1445575384,1445575384,False,0,0,0.44819563627243042,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.

These Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously  flawed in the PC market.

Even the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize.
The old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.

Most of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market.

First of all: Yes... yes I know the graphics may not be so gentle to the eye sometimes and yes it might be a little glitchy here and there, but to be honest, I dont really pay much attention to that.
I would describe DP as a rare species. Why you ask?

Graphic:
Eventhough the graphic may not be so 21st century and wont kill any big product such as action movie-game 
Resident Evil 6 (which is very bad in its own way), it just wont take that long to get used to it. You only really see that problem during forest scenes when the grass textures are flickering a little. But despite that, come on guys, is graphic really that great? Look at Call of Duty. Great HD graphic, but always the same crap in it. Shoot shoot shoot.

Glitches:
To be honest, the only real glitches I have noticed were spinning cars or my tie running through my body lol. 
The tie get unstuck fast thought and it only happened once. That thing with the car, well, it does weird things sometimes, for example spinning around itself for a splitt second and... yeah. Hehe but these gliches are not game breaking or frustrating, in fact they are really funny to watch and add up to the games humor a little, even if unintentionally. Sometimes they can even work for you.

Gameplay:
Having the two issues out of the way, we only have the major reasons to buy the game left. The gameplay is easy to understand and a ot of fun. Like in Resident Evil 4, you play York in a third person (over-the-shoulder) perspective, when aiming with the weapon you have you have to aim yourself or use the auto aim. Killing ghosties in this game is super fun due to the awesome atmosphere, the creepy enemies, the huge variety of weapons and the amzingly high amount of side quests like investigating old abandoned haunted places. Good thing is, I dont even spoil you things becuase there is so much to do and see in this game that I only scratched the surface. So to sum it all up:

-Easy handling (except for the cars)
-Very atmospheric
-Big town to explore freely
-A lot of side quests
-Very fun battle system
-A lot of very funny and extremly awesome weapons
-A lot of stuff to unlock
-Very well made creepy creatures

Sound:
The music in this game is amazing! Yes it maybe repeat itself a little to often, but hey, its always very fitting and it never gets old hearing these tunes. Especially during action sequences it can really bring you onto your toes, and while exploring something creepy or eary it will please you with a very ambient and... more eary track. To be honest here, it doesnt happen that often that music really melts into the game, at least not in my opinion.

Story:
And now we got to the cherry on top of this very strange cake that is Deadly Premonition.
If you are like me and graphic isnt everything, then you came to the right place. Remember when I said this game is a rare species? Well it surely is. I never saw a game that is a mixture of many things. 
Resident Evil 4, Silent Hill and even a little bit of GTA is in there. Its funny and cheesy, its creepy and serious.
You have to eat and sleep to survive, you earn money, you can do this and that and wow...
But... NOTHING can be compared to the story. This real, at the beginning seemingly slowly starting story, will turn into a big and complicated, and at the end really mindblowing masterpiece! The combination with the music, the way the story tells itself, the whole atmoshpere the world builds around the character Francise York Morgan, the dark and creepy environments and an ending that stays stuck in your throat even days after. Not in a bad but more in a bittersweet way. Heck even if I would try to explain the ending here I couldnt even do it justice, neither would you understand it.
Long story short, the story is one of a kind and frankly said, I never ever witnessed a story like this before... just amazing!

So yeah, if you love very good stories and gameplay such as the good old Silent Hill or Resident Evil games,
you are not so interested in graphics and you dont mind the slightly cheesy dialogues sometimes, you should really give it a try. If the price is too high for you wait for the next sale but, still, people dont really give the game as much credit as it deserves. Out of all the games out there these days, this one is a hidden gem and should at least be played once.
I promise you wont regret it. I already played it on the XBox 360 two years ago and downloaded it again as directors cut a few days ago, and it still give me the chills when I hear the story. It also extended story wise, which makes it even more awesome! 

Sometimes great things come in little packages, keep that in mind.
Deadly Premonition will forever be one of my all time favourites.

- Второстепенные задания примечательны...ничем.Да,они расскрывают характеры персонажей,но сделаны в стиле пойди-принеси.Да и награда по большей степени бесполезна.
- Музыка.Оказалось,что в игре 25 композиций,хотя мы постоянно слышим 3-4.А игра не маленькая.И очень уж часто музыка невпопад звучит.

It will definitely stay within my top 5 games for a long, long time. I plan to at least do a second and third playthrough, if not more.

Before buying, there are 2 things that you must know:
 1. This is the very definition of a cult classic. If you find yourself only enjoying huge budget AAA games and never really straying into anything else, then perhaps this is not the game for you. This game must be played with an open mind, as it is very unique. Also, it is worth mentioning that the game really doesn't pick up until an hour or so into it. 

2. The PC port is not very good. I would only recommend buying it if you have intermediate computer skills, as you are going to have to edit a few files as well as apply a user-made patch, DPfix. 

The story: Simply put, it's amazing. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate the murder of a local teenager. The story quickly picks up from here and sucks you in. I wish that I could be less vague about the story, but I risk ruining the game's 20+ hour run. This is the kind of story that keeps you wanting to play the game to see what happens next. It takes many sharp turns and streches across several different genres, including, but by far not limited to: horror, mystery, survival, comedy, and even some romance. I consider myself to be good at predicting storylines in games and movies, but even I could not predict hardly any of this game. It truly kept me interested until the very end. Speaking of the end, you may just shed a tear. 

Characters: The characters in this game are incredibly varied and all have distinct personalities. I will certainly not ever forget any of them. The voice acting is great and really helps to bring the characters to life. 

Gameplay: The driving is pretty awful but far from the worst I've ever played. The pause menu map only shows your immediate surroundings and cannot zoom out, rendering it useless. You'll have to pay close attention and learn the town if you want to get around. While this map issue was mildly annoying, it made the game a little more challenging. The rest of the gameplay is good, but nothing new or super polished. I would recommend using a controller, as the keyboard and mouse control for this game just feels clunky. The game is open world and each character has a routine that they do. This is important to remember, as they may not always be home for you to ask questions. There are some points in the game in which you must wait a certain amount of in-game time before moving on to the next portion of the story. This gives you time to explore all that there is to do in Greenvale, including a ton of side missions and collectible items.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is great, and very memorable. I love the acoustic guitar song that plays at the main menu and at various points in the game. Each track suits the level that it was designed for, and nothing seems out of place. The only complaint I have is that the music volume levels occasionally overpower dialogue in cutscenes. 

Other thoughts: The game crashed to the desktop about a dozen times during my playthrough. The crashes all occured at set points in the game's story, so they are not random. There are some suggestions to remedy this with a quick search online though. I had luck passing these crashes by setting the game's launcher and .exe to Windows 98/ME mode and running as administrator. I am using an AMD gpu with the latest drivers (15.7.1 at time of writing) and Windows 7 64 bit. 

Bottom line: If you don't mind the possibility of some technical issues and you are a fan of survival-horror/mystery games, by all means, buy this game.",1444539576,1444706735,True,6,0,0.570788204669952393,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Rare are the instances when a game comes along that is so horrible, yet so intriguing that you simply can not help but love it.

First, a word of warning. This port is, to be frank, atrocious. I experienced a dozen crashes or more, three during the end credits alone. Furthermore, you need to use fixes to change the in-game resolution. The graphics lie somewhere between badly aged and horrible. And finally, the game mechanics are often stiff, walking on the border between being boring or laughable. Using a gamepad is recommended.

But with that said, what is offered if you fight past these issues is in my opinion nothing short of amazing. A quirky, twin peaks-esque world full of strange characters, weird happenings and charming dialogue, and a story that more often than not is wonderfully over the top.

This is not a game you should play for the gameplay or the visuals - its all about the experience of visiting the small town of Greenvale and its residents. 

Seeing this story through is nothing I regret
Despite it being in perhaps the worst port yet
To Greenvale I think you should travel
So that this mystery, you can attempt to unravel

Ты меня слышишь Зак?

Одна из неоднозначных игр, но только из за странного порта.
Нет, эта игра раздражала меня своими постоянными вылетами, которые правда тем или иным образам лечатся. 
Всё остальное вполне терпимо, а на графин всё равно, тем более что он фиксится программой  dpfix.
Но эти вылеты...
Такое ощущение что у игры...Кхм...Раздвоение личности.
Одна личность даёт игре стабильность...
Другая награждает вылетами.
Причём появление этих вылетов совершенно непредсказумо...Для этого даже есть отдельный гайд.
В принципе и на этом закончим.
За портирование игры 4 из 10.

Стоп, стоп, стоп!Зак, ты меня слышишь?Ты что-то недоговариваешь.
Ладно.Приврал я.На этом не всё.
Эта игра...Чёрт возьми она великолепна...Её основной сюжет, атмосфера, проработанность,уникальность и интересность персонажей, а также весьма классные доп миссии сделаны просто...Превосходно?Да, просто отлично.
Игра радует тем что по сути её прохождение не несёт за собой рутину.Каждая миссия в сюжете УНИКАЛЬНА. Тут не найдёшь одно и то же под разными соусами.Поэтому проходить сюжетную ветку вообще не надоедает. Дизаин как городка, так и потусторонних миров просто вытягивают игру..И повторюсь про сюжет, уж он будет держать в заинтересованности от начала до самого конца. (Интрига, Зак, интрига) Но для тех страдает манией исследователя разбросано множество карточек и доп миссий.
Ну да ладно. Доволен, Зак?

Tecnicamente, il titolo pecca da tutte le parti: i comandi sono terrificanti, level design per niente curato, innumerevoli bug e glich (grafici e sonori), animazioni brutte e un sistema di guida penoso...
Per non parlare delle musiche, sono poche e, spesso, sono fuori contesto.
Questo, gioco è, a mio parere, troppo dispersivo: prima di iniziare una missione saremo costretti ad aspettare tanto, TANTO, tempo, il che non sarebbe un problema se dormiamo in uno dei più punti in cui possiamo riposare, la rogna è che la mappa non è piccola (è ingigantita dal fatto di essere, per la maggio parte, VUOTA, oltre ai pochi quartieri che, comunque, sembrano inabitati, oltre a qualche automobile, non c'è anima viva) e i letti sono lontani tra loro, quindi inizia il nostro interminabile viaggio in auto molto frustrante.

Onestamente non so se collocare questo gioco nella categoria investigativa o horror, mettiamo le cose in chiaro: sono una persona che si impressiona facilmente, ma qusto gioco non è riuscito a trasmettermi ansia o paranoia.
I nemici di questo gioco, probabilmente ispirati da Silent-Hill, sono davvero troppo facili da uccidere, in 6 ore di gioco non sono mai, MAI, stato toccato da uno di quei cosi; le armi, tranne la pistola, sono inutili perché grazie a quest'ultima saremo in grado di cavarcela alla grande, tanto le munizioni sono anche illimitate...
Evidenti le ispirazioni a Resident Evil come la cassa degli oggetti presente nei primi 3 capitoli di quest'ultima saga oppure i movimenti del protagonista.

About the game itself I must say that I played very nicely. The game takes on the character of the young FBI agent who comes to a small town in America to explain the mysterious murders. The game offers us an open world but it is boring and the tour it is very tiring. The advantage may be some side missions. Some of them are interesting and usually after finish it we get cards or quite useful stuff, weapons, suits or new cars. Soundtrack is good but sometimes goes weird music and i mean (using a Emilys car). The game has a very interesting but sometimes strange characters but for me another big advantage.

	El juego está repleto de errores  -incluyendo uno que puede imposibilitar completar el juego-, los cuadros por segundo son inestables, pasan de 57 a 43 a 18 luego a 60, la jugabilidad es extraña, especialmente la conducción de los autos, los cuales a veces, en altas velocidades saltan y pueden hasta atravesar los objetos, y si no se le tienen parches, tiende a caerse cuando le place al juego, los efectos de sonido a veces se sienten de mala calidad.

	Dicho todo esto, Deadly Premonition es un grandioso juego  si puedes dejar pasar, o arreglar, todo lo anterior, la historia es basada en Twin Peaks, tiene muchas semejanzas con la serie misma, es interesante y con buena concordancia. Quitando todo lo feo que tiene, que se puede volver algo pasable a medida que uno juega, el juego es adictivo, los personajes son memorables, la ciudad tiene vida propia, los habitantes tienen una rutina para cada momento del día, y varios pequeños detalles que son simplemente geniales. Lo recomiendo mucho, pero más por la historia, que por la jugabilidad.

When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems. 

It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.

Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.

- Bugs and crashes galore, be prepared to deal with issues, more so if you're going to use Durante's Dp Fix mod (which is essential).  A great place to start is the pinned ""Techinical Support Topic"" in the forums if you decide to start playing this game (which is worth it, despite how this critique starts).  This is an issue that I wouldn't blame people for being really upset about but if you have the patience it'll work out fine.  

- No in-game graphic settings, no AA, no resolution settings (defaults to 1280x720)... zip, nadda, nothing.  Unless you use the afore mentionned Dp fix where Durante the modder added the ability to tune various settings in the mods .ini file. 

- Graphics are hit or miss, some areas in the game will leave you scratching your head wondering if the textures were vomited into the game as oppossed to programed. 

Sort of in the middle:

- Some Controls/gameplay:  There is controller support (I use an Xbox 360 wired controller without issue, thankfully...), haven't tried the keyboard and mouse controls.  Control is serviceable, I can vouch that the default settings are actually better than the xbox 360 version of the game, you can react a little faster and aim better with this control scheme. 

- Driving! Oh my...  Picture driving a giant heavy brick with wheels that are smaller bricks.  It's almost hilarious, it's a universe where turning down the street can only be done in small calculated increments. Miss a turn in one the games side races and then marvel at the excrutiatingly slow reverse function complete with the back up sounds of a forklift and the engine power of a small lawn mower. 

Finally the pros!

- The story is fascinating, the characters are eccentric and a joy to interact with. The main character is absolutely fantastic!!  He's funny, smart and a bit smarmy, it's a lot of fun to watch him rattle the towns folk.  The voice acting is pretty good as far as I'm concerned and each character exudes uniqueness, personality or eccentricity.  There are some pretty laugh out loud moments too!  Also helps that I'm a Twin Peaks fan as the game makes no bones about taking direct influence from that material.  
 
- Albeit the graphics are a bit dated, there are areas that have really good art style: like the interiours; the diner looks really cool and each house you can enter has  distinct personality and depth. 

- It's an open world, you are given plenty of time between points in the main story line to explore the town.  Nice details peppered all over the place and collectables to grab.  Lots of side quests that aren't too taxing and also some that add some extra context to the main mystery at hand.   Every interactable character seems to have differenct routines, so you won't always find characters in the same place.  For example: you can observe from the windows on the outside of some homes that have characters in them, one time I observed Emily the police officer, it was about 10pm game time, wearing a blue dress (which I've never seen her wear) and casually enjoying her living room or the time I peeked in on the Ingrams around dinner time, the whole family was there.  The twins appeared to be interacting with themselves while watching tv.  Mrs. Ingram was making dinner in the kitchen and then Keith walked in through the front door (I was there because I decided to follow him from the milk barn, not creeping, observing!!!), he went to the fridge grabbed a beer and sat next to the twins (how's the peeping Tommy... how's the peeping). I thought it was kind of neat because there was effort to make the world feel like it was living around you.  

- Some really tense moments in the game, especially the moments where it turns into screen on screen, your characters perspective and the killers perspective.  Those parts are amazing!

I originally played and finished the game on the xbox 360 and now  i've been compelled to play it again, this time the  directors cut on the p.c.

Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut, juego del estudio japonés [b]Access Games,[/b] publicado en Abril de 2013 para PS3 en formato físico y para PC en formato digital pudiendo adquirirse mediante Steam y GOG.com, el montaje del director es una versión exclusiva de Europa y Estados Unidos e incluye mejoras a nivel gráfico y de jugabilidad así como nuevo contenido como escenarios adicionales y un final alternativo entre otros.

[b]Dato curioso:[/b] En japón el juego es conocido como ""Red Seeds Profile"".

[h1][b]HISTORIA[/b][/h1]
Fancis York Morgan, un agente especial del FBI es enviado a Greenvale, un pueblo ficticio del Estado de Washington, para investigar el asesinato de Anna Graham, antes de su llegada al pueblo York sufre un accidente de coche provocado por la aparición de un hombre con impermeable rojo en la carretera, viéndose obligado a dirigirse al pueblo a pie, momento en el cual descubrirá que algo extraño ocurre en este pueblo; a partir de aquí, empieza un largo periplo para averiguar la verdad que se esconde tras el asesinato de Anna Graham y la historia del pueblo,York contará con la inestimable ayuda del Sheriff George Woodman y los ayudantes Emily Wyatt y Thomas MacLaine, ¿será capaz York de descubrir la verdad con la ayuda de su alter ego Zach?

[h1][b]DESARROLLO[/b][/h1]
[b]Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut[/b] es una experiencia jugable sin igual gracias a la mezcla de géneros que alberga en su interior, principalmente es un juego de mundo abierto (sandbox) en el que los momentos de acción son desarrollados al estilo de los survival horror clásicos, todo ello con dosis de thriller de terror, manteniendo una narrativa excepcional que mantiene al jugador expectante ante el desarrollo de la historia, algo que a su vez se complementa con la interacción con los distintos habitantes del pueblo, cada uno con su personalidad bien definida y papel que desempeñar en la historia narrada.

A continuación profundizaré en su vertiente sandbox, como buen juego de mundo abierto, la libertad de movimiento e interacción es total pudiendo recorrer el mapeado que conforma el pueblo y sus alrededores al completo, ya sea a pie o en coche, hay gran variedad de coches que podremos manejar durante la aventura, cada uno con sus características, y aunque el control no es el mejor, la mejor forma de disfrutar de estos momentos es desde la vista en primera persona, tanto por el recorrido como por la conducción y por supuesto, habrá que estar pendientes de la cantidad de gasolina que nos queda en el depósito para no quedarnos tirados en medio de la nada.

Podremos interactuar con los distintos habitantes del pueblo, ya sea simplemente hablando con ellos para recavar información para el caso, cumplir una misión secundaria (50 en total) o abastecernos de objetos, nuevos coches y armas o simplemente comer y beber; aunque las misiones secundarias no son obligatorias y no influyen directamente en la historia principal, si desvelarán información y detalles sobre ciertos habitantes que complementan la historia principal, así como poder conseguir ciertas armas y objetos que nos serán de gran utilidad durante la aventura. 

La climatología es fundamental así como el horario, ya que depende de estos dos factores la rutina diaria de los habitantes del pueblo, por ejemplo para poder realizar algunas misiones secundarias será necesario acudir a un determinado lugar con una climatología y a una hora determinada, por otro lado, las distintas tiendas y el restaurante tienen un horario propio, lo que ayuda a transmitir el día a día de sus habitantes cuyas conversaciones y actos van cambiando según se desarrollan los acontecimientos de la historia principal.

York tendrá que vigilar su hambre y cansancio, lo que hará que el jugador se preocupe por visitar regularmente tiendas y el restaurante para abastecerse de comida y/o dormir para evitar que York caiga rendido, a su vez entra en juego el ritmo cardíaco de York, el cual va aumentando mientras que corre o usa el turbo del coche que conduce, si llega al límite deberá usar un estabilizador para devolver su ritmo cardíaco a la normalidad; el tener que estar pendiente del estado de salud, hambre y cansancio de York otorga al jugador mayor sensación de inmersión en la historia e interacción con el protagonista.

[h1][b]COMBATE[/b][/h1]
A continuación profundizaré en la vertiente de acción/survival horror del juego, en los momentos de acción, en los que seremos trasladados al ""Otro Mundo"", nos enfrentaremos con seres conocidos como las sombras que son personas muertas controladas por ""..."", no pueden ver a los humanos pero si escuchar su respiración, hay dos tipos de estas, desarmadas, que nos atacarán directamente intentando cogernos o armadas con armas de combate cuerpo a cuerpo o de fuego así como su variante más peligrosa y letal que surge de los conductos de ventilación y se desplaza por el techo y paredes; si nos encontramos de 00:00 a 06:00 en las calles/alrededores del pueblo, el ""Otro Mundo"" hará presencia y las sombras, bandadas de pájaros y perros salvajes gigantes camparán a sus anchas.

En ciertas ocasiones tendremos que hacer frente al ""asesino del impermeable"", ya sea evitándole al pulsar un botón determinado en eventos ""QTE"" o huir de él a toda carrera e incluso escondernos en taquillas manteniendo la respiración, momentos en los que se nos mostrará  la visión de York y la del propio asesino del impermeable.

En cuanto al armamento, tendremos gran variedad de armas de combate cuerpo a cuerpo y de fuego, cada una con sus propias características, como son alcance, daño, durabilidad, velocidad de ataque y munición, las encontraremos en los distintos escenarios, al derrotar enemigos o al comprarlas en la armería; mención especial merecen las que obtenemos al completar misiones secundarias, ya que son indestructibles o de munición infinita.

[h1][b]MOTOR GRÁFICO / DISEÑO ARTÍSTICO[/b][/h1]
Access Games se decantó por el uso del motor [b]PhysX[/b] de Nvidia, el port para PC sufre de popping en el paisaje lejano así como de crasheos aleatorios, está capado a 720p en cuanto a resolución y apenas ofrece opciones gráficas que configurar, así como una paleta de colores bastante ""fría"", prácticamente todo se puede solucionar empleando entre 5 y 10 minutos usando esta guía:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218647912

En cuanto al diseño artístico, algo desfasado cuando salió la versión original en 2010 pero aún así, los personajes están muy detallados y la belleza de ciertos parajes del pueblo es excepcional, mención especial merecen las habitaciones ""roja y blanca"". Los enemigos aunque no son muchos, si cuentan con varios modelos de sombras, igualmente bien detallados.

[h1][b]BANDA SONORA / SONIDOS FX[/b][/h1]
La B.S.O. del juego es excepcional, hay 3 ó 4 temas que se repiten bastante a lo largo del juego, pero encaja perfectamente en cada momento, mientras pesquéis silbaréis, cada coche tiene su propia melodía, los momentos de acción y trágicos son acompañados también por melodías increíbles, todo obra de [b]Riyou Kinugasa, Takuya Kobayashi e Hiromi Mizutani,[/b] podéis adquirirla en Steam como DLC.

El doblaje aunque en inglés es de muy buena factura, en cuanto a los FX, cumplen su función, sin más.

[h1][b]COLECCIONABLES / EXTRAS / REJUGABILIDAD[/b][/h1]
50 misiones secundarias, 65 cromos que conseguir, armas de durabilidad y munición infinitas, poder pescar distintos objetos en distintas localizaciones del pueblo, varios coches y trajes que conseguir y 60 horas de diversión.

[h1][b]VALORACIÓN FINAL[/b][/h1]
Deadly Premonition DC se ha convertido en un juego de culto por su historia, ambientación, carisma de los personajes y mezcla de géneros, ¡¡hazte con él YAAA!!

I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?

сюжет, хотя и немного макобрический, и отдает оттенком сумашествия,  все равно  колоритен, проработан и поражает.  невообразимо атмосферна изображена жизнь в маленьком городе, где все друг друга знают и подозревают. главный герой каждое утро завтракает с друзьями в кафе, на расследование ездит с напарниками, по ходу дела мы узнаем истории каждого из них, проникаемя их судьбами, в конце рабочего дня он идет в джаз бар итд, то есть погружеие в роль протсо фантастическое.

Tem tantas coisas dando errado no jogo, mas ainda assim, continuo intrigado, esperando que ele melhore. O game é uma mistura da mecânica de Resident Evil 4 com as técnicas narrativas de Alan Wake (com uma ótima trilha sonora) num mundo aberto ao melhor estilo ""Que-diabos-é-isso?"" de Silent Hill. A história de um investigador indo para uma cidade do interior para desvendar um misterioso assassinato é genérica, porém interessante. Os personagens são bizarros, os diálogos são dignos de filmes como ""Evil Dead: A morte do Demônio"" e os monologos do personagem principal fazem altas referências a cultura pop (Viu? Não dá pra definir ao certo se isso é um ponto fraco ou forte). Veja uns trailers, uns gameplays e se possível, jogue o demo antes de decidir pegar esse jogo, mas ainda assim, me parece correto recomendá-lo.

+ Ótima trilha sonora
+ Ênfase no Roteiro

But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.

Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic ""who dun it"", story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story. 

The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,
 bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness. 

I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.

Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed.  In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

Warum?

Das Spiel, oder um ganz genau zu sein DIESE VERSION DES SPIELS ist so massiv verbuggt, dass es nur ein einziges Wort gibt, mit dem man es beschreiben kann:

[h1]UNSPIELBAR.[/h1]

[h1]Wie sieht das aus?[/h1] 
Es stürzt an bestimmten Stellen IMMER ab. Diese scheinen von Spieler zu Spieler zu variieren, aber das ändert an der Sache ja nichts. Meist sind es Cutscenes, bei denen das Spiel aufhört zu arbeiten. 
Genauer gesagt schließt einfach das Spiel und man bekommt die Fehlermeldung ""dp.exe funktioniert nicht mehr"". Im Forum gibt es dafür zwar Anleitungen was zu tun ist, aber NICHTS HILFT (Mir jedenfalls nicht). Ich selbst und ein paar andere haben es auch mit ""Ersatz-Saves"" probiert,die es zum Runterladen gibt, aber selbst das hilft nicht. 
In meinem Fall handelt es sich um die ALLGEMEIN BEKANNTE Stelle - Episode 2 / Kapitel 09 -, allgemein bekannt weil das Spiel an der Stelle wohl bei vielen Usern den Geist aufgibt. Überspringt man die erste Sequenz des Kapitels (mit Hilfe des Saves), kommt man zwar an der ursprünglichen ""Absturzstelle"" vorbei, allerdings nur bis zum nächsten Dialog. D.h. das Spiel stürzt weiterhin ab, nur eben an anderer, leicht verschobener Stelle.

Obwohl diese Tatsache allgemein und lange bekannt ist (das Spiel ist ja auch hier auf Steam NICHT neu), gibt es keinen Patch dafür.
Wenn man [h1]Gerüchten[/h1] glauben darf, wurde wohl das Entwicklerteam kurz nach dem Release der PC-Version des Spiels (das Spiel selbst ist ein xbox 360/PS 3 - Port) entlassen. Wahrscheinlich vom Publisher aus, oder wem auch immer ... ist ja auch egal. Es würde zumindest erklären, warum nicht mal solch spielzerstörende Bugs behoben wurden. (Mal ganz abgesehen davon, dass sich der Port wie eine ""Early-Access-Alpha""-Version spielt. Außerdem kann man lesen, dass es den Port ohnehin nur gab, weil es von der Community so gewollt wurde [i](siehe ""Dark Souls - Prepare to Die Edition, die ja auch nur auf ""flehen"" der Community für den PC erschien ... mit dem Unterschied, dass diese zumindest spielbar ist, wenn man einen Controller besitzt)[/i] und man entsprechend halt einfach was für den PC zurechtgeklatscht hat, ohne zu testen, ob es überhaupt läuft.

Das  ist auch ein Grund, wieso ich kein ""richtiges"" Review schreiben kann. Mir fehlen einfach notwendige Infos und mir irgendwelche Sachen ausdenken oder wild zu spekulieren, nur um irgendetwas zu schreiben, wäre hier einfach nur dumm.

Nunja, einige können es scheinbar spielen, viele nicht. Ich kann es nicht. Deswegen

Everything.

I show this game off all the time and most people think I'm joking.
I first played this back in 2012.
This is genuinely my favorite game of all time.

The story is like if you took Twin Peaks, translated it into Japanese, had a dude translate it back into English and then had another guy try to read back the lines in Japanese with his only exposure to English having been some late night sitcoms.
Basically what I'm saying is it's amazing, it has so many twists and major plot points that left me stunned.
One of the most satisfying boss fights of all time is against a cross dressing man who flys around calling you a skank.
The characters were likeable and kooky in their own way and were generally unique and not bland archetypes.
Some of the most memorable and funny lines in the world ""FK in the coffee"" and ""The answer is [onion]""
The graphics while lackluster contribute to the off-kilter world of Greenvale.

The only downside is this version crashes all the time and the PS3/Xbox version is slow as hell.
But if you download DPfix it mostly fixes the crashes, except for some very specific ones.
(Hint: Wait for it to start raining before you go in the Town Hall to fix that crash)

Jugable :

Simple y llanamente pésimo, triste, ridiculo e incluso gracioso que a veces se aprecia.
Los controles son un completo caos, aparte añadiremos la mala optimización, que hace que nuestro personaje parezca loco.
Como he dicho, el juego a veces se parece a un simulador de crash, en mi run de este juego tengo que decir que se me ha crasheado alrededor de 20-25 veces como mínimo.
Los recorridos de misión a misión son la mayoria abusivos, quiero decir, deberemos viajar unos 5 mins en coche y no bromeo.
No es todo negativo, la música es preciosa, música que evidentemente adquiriré a la larga.

Historia :

Pues si DP falla en lo jugable, esto es un zasca, Simplemente en historia este juego para mi ha sido un ""no-va-más"", totalmente sorprendente este juego ha conseguido enomararme en su historia de manera que MUY pocos juegos han conseguido hacer a lo largo de su recorrido.
Deadly Premonition es el juego que juegas por su historia, por que sí. podra ser complicado en  otros aspectos, pero realmente te sientes realizado e incluso vacío cuando completas la historia y sabes que ya no vas a ver más a Francis ni a Zack.

Jugable : 5/10
Historia : 9,5/10

making for one of the most unique, confusing, hilarious, and quotable gaming experiences ever to grace the face of the universe.

So why not recommended then? The port is probably the single worst I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.
If you pick this up prepare to be greeted with such lovely features such as:[list]
[*]720p resolution lock (Can be fixed by DPFix)
[*]15fps, but only half the time you start the game. Also note it's still running at 60 (evident by some of the camera movement and the pause menu, but the timing is messed up for everything else).
[*]Bad controller support. This game was originally a XBox 360 game, which makes the dev's choice of DirectInput over XInput make even less sense. Editing controller binding happens in the launcher and is extremely limited & finicky (DPFix does give you a few more options through ini files).
[*]Random crashes, the game tends to crash randomly due to memory leaks or just bugs in the game code. There's some ways to lessen the effect but no way to get rid of all of them.
[*]Not so random crashes, some parts of the the game just outright crash and you have to do all sorts of stuff to try to work around them (such as running in compatibility mode for Win98, or rebooting your PC), but even that's not as bad as
[*]Save file corruption, save files can easily become corrupted, causing the game to crash soon after load, and usually in the same spots. Sometimes the only work around is to delete your save and start again. Save often and backup saves often.
[/list]

It's a great game but it's just not worth the money they're asking for considering the state of the port, however if it goes really cheap it might be worth the gamble if you can make the port bearable.
If you are a XB360 or PS3 owner then I highly recommended you pick it up for one of those if you can find it cheap (might need to import the PS3 version however).
If you just want your dose of SWERY then I suggest you go and pick up D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which is cheaper and has a good PC port (Unreal Engine 3).",1438237333,1680426265,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Si bien me ha encantado la programación es un desastre. Problemas que he sufrido:

- Primero tuve que ejecutarlo en modo ventana, bajarme un programa para que use más RAM y ejecutarlo como modo administrador para hacerlo más estable
- Guardaba cada vez que encontraba un checkpoint, porque si no se me ha cerrado 30 veces el juego solo no se me ha cerrado ninguna.
- Tenía que estar siempre antento de llevar tabaco (para pasar el tiempo rápido) porque hay misiones que si te las pasas muy rápido, como en el restaurante, se crashea
- Procurar no rejugar capítulos para hacer sus secundarias, porque te pueden desaparecer items importantes
- Ver como 6 o 7 secuencias en youtube porque se cuelga el juego si las dejo, sobre todo en la casa de cierto personaje
- Además he sufrido bugs del tipo de que el personaje no corre bien y tengo que estar dándole al botón de correr varias veces, misiones que no salen en el mapa, la conducción es horrible y a veces el mismo coche gira más que otras veces... es un despropósito.
- Si bien me marca más de 30 horas, la verdad es que son unas 15. Lo que pasa que si el juego iba bien durante mucho rato no lo cerraba para que aguantase más sin crashes

Había leído un montón de criticas acerca de este juego, en las cuales te dabas cuenta de que u odiabas este juego o lo amabas. No había punto intermedio. Yo no sabría deciros.

Soy capaz de perdonar su apartado gráfico totalmente desfasado y su jugabilidad arcaica. De hecho el juego me estaba gustando ya que la historia poco a poco engancha. No obstante lo que no soy capaz de perdonar son los continuos cuelgues del juego. No es normal que me tocase repetir cinco veces la misma parte del juego solo porque de repente le de por sufrir un error y colapsar el juego, llegando finalmente a dejar de funcionar en una parte específica del juego e impidiendo continuar la historia.

Si algún día me vuelvo a animar probablemente lo instale y le de una segunda oportunidad. Sin embargo, si estais pensado en comprarlo yo os recomiendo que NO lo hagais, a no ser que esté a precio de risa.

This might be one of the best games I've ever played.
'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity.

Это настолько [u]противоречивая игра[/u], что спорить о её достоинствах и недостатках можно часами.
Начнём с недостатков.
[b]УЖАСНАЯ ТЕХНИЧЕСКАЯ РЕАЛИЗАЦИЯ![/b]
Это просто кошмар. Помните самые ужасные порты на пк? ([b]Devil May Cry 3, Resident Evil 4, Dark Souls[/b]). Так вот - у них пополнение. Это один из самых [u]отвратительнейших[/u] портов, что я видел за свой век.  
Давайте по порядку
[b]МЕРЗКАЯ ГРАФИКА![/b]
Ужас! Не поймите меня превратно – но так выглядели игры на запуске PS2. Ещё и настроек нет :(
Убогие модели, убогое окружение, убогое освещение, ужасные текстуры и [u]блюр[/u]. [u]Много блюра[/u].
И ещё бывает фпс проседает. Ну это вообще без комментариев.
[b]ПАРШИВЫЙ ЗВУК![/b]
Качество звука и звуковых эффектов оставляет желать лучшего. Ещё есть проблемы с поддержкой оборудования и баги.
О, да) 
Если вы обладатель гарнитур 5.1, 7.1 – уберите их подальше от этой игры.
[b]ВЫЛЕТЫ![/b]
Это отдельная тема) Игра может идти идеально, а может вылетать на каждой кат-сцене.
Что с этой игрой не так – одному Заку известно.
Всё ещё читаете? Значит, возможно, у Вас хватит терпения оценить эту игру по достоинству.
Поговорим о спорных моментах.
А что представляет из себя игра, если опустить детали технического характера?
[b]Deadly Premonition[/b] – эта такая странная помесь из [b]GTA, Silent-Hill’а, Alan Wake[/b]. Ну и возможно, [b]L.A. Noire[/b].
Играем мы за Йорка – агента ФБР, прибывшего в маленький городок Гринвейл расследовать убийство. И чем может заниматься агент ФБР, прибывший на расследование?
Да ничего особенного – занимается тем, чем занимается [u]обычный среднестатистический агент ФБР[/u]! Ест, пьёт, спит, курит ([i]весьма стильно[/i]), бреется, рыбачит, собирает коллекционные карточки, ездит по чекпоинтам на машине под вариацию песни [i]American Idiot[/i] группы [i]Green Day[/i]…
И тут мы переходим к спорному моменту в этой игре – это игровой процесс.
Он странный. Он кривой. Местами очень скучный. «Зато Сэндбокс!» - Скажите Вы)
Какой к чёрту сэндбокс?! Какая ещё нахрен свобода!?
В игре нечем заняться помимо основного сюжета и дополнительных заданий.
Экшен часть вообще [b]мрак[/b]. В игре есть два типа врагов. Ну ок, 3. Ладно 5.
 «Тени» (Так зовут местный бестиарий), которые бьют вблизи или засовывают свои грязные руки Йорку в [u]рот[/u] (О_О), тени, которые стреляют по Вам с расстояния, ползущие по стенам кикиморы, а также нечасто встречающиеся зомби-псы и птички.
Есть ещё загадочный убийца в красном дождевике, но рядовым противником его не назовёшь – он появляется только по праздникам.
Так вот, по всем этим упырям совершенно неинтересно стрелять, опасности они никакой не представляют, выглядят скучно и вообще такие эпизоды обычно затянуты и ничего кроме зевоты не вызывают. Чтобы не заснуть, запасайтесь кофе) [i]Кофе важный элемент расследования :)[/i]
Ещё есть боссы. 
Мда…
Ах да. Ещё вы будете в этой игре ездить на машине. Много ездить. 
Какая же тут поганая физика… Автомобили ведут себя как утюги на льду. Ездить вам надоест очень быстро.Зато дворники можно включать и выключать и поворотники. ^_^ В игре присутствует быстрое перемещение, но о нём я узнал, только на втором прохождении :( - так что будьте внимательны и не пропускайте сайд-квесты. Облегчите себе жизнь.
Кстати о [b]ФИЗИКЕ[/b]. Вернее про её отсутствие. Уж не знаю, что там обрабатывает [i]PhysX[/i], логотип которого красуется в титрах (наверно поведение галстука на костюме Йорка), но и без того неубедительный мир, с такой физикой выглядит совсем картонным.
В общем геймплей не удался.
Ладно, поговорим о хорошем)
А что же есть хорошего в этой игре? 
Переходим к [b]ПЛЮСАМ)[/b]
[i]Сюжет, атмосфера и персонажи.[/i]
Если Вы сможете пережить всё это мракобесие, дадите игре шанс – то увидите, что медленно погружаетесь в местную атмосферу. Этот маленький городок, полный тайн, манит и притягивает словно свет – мотыльков. Есть приятная музыка. Её немного, но она хорошо подчёркивает происходящее. 
А эти персонажи)))  Каждый персонаж  хорошо прописан, и имеет свою изюминку. А тамошний сюжет припас немало твистов, которые заставят Вас не раз удивиться.

Tldr version:

Do I like Deadly Premonition?   YES
Does it deserve it's Cult following?    I think So.
Is it a good, GAME?  No
Would I recommend it? 
Only if you are INCREDIBLY patient and have a love for Dark, Twin Peaks style mystery and quirky Humour.

----------------------------------

Firstly the Twin Peaks references are obvious, so if you're a fan, it's already got that to its advantage.
Initially it feels a bit too close for comfort, almost a carbon copy, but Deadly Premonition does a good job of building on its influences and has an engaging and exciting plotline the comes into its own as the game progresses.

The progression of the story is wonderfully executed and I felt genuinely invested in the characters at the end of the game, giving it all the more impact. 
The plot was dark and disturbing, yet light hearted and humourous at the right times and often left a number of potential candidates for the 'culprit', yet left enough uncertainty to make me doubt I was SURE who it was.

This side of Dead Premonition almost outshines all the negatives. The side missions in particular are wonderfully varied and offer a great glimpse into each character's personality and motivations. 



Regrettably, there are often some conflicting design choices where 'realism' and 'gameplay' butt heads.
Side missions often only unlock in certain weather conditions or require you to drive MILES to get to them, and you are hassled by characters to progress the main plot, which will often prevent you from accessing time-limited side missions.

Eating and sleeping appears to be a requirement in addition to health purely to irritate you and give you a reason to spend money on something.

The gameplay also often features a lot of clunky third person shooting sequences with intrusive quick time events thrown in for extra irritation. Although you do adapt to these over time, they did often feel 'bolted-on' to make it more of a ""Game"".



The nail in the coffin however is that the PC Port is frankly, terrible:

 - Many users find it crashes on startup until you reinstall DP's Physx
 - The Game crashes to desktop very frequently, making saving at every possible moment (and backing up save files) a requirement
- I had a wonderful bug where the handbrake 'Screech' sound of vehicles loops constantly while driving (I hear this is a 5.1 Audio issue)
 - the 'HD' is 720p and only really the core character models have anything resembling a good level of detail

Some attempts at fixing these issues are available from members of the community, but it's just not practical for the majority of users.

Non conoscevo l'esistenza di esso finchè non mi è stato consigliato da un mio amico, e che dire..., non potevo ricevere consiglio migliore perchè questo gioco è bellissimo, ma davvero molto molto bello!
Posso dire con sincerità che è entrato tra i miei giochi preferiti in assoluto perchè ha tutto, per prima cosa il protagonista è semplicemente ""un grande"", non ho mai visto un protagonista come questo in nessun altro videogioco, è carismatico, brillante, geniale, divertente, misterioso e onesto, accompagnato sempre dal suo alter-ego ""Zach"".

La storia è il VERO PUNTO FORTE di questo titolo, è geniale, e grazie anche alle molte scene animate piano piano si riesce a capire cosa stà realmente succedento a Greenvale dato che all'inizio ci saranno tantissimi interrogativi.
Un altro fattore interessante è che ci saranno colpi di scena sempre più incredibili avanzando nel gioco che vi faranno rimanere veramente a bocca aperta e faranno aumentare la tensione al giocatore.

La Longevità è desisamente un altro punto a suo favore, una volta completata la storia principale c'è comunque tanto da fare e da esplorare perchè la cittadina di Greenvale è molto grande e se si vogliono fare le missioni secondarie e collezionare le carte il tempo di gioco aumenta di molto.

Il Gameplay può risultare con qualche difetto specialmente quando bisogna mirare o combattere ma niente di estremamente problematico, ci si fa l'abitudine velocemente.
Una buona cosa è che questo è anche un ""Free Roaming"" quindi si potrà girare per tutta la cittadina e per tutte le strade e stradine di Greenvale in completa tranquillità scegliendo il veicolo che più ci piace, ed è anche possibile interagire con gli abitanti del luogo per avere informazioni o per fare delle missioni secondarie.

Il comparto Sonoro è un pò scarno perchè le musiche sono poche e ripetute molto, comunque io l'ho trovate carine e per niente stancanti.

La Grafica non è il massimo ma neanche detestabile, si può definire in stile ""PlayStation 2"", i nemici sono quasi tutti uguali, non cambiano molto tra loro, invece gli abitanti del paese sono molto diversi tra loro ognuno con personalità e caratteristiche diverse.
L'atmosfera è perfettamente intonata con i luoghi e con i personaggi.

Il difetto principale di questo gioco secondo me è che una volta installato esso non si avvia pur premento il tasto ""Play"" e bisogna fare una correzione su un file per farlo partire, altri piccoli problemi sono dei Crash improvvisi, delle schermate di caricamento che si bloccano, qualche difetto nel Gameplay e qualche errore nella traduzione, ma vi garantisco che tutti questi problemi passano in secondo piano perchè Deadly Premonition è semplicemente unico e bellissimo.

Ich will versuchen, euch ein paar Infos an die Hand zu geben, die euch helfen, diese Enscheidung zu treffen und erklären, warum ich letztlich doch - zögerlich - auf ""Empfehlen"" geklickt habe. Das hat zur Folge, dass dieses Review auch recht lang wird. Sorry dafür!

Ihr seid Agent Francis York Morgan vom FBI (nennen wir euch York, das macht nämlich jeder). Eure Aufgabe ist es, einen Mord an einer jungen Frau in einem kleinen Ort namens Greenvale aufzuklären. Ihr seid allerdings nicht einfach irgendein Agent, sondern der Mann für die besonderen, mysteriöseren Fälle. Das dies ein solcher werden wird, wird direkt bei eurer Ankunft klar...


In seinen Grundzügen ist Deadly Premonition ein OpenWorld-Horror-Krimi-Action-Advenure. Wer die 90iger-Jahre-Serie ""Twin Peaks"" kennt, dem sollte gesagt sein, dass das hier praktisch das inoffizielle Spiel dazu ist. Das schlägt sich im Erzählstil, dem Humor bis hin zu der Tatsache, dass viele Charaktere der Serie ihr Gegenstück im Spiel gefunden habe, sehr deutlich nieder. Wer die Serie nicht kennt, dem sei gesagt, dass ihr es in  Deadly Premonition mit einem skurrilen Mix zu tun bekommt. Da ist einmal die wirklich spannende, sich an Erwachsene richtende Story, die sich vom einfachen Krimi langsam in Richtung japanischer Horror-Fantasy entwickelt. Dann haben wir die überzogenen, überkarikierten aber sehr markanten, gut ausgearbeiten Charaktere, die wegen ihrer Art und ihrer Inszenierung einfach auf eine positive Art lange im Gedachtnis bleiben werden. Dazu gibt es B-Movie-Trash und einem sehr speziellen Humor, der von tiefsten, zynischsten schwarz bis zu Slapstick eine breite Paltette abdeckt. So weit, so gut...

Leider kommen dazu auch viele Schwächen. Teilweise die Gleichen, die man in den Konsolenversionen schon hatte. Da wäre einmal die Grafik, die selbst zum Erstrelease ihrer Zeit schon um mindestens 5 Jahre hinterher hing. Schusswechsel sind mäßig realisiert, was sowohl daran liegt, dass man keine Wucht bei den Waffen spürt, als auch daran, das die Steuerung schwammig und unpräziese ist. Und wo wir gerade bei schwammig sind: das Fahrverhalten dieses Spiels ist wohl das Mieseste, was ich je in einem Spiel erleben musste. Die Straßenkarte, die sich kaum zoomen lässt und sich dazu noch ständig mitdreht ist an Nutzlosigkeit kaum zu überbieten und trägt somit ebenfalls noch ihren Anteil zum ""Fahrspass"" bei. Und die deutsche Übersetzung ist auch eher verständlich als gut.

Und dann haben wir da leider noch eine Menge technischer Probleme, die quasi exklusiv in der PC-Version sind. Zuerst sei angemerkt, dass es eine ganze Menge Spieler gibt, die dieses Game überhaupt niemals starten können. Selbst wenn das aber nach einigen Workarounds funktioniert (was keineswegs garantiert ist), wird man je nach System gegebenfalls von häufigen Crashes geplagt (Tipp: Komppatibilitätsmods für Windows 98/ME, allerdings geht dadurch ggf. die Framerate in den einstelligen Bereich), ab und zu verweigern die Tasten des Gamepads bis zu einem Rechnerneustart den Dienst, das Bild bleibt schwarz oder der Ton verschollen. 

Dagegen wirken die restlichen Unzulänglichkeiten, wie das das Spiel ohne Mod auschließlich in 1280x720 Pixeln (720p)-Auflösung läuft, die nicht optimale Gamepadvorbelegung, die sich nur eingeschränkt ändern lasst, die Farbpalette, die bei der PC-Version verbuggt ist und somit das ganze Spiel mit einem Grauschleier überzogen ist, die miese und sehr instabile Framerate oder das das Spiel mit Maus und Tastatur fast unspielbar ist, fast schon vernachlässigbar.

Oder kurz: Technisch ist die PC-Umsetzung der eh schon altbacken wirkenden Konsolenversion eine absolute Katastrophe, wie ich sie noch nie erlebt habe. Und je moderner der PC ist, umso größer sind die Probleme. Wer kein fundiertes Wissen über seinen PC, über Treiber, deren Einstellungen und ähnliche Dinge hat und/oder wer keine Lust hat, sich auch mal 3 Stunden durch irgendwelche Forenbeiträge zu wühlen, wenn er eigentlich lieber Zocken würde, sollte vom Kauf direkt absehen. Für alle die es dennoch probieren wollen: denkt an das Steam Rückerstattungssystem.


Warum empfehle ich nun dieses Spiel, dessen Gameplayelemente für sich genommen alle höchstens Durchschnittlich sind und dessen technische Umsetzung eine Totalkatastrophe ist? Ein Spiel, dass ich ein halbes Jahr lang auf dem Laptop meiner Freundin spielen musste, weil es bei mir trotz allen Versuchen und aller Forentipps nicht zum Funktionieren zu bewegen war und das dann nur durch Zufall mehr oder minder ""plötzlich"" auch bei mir startete?

Es ist die Einzigartigkeit. Lange bevor sich irgendwelche experimentellen Indie-Games ohne wirkliches Gameplay versuchten, statt eines Spiels eine Erfahrung zu schaffen und sich selbst eher als Kunst als als Spiel sahen, hat Deadly Premonition diesen Schritt zur Kunst meiner Meinung nach schon geschafft - und sogar mit richtigem ""traditionellem Gameplay"". Es ist ein Spiel, dass mit nichts vergleichbar ist, was ihr jemals gespielt habt und vermutlich auch mit nichts, was ihr noch spielen werdet. Die einzeln betrachtet unterdurchschnittlich umgesetzten Gameplayelemente ergeben zusammen genommen ein stimmiges, durchaus positives Bild. Die Story ist spannend, rätselhaft und mit vielen Wendungen versehen, so das man unbedingt wissen möchte, wie es weiter geht. Zu den einzelnen Charakteren baut man für ein Spiel ungewöhnlich starke Bindungen auf, so das man immer wieder gern in die Welt zurück kehrt. Der Erzählstil ist einzigartig und obwohl alles immer etwas ""over the top"" ist, wirkt es innerhalb der Spielwelt völlig normal. Ja, selbst eine gepfiffene, sehr eingängige Melodie als Hintergrundmusik wirkt hier keineswegs albern, sondern perfekt passend. Die Gespräche des Protagonisten mit einer ""unsichtbaren Person"" werden auch nach kurzer Zeit für den Spieler zu etwas völlig Normalem. Alles Dinge, die man schlecht erklären kann, aber die einen unglaublichen Sog entwickeln, der die zahlreichen Schattenseiten des Spiels irgendwann in Vergessenheit geraten lässt.

Das Spiel lebt von seiner Story, von der Art, wie sie inszeniert wird und von den Charakteren als Darstellern - und spielt in diesen Disziplinen in der oberen Liga mit - nicht nur, was Spiele, sondern auch was Bücher und Filme angeht. Die Technik ist, wie schon umfassend erwähnt, totaler Mist, der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist leicht, denn obwohl York Munition benötigt, wird sie quasi niemals knapp, obwohl er essen, schlafen und Kleidung wechseln muss, stellt das niemals ein Problem dar. In der Community hat sich der Spruch etabliert, dass das Schwierigste am Spiel ist, es zum Laufen zu bekommen. Das sagt diesbezüglich schon alles. Die zahlreichen Nebenquests sind interessant, gut erzählt und geben nette Belohnungen, sind aber für das einfache Durchspielen des Spiels nicht im geringsten irgendwie Notwendig. Für die Nebenbeschäftigungen wie Angeln, Dart spielen oder Rennen fahren gilt das Gleiche. Wenn also die Story und die Charaktere bei euch nicht funktionieren, gibt es nichts anderes für euch bei Deadly Premonition zu holen. Das ist wohl auch der Grund, warum dieses Spiel die Gamer in zwei Lager teilt. Entweder man liebt es - oder man hasst es. Bei mir hat es zielgenau den Nerv getroffen und wenn die technischen Probleme nicht wären, würdet ihr an dieser Stelle nun ein überschwengliches Review mit absoluter Kaufempfehlung lesen. Das konnte es nun so leider nicht werden, aber für die geduldigeren Leute unter euch, die sich gern in gute Geschichten ziehen lassen - oder für Twin Peaks-Fans - ist es möglicherweise dennoch einen Versuch wert.

You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.

Since the beginning I like the habit of the main character ""York"" to talk to ""Zack"". It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.

Some insights of my journey with the game:
I was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix.  I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad.
In chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements.
After you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :)
I used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.

I like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun!

แต่เรื่องอื่นๆ บอกได้เลยว่าค่อนข้างห่วย ถึงขั้นห่วยมาก เพราะเป็นเกมยุคPS3 แต่หลายๆอย่างในเกม สู้เกมดีรุ่นPS2ไม่ได้ด้วยซ้ำ
ถ้าค่ายเกมใหญ่ๆ เอาไปคอนเซปนี้ไปทำดีๆ อาจจะเป็นGame of the year เลยก็ได้

Story : 6/10
ทำได้เกือบดีละ มีหลากหลายอารมณ์ดี ทั้งHorror, Drama, Comedy แต่อย่าหาคำว่าตรรกะจากเกมนี้ เพราะมันไม่มี นึกจะใส่เนื้อเรื่องแบบนี้ก็ใส่มาเลย ใส่มาแล้วขัดๆกัน มันก็ยังจะใส่ แถมเปลี่ยนอารมณ์ไว้เหลือเกิน เมื่อกี้ยังหลอน มาตลกซะละ แต่ก็ดี ขำๆ

Gameplay : 4/10
เข้าขั้นห่วย ไม่รู้ว่าเป็นเพราะพอร์ทมาไม่ดีด้วยรึเปล่า ศัตรูทั้งเกมมีแต่ซอมบี้เดิมๆ แค่เปลี่ยนอาวุธที่ถือ บอสก็กระจอกงอกง่อย กระสุนปืนพกตอนเริ่มต้นก็ Infinity ซะละ(แต่อาวุธระยะประชิดดันแตกทำลายได้) หาความท้าทายน่าตื่นเต้นไม่เจอเลย
ยังดีที่เป็นเกมแบบเล่นอิสระ มี Side Mission ให้เล่น ก็พอเป็นสีสันขึ้นได้บ้าง ( ทำให้รู้สึกเหมือนเล่น Harvest Moon ที่ไปพบปะผู้คนในเมืองแล้วทำ Quest กับซื้อของ) 

Graphic : 3/10
เฮ้ย! นี่เกมรุ่น PS3 นะเฟ้ย ภาพแม่งหยั่งกะ PS2 ทั้งการเคลื่อนไหวไปจนถึงระบบการเล่นหลายอย่าง มันตกรุ่นสุดๆอ่ะ แถมการขับรถทำออกมาได้แย่มาก ไม่สมจริงเอาซะเลย บางครั้งขับๆอยู่ รถก็จมลงไปในดินบ่อยๆ T_T

แต่ยังไง ผมก็แนะนำเกมนี้อยู่ดีล่ะครับ เพราะอย่างที่บอกไปตอนต้นแล้วว่า เกม Horror ที่ Open อิสระแบบนี้ ไม่ใช่หาได้ง่ายๆ ซึ่งเกมนี้ก็ออกมาหลายปีแล้ว ยังไม่เห็นมีเกมค่อยใหญ่ๆอันไหนทำคอนเซปใกล้เคียงอันนี้

Les notes:

+ Points positifs

Un scénario Lynchien qui interpelle
Dialogues savoureux
La possibilité de visiter librement la ville
L'aventure rythmée par le quotidien des habitants

- Points négatifs

Un visuel digne d'une PS2
Choix esthétiques douteux
Des bugs graphiques
Une version Director's Cut qui rame et qui n'apporte pas grand-chose de plus
De nombreuses fautes d'orthographe
Pas mal de dialogues au son caverneux
Gameplay catastrophique
Phases en voiture indigestes
Le jeu s'évertue à singer Twin Peaks sans jamais l'égaler

En l'état, on regrettera qu'Alan Wake n'ait pas fusionné avec Deadly Premonition, bien plus ambitieux sur certains points que l'oeuvre de Remedy. Plus proche de Twin Peaks que ne le fut le thriller psychologique finlandais, le soft nippon souffre néanmoins d'un nombre insurmontable de tares empêchant le joueur de se plonger pleinement dans ce monde étrange. En effet, difficile de ressentir de l'empathie pour l'ami Francis tant la technique et le gameplay se veulent rebutants. Au final, Deadly Premonition nous montre bien qu'un jeu vidéo se doit avant tout de trouver un parfait équilibre entre la forme et le fond afin d'éviter que l'oeuvre ne sombre dans un abîme de médiocrité duquel un synopsis, aussi bien rédigé soit-il, ne pourra l'en extirper. Ce n'est malheureusement pas le cas en l'état tant on subit l'aventure plus qu'on ne la vit, ceci étant encore plus vrai avec cette Director's Cut, aussi paradoxal que cela puisse paraître.

Вообще, она состоит из сплошных заимствований:тот же сюжет-копирка с Твин Пикс; стрельба из RE4; открытый мир(но  намного больше), перемещение героя в потусторонний-из Сайлент хилла. Разрабы взяли всего отовсюду и смешали в кучу. Получилось крайне коряво. 
Вот одни из главных недостатков:
-управление авто даже хуже чем в GTA 3 и многих более старых игр;
-всвязи с предыдущим преодолевание больших расстояний превращается в полный кошмар;
-QTE критинские. Готов поспорить никто их с первого раза не выполнял, т.к. слишком мало времени дается. А кто решил, что сделать QTE для бега, основанное на шатании стика-хорошая идея, стоит полечить электро-шоковой терапией;
-прятки и удерание от неубиваемого Бугимена. Черт, как же достали вводить это в последнее время куда ни попадя;
-стремная графика и анимация. Ну к этому пункту были притензии у многих рецензентов, но не указать его я не могу;
-игра довольно сурово относится к игроку. Тут нет никаких туториалов, не всплывают подсказки и т.д.

Игра меня не оценивает, и я ее не буду. Попробую просто описать это чудо. В далеких 90-х некто Дэвид Линч снял некий культовый сериал про расследование убийства в небольшом городе Твин Пикс, преисполненый мистики, драмы и необычности. Это тот случай, когда принято говорить ""своя атмосфера"". Впоследствии некто Swery65 из Японии, посмотрел этот сериал, проникся и решил сделать нечто подобное, но в виде игры. Ну то есть не игру по мотивам кино, а нечто схожее по духу. И ему это удалось.

Как и в сериале, имеется небольшой город, убитая старшеклассница и заезжий агент ФБР. Звать Френсис Йорк Морган (""Зовите меня Йорк. Меня все так называют"") - любит кофе, сигареты и периодически обращается к некоему Заку (обычно в такие моменты на экране появляется выбор действия, так что можно подумать будто Зак и есть игрок, но..). Городок открытый и достаточно обширный, пешком много не побегаешь, тем более что персонаж устает, а время идет. Все квесты назначены на определенные часы, можно брать их каждый день, пока не выполните, но в зависимости от погоды. Погода - дождь или ясно - важный аспект в игре, ибо местный Убийца-в-Дождевике предпочитает непогоду, плюс в дождь по ночам спавнятся зомболюди (хз откуда они, вроде бы добавлены в конце разработки по просьбе издателя). В самом городке работает симуляция жизни, персонажи занимаются своими делами по расписанию. Кстати о персонажах - у нас полгорода ""подозреваемых"", все просто интереснейшие личности. Настолько неординарны, что когда во время городского собрания видишь их всех разом - аж глаза на лоб лезут. Заниматься предстоит расследованием убийства, и тут уж не придерешься - сюжет восхитителен, а Greenvale преисполнен тайн и интересностей.

[code] Tip: если при стрельбе область прицеливания сильно ограничена, попробуйте выставить совместимость с Win98. Или всегда имейте при себе автомат. Критично для финального босса.	 [/code]

Теперь о грустном. Техническая реализация всего - ужасна. Если вы графодрочер или что-то в этом роде, лучше купите себе GTA 5. Разрешение залочено на 720р, присутствует т.н. ""утечка памяти"", из-за которой игра вылетает, в зависимости от мощности ПК, каждые 15-45 минут (но не  у всех). Многие страдают и от ""вылета в 9й главе"", который вообще ничем не лечится, разве что чужой сейв качать. Хотя выставление совместимости с Win98 может оказаться спасением от многих проблем. Также возможны просадки фпс, стрельба реализована убого, машины на дороге ведут себя как утюги в масле, кругом мыло, багучие тени, и все в таком духе. Графон напоминает о первом ПК порте Resident Evil 4, и управление тоже. Фанатский DPfix позволяет выставить нужное разрешение и улучшает графику, но панацеей не является. При всем этом гемплей достаточно разнообразный, квесты интересные, хотя некоторые решения вызывают недоумение. Как вам, к примеру, QTE из 8 разных кнопок? Ладно, оно там одно такое.. С другой стороны, ачивменты хороши - даются исключительно за прохождение миссий и сайдквестов, никакого вам бессмысленного дрочева, что еще раз подчеркивают ценность сюжета.

В общем вот: на одной чаше весов у нас оказывается своеобразный шарм, присущий лишь Deadly Premonition, на другой - груз технических проблем. Что перевешивает, каждый решает для себя сам, а я просто оставлю здесь этот обзор.

Zuerst die negativen Punkte:
Die Grafik ist sehr bescheiden, und nicht verstellbar. Muss man die Grafik durch Fixes aus dem Internet aufpeppen, ist schon mal etwas seltsam. 
Zudem ist das Spiel sehr buganfällig, und es kann durchaus hin und wieder passieren, dass das Spiel abstürzt. (Durch zahlreiche Einträge in Foren belegt). 
Dann noch etwas, das mich persönlich ziemlich gestört hat: Das Spiel wiederholt einige Vorgänge und ""Level"" immer wieder, so dass man bald vorraussagen kann, was passieren wird, auch wenn man es zum ersten mal spielt, was meiner Meinung nach in einem Horrorspiel ein absolutes No-Go ist. 
Manchmal wird es durch die Riesenkarte auch etwas langweilig, da man vielleicht 10 Minuten stupides Autofahren üben kann, um zum nächsten Punkt zu gelangen.
Zum positiven: Ich mag die ganzen Figuren (vor allem York und Emily) 
und die Geschichte wird gut erzählt mit Rückblenden und gewissen Hinweisen, welche die zukünftigen Ereignisse andeuten. 
Auch das der Spieler als Zach eingebunden wird in die Geschichte finde ich genial. 
Die ganze Atmosphäre des Spiels (oder vor allem der Wechsel von Horror auf Krimi) ist super gelungen, der Spannungspegel steigt sofort, wenn man weiss, dass man jetzt vorsichtig sein muss.
Auch wenn die Grafik insgesamt wirklich traurig ist, muss man dennoch zugeben, dass das Spiel teilweise Bilder bietet, bei denen man staunen muss.
Alles in allem muss ich sagen, dass ich dieses Spiel zu dem Preis weiterempfehlen würde, trotz zahlreicher Mängel. Wenn man jedoch ein perfektes Spiel erwartet zu diesem Preis, sollte man als Spieler die Finger davon lassen und sparen.",1434201530,1434201530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Были даже отзывы, что игра и вовсе не проходима на ПК. Лукавить не стану, порт действительно один из худших на моей памяти. Однако, уверяю вас, при наличии прямых рук и зрячих глаз, ситуацию можно исправить практически полностью. За всю игру я столкнулся лишь с одним постоянным вылетом в определенном месте, и даже там решение нашлось без особых усилий. Используйте DPfix, экспериментируйте с его настройками, читайте гайды по решению технических проблем, и наверняка вы сможете привести пациента в играбельную форму и подтянуть графику. Насчет управления – на геймпаде от Xbox 360 все играется на ура и без танцев с бубном.

Что касается сюжета, думаю подробно разглагольствовать не стоит (да и не выйдет без спойлеров), лишь выскажу, что это действительно нечто, без сомнения – самая сильная сторона игры. И пусть вас не отпугивает несколько типичная начальная завязка, если вы любитель крепких триллеров и детективов с элементами мистики и хоррора – вы наверняка влюбитесь в игру. Интрига и саспенс нарастают с каждой главой. Количество и проработанность катсцен, диалогов, деталей, твистов – все выполнено на уровне лучших произведений вышеупомянутых жанров, больше всего ассоциаций у меня навеяло с Silent Hill, Heavy Rain и Alan Wake.

Геймплейно игра представляет собой своеобразный винегрет. Здесь есть экшн, квест, рпг-элементы, квик-тайм эвенты, и даже открытый мир с покатушками на авто. Присутствует простенькая симуляция жизни, как у главного героя (например – еда, сон, бритье, стирка), так и у жителей города, также фигурирует внутриигровое время. Помимо основного сюжета, будет доступно немало побочных и довольно увлекательных квестов. Ничего необычного, как может показаться, и действительно – геймплейные откровения здесь едва ли можно сыскать, однако в своем неординарном сочетании элементы игрового процесса и визуальной составляющей создают особый, непередаваемый шарм, позволяя глубже окунуться в атмосферу провинциального городка.

Очень жаль, что столь уникальный продукт не получил широкой огласки, особенно в российском сегменте. Ситуацию омрачают проблемы технического характера.

Мистическая детективная драма в жанре психологического  хоррора [i]с замечательной историей в лучших традициях[/i] культового «Твин Пикса».

Главным героем игры является специальный агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган, которому поручено расследование  загадочного убийства молодой прекрасной  девушки в небольшом городке Гринвэйл. Из-за тревожной инцидента в детстве  у Йорка появилось [i]раздвоение личности[/i], друг, известный как Зак, с которым постоянно общается в  собственном подсознании. Наличие этого персонажа будет ассоциироваться, наверное, сам игрок.
«Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut»  представляет собой своеобразный [i]симулятор жизни[/i]. Город Гринвэйл  огромный [i]открытый  мир[/i], где можно порыбачить, заправлять машину бензином или зайти в кафе выполняя при этом  [i]побочные квесты[/i]. Ведь Йорку нужен уход , он должен есть, спать и бриться.
Во время расследования дело об убийстве вы попадаете в [i]потусторонний мир[/i], где местность вокруг меняется. Красные корни деревьев будут расти от стен и полов,  пути  блокируются кроваво-красными нитями,  а в ночью город превращается по уши в иной мир, и  вылезают монстры, именуемые ""Тени"". 
Вот тут-то и начинается банальность [i]геймплея[/i]. Замечаешь кривое управление, враги повторяются, стрелять  надоедает. Постепенное улучшение оружия позволяет без труда справляться с ними, ну или Йорк может избежать  обнаружения, затаив дыхание. К сожалению, [i]боевая система[/i] не оставило хорошее впечатление.  Аж быстро успевает игроку надоесть, а именно мне.
Насчет [i]графики[/i], то более-менее лучше.  По сравнению с оригиналом имеется улучшенные  текстурки.   Но ведь здесь  важнее сюжет, нежели графика, не так ли, Зак?
Помимо визуальной плане  в игре  хороший [i]звуковой дизайн[/i] . Жуткое, но при этом приятное музыкальное сопровождение дополняет атмосферу игрового процесса, что  влияет на общем атмосферы игры. 
Также в игре присутствует [i]юмор[/i] от талантливого  спецагента  Йорка.  Шуток  немного, но они  заставляют вас по-настоящему улыбнуться.
Хочу предупредить о  [i]технических проблемах[/i]. Для их решение имеется руководства.

В общем, ознакомиться с этим проектом стоит в любом случае.

Ось такий, він Френсіс Морган Йорк, працівник ФБР, якому доручили розслідування загадкової серії вбивст жінок, справу, яка відкопає старі таємниці біографії самого героя. Саме непростий сюжет і взаємодія з жителями містечка витягує цю глючну і непривітливу гру до рівня шедевру. Ні, не можна сказати, що сценарії крутий і багатоплановий, і що не можна було майже відразу запідозрити, хто ж вбивця, але це гра-мрія, щоб довести її до кондиції, не вистачило сил і досвіду розробників, але навіть на те, на що вони замахнулись та хоч і криво, зате реалізували, вражає.

This game is known for being a Twin Peaks-esque cult classic that is easy to overlook as being horrible in every way, yet somehow pulling it all together perfectly.

To co wyróżnia ją na tle innych tego rodzaju gier to fabuła, postacie oraz świetne dialogi i muzyka. W grze wcielamy się w młodego detektywa (nietypowego detektywa, bo kierującego się intuicją i przeczuciami), którego celem jest wyjaśnienie tajemniczego morderstwa w małym, ale przebogatym w historie amerykańskim miasteczku. Na swojej drodze spotykamy wiele zagadek i tajemnic do rozwikłania - dokładnie badamy każde miejsce w poszukiwaniu poszlak i dowodów oraz wypytujemy wszystkich na każdy mozliwy temat. Oprócz głównego wątku mamy mnóstwo misji pobocznych (plus zbieranie kart oraz osiągnięcia steam), których wykonanie to ciekawe przeżycie i poznanie także ciekawych historii o mieszkańcach miasteczka (należy wspomnieć, że postacie zachowują się różnie zależnie od pogody i pory dnia). Nietypowy klimat gry potęguje wspaniała muzyka i dźwięki otoczenia - czy to przy walce, jeździe samochodem, przerywnikach filmowych lub w paru lokacjach (śpiewanie, radio, szafy grające itd.). Walka w grze jest intuicyjna i w sumie nie sprawia wielu trudności, niestety celowanie zostało totalnie spaprane (widok celowania jest zbyt mały) i pokonanie niektórych przeciwników, a zwłaszcza końcowego bossa to udręka. Nie można też wiele dobrego powiedzieć o optymalizacji (gra przycina i czasem po prostu wywala do pulpitu, częste były również braki dźwięku w dialogach). Graficznie jest bardzo słabo - kanciaste elementy otoczenia, karykaturalne drzewa, modele obiektów i budynków wołają o pomstę do nieba. Nie będę za dużo wspominał o sterowaniu samochodem, bo te także mogłoby być lepsze (bardzo czuły i czasem łatwo o wywrotkę ;p). Na sam koniec dodam, że gdyby nie wymienione przeze mnie wady ta gra byłaby idealna - ma wszystko, fabułę, klimat, świetne projekty poziomów, ciekawe postacie i genialnie skomponowaną muzykę i dźwięki otoczenia. Nie nudziłem się przy niej, a po odejściu od niej miałem ochotę wrócić i dalej zagrać. Polecam i zachęcam do kupna w promocji gdzie kosztuje niecałe 2,49 Euro.

PLUSY :

- bogata i pełna zwrotów akcji fabuła (jest smutno,wesoło i strasznie)
- ciekawe i rozbudowane misje poboczne
- nietypowy mroczny klimat
- ciekawe postacie (mieszkańcy miasteczka,stwory, bossowie i...  Willie ! ;p)
- wspaniała muzyka i dźwięki otoczenia
- logiczne i ciekawe zagadki
- dobrze stworzone i rozbudowane lokacje oraz projekty poziomów

- celowanie, interfejs i mapa
- słaba optymalizacja

В то время я смотрел одного западного обзорщика, и праздное любопытство натолкнуло меня на его летсплей по Deadly Premonition. Я думал, что это будет забавно, но после вступительного ролика нажал «стоп» и закрыл видео. Прекрасно было решительно всё: музыка, постановка, но главное – сила визуального образа. Девушка, распятая на дереве в облике лесной богини не выходила у меня из головы, и я знал, что когда-нибудь я сам возьмусь за это дело. Совсем недавно я поставил точку в истории агента Моргана, и хотел бы поделиться впечатлениями. Это не будет рецензией, скорее художественным опытом.

Твин Пикс. Я думаю, только ленивый не упомянул об идейном вдохновителе и прообразе данной игры. Перед прохождением я специально посмотрел оба сезона и полнометражку с вырезанными сценами, и рекомендую каждому сделать так же. Удовольствие возрастет многократно, хоть поначалу и трудно будет не хмыкать при виде неприкрытых заимствований. Это пройдет.

Прелесть истории здесь в том, что при похожих на известный сериал предпосылках, она развивается совсем в другом направлении. Под конец там будет больше от Стивена Кинга, чем от Дэвида Линча (и я даже рад этому, честно говоря). Но не буду забегать вперед.

Главный герой почти дословно цитирует агента Купера, но со временем развивается в нечто другое, не теряя при этом крутизны и обаяния. Наиболее близким примером будет трансформация Змея Плисскена в Солида Снейка. Если взять хорошую основу и переосмыслить по-своему, может получиться очень годно. И в этом вся игра.

Тихий городок, загадочное убийство, жители с множеством тайн, детектив с особенным modus operandi – все так знакомо, но в то же время так правильно. Только в этот раз мы действительно сами ведем расследование, разъезжая по пустынным дорогам и лично допрашивая подозреваемых. Давно я не использовал блокнот и ручку при прохождении игры! Каждая мелочь может стать решающим кусочком мозаики, и загадка как раз из тех, которые интересно решать самому. Разумеется, сюжет линеен и нам не дадут поймать убийцу раньше времени, но если внимательно фиксировать факты и не жалеть времени на побочные квесты, можно мысленно вычислить преступника еще в первой половине игры.

Сюжет и атмосфера – вот, что самое прекрасное здесь. Для создания последней расставлено огромное количество опциональных предметов, мини-игр, диалогов и ситуаций. Я не помню, когда в последний раз проходил достаточно однотипные сайдквесты только из-за истории, которую они раскрывают. Я обожаю совершенно ненужные мелочи вроде необходимости бриться и менять одежду, начать день с чашки крепкого черного кофе и возможности выпить вечером в баре.

Некоторые вещи, конечно, сломаны. Боевка, хоррор-элементы, экономика и общая сложность не работают как надо, но, по крайней мере, не мешают продвигаться по сюжету. Гораздо сильнее мешают прохождению постоянные вылеты. Серьзено, это один из самых кривых портов, которые когда-либо видел мир. Чтобы только запустить игру я полчаса читал форумы. Увы, некоторые вещи так и не лечатся, и к этому нужно быть готовым. Но будь я проклят, если эти усилия не окупятся многократно блестящей режиссурой и грандиозной историей!

Музыка, колоритные герои, детективная линия, юмор и майндфак в концовке – это вещи, которые выполнены здесь просто блестяще. Да взять хотя бы главного героя – Йорка. Я опять таки не могу припомнить, когда в последний раз встречал настолько притягательного протагониста. Ум, харизма, и всеобъемлющая крутость, которая сочится из каждого жеста и небрежно брошенной фразы заставляют невольно подражать, и вот я уже закуриваю сигарету и обсуждаю с правым ухом любимые фильмы восьмидесятых. Думаю, что по совокупности чудачества и таланта Йорк наверняка бы мог работать в отделе Купера.

После этой игры мне очень сложно сесть за что-то новое. Просто не могу. Кажется, что я уже нашел идеальную историю лично для себя. Разумеется, это пройдет, но, черт возьми, Зак, как мне теперь перестать пялиться в кофейную кружку?",1430340378,1430340565,True,8,0,0.567116141319274902,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- ваш организм значительно лучше перенесет знакомство с игрой, если вы предварительно ознакомитесь с ней на youtube
- за прохождение сайдквестов дают очень полезные читерские плюшки, которые помогут сгладить недостатки игры и сделать прохождение основной линии более приятным (конкретно: радио и гаечный ключ). Но поскольку иногда случается так, что игра вам говорит ровно ничего, для того чтобы вам было понятно, как пройти сайдквест, свободно без зазрения совести пользуйтесь советами на Викии. Это сохранит ваши [strike]пуканы[/strike] нервные клетки.
- сохраняйтесь при любой возможности. Потому что игра сама любит решать, будете вы играть еще или, пожалуй, на сегодня уже хватит.
- не спешите проходить основную историю. В городе есть куча интересных мест и персонажей, отвлекаясь на которые вы лучше познаете [strike]суть бытия[/strike] игру.

Услышал о Deadly Premonition ещё тогда, когда она была консольным эксклюзивом. Тогда меня заинтересовала концепция игры - японская версия сериала Дэвида Линча ""Твин Пикс"".

Агент ФБР Френсис Йорк Морган приезжает в небольшой захолустный городок Гринвейл для расследования жестокого убийства местной девушки. На месте проишествия агент понимает, что подобные убийства уже происходили ранее, и он обязан подойти к расследованию со всей строгостью. Остановившись в отеле города, он знакомится с его немногочисленными жителями, в том числе с типичным таким шерифом-дуболомом Джорджем и его очаровательной помощницей Эмили. Да и вообще, каких только людей, в том числе странных, там нет - даже местная ""дама с поленом"" есть, только она с кастрюлей.

Сюжет игры и диалоги - это главные составляющие игры, ради которых в неё стоит играть. В ходе развития истории будет масса забавных сценок, неожиданных поворотов, тайн, мистики и романтическая линия. Главный герой, агент Морган, вообще занятная личность - всё время говорит с неким Заком по ту сторону экрана. Или не экрана. В общем, там не все так просто - сами узнаете. Если конечно сможете добраться до финала.  

А до финала нам с Заком мешает добраться не хардкорная сложность, нет. До финала нам будет мешать АБСОЛЮТНАЯ ДУБОВОСТЬ игровой механики.

В кратком описании концепция игры весьма занимательна. Открытый мир, городок Гринвейл со всеми домами, лесами и магазинами, жители которого живут по своему расписанию - ходят на работу, ходят домой. Очень напомнило внешне, нет, не Готику, а другую культовую игру - Shenmue, где жители японского города так же жили по своим расписаниям, а главному герою приходилось под них подстраиваться, чтобы выведать что-либо. Так вот - есть город, есть машина, чтобы ездить, есть инвентарь, есть потребность во сне и еде, мытье и бритье, побочные квесты, экшеновая и диалоговая части, расследования. Вроде хорошо звучит, правда?...

... но каждый элемент сделан настолько ДУБОВО и КРИВО, что пройдут эту игру наверное только сильные духом. Я вот с декабря проходил - 4 месяца.

Разберем:
- экшен часть вообще пришита белыми нитками, ибо никакого объяснения, что это за монстры-реднеки на тебя нападают так и не дают - типа больное воображение главного героя заставляет игрока носиться  с подобием оружия добрые полчаса в каждой сюжетной миссии. И ладно бы этот экшен был приятен - но это одна из самых убогих боевых механик, что я видел в играх. Никакого удовольствия от этого инвалидного действия нет, оружие не ощущается, враги и герой двигаются как существа с перебитыми ногами, управление убогое и неудобное. В общем, мрак. А ведь ещё и боссы есть - вот там вообще битва контуженных получается. 
- открытый мир через 10 часов поездок взад-вперед начинаешь материть, ибо с нынешней физической моделью автомобилей и картой... ох... всех слов не хватит... лучше бы она была коридорной игрой без открытого мира.
- графика уровня PlayStation 2. Я не графодрочер, но игра выглядит скверно, по настоящему скверно. Деталей почти нет, часто просто пустые комнаты с одной текстурой, или копипаста деревьев на голой земле.
- авторы не чувствуют меры во многих моментах, типа побега от маньяка с топором, когда это повторяется в десятый раз, а ты всё так-же насилуешь левый стик влево-вправо. Или от последнего босса бежишь по леснице - всё бежишь и бежишь, бежишь и бежишь. Думаешь глюк, а нет - надо просто тупо бежать минут 10.
- типично японский кривой порт на ПК, когда игру доводят энтузиасты, а разработчики даже выбор разрешения прикрутить не могут.

По поводу кривостей можно распинаться долго, и казалось бы игру можно разнести в пух и прах, ибо она и впрямь местами доставляет чуть ли не физические муки.
Но делать этого не хочется. Всё-таки это очень необычный проект, и хоть как игра она ужасна, но как произведение - на удивление хороша. Сюжет и сценарий заставляют играть до следующей сценки, да и общая атмосфера эдакого Твин Пикса весьма необычна и нова. Плюс достаточно трогательный финал сглаживает многие острые углы.

В общем, стоит взять на заметку любителям чего-то необычного и сюжетного.

Pros
-So many side missions
-Soundtrack (actually pretty good)
-Subtitles (Big and Easy to read)
-Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 (Probably the Graphics, Specific save points, over the shoulder gameplay and the BIG Subtitles)
-York is so quirky
-Characters are all so unique in some way (E.g. Gay Assistant, Thomas)
-Humor
-Quite lengthy

Cons
-Its a port
-Minor Hiccups
-Driving sections

Overall, some might say that this game is bad because of its outdated PS2 graphics and other it being a port and all but honestly, those people don't see the the good points, what good points you may ask? The over-the-top humor, a range of memorable characters & Nostalgic gameplay (RE4). I would say this game is worth a buy but you'll probably only during a sale since the game is kinda old and at $25 you can get other better games and besides its like $2.49 during a sale.

La trama è spettacolare e non vi stancherete mai dall'inizio alla fine del gioco, il gioco parla di un Assassino che uccide le sue vittime, tagliando le lingue e lasciando in bocca dei particolari semi rossi, e voi dovrete scoprire chi è l'Assassino, durante il gioco scoprirete che in questo Paesino gira una leggenda, in cui quando piove nelle strade si gira un'assassino che uccide le donne e viene chiamato ""L'assassino dell'impermeabile"", ed è proprio lui che uccide le vittime e voi dovrete scoprire chi è l'assassino, vi dirò in anticipo che ci saranno MOLTISSIMI colpi di scena, per questo AMO questo gioco alla follia, per avere una trama veramente spettacolare.
La grafica è sottotono diciamo ""Grafica PS2"" ma non è male allo stesso tempo, ma la storia del gioco giustifica la grafica  non perfetta del gioco.
Le animazioni sono un pò lineari e robotiche, ma come ho detto sopra la storia giustifica veramente tutto di questo gioco, che per quanto vi incuriosite sulla storia non ne fate nemmeno caso di queste particolarità.
La longevità è molto buona circa 20-25 ore, e può anche allungarsi visto che ci sono missioni secondarie e collezionabili.
I personaggi di questo gioco mi sono veramente piaciuti, sopratutto il protagonista, che farà delle battute divertente ed è molto ""misterioso"" andando avanti nella storia capirete cosa intendo.
Consiglio l'acquisto ASSOLUTAMENTE, perchè questo gioco MERITA di essere comprato e giocato, spero moltissimo in un Sequel.

Pro:

+ Longevità molto alta
+ Personaggi carismatici

This game is living proof that the games even if they can be graphically undertone can still be pearl gaming, and this game is proof, even came into my list of the most spectacular games I've played in my life and now gaming has become one of my favorite games Horror / Investigation, so I hope in a Sequel.
The plot is spectacular and you will never tire from the beginning to the end of the game, the game is about a Murderess that kills its victims by cutting the languages and leaving in the mouth of the special red seeds, and you must find out who is the Murderess During the game you will find that in this village runs a legend, in which when it rains in the streets turns un'assassino that kills women and is called ""The murderess Raincoat"", and it is he who kills victims and you you'll have to find out who the murderess, I will tell you in advance that there will be MANY twists, for this I LOVE this game to madness, to have a plot really spectacular.
The graphics are subdued say ""Graphic PS2"" but not bad at the same time, but the story of the game justifies the graphics of the game is not perfect.
The animations are a little linear and robotic, but as I said above the story really justifies everything about this game, which as you curious about the history you do not even notice these peculiarities.
Longevity is very good about 20-25 hours, and may even stretch as there are side missions and collectibles.
The characters in this game I really liked them, especially the protagonist, who will make the jokes funny and is very ""mysterious"" going on in the story you will understand what I mean.
ABSOLUTELY recommend buying, because this game DESERVES to be bought and played, I hope very much in a Sequel.

Pro:

+ Plot spectacular
+ Longevity very high
+ Charismatic characters

It should be clear that this is by no means a perfect port, but I was able to complete it with only running into some minor problems.
Over the near 20hours of playing I experienced a total of 4 crashes, 2 of which where that DP.exe stopped working and 2 frozen screens that had me restart the PC. No framerate drop or other things that stopped me from playing.

When I first started the game it would always tell me that DP.exe did not work. The fix for that was to go into the Games folder: Steam/SteamApps/Common/Deadly Premonition The director's cut/redist
There you find the file: PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi
Right click Repair stopped the DP.exe from crashing and let me play the game. The error might occur again after some time when trying to start the game, so you might have to do this from time to time again when starting the game.
Apart from 2 times the error did not occur while actually playing the game.

I played the game under Windows 8.


If you bought the game a while ago and where unable to play it, maybe now is the time that it finally works.



Apart from these difficulties I really enjoyed the game. 
The negative sites are the boring and repeatitive combat and some very annoying quick-time-events (especially when playing on keyboard).
For me the story, atmosphere and gerneral experience where worth getting through this. Therefore I recommend this game.",1427734145,1427734145,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

""Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it."" Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P

I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, ""But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me."" Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.

The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think that’s the biggest strength in this game. It’s interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.

The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, it’s quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and don’t flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5.
The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as you’d expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.

Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1’s and those budget games you’d find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.

So yeah… vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In  the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I don’t know the development cycle and I don’t know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didn’t focus in… but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P
Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you don’t save… so it’s up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).

There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:

It is a terrible port from what I've been told and have experienced. However, though I think I'm only about halfway done with the game I have only experienced 1 crash so far... thought it was game breaking until I switched to Administrator mode for the game and the compatability for win 98.*

So far... this is one of those games that's so bad that it's good... And I mean that in a way in which no matter what platform you play it on, it will have some faults, but just the fun, interest in the plot, and characters and what not are gonna get you hooked on this game. If I play a bad game it's usually to torture myself for an audience, but this is a game that is instead very enjoyable even with it's faults.

The dialogue is some of the most ridiculous you'll ever hear and it is just god damned beautiful. It feels like a B-Movie on a low budget, but the director and the actors would have fun with it if it were an actual movie (which by the way the main character while driving WILL tell you some interesting movie trivia). The characters are for the most part likable and each have their own personality.... and... tend to overexaggerate their gestures while talking (seems to be very on purpose in all of it). The music is really damn good in my opinion. When the song, ""Life is Beatiful,"" plays it will get stuck in your head, and it always seems to play at some of the most unappropriate spots.... just... making the situation that much wierder (perhaps it plays at such spots because it what the main character, York, feels at that moment.... simplicity in life). 

The controls, on the other hand.. are what set me off a bit.... So many times I wish I could walk or run while I shoot a gun or swing a crowbar, but instead I am locked in place and can only aim. Seems to be a control sceme that even older Resident Evil games suffered through. The driving in the game is very weird to me as well. You can buy new cars in the game, each with it's set of speed and steering difficulties. However, I found myself always having trouble turning or turning too hard and spinning out... or hell even parts of the road that will have the car think it's Ryu or Ken from Street Fighter doing the Hurricane Kick! 

One more gripe I HAVE to mention with the game is the map. It is one of the most difficult maps I've ever had to handle for one SIMPLE reason... It cannot zoom out far enough to properly know how to get from point A to point B, unless it is directly related to a plotpoint mission. If I want to do some side missions or go to the diner or gas station, I have to either start at my car and pan up the map until I HOPE to see a path that will take me to my desired location, OR I have to flip through set locations using the left or right bumpers on my controller and then from there try to search for the location of my car. It is very annoying, tedious, and frustrating. It would have been nice to either be able to zoom out even further to see more of the map, or even if there is a way to set your own waypoints like the game does for you when you have to proceed with the plot (seriously.... if there is a way to do that and I just can't find out, please message me and tell me how! Would help me greatly!!!).

With all that has been said, I still really enjoy this game and would recommend it! Just take caution, however, that it MAY or MAY NOT work on your pc, not matter what your specs are. Youtuber and Twitch Streamer Cryotic stated he can't get this game working on his rather powerful gaming set up, and yet I'm able to play this on a rather standard laptop myself, so... you have been warned... it may not work. I took the risk and was able to fix my one crashing issue thankfully by switching the compatability and turning on admin mode. Also do NOT GET THE DPFIX JUST YET!!!! It is still in alpha and needs to be throughally updated before it will do any sort of good... Tried it, and had to reinstall the game to make it work again... 

Anyhow, I talked on far too long. The bottom line is this is a good game! Give it a shot! If too afraid for the PC version, try it on xbl or psn!",1427255284,1427255284,True,1,0,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Va a ser muy difícil que si no lo coges con muchas, muchísimas ganas llegues a jugar más de dos horas pues el control es realmente pésimo. A parte, la dificultad es muy sencilla (supongo que para paliar los problemas de control) y a pesar de que hay algún que otro puzzle la complejidad de estos nunca llega a ser muy alta. Para colmo de males el juego está lleno de glitches e incluso alguna crasheo ocasional (aunque lo arreglaron en un último parche, o eso leí, yo lo terminé antes así que no lo pude comprobar) y para completar el pack, el juego cuenta con una cuestionable traducción en la que faltan ciertos caracteres de nuestro idioma además de otros fallos.

¿Por qué recomendar este juego entonces? En primer lugar, el argumento. No es que sea el mejor argumento que hemos visto en un videojuego, pero el caso es que está repleto de personajes geniales, toques surrealistas y secuencias muy divertidas todo metido en un ambiente de misterio. Además, este juego es un homenaje enorme a Twin Peaks, si te gustó la serie, debes darle una oportunidad pues los guiños, referencias, plagios, etc, están por doquier y sinceramente se disfruta mucho.

El juego es una suerte de sandbox bastante vacío pero con sus misiones secundarias y un sistema de ""horas"" que hace que te apremie la situación y decidas que hacer con tu tiempo. Puede llegar a agobiar, pero le da un toque de realismo a la experiencia. Digo que es un sandbox vacío, sí. Pero en cuanto a los elementos gráficos en él. A pesar de eso contamos con un número interesante de misiones secundarias, en general con tramas o situaciones bastante absurdas y divertidas.

La música es otro elemento bastante curioso del juego. En general los temas están a un gran nivel. Pero el montaje realizado en algunas escenas es... ¿muy japonés? Es difícil de explicar. El juego cuenta con un gran número de escenas cómicas entre los personajes protagonistas y hay un tema muy específico para esas situaciones; el caso es que este tema también suena en ciertas escenas dramáticas o el cambio de una escena dramática a una cómica es tan brusco que resulta... sorprendente, que no malo, ojo.

Poco más tengo que decir, el control del movimiento del personaje, de la cámara, de las fases de disparo, las de conducción... es lo más terrible del conjunto pues unos gráficos malos se pueden pasar fácilmente por alto, pero el control es un tema más escabroso... aun así, si logras jugar lo suficiente como para que te hayas acostumbrado vas a encontrar una trama muy interesante repleta de extraños personajes, momentos muy divertidos y el homenaje más grande a Twin Peaks que se ha hecho en un videojuego.

O, almeno, non su pc. Dopo averci giocato diverse ore (premetto che era forse il gioco console che attendevo di più su pc), potrei parlarne benissimo: trama interessante, personaggi ben riusciti, grande atmosfera, humour e citazioni a manetta. La grafica è brutta, ok, le animazioni e i suoni pure, ma alla fine non è niente di così scandaloso. Se la storia prende, si passa oltre senza problemi.

Non si passa invece oltre sui problemi tecnici: appena si ha la possibilità di affrontare in libertà la vasta mappa free-roaming, parte il festival del crash. Crash mentre si viaggia in auto, crash mentre si esplora a piedi, crash durante i caricamenti e crash se si prova ad aprire il menu delle missioni secondarie. Sui forum si trovano miliardi di fix e workaround ma almeno nel mio caso niente è stato risolutivo, ho buttato solo via tempo.

Se avete una ps3 o una 360 è STRACONSIGLIATO, su pc non spendeteci neanche un euro.

AGGIORNAMENTO
Ho recuperato questo titolo su PS3. Framerate ridicolo di quella versione a parte, ho potuto godermelo come si deve. Ho terminato la trama (e fatto un bel po' di sidequest) in 30 ore e sono assolutamente soddisfatto.
Nel frattempo un mio amico lo ha terminato su pc: se non si prova a fare le missioni secondarie in qualche modo sembra si riesca ad arrivare alla fine della storia, anche se è andato incontro a problemi di qualsiasi tipo. Quindi, considerando che spesso si trova ad un paio d'euro, si può anche fare. Ma uomo avvisato...

Propongo qui il mio pensiero a caldo, scritto dopo aver finito il gioco:

Abych řekl pravdu, o této hře jsem před tím, než šla o 75% dolů, nic nevěděl. Potřeboval jsem nějak vyplnit čas v době čekání na nový pc a tak jsem potřeboval něco, co opravdu ""rozjedu"". Adventury mě baví, proto jsem sáhl po Deadly Premonition.
Dneska můžu s klidem říct, že se to vyplatí koupit i s plnou cenou. Hra je skvělá, opravdu hodně promyšlená, někdy až moc - je taky trochu psycho, to se nemusí líbit každému - mě to ovšem extrémně baví. Co můžu vypíchnout jsou super sympatické postavy (ano, hlavně Naomi Watts :D ) s dokonalou psychologií, humorem - s tím souvisí i dobře napsané dialogy. Soundtrack také není špatný. Naopak grafika by mohla být lepší, ovládání vozidel samo o sobě by bylo v pohodě, kdyby se při nárazu do čehokoli nezastavilo jako o skálu. 
V krátkosti bych Deadly Premonition charakterizoval jako vyjímečnou a nenapodobitelnou hru. Buď vás chytne a proto ji odpustíte všechny chyby, nebo vás hned v prvním okamžiku znechutí a víckrát ji nezapnete. Doufám v první možnost :)

First impression of Deadly Premonition? Awful graphics, weird physics and models and confusing story. After getting past the prologue, however, it all makes sense. Getting into this weird game thinking it's going to be an amazing investigation title with interesting horror elements can get you very disappointed, but if you understand it's actually a parody and can enjoy it for that, then don't hesitate to dive into this bizarre adventure! And I don't really think there's much else to be said, only that if you keep an open mind you're in for a good time.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]High comic value
    [*]Interesting characters
    [*]Plot can get curious after you understand it's not all serious
    [*]Gameplay can be a little odd at first, but it's really easy to get used to it
    [*]Plays nicely with a controller
    [*]Possible to invert both X and Y axes of the camera
    [*]Despite port issues, it runs smoothly on a medium rig and enhanced with CCC

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*]Terrible port:
    [*]Locked at 720p
    [*]No graphic options
    [*]Outdated graphics and physics
    [*]Menus might be confusing at first
    [*]No real explanation to the hunger and fatigue systems
    [*]Jokes might not be for everyone / not everyone might understand them
[/list]

[b][u]A note on the graphics and DPFix:[/u][/b] The game would not open with DPFix installed. I don't know if that's because the original (and only copy of the fix I could find on Durante's blog) release of it has also a fix for the controller support (and the current version on Steam has native controller support) or what, but it would simply not work at all. Maybe Durante has to fix this, maybe it's a problem with the current version of the game, but either way making the fix work won't be so easy as others released by Durante.",1426385460,1426385503,True,0,1,0.432445406913757324,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Soyons clairs dés le départ : Deadly Premonition est assez exceptionnel en termes d'ambiance, de scénario et de chara-design mais il souffre également de tares techniques à même de rebuter 99% des joueurs tentés de se lancer dans l'aventure. En gros, [b]c'est le meilleur mauvais jeu auquel j'ai jamais joué[/b]. La lecture peut s'arrêter là, mais je vais prendre le temps de détailler mon avis ci-dessous.[/quote]

[h1]Points forts[/h1]

Le jeu place le joueur au côté de l'agent York Morgan du FBI, chargé d'enquêter sur un meurtre ayant lieu dans une petite ville forestière. Niveau environnement, Deadly premonition est très proche de Twin Peaks (le jeu est truffé de parallèles avec cette série) ou plus récemment de Alan Wake. Un peu à la manière d'un Majora's Mask, le joueur est rapidement lâché dans la ville avec la possibilité de faire ce qu'il veut pendant que chaque citadins vaque à son emploi du temps. [b]Je me dois de préciser l'excellence du studio à avoir su insuffler une personnalité à pratiquement chaque protagoniste[/b] (et il y en a quelques dizaines), chacun avec son caractère, ses problèmes (quêtes secondaires), son planning et sa propre implication dans la trame générale. Cela se fait grâce à [b]un superbe travail sur les dialogues et le doublage qui permet de véritablement s'immerger dans l'univers proposé[/b]. Je terminerai sur ces aspects très positifs en précisant que l'histoire ne s'essouffle pas du tout (malgré un démarrage un poil lent) et que pour une fois, le tout est très cohérent et la fin largement à la hauteur peut vous prendre aux tripes (et pas que la fin d'ailleurs). Tout au long du jeu, [b]la nationalité japonaise des développeurs apporte une extravagance bienvenue sur une histoire très sérieuse et un titre qui n'oublie pas avant tout être un jeu, souvent complètement décalé comme en témoigne la BO complètement barrée[/b]. Ne serait-ce que pour la façon dont elles sont employées, vous n'oublierez pas [u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6CYek7Mrtw&list=PL7C25F62540DF4C0E&index=16]certaines[/url][/u] [u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwpzEpPkBE0&list=PL7C25F62540DF4C0E&index=14]pistes[/url][/u].

[h1]Points faibles[/h1]

Il n'est hélas pas possible de cacher des défauts presque rédhibitoires qui tiennent en deux mots : technique et gameplay. [b]Graphiquement parlant, Deadly Premonition aurait tout aussi bien pu sortir sur une Dreamcast à peine boostée, et même à cette époque, on aurait pesté sur la lourdeur du gameplay.[/b] Citons en vrac : options graphiques absentes, modélisation à la truelle, animations ridicules, synchro labiale à côté, moteur physique sur la lune, mixage audio avec le moteur physique, conduite de véhicule désastreuse, visée pire que dans un Resident evil. Et pour les quelques motivés qui passeront outre, [b]le jeu aura le bonheur de vous placer à quelques moments des QTE atroces et surtout vous avez de bonnes chances sur PC de subir des plantages aléatoires quelle que soit votre configuration[/b].

[quote] [h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Tout cela étant dit, [b]la médiocrité des défauts précédemment énoncée n'a d'égale que les qualités de ce titre en manque de reconnaissance[/b]. Les quelques passionnés persévérants qui auront lu cette recommandation jusqu'au bout pourraient adorer le jeu, même avec les crises de nerf garanties.

Прежде всего, хочется поделиться своими впечатлениями - игра заняла почетное место в списке любимых игр, она прекрасна, атмосферна, в ней много юмора (в том числе и черного), упоминаний культовых преставителей кинематографа, панк-рока. Ее хочется хвалить и хвалить, к ней хочется возвращаться.
Уже в первые минуты игры в голове возникают образы чего-то отдаленно знакомого. Человек, смотревший и любящий Твин Пикс, начинает улыбаться, ведь Йорк Морган безумно напоминает агента Дейла Купера. Далее игра преподносит новый сюрприз - тут тебе отголосок первых частей Resident Evil и Silent Hill.

Коротко о сюжете.
Агент ФБР Френсис Йорк Морган прибывает в маленький провинциальный город Гринвейл (да не просто так прибывает, а по пути вляпывается в историю), где он должен расследовать убийство молодой, всеми любимой девушки (что-то знакомое, правда? [spoiler] Кто убил Лору Палмер?[/spoiler]), там же он знакомится шерифом Джордем Вудманом и его помощницей Эмили Уайатт (тут я подумала ""а как же она похожа на Наоми Уоттс"" и, действительно, с нее и копировали)
В городе начинают происходить различные странные вещи, нас посвящают в местную легенду об [spoiler]Убийце в дождевике[/spoiler], знакомят с множеством героев, каждый из которых имеет различный вес в сюжетной линии и с каждым из них вам предстоит ни раз встретиться по ходу сюжета, у каждого из них есть собственное расписание и, перемещаясь по городу, можно повтречать того или иного и получить информацию, либо же дополнительное задание.

Итак, Йорк может спокойно, в свободное от намеченных планов время, передвигаться по городу, ему требуется еда (знайте, Йорк любит черный кофе и вишневый пирог [spoiler]Привет Куперу[/spoiler]), сон, уход за внешним видом (бриться или нет?), служебным машинам нужно обслуживание - заправлять и следить за их поломками. Так же, в игре сменяется цикл дня и ночи( в режиме 1/3 реального времени), ускорить время можно выкурив сигарету или уложив Йорка поспать на 1,3,8 или 12 часов и еще много, много всего интересного.

Финал игры приятно удивит, часть догадок подтвердится, очень малая часть. Ожидаете типичной концовки в духе детективного жанра? Не дождетесь! Сюжет закрутится в тугую петлю, обвитую вокруг вашей шеи, по телу побегут мурашки и голову не покинут мысли о том, насколько это гениально.

En vista que pude arreglar el tema de los crasheos de forma permanente hasta poder terminarlo gracias a la misma comunidad que hizo un par de parches y fixes no oficiales -obligatorios a esta altura-, decidí modificar mi review inicial. Detalle que no quita el hecho que este port de PC sea terrible en muchos sentidos, pero darle una review negativa no seria justo. El juego en si es bastante brillante e independiente de lo malo que es el port de PC del mismo.

En fin y al hueso. Deadly Premonition sería uno de los pocos juegos que produce in tema de amor y odio. El gameplay es funcional, en terminos de gameplay se siente como estar jugando un juego de Playstation 2, incluso ya en esa epoca habian juegos que se controlaban mucho mejor. En resumen: es solamente funcionales a lo más. La conducción de vehiculos es simplemente horrible. Lo bueno es que casi al principio puedes obtener un item que te permite hacer fast travel sin la necesidad de ir en vehiculo todo el tiempo. El Shooting es como estar jugando los GTAs clásicos, sino peor.   

Leyendo todo eso. Qué mierda es lo que hace a este titulo tan especial? Bueno. Es todo lo demas. La historia es por lejos lo mejor además de los personajes. Todos los personajes tienen un transfordo, un carisma propio, y el juego los trabaja de una forma increible, ningún personaje: incluyendo los secundarios están ahí por estár. Como dije; su punto fuerte. Es por lo que jugué DP justamente hasta terminarlo. 

Algo que tiene además, es que dentro de todos sus problemas tecnicos. El pueblo donde de desarolla tiene un tremendo detalle. Cada ciudadado (Los pocos personajes que hay en el pueblo) tienen una vida propia. En ciertos horarios del dia van a estar hubicados en distintos lugares de la ciudad: Comiendo en el Restorant, comprando en el Market, viendo un obra ne el teatro, pescando, o haciendo algo en su respectiva casa. Tienen una rutina, lo que hace que el pequeño pueblo de Greenvale se sienta vivo. Es un detalle, pero que hace una gran diferencia.

El OST que hace gala es buenisimo, tiene un carisma propio, y resalta en hartos detalles el terror comico que el juego posee. Se me hace dificil no acordarme de Silent Hill, ya que tienen algunos detalles en común, pero sin llegar a ser una copia de esle último. 

Para terminar. Se me hace dificil recomendar este juego, ya que claramente no es para todo público.-El juego se le conoce bastante bien por haber dividido la critica especializada... reviews desde el 2/10 hasta el famoso 10/10 de Destructoid, o el 9/10 de Eurogamer.

The reason I can't recommend it is because I just can't get it to stop crashing.  This game seems to be very poorly optimized and even using DPfix and upgrading my video card only postponed the issue before I kept continually crashing in the same spot.  It's not worth the hassle of getting the game to work.  If this game ran smoothly without the crashing, I would have no issue recommending it.  As it stands now, I have no idea whether it has been patched, but I highly doubt it.

Игра, геймплей которой настолько скучный, что утомляет после первой сцены со стрельбой. Потенциально красивая игра, которая оборачивается текстурами уровня PS 2 (порой даже хуже). Но это игра, чья гениальность не знает границ, чьи наработки можно использовать для создания шедевра и чей сюжет по проработанности не уступает (а порой даже превосходит) множество признанных детективных триллеров. Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut, самая неоднозначная игра в истории человечества.

Завязка следующая: в тихом небольшом городке Гринвейл двое детей находят труп женщины со вспоротым животом, которая подвешена на дереве. Для расследования приезжает агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган, ведь подобные убийства уже случались в различных местах мира. Наона въезде в город, агент попадает в аварию. Оказавшись в глухом лесу, Йорк сталкивается со странными существами, похожими на людей, которые атакуют его. Да и странная персона с топором и в красном дождевике не внушает доверия. Какие ещё тайны скрывает этот маленький городок?

Сюжет моментально интригует и не отпускает до самого конца. Начинаясь как наследница идей ""Твин Пикса"", игра постепенно перерастает в нечто настолько большее, что Хичкоку и не снилось, что уж говорить о каком-нибудь Алане Вейке. Каждое новое убийство - кровавое произведение искусства, смерть ещё никогда не была подана в играх столь будоражуще и восхищающе. Само же расследование выглядит свежо и необычно. Оно ссылается на события прошлого, достаёт многочисленные скелеты их шкафов персонажей и ни на секунду не теряет интереса и привлекательности.

Не стоит забывать и о персонажах, которые составляют половину колорита местной истории. Тут вам и шериф, который встал на путь хранителя порядка из-за побоев от родной мамы. И его помощница, приехавшая в город лишь во время окончания учебы и чувствующая некую отстранённость от остальных. И ещё один полицейский, плачущий по поводу убийств и восхитительно готовящий. Местные люди, которые сначала кажутся шаблонными, постепенно раскрываются с новых сторон, удивляя и даже шокируя. 

Отдельного внимание заслуживает главный герой. Агент Йорк, пожалуй, заслуживает звание самого оригинального служителя закона в мире, потеснив даже Феникса Райта и Макса Пейна. Он много и безумно стильно курит, совершенно не берёт в расчёт своих коллег, гадает на кофейной гуще, рассуждает о панк-роке и фильмах класса B. И конечно же, разговаривает с Заком. Кто такой Зак? Ещё один вопрос, сокрытый в Гринвейле.

И могла бы эта игра стать классикой, если бы не одно маленькое ""но"". Местный геймплей просто ужасен.  Большую часть времени мы отстреливаем монстров в местном аналоге параллельного мира. Сей процесс навевает воспоминания о РЕ 4, только об удобстве игры Миками стоит забыть. Зона прицеливания ограничена небольшим прямоугольником, словно у главного героя на сгибаются руки. Враги однообразны, оружие словно игрушечное. Порой приходится убегать от пресловутого Убийцы в Дождевике. Оформлено это в виде мини-игры с множеством QTE. Утомляет даже сильнее основного процесса, но вносит должное разнообразие.

Но если вы преодолеете все преграды на пути сюжета, вас ожидает по-настоящему прекрасная концовка. Подумать только: за одни лишь титры она почти доведёт вас до слёз, затем заставит мурашки пройтись по вашей спине, а под конец и вовсе задуматься. А самая последняя сцена оставляет финал открытым, позволяя игроку самому додумать, чем же всё окончилось. 

Пару слов о технической части. С графикой всё ясно по скриншота - она хуже некуда. Зато музыка, словно в контраст, превосходна. она разнообразна, но самодостаточна, даже вне контекста звучит отлично. её не жаль и купить, благо в комплекте с игрой она стоит всего 50 рублей.

В конечном счёте, мы получили самую спорную видеоигру в мире. Её геймплей содержит множество новаторских находок, но их реализация просто ужасна, что очень печально. Ведь ничего похожего на Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut нет и, видимо, никогда не будет. Это уникальный игровой опыт, который не сравнится ни с чем. А история (подумать только!) может потягаться с To The Moon и Silent Hill 2. Тут у нас действительно тот случай, когда лучше один раз попробовать, чем сто раз услышать. А вот будете ли вы плеваться от данного блюда или насытитесь им сполна - целиком ваш выбор.

Ездить и разговаривать, было вроде прикольно.

- смотрим катсцену заново
- успеваем нажать первую кнопку
- не успеваем нажать вторую

Ultimately, it fails on all levels. The setup of the story is actually pretty good. It's obviously biting off Twin Peaks. A weirdo FBI agent is sent to investigate a murder with supernatural overtones in a small town filled with wacky characters. The obvious inspirations for the game play are Silent Hill and Resident Evil. There are parts where a location transforms into a twisted nightmare version of the place and its filled with monsters and the player has to make their way through the nightmare version of the location to find clues to help the investigation. So, the combat takes place really in the protagonists mind. The combat gets really repetitive and boring really quick. There's really just one type of enemy to fight for most of the game besides bosses. Later there's another type that's even more boring and repetitive to fight. Every location ends up being the same thing. To gather the necessary clues you gotta wade through a series of narrow corridors fighting the same boring enemies over and over again. The combat is really clunky too like a Resident Evil game. There is one interesting part of this, though. At some point the legendary supernatural killer of the story, The Raincoat Killer, will track you down and the screen splits so you can also see through the killers eyes and your own point of view simultaneously. You need to hide from  him for a certain amount of time before he gives up and goes away. Usually, right after this section there will be a chase sequence that's kind of like an on-rails quick time event where you need to escape from The Raincoat Killer.  These encounters were fun the first few times, but even these interesting parts get repetitive as they are used over and over again. So, the actual combat portion of this game is a big dud. There's also a lot of driving that needs to be done in this game. It is also no fun. The cars handle terribly and they can even run out of gas. This is supposed to be an open-world exploration adventure game, but the fuel tank keeps a leash on you so its an annoying concern that made me not want to even bother with exploring the environment. Really, all there is anyway is some random collectibles to find littered around and also some side quests. So, the driving portion is also not any fun. The PC version is a really bad port too. It crashes ALL the time. I lost several hours to stupid crashes that can and will strike at any time. There was even one cut scene that would guaranteed crash the game. I had to change the compatibility mode and some other options to get past this stupid bug. The game is originally capped at 30 fps and 720p. Ridiculous! The same guy that fixed this outrage for Dark Souls did a fix for Deadly Premonition too, but like the DS one, it seems like it just plain wears off after a while and the game reverts back to shitty graphics and frame rate.  I had to re-start the final boss because the game was running so horribly it wouldn't even register inputs from the controller. One thing I did find at least amusing is that if you don't have your clothes cleaned every so often, flies will start buzzing around your character because of your stinky clothes. I got a chuckle of watching cut scenes where these big fat (white?) flies were swarming around this guy. Now to the story. The setup is intriguing. There's a serial killer on the loose which brings the FBI to the small town and while there, more people get murdered. I was hooked on the setup. However, once the story starts to explain what's going on and who is behind everything the story just falls completely apart. It's just plain retarded. It's like a ten year old's idea of a murder mystery. It's unbelievably bad. It's so dumb! I'm shocked and baffled that this story isn't completely ripped apart by everyone that has reviewed this absurd game. This game is also not scary, AT ALL. It fails in that department too. On the technical, atmosphere, narrative, and game play levels this game fails across the board and I definitely recommend you avoid this game.",1422662057,1422662057,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS

105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.

I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)

Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a ""bad port"". No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!



HOW TO GET IT TO RUN

In order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to ""repair"" its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)

Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to ""Ultra"" in that file, the graphics will crash.)

Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.

In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.

As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes.
First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.

Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.

If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.

However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.",1422657671,1423999172,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Technically, [i]DP[/i] is a charlie foxtrot
It's ugly, and crashes a lot

You'll have to wrestle with it to play
Set compatibility and back up your saves

The port to mouse is cause to frown
York can aim neither up nor down

It makes attempts to be realistic
But lays the uncanny valley effect on thick

E.g., a map to some godforsaken hole
Costs 71 times the fine for destroying a telephone pole

And you can subsist on cans of tomato paste
Open them first?  But that would be a waste!

The presence of zombies is never explained
(Save that without them, revenue might not be gained)

Gameplay has a few minor flaws
Like the crazy handling when driving cars

Even so, if you're playing for the story
Buy it (on sale); you won't be sorry

You control a federal investigator
Tracking a supernatural serial killer

The fourth wall is cleverly under attack
York is schizo, and thinks you're his friend Zach

You'll travel to a small town and meet the residents
Who have lives of their own (and don't always make sense)

Question them, and learn the local folklore
Might it be real and connected to the recent gore?

You'll find there's more to this case than meets the eye
If at the Raincoat Killer's hands you don't die

Still, no need to rush in investigating the deaths
Goodness knows, there's always time for sidequests

That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldn’t miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.

In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and it’s up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the town’s biggest case yet.

Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.

The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where “an ingenious law school student raped over 800 victims” to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think you’ve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.

Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, it’s also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however it’s worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.

Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.

When you’re not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, you’ll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesn’t get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While you’re shooting enemies you may encounter the “Raincoat Killer” who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesn’t find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.

I think I should also mention the graphics; they won’t impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.

Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole “so bad it’s good” tactic perfectly.

It’s nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.

The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, it’s like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.

After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.

However I think it’s now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you don’t have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.

If you’re curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: “Deadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. It’s perverse, it’s wrong, and yet it’s so fucking funny.”

There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.

there is a lot to do
has the classic intentional bad dialogue
some rather strange humor
a horror aspect in an open world

Deadly Premonition - это противоречивое, неоднозначное, но в своем роде шедевральное творение SWERY 65, он же Хидетака Суэхиро. Неоднозначной ее делает геймплей, про который лучше вообще забыть. Здесь намешано всего от множества игр, вроде механики стрельбы из Резидента, которая ну очень неудобная, сбор улик, вроде L.A. noire, но в очень упрощенном виде. Через геймплей, через множество багов, глюков и вылетов, через плохую графику стоит пройти ради сюжета, ради персонажей, ради истории.

Это безумие и красота. Настоящее произведение искусства. Полет творческой мысли. Японская психоделика вкупе с ""Твин Пиксом"" Дэвида Линча - и на выходе получается яркий, сочный, ударяющий в голову коктейль. Я жалею лишь о том, что не познакомился с Гринвейлом раньше, на консоли, например.

Deadly Premonition стала для меня сюрпризом. Купленная полгода назад и сыгранная всего пару часов, она пылилась в моей библиотеке ожидая лучших времен. И вот, завершив сессию, я решил немного поиграть в нее. 
С самого начала, вам в глаза будут бросаться различные минусы игры. Скудная анимация, не совсем удобное прицеливание, ужасное поведение автомобиля на дороге, некоторые затянутые эпизоды(вроде предпоследней битвы с финальным боссом, представляющей собой QTE раннер) , и самое главное, большое количество зависаний и вылетов из игры. Но мне было плевать на все это, к управлению я привык, а руководства из сообщества прекрасно помогают в борьбе с багами. Запустив игру, я решил что просто пробегу сюжетку и удалю ее.... 
А потом я понял что увлекся сайдквестами и завис во второй главе на 30 часов. Просто пройдя пару-тройку из них, вас затянет надолго. Жители городка, в котором происходит действие игры, придерживаются простенькой симуляции жизни. Днем работают, а по ночам, и в дождь(почему, узнаете по сюжету) сидят дома. Квесты несложны и интересны, а кое какие награды сильно облегчат прохождение. 
Но самая сильная сторона игры, конечно же, сюжет. В тихом городке, Гринвейл, убивают местную девушку, и на расследование этого дела отправляют харизматичного агента ФБР Френсиса Йорка Моргана. Завязка кажется банальной, нечто подобное мы вроде бы видели много раз. И несмотря на убийство, первая глава кажется какой то жизнерадостной, солнечный город, веселенькая музыка с насвистыванием(ее надо слышать), забавный юмор. Первое время недоумеваешь, зачем это в хоррор-детективе. А под конец понимаешь, что таким образом, разработчик вас расслаблял, чтобы потом вылить на вас все хитросплетения сюжета. И катаясь в очередной раз по городу, и общаясь с жителями, вы сильнее почувствуете упадок местного настроения. Сюжет начинает раскрываться, обрастать деталями, и в конце концов выливается в грустную и трогательную развязку. Радует так же и множество отсылок, на такие произведения как Твин-Пикс, Молчание Ягнят, Resident Evil и Silent Hill.
Я привык к персонажам, к музыке и юмору. И жаль что игра закончилась, надеюсь что когда нибудь появится продолжение.
Deadly Premonition, игра не для всех. Вы, как я и другие прошедшие, должны закрыть глаза на недочеты графики и баги. И только тогда, вы увидите положительные стороны, и возможно так же надолго увязнете в этой драме, и все таки узнаете, кто же убил Анну Грэм?

Before I begin, just on this review. I have played this game for more than the clocked 9 hours, but apparently Steam does not register this during offline-mode. I 100%'ed the game in about 20-25 hours.

Deadly Premonition is great and terrible at the same time.
The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the sidequests are almost all gems and when you're in the zone this game becomes rather addictive.
On the other hand, the PC version of this game is riddled with bugs. Terrible, game-crashing bugs. If you look online you'll find some fixes, but even after following everything recommended, the game will still crash after about three hours of playing.
The problem lies in the memory management. if you unlock the game to use the maximum amount of RAM it takes longer for the game to crash. The way to play with the least amount of frustration is to restart your PC the moment the game starts lagging.
Had I not already owned the game before learning of this, I might have passed it over, but even with getting thrown out of the game two to three times per playing session, I still loved it.
The graphics are not bad and neither is the sound. the controls are rather intuitive and combat is fairly smooth.

Good thigs about this video game:
1. Main story is a masterpiece full of mystery and weird things. (Greenvale town is a strange place)
2. The characters are so spectacular you can find crazy guys, tough guys even a horny Woman who try to seduce you.
3. Side quest mission are so funny.

Bad things about this video game:
1. The graphics looks like 128-bit era. 
2. Bad really bad pc port sometimes crash over and over again and you need to restart your computer. 
3. Only 720p is this a joke ?? but don't worry you can solve it with DPfix.

So if you like video games like resident evil or similars (survival horror games)  I can tell you this you will enjoy this one just like me off course you must have a lot of patience because you know the glitches about this game can be a pain in the ass  so I hope this little review may help you",1420905855,1420905855,True,31,4,0.709259390830993652,0,False,False,False,False,,,

La trama di base è molto semplice, Francis York Morgan si reca nella cittadina sperduta di Greenvale per risolvere un cruento caso di omicidio che si ricollega ad altri casi già da lui seguiti. E stop. Non vi serve sapere altro, la storia di DP sarà un vortice di colpi di scena, personaggi fuori di testa ed il tutto condito da un intreccio narrativo che vi terrà incollati alla sedia. Adorerete York, e senza accorgervene sarete veramente appassionati alle sue vicende, con la voglia di andare avanti per scovare un ennessimo tassello del puzzle.

In breve ecco i due difetti (secondo me gravi) che possono pregiuducare l'esperienza:

gioco che si blocca di continuio (almeno con la mia configurazione), in 18 ore di gioco avrò avuto una cinquantina di blocchi, sia la patch che la mod che ho provato non hanno risolto definitivamente il problema!

mira limitata: sia usando il pad che il mouse non è possibile mirare ""tutto"" in alto o ""tutto"" in basso, la mira è limitata, per fortuna esiste il tasto per la mira automatica, ad ogni modo (avendolo finito per 360) ho paura che il boss finale (che richiede la visuale completa per la mira) mi possa dare dei problemi!! (per gli oggetti che si trovano sopra gli alberi, visto che non è possibile mirare così in alto, utilizzo un tubo o una pala, un colpo all'albero e l'oggetto cade, per fortuna si può andare avanti anche con questo problema).

Detto questo ecco i miei tre consigli su questo gioco:

1° se potete, prendetelo in versione PS3 (in versione Director's Cut), ne vale la pena, storia eccellente che vi incolla allo schermo (vi dimenticherete della pessima grafica dopo poche ore di gioco), questo gioco è un diamante grezzo!

2° in alternativa prendetelo per 360 (in versione normale), anche questa versione merita di essere giocata!!

3° ultima possibilità, prendetelo per PC ma SOLO ad un prezzo ridicolo (io l'ho preso a 3€), mettete in conto che con il vostro PC potrebbe non girare come si deve (su un altro PC manco si avviava, con questo almeno, blocchi a parte è giocabile).

Il gioco in se è un capolavoro!! (anche se tecnicamente fa davvero pena...) purtroppo questa conversione è pessima.

NON COMPRATE LA VERSIONE PC se avete la possibilità di giocarlo per PS3 o 360!!!

Se invece come me non avete la PS3 o la 360 e volete cmq giocare questo strepitoso titolo, ecco alcuni piccoli consigli:

per entrambi i files (il launcher e quello che lancia il gioco), impostare la compatibilità per Windows 98 (i files si chiamano DP e DPLauncher)

provate a far partire il gioco direttamente dal file DP (senza far partire il launcher). 

Con uno e entrambi questi metodi, il problema della visuale sembra risolto anche se nel mio caso mi ritrovo alcuni problemi di audio sfasato!! I blocchi continuano ad esserci, pertanto il mio consiglio è quello di salvare SEMPRE, ogni volta che ne avete l'opportunità!! 
Fortunatamente i blocchi sono random, poche volte accadono nello stesso momento (solo una volta ho dovuto rifare una zona 4 volte!!!!).

Плюсы игры:
- Достаточно неплохой сюжет, для тех кто ценит темы безумия, игр разума +мистику.
- Есть любопытная система симуляции жизни. Вам нужно есть, спать, бриться, отдавать одежду в стирку, добираться по городу самому, как влюбой игре с открытым миром. 
- Какой-никакой эллемент хоррора (монстры напомнили мне призраков из Silent Hill 4).

Минусы:
- Видимо ограниченый бюджет игры и, как следствие, ужасная реализация всего... + особености японского подхода к играм. Графика, геймплей - все ужасно, но терпимо.

Jak tak, to i ta gra powinna, gdyż widać, że mocno wzorowana jest na tym arcydziele Davida Lyncha i Marka Frosta. Oczywiście nie tylko. Mechanika gry przypomina trochę tą z ""Resident evil 4"", nie da się nie zauważyć też smaczków z mojej ulubionej serii gier ""Silent Hill"".
W Deadly Premonition wcielasz się w detektywa FBI Francisa Yorka Morgana, ale mów mu York, każdy tak go nazywa. York przyjeżdża do małego amerykańskiego miasteczka Greenvale, by rozwiązać tajemniczą sprawę morderstwa młodej dziewczyny - Anny. No zaczyna się mniej więcej jak Twin Peaks. W trakcie pobytu w Greenvale poznamy wielu jego mieszkańców, każda postać ma swój unikatowy charakter, każda jest dziwna i tajemnicza. Postacie naprawdę są świetnie napisane, co chwila będziemy podejrzewać kogoś innego.
Gra jest sandboxem, mamy dużą ilość misji pobocznych, bardzo ciekawych z resztą. Dzięki nim możemy bardziej poznać mieszkańców tego miasteczka. Naprawdę przyjemnie mi się je robiło. Mechanika gry, tu mówię głównie o walce, jest trochę sztywna. Przypomina poniekąd tą z wcześniej wspomnianego ""Resident Evil 4"". Miedzy innymi, gdy celujemy to nie możemy się poruszać. Naprawdę na pierwszy rzut oka co niektórzy mogliby się znięchęcić, ale naprawdę sugeruję by pograć dłużej. Graficznie gra przypomina trochę erę Playstation 2, aczkolwiek postacie są ładnie zrobione to juz animacje trochę sztywnawe, a o dziwo jak już trochę pograłem to mi się zaczęło podobać. Klimat gry jest naprawdę mocny, a sprawa morderstwa z epizodu na epizod robi się coraz ciekawsza. Podczas rozgrywki natrafimy na ""Otherworld"" co jest właśnie zapożyczone z serii ""Cichego Wzgórza"", w którym przyjdzie nam mierzyć się ze złowrogimi przeciwnkiami, którzy kojarzyli mi się z Ganados z ""RE4"". Warto poruszyć sprawę portu PCtowego, cóż najlepszy nie jest. Jest trochę błędów, ale każdy da się naprawić lub sprawić by do nich nie dochodziło. Rozdzielczość jest zablokowana na 720p co pewnie wielu osobom będzie przeszkadzać, ackzolwiek mi nie. Dla mnie to nie ma większego znaczenia. Ostatni element gry o którym chcę wspomnieć to ścieżka dźwiękowa, która jest w skrócie po prostu piękna. Tak, piękna. Naprawdę przyjemna dla uszu i nadająca klimatu do gry. Wystarczy posłuchać chociażby ""The Woods and The Goddess"", które przygrywa w menu głównym. :]

En mi caso, pasó lo segundo y tengo que decir que es una de las historias mejores contadas dentro del mundo del videojuego, es original y sobre todo te mantiene intrigado hasta el final sacando tus propias conclusiones incluso con solo observar la rutina que llevan día a día los personajes.

Respecto a la jugabilidad, es mala, así de simple,  el personaje se mueve muy extraño, recuerda un poco a esos juegos de PSX o N64 en sus primeras incursiones al 3D, si mueves la cámara al mismo tiempo que al personaje parece que pierde desenfoque, el carro se maneja muy mal aunque conforme avanzas en el juego tienes la posibilidad de conseguir vehiculos mejores, graficamente es bastante discutible, muchos diran que parece de la generación de PS2 (cómo si eso fuese malo) pero los modelados e interiores a mi me parecen bastante competentes, cosa aparte ya son los exteriores cómo los árboles o lo coches pero cómo no suelo fijarme en el aspecto gráfico para evaluar un videojuego pues tampoco presté mucha atención en este aspecto.

Algo que me encanta de este juego es su originalidad, a pesar de lo que se pueda ver en las imágenes, no es un sandbox al uso ni mucho menos un shooter, y el hecho de que de inicio ya cuentes con una pistola con munición ilimitada ya dice mucho de lo que pretende el juego. Puedes andar a tu bola por el pueblo y tienes repartidas por todas partes un monton de misiones secundarias (la gran mayoria de ellas solo aparecen bajo condiciones especiales cómo por ejemplo de ciertos horarios o solo en días lluviosos) , la gran parte de ellas tienen que ver poco o mucho con la investigación de la trama principal y cómo he dicho antes, puedes incluso resolver el misterio de la trama en base a pistas que arrojan las misiones secundarias y las actitudes que tienen las personas del pueblillo. Esto creo que es algo que muuuuy pocas veces se ha visto en otro juegos.

El inicio es ESPANTOSO, no puede haber una peor primera impresión, te muestra precisamente las peores caras del juego que son la faceta shooter, el sonido muy pobre (incluyendo los efectos sonoros de unas ardillas que ya lo vereis por vuestra cuenta), los efectos de impacto tan poco creibles y esos arboles tan feos de los que antes he hablado. Si eres capaz de resistir esa primera media hora de juego, os aseguro que el juego os atrapará con todo lo que viene.

Otro aspecto muy curioso y que desata polémica es la banda sonora, es otra de esas cosas que hace única al juego, la mayoría de pistas se repiten cómo el ajo y en muchas ocasiones te quedas con cara de wtf? cuando de la nada aparece una melodía que poco o nada tiene que ver con el momtno que se vive en el juego. Esto ya es muy subjetivo pero tengo que decir que la banda sonora me fascina, sobre todo el tema The Goddess y el del silbidito que tan famoso es.

En resumen, es un buen juego, un grandioso juegos que suple de lleno algunas carencias con mushisimas bondades, si eres amante de las buenas historias, de las historias originales y de las tramas bien contadas, este definitivamente es tu juego.",1419958709,1419958709,True,8,0,0.626436829566955566,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.

+ Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.

+ The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.

+ The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).

- The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting ""monsters"" was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.

may contain spoilers

Note: The review has been made director's cut, not for original version.

So Deadly premonition (also known as Red Seeds Profile)  is open world, survival horror by Rising star games. Originally deadly premonition was released on Xbox 360, but later Rising star games wanted to do Playstation and Pc version, se they made Director's cut. 

Gameplay
 So This game has so terrible controls. Like if you want shoot, you need to press spacebar, before you can start shoot on mouse button. Cars are so difficulty to manage, because they don't wanna turn into where you want. Cars are like big tin can XD

Graphics 
graphics are by far the weakest side of the game. The game has been made in 2010, but grapics are Worst than Grand theft auto III on playstation 2, really.  pixel mush everywhere, trees, grass, cars. Houses...

Story 
Deadly premontion Protagonist Is FBI special Agent Francis York Morgan, also known by scarface :D Story is based on the study of the murder with sheriff and his assistant, Emily. Place, where Game is based is Rural town of Greenvale, Washington. Most Things  I liked the fact that all of the game's characters are well-Personal, But stranges. characters in the club get to familiarize yourself with wise :D

 short, the game is crap for the graphics, clumsy, but very story-based.
In fact, I liked the game very much, but i know alot peoples, who said like : This is The worst game what i'm ever played :D

This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010.  It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.

Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.

Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.

This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the ""quirky dialogue"" as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.",1419548344,1420410762,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country. 

To preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.

TL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.",1419540271,1419540271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Come tutti i port ha i soliti difetti, se siete abituati a:
- problemi di frame rate 
- assenza di impostazioni video
allora, potrete anche passarci qualche oretta.

Per il fix potete trovare una discussione nel forum di steam della versione DPfix 0.9.5, che contiene un link al sito dell'autore del fix, e il link per scaricare il file zip del fix :

Come si utilizza il fix DPfix 0.9.5:
- Estraete i file contenuti nel DPfix 0.9.5
- Entrate nella cartella di Steam la mia è installata sotto ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam )
- Entrate nella cartella ""SteamApps"" ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\)
- Entrate nella cartella ""common"" al cui interno troverete la lista delle cartelle dei giochi installati su steam ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common)
- Cercate ed entrate nella cartella ""Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut""
- Copiate i file estratti da DPfix 0.9.5 nella cartella ""Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut""
- Aprite il file ""DPfix.ini"" (uno dei file appena copiati) con il blocco note o un altro editor di testo.
- Modificate i parametri contenuti nel file seguendo le istruzioni precedute dal simbolo ""#"" ( Consiglio di saltare questo passaggio inizialmente e avviare il gioco per provare cosa succede, inoltre alcuni cambiamenti non sono ancora stabili quindi consiglio di cambiare inizialmente solo la risoluzione e poi provare con gli altri ).
- Se dovesse crashare a modalità schermo intero impostate window mode ( il mio a finestra intera non si avvia)
- Avviare il gioco.

Se il fix vi da problemi per toglierlo basta eliminare i file copiati nella cartella del gioco.

Se volete modificare la risoluzione di gioco dovete aprire il file ""DPfix.ini"" e sulle prime righe modificare i parametri renderWidth e renderHeight. IMPORTANTE: Accertatevi di impostare dei valori corretti, perché altrimenti potrebbe non avviarsi, esiste una risoluzione massima per cui il gioco dovrebbe funzionare.
  
Ho riportato una parte del file con le mie impostazioni grafiche ho settato anche presentWidth e presentHeight a 600 e 480 perché continuava a crashare all'avvio, provate ad avviare il gioco in modalità schermo intero o finestra per vedere se cambia qualcosa nel caso desse problemi (un po' bassine :>)

It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.

The truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass (""smoking"" in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.

If you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the ""savedata"" folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.

Barring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.

However, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.

The minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.

The more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.

The game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.

Sidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.

To wrap this review up and summarize the main points:

[CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.

[CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.

[CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities


[PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.

[PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too

[PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game

[PRO] Decent sidequests and minigames


All in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.",1419299841,1419299898,False,26,0,0.623799800872802734,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't play Sandbox games, and I played this a recommendation from a friend. I had no idea what to expect, and went in with almost zero expectations. The game, in short, is a mixed bag. It's plagued with coding errors, bugs and is a rather mediocre port. I highly recommend researching into this title to see if your computer can run it and avoid most of the glitches/crashes. I also recommend resetting if you ever come across any glitches or crashes, as this, for whatever reason, fixes a majority of them.

Gameplay wise? It's kind like No More Heroes overworld (with dynamic time and weather) meets closed off extremely easy Resident Evil 4 sections. Actually most of the game is very easy, and saves are sprinkled everywhere (which helps with any crashes so save often). You'll probably spend the bulk of your time in the overworld, driving around the town. You'll interact with the townsfolk (If you've played Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii, this game also has a system where the NPCs have their own schedules. It's much easier to find people however, and are infinitely more rememberable however) and try to gather information to piece together what's happening. The shooting segments are pretty straight-forward and there's not really any major puzzles or anything to solve. The enemies aren't hugely varied either, once you play a few you got the general gist of them.

Setting and story wise: If you're a fan of the short lived TV series Twin Peaks, the plot's basic premise is very similar: an unothordox FBI agent is sent to investigate the death and murder of a young girl, and finds a lot more. Cast is unothrodox and strange, as they are rememberable. It's definitely a ride, highs and lows. There's some cliches, and big bad is a little too obvious, but ultimately it doesn't detract from the fun.

I bought this for 2.50 and put something like 30 hours into it, so there's plenty of content and the entry fee is very reasonable. This game is definitely a mixed bag, but speaking a gameplay centric kind of player, the story engrossed me and warmed my heart. It was geniunely refreshing to play this game, headaches and all.

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
As you most likely see in the other reviews for this game:  [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] itself is quite enjoyable, but bugs and crashes can quickly sour the taste of the experience.  I, however, mostly enjoyed the game so I wanted to give it a ""Thumbs Up.""  If you approach the game the right way then you can really minimalize the impact of the crashes.

The game is a moderately open-word survival horror game.  The controls are a little clunky, especially the driving, but I suppose it fits the genre.  The music is whimsical and the dialogue is funny, if not at times very corny... but again the corny lines fit with the genre and the ""bad horror movie from the 80s"" type vibe the game gives off.  The story is enjoyable and intriguing.  A fun little aspect is that the game does it best to make the small town of Greenvale feel lived in.  That is to say:  each NPC moves around the town depending on the time of day, and the weather—so you may have to search for them accordingly.  The graphics are not very good, but they aren't [i]that[/i] bad.  There is a user-created mod that can improve the visuals.  

As mentioned, the bad side of the game really boils down to bugs and crashing.  Now as for bugs, I didn't really experience any ""bugs"" when I played, I did experience crashing, however.  But really, it wasn't [i]that[/i] bad.  Here is some advice:  check out the “stickied” thread about troubleshooting.  Make sure to repair PhysX.  I personally did [i]not[/i] install DPfix (which is a user-created, unofficial mod) because it only fixes visuals (which don’t bother me) and it may actually cause more problems than it fixes.  Lastly, be sure to save [i]often[/i].  Like: even if you just saved 5 minutes ago, if you reach another save point, save again.  This way if and when you get a crash, you don't have to replay a ton of gameplay.  This will help make the crashes a minor annoyance rather than a game-destroying problem.

There are also 50 side-quests in the game which actually offer rewards that are valuable in the main campaign—so you may find yourself wanting to do them even if you don’t care about achievements or “completionism.”  Many guides and such will recommend you do the side-quests during chapter-replays... I however, recommend you try to do as many as you can during initial playthroughs of a chapter.  This is because during a chapter-replay you can't save until you finish the replay, which may cause you to lose some progress if you encounter one of the aforementioned crashes.  If you try to do as many side-quests as you can during initial playthroughs, you will be free to save often preventing progress loss.  Some side-quests will require replays to do, simply because of the mechanics… for those I recommend chapter 7, because you can quickly end the chapter-replay, save, and then start it up again to do more side-questing.  Then just rinse and repeat until you’ve done everything… that’s how I did the side-quests and the occasional crashes were endurable.

In summary, the game is good, and worth the experience... in my opinion.  This is especially so if you enjoy the genre, or enjoy heavily story-driven games.  It will require some troubleshooting and some tolerance for bugs/crashing.  If you decide to follow my advice, and do a little planning and save often, the crashes that you will encounter won't set you back that badly, and you will probably enjoy the overall experience of the game.

This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and ""jank"" that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.

Over all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from ""Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling"" or ""pffft that zombies running sideways."" Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.

This games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the ""two best friends play"" of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.

It has a quirky but nice story, moving quickly from serious moments to joking ones in seconds.  It relies in a lot of cut scenes giving a feeling of playing a series like Twin peaks or anything related to that. It uses supernatural events in the story telling, not trying to be 100% real.

Gameplay:

The game is mostly a sandbox where you can do side missions and follow people in their normal lives.  
You may drive cars, eat and sleep.

Establishments and people work at determined hours.  Trying to get at a bar at the morning will be of no use neither going to the store at midnight.  All the missions are for research purposes and they are linear.  When in a mission at a place there are usually spirits/ghosts that roam around.  It somewhat reminded me of Silent Hill. The villain usually haunts those places too and there are sequences hiding, 
running and QTE.

Shooting is inspired in resident evil, where you stay in the same place shooting but this one is strange to handle with K+M. Melee items will break according to use but for combat they serve almost no purpose.  If you are looking for a shooter/combat game this is not the place.

Item management is very bad; you cannot change items from the box to the inventory.  Dropping items will simply disappear. You cannot sell items, only buy.  Almost any action you do grants you money such as shaving, saving, driving long distances.

Time to finish: 24 hours
Around 15 in game playtime

Technical aspect:

The game has a lot of bugs. A really bad port.  You will need to use guides in order to fix the bug but I will simply mention the ones I faced. For a general guide visit 

http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut

First, the game failed to run. I needed the game to be Run as Administrator, add some files to the directories for mods and SweetFX in order to fix contrast.  Driving a lot of time in the open (20 minutes I think) causes the game to crash, this is before the next bug; in a mission it failed and the game crashed, finding a guide led me to use CFF explorer and incremented the memory.  Now it does not crash.

Support for controllers any than xbox 360 is nonexistent.  Using x360ce is somewhat tricky but I could not get it to work so I simply used K+M.

Graphics are kinda bad (this game is from 2010 originally) and it was a budget game ($20 dlls on release).  They look like the first games for the 7th generation (xbox 360, ps3) or late 6th generation (GCN, ps2), whatever you prefer.  expressions for the characters are rendered manually and no motion capture was used.

Et cet objet volant non identifié qu'est Deadly Premonition n'est pas passé inaperçu. Le bébé de SWERY  provoqué à la fois dégout et admiration chez les joueurs, sans jamais parvenir à trouver un juste milieu. Car DP est un jeu bourré de petits défauts en veux-tu en voilà mais aux (quelques) qualités énormes.

Pêle-mêle on pourra citer un aspect technique digne d'un jeu PS2 mal branlé, un gameplay très rigide et redondant (vous savez, le fameux balais dans-le-cul, avec en prime une accélération matérielle de la souris rendant la visée fastidieuse), des animations complètements datés (mais qui ont le mérite de provoquer quelques fous-rires), une conduite désastreuse, des temps de chargements omniprésent, blablabla.... La liste est longue. Le tout n'a pas été rehaussé par le portage PC, bien au contraire. Bienvenue à la foire aux crashs, en direct de l'Other World! (heureusement un patch existe). Mais alors, pourquoi jouer à ce qui ressemble plus à une mauvaise blague qu'un véritable jeu vidéo ?

Eh bien tout simplement parce que Deadly Premonition est une expérience à faire au moins une fois dans sa vie de gamer, malgré la foule de désagrements que cela imcombe. Ce qui vous attend, c'est un scénario terriblement bien construit et qui, une fois lancé, vous tiendra en haleine jusqu'au grand final. Un savant dosage de mise en scène et de rebondissements, le tout porté par des personnages hors du commun et unique en leur genre, à commencer par Francis York Morgan, le charismatique agent du FBI que vous incarnez dans son périple (et son grand ami Zach, très très très proche de lui (le nombre de ""très"" n'est pas là pour faire joli)). L'univers dans lequel évolue toute cette joyeuse troupe n'est pas en reste lui non plus, puisqu'il vous sera possible de visiter Greenvale de fond en comble, et même de participer à la vie locale tel un bon citoyen, en allant par exemple manger un sandwich au restaurant, vous raser et changer de vetements à l'hotel, réaliser quelques parties de pèches près du lac, proposer votre aide aux habitants sous forme de quetes secondaires (qui vous rapporteront parfois de jolis récompenses et meme peut-etre quelques informations intéressantes pour votre enquete), jouer aux fléchettes au bar du coin le soir, etc... Mais attention, il faudra veiller à respecter les horaires d'ouverture/fermeture de chaque établissement et certaines quetes secondaires ne sont accessibles qu'a des heures spécifiques de la journée. De même, certaines maisons resteront fermées à des heures tardives ou quand le propriétaire sera tout simplement à son travail. Plusieurs jauges seront à surveiller également : faim, sommeil, jauge d'essence et taux  d'endommagement du véhicule utilisé. En clair, le jeu est un véritable pot-pourri d'idées plutot bien pensées et un véritable mélange de genres. On aime ou pas, mais on ne peut lui enlever ce mérite.

Deadly Premonition est un jeu étrange, repoussant au début (le prologue n'est absolument pas représentatif de la valeur réelle du jeu) mais qu'on se surprend à aimer petit à petit.

Gave this another try since i finally got me an xbox controller for my pc (keyboard+mouse controls like ass) and they switched the controls around and actually made em worse. Great.

Then the ""HD"" treatment. Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent. 

Additionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.

[B]Performance[/B]:
Extremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run.

You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading! [B]There are countless super-long invisible loading times![/B]

Aber hier hat man 2D Feuer zum begrenzen von Gebieten, das ist gerade mal PS2 Niveau (und wir reden von einem 2013er Titel für 30€).

Die Story ist wie ein Gewürfel aus Silent Hill, Akte X, bisschen Mystery aus Twin Peaks und Alan Wake. Leider gabs das alles schon und vorallem besser: Nämlich in den Originalen.

Gepaart wird das von ENDLOSEN Videosequenzen in denen nur wenig gesprochen wird. Japanisches Spiel halt.

Steuerung ist durchaus okay. Waffen ist alles vertreten, sogar das aus Silent Hill bekannt Stahlrohr.

I'd suggest watching a playthrough like the one from Video Games Awesome or Giant Bomb instead of actually playing the game. It's really not worth the hassle to slog through the gameplay.

I groaned everytime there was an action sequence (I counted around 6). The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny.

เนื้อเรื่อง
Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut เกมที่ว่าด้วยนักสืบพิเศษ (FBI) ที่มีความสามารถพิเศษพูดคุยกับผู้เล่นได้ ทำหน้าที่ตามสืบฆาตกรต่อเนื่องมาถึงชุมชนเล็กๆ ไกลปืนเที่ยงแห่งหนึ่ง พ่อนักสืบคนเก่งจะไขคดีและตามจับตัวคนร้ายได้หรือไม่ ขึ้นอยู่กับคุณแล้ว!!

เกมเพล
Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut เป็นเกมผสม คือมีรูปแบบของซิม, Open world, เกมยิง และเกม RPG ผสมคลุกเค้ากันไป โดยเกมจะมีมุมมองบุคคลที่ 3 เป็นปกติ (เว้นแต่เมื่อขับรถ) ผู้เล่นจะต้องวิ่งไปมาจนทั่วเมืองชนบทแห่งนี้ อาจต้องตามคุยคนนั้นคนนี้บ้าง หรือแม้แต่ไปยังจุดนัดพบตามที่ต่างๆ ในเกมบ้าง เพื่อสืบคดีที่เขากำลังติดตามอยู่ และเมื่อถึงช่วงสืบเสาะในที่เกิดเหตุ ตัวเกมจะตัดเข้าไปสู่โลกจินตนาการ ซึ่งผู้เล่นจะต้องพบกับปีศาจที่เกิดขึ้นในหัวของเขา และเจ้าตัวฆาตกรตัวดีที่เรากำลังตามตัวอยู่ เมื่อผู้เล่นผ่านสิ่งเหล่านี้ไปได้ ตัวละครจะสามารถไขเบาะแสในที่เกิดเหตุได้ 

เนื่องจากเกมนี้ไม่ได้ขาย Action ดังนั้นผู้ที่คาดหวังในตัวเกมนี้ว่าจะต้องบู้บ้าเลือดก็คงต้องบอกว่าเสียใจด้วย เพราะเกมนี้เป็นแนวสืบสวนสอบสวน และเน้นการพูดคุยกับ NPC เป็นส่วนใหญ่เพื่อดำเนินเนื้อเรื่อง ดังนั้นจุดแข็งของเกมนี้จึงอยู่ที่เนื้อเรื่องนั่นเอง (Deadly Premonition ดัดแปลงมาจากนิยายชื่อเดียวกัน) และหากเนื้อเรื่องเข้มข้นเกินไป ผู้เล่นยังสามารถผ่อนคลายด้วยการไปตระเวนเล่นมินิเกมต่างๆ ซึ่งอยู่กระจายทั่วไปในเกมได้อีกด้วย

Here's a few of my favorite bugs and glitches: 

1. Once you reach the hotel and walk into the cafeteria hallway, the sound will give out this blast of distortion that makes your speakers cry out for a quick death. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES. 

2. During the in game cut scenes, York will light a cigarrette, but somebody fucked up the animation so that when he removes the cig from his mouth, one will be in his hand and another will stay in his mouth. 

3. The inventory menu is like a goddamn minefield for crashes. The game crashed on me at least 3 different times when I checked my inventory for either a medikit, some food or just to see the map. The inventory screen will both haunt and mock you. 

4. During the second part of chapter one, while you're in the hospital and you're about to wrap it up after killing 3 zombies who are armed with shotguns, you just need to walk out of the hospital and then a cutscene will start up and you've finished the section. What's the problem with this ? WHENEVER THE FUCKING CUT SCENE STARTS UP, THE GAME CRASHES. Don't give me this ""windows 98 compatibility mode fixed it for me"" bullshit. It worked for me sure, except it took 30 fucking minutes to clear a 2 minute piece of game due to the frame rate drop! 

5. Starting the game up in Windows 98 compatibility mode will prevent you from using a gamepad. Wanna use that nice comfy 360 controller you bought for games like this? Well don't worry, you can use the A, B , X and Y buttons. Oh, you want to use the thumbsticks? Fuck you. 

And those are only off the top of my head! I'm sure if I sat down and really thought about it, I could easily come up with 10 more! 

I was really enjoying this game at first, but the bugs make it unplayable. I managed to make my way through almost through the first chapter but then the game would constantly freeze on me whenever I attempted to make my way through to my objective (the manor where the townspeople are to be questioned). 

Many people claim running the game in Windows ME/98 will fix this. That much is true only half of the time. This theory works when it wants to, at other times however the frame rate will drop all the way down to 10 FPS (what's the point then?) .  I searched high and low for an answer to the drop in frame rate and it seems I'm not the only one suffering from this. No answer could be found. 

Seriously, this game is incredibly unique, cool and different. I wanted to play through this so much, but in its current state, it's just unplayable. It'd be nice to get a refund, but considering that the developers don't care about their customers, and trying to convince Steam to test the products they put up for sale is about as likely as the next coming of Jesus, I find this unlikely. 

Again, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PORT. If you've got a PS3 or 360 just buy that version, I certainly know I will.",1415745294,1415745294,False,2,0,0.481414318084716797,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Es interesanta ver al pirado de York, el protagonista y su alter ego Zach, en momentos como al encontrarse con la pirada de la olla, Sigourney...es un pique de intelectos al mas alto nivel.

Tienes 50 misiones secundarias que realizar, algunas repetidas, casi por mera cuestión de relleno, y logros por cada una de ellas. Tienes algunas actividades que hacer, comer, dormir, cambiarte de ropa y mandar a limpiar tus trajes, pescar y encontrar cromos y huesos a fin de hacerlo todo mas ameno.

El problema radica en la falta de esmero de esta versión, y es que si la juegas sin el DPfix, te sangrarán los ojos. A esto le sumamos los muchos problemas que ha tenido la gente para hacerlo funcionar, aunque no es mi caso, y los cuelgues aleatorios que presenta el producto, totalmente injustificados.

Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should.

Изначально я думал, она будет по типу линейной игры, но нет, после прохождение пролога нам открывается небольшой город Greenvale, полностью открытый для исследования.

Что касается персонажей, то тут все просто отлично. Особенно понравился главный герой : агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган, заядлый курильщик, киноман, страдающий лёгкой шизой по имени Зак (в финале всё станет ясным). Эмили, Джордж, Томас, Гарри и другие персонажи, раскрыты превосходно.

Саундтрек здесь неплохой, но единственное что, его мало, поиграв парочку глав его уже можно разделить на весёленький, загадочный и нагнетающий. Который вставляют абсолютно во все диалоги.

СЮЖЕТ! Сюжет это просто бомба, давненько я не играл в нечто подобное. По началу всё кажется ясным, но игра выдаёт повороты, заставляющие менять свое мнение о персонажах и расследовании. Убийство девушки которое переплетается с местной легендой и тайны которые предстоит открыть в корень меняют жизни тех, кто оказался в этом городишке.

Единственное, что могу сказать по минусам это, однотипные и затянутые встречи с убийцей и по мне с боссами перегнули. Кто-то конечно может отнести к недостаткам и ""ужасную графику"", и деревянное управление, т.к я не грaфoдрoчeр, для меня, это проблемы не составило, что касается управления вполне терпимо.

Геймплейно же самыми близкими будут Dead Rising и Resident Evil.

Игрок выступает в роли агента ФБР, который разговаривает сам с собой, гадает на кофейной гуще и обсуждает фильмы 80х. В свободное от расследования время Йорк (так зовут гг) ловит рыбу, и всячески помогает местным жителям, будь то фасовка коробок или задания уровня принеси-подай.

Под конец все это действо достигает уже какой-то ""финчеровщины"" приправленной японской гигантоманией. Удивительно, но весь этот винегрет выглядит целостно, подается правильно, и оставляет после себя чувство уникального игрового переживания.

Помимо графики есть и другие минусы: абсолютно сбивающая с толку карта, не всегда приятные QTE и нестабильная работа приложения. Хорошо еще, что чекпоинтов и точек сохранения в игре очень много.

Now, I do recommend this game. Just.. not this version. It's a terrible terrible awful port that put me through the whole rigamarole of legit 'fixes' all the way through to superstition (caused by low probabilities and the very human desire to control the situation) 

I've downloaded and implemented DPfix for resolutions and frame rate issues. As well as for controller support. Though I believe that was a real update. 

The real issue is with random and frequent crashing. I've done everything from running it in compatibility mode with Win98 to using a program called Large Address Aware, allowing for the use of more than 2GB's of RAM. Changing audio to only stereo. It still crashes. I've even broken into superstition pressing L-ALT whilst in windowed mode which I'm sure is accomplishing nothing if not negligible results. 

The characters are so dumb, the animations canned and inappropriate. Awkward pauses between nonsense dialogue and its fantastic.  Plus the main character has a voice in his head that breaks the fourth wall (even more so for me as my name is Zach.. spoopy)

I really tried to finish this game, but this port is so unstable and I've replayed missions and rewatched cutscenes for the last time.

The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too. 

It's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.

The point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that ""it's so bad it's good"". This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.

But I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.

It took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.

For the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on.

Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness,
The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold.

So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.

This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.

You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?

Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.

Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain [i]weirdness[/i] of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.

If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.

The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition.

Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.

If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.

Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.

That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable. 

So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.",1414756543,1414756543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра постоянно меняет настроение и местами держит в не слабом напряжении,при этом в следующую секунду отпуская шуточки и подсовывая диалоги в стиле Твин Пикса. 
У героя помимо хп и стамины есть полоска бодрости и сытости,которые необходимо поддерживать,пару раз в день заезжая в кафешки или обедая в участке,ах да,забыл упомянуть - тут открытый мир ! День длится около 8 часов реального времени, при этом сам проматывается по ходу сюжетных миссий. Имеется куча дополнительных заданий,скрытых предметов и ачивок.
Персонажи прописаны довольно хорошо,так что есть смысл узнать их по-лучше,последить за ними и нарваться на пару-тройку смешных моментов.

Кто смотрел вышеупомянутый сериал начала 90-х Дэвида Линча, без труда поймёт, чем вдохновлялся Хидэтаки Сухиро, автор этой, пожалуй, единственной в своём роде игры, и такого себе, своеобразного шедевра для небольшого круга игроков. Ибо массового геймера она попросту отпугнёт. В основном, конечно, по причине не очень хорошего технического исполнения. Корявое управление, многочисленные баги, местами падение fps, ну и в целом довольно невзрачная картинка по нынешним меркам - всё это оставляет желать лучшего. Ветераны, прошедшие Silent Hill 2-4, Devil May Cry 3, Resident Evil 4, Alone In The Dark 2008 на ПК, вообще без труда освоятся со здешним управлением. Лёгкий дискомфорт вызывает, разве что стрельба и управление машиной, но играть это практически не мешает. А моменты, которые неоднократно придётся переигрывать по причине кривого управления (как в том же пресловутом Alone In The Dark 2008) здесь попросту отсутствуют. Это приключенческий детектив в открытом мире, где нужно: есть, менять и чистить одежду, бриться, рыбачить, ездить на машине, заправлять её, использовать оружие ближнего боя, стрелять, выполнять QTE, разгадывать различные загадки, общаться с жителями города и решать простенькие второстепенные задания, которые более широко раскрывают детали сюжета и характеры персонажей. Интересный сюжет, харизматичные действующие лица, которые вряд ли можно спутать друг с другом, остроумные диалоги и юмор - всё в наличии.  Да чего уж там...  Один главный герой чего стоит. Который, во время затяжных поездок на машине постоянно размышляет о кинематографе 80-х, со всеми вытекающими.

Buggy.
Gameplay reminiscent of old resident evil games - may be good or bad depending on your perspective.
Locked resolution (there's a mod), dated graphics (dem textures).
If you don't enjoy hours of exploration, you will essentially need a guide to help you locate sidequests.
Sidequests are repetitive.

The story is great and I personally think the main character in particular is excellent. There are a handful of sidequests that provide genuinely useful items for the effort you put in (wrench, radio, weather doll) and the rest are forgettable.
Combat is decent. Aiming with the mouse is stiff, but aiming compensation makes it very easy to achieve headshots.

Over all, for the price I bought it at ($10 I think) I would recommend it, provided quite an entertaining experience.
For $25, there are better things to spend money on.

The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.

But here's the thing:  I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully.  From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight.  You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening.  You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town.  This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.

For all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve:  a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules.  I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.",1414461915,1414461915,True,4,0,0.554346799850463867,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Главное, что есть в DP  это сюжет и он хорош во многом благодаря персонажам, в особенности гг.  Нет ни одного персонажа которого можно было бы назвать скучным ,будь то сумашедшая хозяийка отеля или офицер чьи повадки делают его самым женственным персонажем в игре. Мы берём роль агента фбр по имени Йорк, он довольно необычный человек, разговаривает с воображаемым другом, считает, что утренний кофе предсказывает удачу и и удивляется зомби примерно так же как мы удивляемся солнышку по утрам. 

 Самое интересное, что эта игра больше всего напоминает то, каким должен был быть Alan Wake. Городок по которому мы можем свободно передвигатся пешком или на транспорте, динамическая смена погоды и времени суток, даже сюжет разделён эпизодами.

This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually ""works"" there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is ""improved"" version. 
Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this...
Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw.
Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)!
My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best.

It´s a great game if it runs on your system. (Luck dependend)

Chances are this game won´t run on your system no matter what you do.

This game maybe takes about 8 - 10 hours to playthrough.

That´s because i had to play sections over and over again because the constant crashes und freezes.
I even need to copy the save file between 3 PC´s !!! with different OS and config.

With Win 8.1 don´t even get started, there you will have all the problems that are available.
With Win 7 you will have most of the problems.

Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.

The shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like “man this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?” “well actually I um... I baked them myself”. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.

I would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate “real game” from “adventure” because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.

I realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.

The game is stuck on 720p quality, crashes randomly, save files get corrupted and characters and objects clip out. The open world environment enables you to drive freely in a somewhat vast environment, but the driving mechanism is so stiff and unrewarding you don't feel like going exploring just for the fun of it (Run out of gas in the middle of nowhere? Tough luck!).
Though most negative feelings I have towards the game can be blamed on the bad PC-port, some are simply due to bad game design. The map system is hard to navigate, as you can't zoom further back on the full world map that you have in your pause menu. Some sidemissions give no clue as to what you're supposed to do. Shooting/melee action is hard to coordinate right and at times feels very repetetive, but the action sequences do manage to bring a lot of good tension to the otherwise puzzle-heavy gameplay.

Though PC edition Deadly Premonition is a somewhat painful experience due to the recurring random crashes and bugs, it's also one the most captivating games I've ever played. Somehow, unexplainably, the game manages to turn many of it's cons into atmospheric pros.  Bad dubs and badly written over-the-top characters somehow add to the odd atmosphere. The characters feel fake and fairytale like, but in a good way. It seems the game's soundtrack has about three songs that play over and over again, sometimes at very inappropriate times. The monotonous soundtrack does however bring a certain Pavlov-element to the game. When you hear the ""evil is lurking"" music you learn to be on your guard - even if visible evil is not present.

The game owes a lot to the TV-series Twin Peaks; Eccentric FBI agent and the unexplained person he talks his mind to, murder of a young but troubled prom queen in a small, secretive town, ½ of which is owned by the owner of a lumbermill... The similarities don't end there. Though similar to the tv show, the game's story still stands well on it's on. It's weird and first sort of alienating, but as you progress in the game you find yourself restarting the game crash after crash, just so you could get on with the story. The terribly dubbed and stiffly animated characters that don't really make any sense pull you surprisingly deep in to Greenvale - and that's why I return to the game time after time.

I would recommend Deadly Premonition to anyone with a  lot of patience and a taste for strange story telling and quirky humor.

This game.  This.  RUDDY.  GAME.  

[b]Should you play it?[/b]  Yes, absolutely.

[b]Can you play it?[/b]  Possibly not.  

Let me explain, (briefly, I promise) this was originally a console game, following the adventures of FBI Investigator and friendly neighbourhood schizophrenic Francis York Morgan who is a walking mix of cliche and man as he attempts to solve a savage murder in a small town in America.  It has some driving and fighting elements but is mostly investigating and talking until you get to do these bits.  It has great atmosphere, is immensely cheesy and there was apparently a court case against it from Twin Peaks for plagiarism.  It feels like Twin Peaks' and Swery65 had an illicit trist and Deadly Premonition was the inbred offspring - perfectly normal until closer inspection.  As soon as the console game, which was a lot of fun if you like a disturbed American comedy murder, was brought to PC, things went wrong.

And oh so wrong.  The graphic quality was hampered to allow it to play on lower settings but the settings were not made accessible to the player so we can't ramp them back up.  The glitches  like walking and falling through walls and floors and tipping over vehicles are just the tip of the iceberg.  Crashes are horribly frequent with some players reporting a crash every hour of play, like clockwork, others getting crashes at certain points like when the camera is on a female characters legs and then again randomly in car parks.  And other points when it simply switches off for no apparent reason but doesn't allow itself to be switched back on without a full restart.  

Two full patches later and these problems are still occuring - there are also external patches that can fix the graphics issue.  It's pretty much unplayable but the game itself is FANTASTIC.  It's fun and strange and shocking in places and I recommend the game itself.

But can I recommend getting it on STEAM?  Probably not.  I've been playing for about 33 hours now and I still haven't completed the second episode, purely because crashes and bugs have made me restart 5 times.  If you can get it on a console, do so, though it's expensive.

Alternatively, here's some quick tips to help make it a little easier:
[list]
[*]Run the game in Admin mode (right click the game icon and click ""Run as administrator"")
Run in compatibility mode in Windows 98 if you have Windows 7 (WindowsXP Sv1 if you have Windows 8) that should fix the problem with aiming up and down
[*]Search for DPfix.ini in Google - it's a graphical fix patch, follow the creators instructions (not necessary and only useful if you have a really good PC)
[*]Use a controller - it will make your life easier, especially forthe driving sections, which are hilariously bad[/list]",1414184303,1414184512,True,119,4,0.860319435596466064,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Deadly Premonition es un juego único, que al principio es muy raro, confuso y hasta sin sentido pero a medida que avanzas en su historia te sumerges en ella, en su ambiente, los personajes y le coges cariño a cada uno y -por supuesto- odio algunos.

No sabría definir que genero pertenece, ya que es una extraña pero muy buena combinación de Misterio, comedia, drama y un poco de acción. La trama gira entre unos extraños asesinatos que han ocurrido en un pequeño pueblo, debido a esto, el FBI envía a un Agente especial a investigar sobre todos estos sucesos, un muy peculiar agente, con una personalidad carismática junto su amigo imaginario Zach. La trama suena simple al comienzo, pero luego se va tornando mas interesante hasta llegar a un punto en que si no terminas el juego no te quedas conforme.

Bajo aspectos técnicos, el juego no esta mal, gráficamente cumple pero obviamente para las mayoría de los consumidores son muy cortos, aun así, sus vídeos y animaciones están bien hechas lo que le da un toque distinto al juego,en algunos casos son un poco torpes pero no le quita calidad y muchos menos entretenimiento. La banda sonora del juego es bastante pegajosa y repetitiva en ciertos casos, pero concuerda con cada escena del juego. 

Este juego es una clara muestra que no hace falta ser un estudio con altos presupuestos para elaborar productos de calidad, solo basta una buena idea y desarrollarla con mucho tiempo y dedicación, sin duda alguna, a estos chicos japoneses que desarrollaron el juego les comprare otro titulo que saquen en un futuro.

En definitiva, es un juego altamente recomendable, con muy buena duracion (25H en mi caso), trama increible con grandes personajes y un final digno de recordar.

Un juego diferente, una experiencia unica, y tal vez sea eso lo que hace de este juego un must have.

RECOMMENDED - for the actual game experience: fantastic.
NOT RECOMMENDED - for the awful PC technical port: horrible.

Before I actually even get into what an outstanding actual gem of a game itself, let's start right up front with this:

*****WARNING!************ 
*****BUYER BEWARE!*****

While Deadly Premonition is a unique + outstanding game, it is such a crime that this game is riddled with technical disaster after technical disaster here on the PC. In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern. 

Also, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.

While I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's start-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere. 

****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***

Now, onto the actual game itself...

What do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, oddest, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has ""cult classic"" written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.

The story + plot goes like this: Francis ""York"" Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.

And boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead ""York"" talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named ""Zach""; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occasions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here. 

The story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to ""catch the serial killer theme,"" it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaying the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.

The controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own ""Nightmare"" version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).

Players, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey. Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.

The game certainly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.

Deadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the abysmal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.

    [*]Если Deadly Premonition и есть за что похвалить, так это за [u]сюжет и атмосферу[/u]. Это прям ядреная смесь из Дэвида Линча и, в частности, его “Твин Пикса”с японским безумием и абсурдом. К сожалению, история - это единственное, чем может привлечь игрока Deadly Premonition.
    [*]А вот [u]играть[/u] в Deadly Premonition буквально больно. Здесь всё, начиная с графики и разрешения экрана (здравствуй, фиксированное 720p) и заканчивая самим игровым процессом и геймдизайном, сделано плохо. И если в экшн-эпизодах Deadly Premonition просто на дне, то в мирно-исследовательской части игра к тому же катастрофически не ценит ваше время. Сцена преследования подозреваемого - это апофеоз корявости местного геймплея. Мы минут 10 реального времени плетемся за ползущей со скоростью черепахи машиной. Никакого интереса эта гонка не представляет, драйва в ней ноль - с такой скоростью от нас не убегут, к тому же постоянно приходится притормаживать. А помножь такое преследование на просто гигантское расстояние и выйдет удовольствие не для слабонервных. Хотя называть это удовольствием и вовсе кощунство. Все, абсолютно все геймплейные моменты тут скорее препятствия, которые вы преодолеваете чтобы увидеть новый поворот сюжета или забавный диалог.
    [*][u]Локализации[/u] в стим-версии нет.
    [*]Сложными [u]достижения[/u] тут я не назову. По большей части, надо выполнить все побочки и собрать коллекционные карточки, но тут вставляет палки в колёса сама природа игры. Как я уже отмечал, Deadly Premonition нещадно затягивает и без того убогий геймплей.

The direction of the script is exceptional, the characters are well fleshed out and memorable (at least, most of them)  and the overall mood is a perfect blend of comedy relief moments and serious thriller sequences. Also, the soundtrack is among the finest I've heard in any game the last 6-7 years.

Somehow someway after NUMEROUS crashes, freezes, and playing 99.99% of the game with what I didn't know was bugged out aiming, I fahcking did it! I think this game is mesmerizing but first a few questions to determine if Deadly Premonition is right for you!

Do you enjoy quirky games?
Do you like the TV show ""Twin Peaks""?
Do you enjoy games that are rough around the edges?

I'd say, if you answered yes to 2 of those questions you should definitely find a way to play this game. It has a great storyline, funny albeit intriguing dialouge, decent gameplay and an absolutely fantastic OST. However be warned this game can be a FAHCKING nuisance due to the terrible programing/coding that was implemented especially for the PC version. 

Keep in mind that this game has a BOATLOAD of problems but it is also a better experience than most ""AAA"" or ""Indie"" games out there!

****TIPS FOR RUNNING DEADLY PREMONITION****
I am using Windows 8 btw.

If the game crashes at start up---->look for redist folder and find the PhysX_Syssoftware installer and run Repair on it
If the game constantly crashes WHILE playing----> Try rebooting your system after exiting or disabling Steam overlay for the game or Run in Windows 98 Compatibility mode
If the aiming is extremely limited (ie. Only can aim within a small rectangle on the screen like i did for 99.99% of the game, lol)---> Run in windows 98 compatibility mode

ALSO sometimes deleting the game and reinstalling helps but it is not as reliable as just running in Windows 98 mode. 

Hope these tips help and happy gaming !",1413325065,1413325065,True,41,0,0.734138250350952148,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show ""Twin Peaks"" are incredibly valid in setting, characterization & situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an ""other world"" when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port.  The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has.

Gracz na swojej drodze spotyka wiele zagadek do rozwiązania. Często trzeba wykazać się niezłą spostrzegawczością, zdolnością łączenia faktów oraz zmysłem przewidywania, by poradzić sobie z napotykanymi zadaniami. Ważne, by rozmawiać z jak największą grupą osób (także z tymi teoretycznie nie mogącymi mieć żadnego wpływu na fabułę), bo mogą nam one podsunąć bezcenne wskazówki.
Z RPG mamy w Deadly Premonition system kondycji głównego bohatera. Twórcy starali się w jak największym stopniu odwzorować rzeczywistość, więc pomiędzy kolejnymi zagadkami musimy dbać również o zdrowie naszego agenta FBI. Trzeba więc odwiedzać różnego rodzaju bary i restauracje, by bohater był w pełni sił. Powinien być również wyspany, bo ma to zasadniczy wpływ na jego refleks oraz zdolności motoryczne.
Deadly Premonition proponuje nam mroczny, przygnębiający klimat, potęgowany przez deszcz i szarzyznę, która z pewnością nie poprawi nam nastroju. Nie zapominajmy jednak, iż mamy tu do czynienia z (przynajmniej po części) survival-horrorem, więc na swojej drodze napotkamy również postacie, które niezbyt przypominają normalnych ludzi. Warto dodać, że ich zachowanie może się różnić w zależności od pory dnia. Zupełnie inaczej zachowują się bowiem rano, inaczej po południu, a jeszcze inaczej wieczorem.
Co do specyfikacji technicznej to jest tragedia pod kazdym względem. Graficznie, sterowanie i audio ssie na maksa. Grafika to poziom poczatku PS 2 czyli tak 2001 max 2002. Muzyka w grze jest zjadliwa a VA jest tragiczny. Sterowanie na klawiayurze jest zjadliwe ale gra padem to mordęga. Ale to co niepozwala się oderwać od tej gry to fabuła. Wciąga jak jasna cholera i jak przełkniesz te minusy wciągnie cię na maksa.

Минусы:
- Один большой минус всей игры: Визуальная часть. Это не так просто обьяснить. Если теоретически можно представить некую единицу измерения просранности полимеров, то в случае в Deadly Premonition будет 10 просранных полимеров из 10. 

Улыбка ГГ будет сниться вам в ночных кошмарах - Check. Вы с вероятностью в 95% поймаете эксклюзивный баг ПК-версии, благодаря которому автомобиль при передвижении беспрерывно издает звук скрежета ржавого металла на полную громкость - Check. Для освоения управления клавиатурой нужно быть пианистом, а геймпад без костылей не подключить - Check. К счастью, половина всех известных багов и проблем с текстурами и разрешением решается установкой фанатского фикса (от того же самого человека, который сделал фикс для ПК-порта Dark Souls, к слову), но будем честны - любой нормальный игрок сразу после покупки хочет видеть игру готовой к комфортной игре, а не тратить время на установку и настройку сопутствующих костылей. 

Плюсы:
+ Это Твин Пикс
+ Это японский Твин Пикс
+ Игра начинается с монолога главного героя о намеках на гомосексуальность отношений Тома и Джерри
+ Главный герой зажигает сигарету под открытым дождем и не боится ничего

Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.

I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue.  Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied ""Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize"" .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.

..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.

Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.

The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.

Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 -  get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...",1411099486,1411100424,True,1,0,0.495006918907165527,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Un momento...c'è qualcosa che non quadra, potrei aver sbagliato qualcosa...meglio riformulare.

Chi ha ucciso Anna Graham? Con questa domanda in testa l'agente speciale dell'FBI Francis York Morgan si reca nella ridente cittadina di Greenvale, immersa nei boschi e ricca di misteri, un posto dove niente è come sembra.

Ecco, adesso va bene.

Questa è la premessa del titolo di cui mi appresto a parlare: Deadly Premonition, alias Twin Peaks: The Game.

Altro che Alan Wake, l'ispirazione a Twin Peaks qui è ad un altro livello. Il titolo sviluppato dai ragazzi di Access Games eredita davvero tanto dal telefilm nato dalla mente di David Lynch (Dune vi dice niente?): il protagonista sopra le righe, l'ambientazione, le atmosfere malate e inquietanti, persino alcuni dei personaggi e aspetti della storia.

Indubbiamente il punto forte dell'offerta è rappresentato da comparto narrativo, dialoghi e personaggi. Tra questi non può che risaltare lo strambo protagonista, Francis York Morgan (chiamatelo York, così fanno tutti). Come Dale Cooper, questo strano individuo è assolutamente fanatico di caffè, tanto da utilizzare quello che ""legge"" in esso per le sue indagini. A questo aggiungiamo la sua seconda personalità, Zach, con cui non si fa problemi a conversare amabilmente, e una passione sfrenata per il cinema anni '80 e per le sigarette, che fuma anche nei momenti più inopportuni. Tutto questo va a costruire quello che secondo me è uno dei personaggi più geniali mai ideati in un gioco. Anche il resto del cast, pur con diversi stereotipi, si difende davvero bene e aiuta non poco ad immergersi in un'ambientazione dove tutti, dietro un'apparenza di normalità, nascondono grandi o piccoli segreti. La trama è avvincente e appassiona fino al (lunghissimo) finale, peccato che proprio quando il caso si avvia alla conclusione ci siano un po' troppe cadute di stile, non tanto per quanto quello che accade, quanto per il modo in cui accade...imho giapponesate davvero evitabili. Non dico niente perché sarebbe un reato spoilerare anche una virgola.

Passando al gameplay iniziano purtroppo ad arrivare le numerose note dolenti. Il gioco si divide sostanzialmente in due componenti: quella free-roaming e quella action-investigativa. 

La prima ci da la possibilità di esplorare in quasi totale libertà la ridente cittadina, facendo attenzione a rispettare le deadline temporali della storia...niente a che vedere con il tempo stringente di un Dead Rising, dato che una volta superato l'orario previsto la missione viene semplicemente rimandata al giorno successivo. Durante i nostri giri abbiamo la possibilità di dialogare coi png, svolgere diverse attività (come pesca e freccette) e semplici quest secondarie, che permettono di approfondire ulteriormente ambientazione e personaggi. In questo caso avere una guida sotto gli occhi e pressoché fondamentale, dato che molte missioni si sbloccano solo in presenza di determinati requisiti legati all'orario o al tempo atmosferico. A questo si aggiungono una serie di collezionabili sparsi in giro per la mappa. L'idea, per quanto balzana possa sembrare, funziona. Peccato che la navigazione sia resa a dir poco pesante da una mappa inutile e confusionaria (ruota di continuo, non la si può allontanare per avere una visione d'insieme, non si possono mettere segnalini) e da un modello di guida dei veicoli semplicemente terribile...sono lentissimi e completamene inguidabili a qualunque velocità, per non parlare del sistema di collisioni raccapricciante. A questo si potrebbe ovviare con un sistema di fast travel ed effettivamente esso è presente, peccato che sia legato ad una subquest facilmente mancabile.

Passando alla seconda componente, è evidentemente quanto si siano ispirati agli ultimi Resident Evi: la telecamera è ravvicinata con il personaggio posizionato sulla sinistra, non si può camminare mentre si spara, si punta attraverso un mirino laser, ci sono continui QTE e così via. Anche qui i problemi non mancano: la varietà dei nemici è nulla, le location sono poco ispirate, le situazioni si ripetono fino allo sfinimento, il livello di difficoltà è inesistente (basti pensare che ho giocato il 70% della partita con armi aventi munizione infinite...senza trucchi ). Le investigazioni dal canto loro sono molto semplificate, si tratta in soldoni di individuare una serie di elementi (sempre ben evidenziati) e vedere un filmatino dove York ricostruisce quanto accaduto in quel luogo. Se non fosse che queste sezioni sempre uguali sono presenti in quantità semplicemente spropositata, si potrebbe passare sopra agli innumerevoli difetti.

Dal punto di vista grafico Deadly Premonition fa semplicemente schifo dall'inizio alla fine, con una motore che farebbe venire i brividi anche a chi è abituato a giocare su PS2, piattaforma per cui era inizialmente previsto il gioco. Non mi soffermo sui singoli aspetti, dato che tutto quello che vediamo va dal bruttino (i modelli poligonali) all'orribile (le animazioni). La discreta direzione artistica delle ambientazioni esterne viene quasi completamente rovinata da tanta pochezza. Giochi così osceni da questo punto di vista penso che se ne siano visti pochi in questa generazione ormai morente. 

Il sonoro è leggermente migliore. Gli effetti fanno quasi sempre pena e spesso non sono neanche ben sincronizzati, mentre il doppiaggio è quanto meno decente, a patto di abituarsi all'utilizzo di intonazioni un po' strane e alla ripetizione di certe formule...sfido chiunque a non sognarsi di notte Michael che dice ""Mr. Francis York Morgan""  Discorso a parte per le musiche: alcune, main theme in testa, sono davvero ben fatte...peccato che la canzoni si contino sulle dita di una mano e che spesso siano riprodotte totalmente a sproposito...perché mettere una musichetta allegra mentre si sta facendo un autopsia? Boh. Forse a qualcuno può piacere questa caratteristica (che a quanto pare è voluta), ma a me da semplicemente fastidio.

Arriviamo così alla conclusione di questo lungo post. Devo ammettere che nel complesso il gioco mi è piaciuto, ma è oggettivo che prendendo singolarmente i vari elementi si assista ad una serie non indifferente di orrori. Praticamente questo gioco è quello che sarebbe stato Alan Wake se avesse avuto un budget infinitamente minore, un team meno competente e fosse rimasto fedele all'impostazione inizialmente prevista. Mi sento di consigliarlo solo a chi apprezza l'aspetto narrativo ed è disposto a ignorare le numerose magagne tecniche e di gameplay. È sicuramente un'esperienza del tutto particolare, qualcosa che non si vede tutti i giorni...magari per pochi euro potrebbe valerne la pena.",1410898272,1410898272,True,17,3,0.661566555500030518,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 Но поиграв пару часов я был очень удивлен тому насколько я втянулся в эту атмосферу настоящего детективного расследования в тихом провинциальном городке Гринвейл.

 Удивлен я также был когда узнал, что игра оказывается с открытым миром, но мир этот не похож на знаменитые GTA и ей подобные. Здесь нет толп безликих прохожих и непрерывного потока машин, мир довольно пуст. Однако все немногие местные жители это уникальные по-своему персонажи, каждый со своей жизнью и каждый со своими секретами. Они живут по графику: ходят на работу, спят, гуляют, встречаются, выпивают в барах - этакий симс к которому прикрутили сюжет. И сюжет очень даже не слабый, хоть кино снимай. Вот так прям бери диалоги, ролики, связывай их вместе и снимай с живыми актерами настоящее кино, для этого уже все есть. Местами забавный, смешной, грустный, напряженный, пугающий и даже жестокий сюжет заставляет дойти до конца, узнать все тайны и получить ответы на все вопросы. Почти все диалоги хорошо озвучены и радуют слух, как и саундтрек. Игра из тех когда с нетерпением ждешь не следующего геймплейного момента, а следующего ролика или диалога, она по праву заслуживает все те положительные отзывы от сообщества Стима.

(Русского в стимовской версии нет, но кто-то писал что можно найти русификатор. Я играл в оригинальную английскую версию, потому-что от русских субтитров при английской озвучке в моей голове получается каша и я в результате понимаю меньше чем могу понять.)

 Однако на странице в магазине стоит оценка 59/100. Могу с уверенностью сказать что все 59 баллов это заслуга сюжета. У игры есть ряд колоссальных недостатков. 
 Графика ужасна. Анимация не менее ужасна. Управление... проще промолчать... Камера в прицеле начинает нормально двигаться только если свернуть и развернуть игру, полно ограничений: тут нельзя пройти, сюда нельзя зайти, здесь не перешагнуть, а ходить и стрелять одновременно - совсем непозволительная роскошь, вследствие чего враги совсем уж безобидные, тысяча и одна аптечка уже не помещается в занятный, но неудобный инвентарь, а у оружия никогда не кончатся патроны. Да еще эти дурацкие QTE-моменты, чтоб им провалиться, совсем уж паршиво реализованы. К тому же было замечено несколько неприятных вылетов на рабочий стол, через 10-20 минут с момента последнего сохранения. 
 Физика машин также оставляет желать лучшего, они ведут себя как игрушечные. Процент повреждений есть, но визуально совсем не ломаются. Имеется вид из кабины с нерабочим зеркалом заднего вида и GPS, также непонятно для чего присутствуют поворотники и полицейская мигалка.

 Но если вы, как и я, готовы ради плюсов не обращать внимание на минусы, то вам я данное произведение искусства настоятельно рекомендую.

В тени пропиаренных высокобюджетных игр теряются различные хорошие проекты. К таковым можно отнести [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] - бывший искбоксовский эксклюзив, в последствии портированный на [b]PS3[/b] и [b]PC[/b]. 

[b]Сюжет[/b] начинается с того, что в тихом американском городке [b]Гринвэйле[/b] произошло жестокое убийство молодой девушки [b]Анны[/b]. За дело берется специальный агент ФБР - [b]Фрэнсис Йорк Морган[/b]. У [b]Йорка[/b] есть свое альтэр-эго - некий [b]Зак[/b], с которым он всегда обсуждает детали расследования и не только. По приезду в [b]Гринвэйл[/b] [b]Йорка[/b] встречают шериф [b]Джордж Вудман[/b], который был не особо рад его приезду, а также его молодая помощница [b]Эмили[/b]. В начале игры нас сразу закинет в некую альтернативную реальность, в которой [b]Йорк[/b] на протяжении большей части игры будет отстреливать враждебно настроенных монстров. Хотя сложно сказать, является ли эта реальность вымышленной. Ведь [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] это та игра, в которой законы вселенной не работают. Вся сюжетная линия по ходу оставляет кучу вопросов и лишь в конце начинаешь понимать, что здесь вообще происходит на самом деле. Игра напоминает сериал [b]Твин Пикс[/b], подробно на этом останавливаться не стану, просто рекомендую посмотреть его.

Перейдем к [b]геймплею[/b]. Игра представляет собой открытый мир с основными и дополнительными квестами. В перерыве между заданиями [b]Йорк[/b] может зайти в бар и попить пивка, или сгонять на рыбалку. 
Стрельбы в игре очень много. К середине игры это уже начинает надоедать и новые виды оружия не делают её интереснее. Монстры весьма слабые и убить их не составляет труда. С боссами же придется немного повозиться. 
В [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] также есть несколько несложных головоломок, разбавляющих постоянную стрельбу и поездку на машинах. К слову о этих самых поездках. Они надоедают не меньше стрельбы. Поездки на 4.000-5.000 ярдов очень утомляют, да еще и бензин имеет свойство заканчиваться. Кстати, за рулем можно поболтать с [b]Заком[/b] и вспомнить старые добрые деньки. Оказывается [b]Йорк[/b] был тем еще киноманом и любителем панк-рока (а может и до сих пор таковым является). Еще ему придется следить за собой: менять костюм, бриться, кушать и спать - мелкие, но приятные геймплейные фишки.
По карте, которой пользоваться очень и очень неудобно, разбросаны всякие коллекционные предметы, например карточки или кости, за сбор которых можно получить соответствующие ачивки. 
А еще в игре много [b]QTE[/b]. Придется много клацать по клавишам, особенно по A и D и в конце концов это тоже начинает надоедать.

[b]Звуковое сопровождение[/b] в игре на высшем уровне. Всю игру музыка прекрасно подчеркивает текущий антураж, будь то ясный утренний денек или серая дождливая ночь. Услышав музыку в начале миссии уже можно понять, что нас ждет впереди: очередная перестрелка с монстрами или же какой-нибудь безобидный диалог с персонажами.

[b]Графикой[/b] игра похвастаться не может. Движок явно устарел, лицевая анимация практически никакая. Но впринципе картинку игра выдает весьма приятную. Модельки персонажей не имеют миллионы полигонов, но этого и не нужно. Графика осталась где-то в 2007-08 году, но это нисколько не мешает прохождению игры. В [b]Director's Cut[/b] текстурки слегка улучшили, по сравнению с консольной версией и выглядят они очень даже неплохо.

Отдельный абзац посвящу [b]багам и вылетам[/b]. Для начала про баги. Однажды выстрелил в монстра с дробовика, он вылетел за текстуры и затем убил меня находясь там. А еще как-то ехал по дороге и увидел чувака, который вроде как был за рулем, но на деле он висел в воздухе слева от машины. Теперь про вылеты: одним словом - это просто ужас! Авторы порта не смогли нормально довести игру до ума. У меня за всю игру было около 10 вылетов. Решались они переключением совместимости. Это жутко бесило. 

[b]Плюсы игры:[/b]
- Шикарный сюжет
- Симпатичные локации
- Отличные персонажи
- Атмосферная музыка
- Открытый мир
- Куча дополнительных квестов

[b]Минусы игры:[/b]
- Вылеты, баги, кривоватость порта
- Долгие поездки и надоедающая беготня в некоторых миссиях (в особенности миссия, где дают поиграть за Эмили)
- Однообразные перестрелки с монстрами

[b]Итог: 7.7/10[/b]. Я бы поставил оценку выше, но игра имеет очевидные недостатки, которые нельзя просто не заметить. [b]Deadly Premonition[/b] определенно одна из лучших игр, в которую я играл, несмотря на все ее минусы.

このゲームは、オープンワールド内でキャラクターと会話などしながらストーリーを進めるパートと、異世界？の様な場所で敵と戦いながらダンジョン？をクリアーしていくパート、この二つのパートを交互に進めていく事となる。
問題は、戦闘パートが壊滅的な程に面白く無い上に長くて面倒だと言う事。
このパートが無ければ、様々な人が書いているように興味を引かれるストーリーだし、キャラクターも面白いので最後までプレイしていたかもしれない。
しかし、とにかく戦闘パートが面倒すぎる。動きのぎこちない主人公、無駄に堅く数の多い敵、所々に用意される即死イベント、意味不明な証拠集めシステム、そしてひたすら長い。戦闘パートでは殆どストーリーが進まないので、ストーリーが気になるプレイヤーからすると出来る限り速く終わって欲しいと感じる。しかし、それが1-2時間も続いたら流石にこのゲームを続ける気は無くなってしまう。自分は数回目の戦闘パートをクリアーした所でゲームを止めた。

戦闘パートをスキップするパッチでも出ればもう一度プレイしたい程度にはストーリーパートは面白かったが、戦闘パートが必須な現状ではやはりクソゲーと言う他無い。ストーリーパートとの関連が薄すぎて、ストーリーを進めるために全く無関係なクソゲーを無理矢理プレイさせられてる感が強かった。

Графон пришол с PS2, ведь изначально игру создавали для неё,а только потом для консолей,но он не важен здесь
Геймплей самое противоречивое в игре.Механика взята из Resident Evil 4.Да нельзя идти и стрелять одновременно, машину ведут себя  нереалистично и не как не могу понять зачем есть бензин хотя на весь город одна колонка,а город немаленький и зачем по воротники нужны.Также как и в великой игре Sims нужно есть,спать,менять костюм а то мухи будут летать и даже бриться.Но конечно же есть куча доп заданий (достаточно интересных) и других способов разнообразить свой досуг, на рыбалку сходить к примеру.И на мой взгляд если бы игра была интерактивным фильм наподобие Хеви Рейн и Ходячих было бы гораздо лучше
Атмосфера действительно напоминает сериал  Твин Пикс. Хотя всё о нём напоминает
Музыка шикарна,треки достаточно запоминающийся

Then, even when you're able to play, you still have to put up with broken vertical aiming that only shows up in the PC version.

If you still get the PC port, look at DPfix (and fiddle w/ resolution and windowing settings), and try setting compatibility to WinXP SP2, or better yet Win98 (but with Win98 you'll probably have to give up the built-in gamepad support and either use keyboard/mouse (mapped onto console/gamepad-first controls) or messing around w/ a third-party gamepad mapper).

With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans.

Игра тормозила, не запускалась, бесконечное количество синих экранов, ужасное управление и камера. Ужасный звук когда ездишь в машине, конечно все это фиксится, но как же это бесит по началу и может попросту испортить первоначальное впечатление от игры. Теперь уже о плюсах игры и о ней самой.

Если вы смотрели один из лучших сериалов всех времен - Твин Пикс, то вы сразу найдете очевидное сходство. Главный герой - Френсис Йорк Морган агент ФБР, посланный в маленький городок Гринвейл чтобы расследовать убийство. Стилистика и идея почти полностью заимствованы из сериала - особенно это заметно в образе детектива. 

Даже не смотря на то, что сюжет почти полностью скопирован с твин пикса, он все равно гениален и смотрится как в первый раз. Расследование загадочных убийств. Загадочный убийца в красном плаще которого никто не видел кроме самого агента Йорка, демоны с которыми борется Йорк, которых тоже никто не видит. Из чего можно сделать вывод что убийца как и сами демоны возможно сидят в голове агента ФБР. Так же одна из особенностей Йорка — некий «Зак» в его голове, с которым Йорк постоянно общается. У всех в этом городе есть свои секреты, как например Зак и демоны у Йорка. 

Даже не смотря на то, что игра первоначально создавалась в 2007 для PS2, в 2007 для PlayStation 2. В 2007. Ну, вы поняли. Разработчики, не смотря на очень посредственную графику и анимацию, смогли сделать город по истине живым. Вообще в игре мало персонажей, но с каждым можно поговорить, узнать какие-либо факты, взять различные квесты. Они же в свою очередь будут помогать расследованию. В игру, конечно, намешали всего чего только возможно. Катаны, огнеметы, гонки, рыбалку, безумные диалоги и забавные ситуации, возможность курить, есть и спать. При этом игру нельзя назвать трешем, безумие доведено до абсурда, настолько, что игра кажется гениальной. Из игры вышла хоть и не идеальная, но замечательная песочница, если её можно так назвать. 

Сложно описать всю гениальность этой игры. В голове сразу столько мыслей об игре, которые просто не войдут полностью в рекомендацию. Игра недооцененный шедевр, игра не для всех. Если вам нравится серия ассасина, фаркрая и крайзиса, то лучше даже не запускать эту игру, вы не сможете её понять.

剧情：6/10。人物塑造很丰满，前段的故事发展让人意外且引人入胜，但到后段情节，因为有些坑没能给圆上或者有些编得牵强，就显得故弄玄虚。比如僵尸到底为什么会出现，这么多年就主角看到了？僵尸刚开始给我的感觉应该是在雨天才出现，可后来去墓地的时候没下雨都有僵尸，这就是瞎搞搞的咯？最后NICK到哪去了？也没交代把他给放了呀。警长是雨衣杀手，可主角大多数时候单独进室内，EMILY不是都和警长在外面等着吗？为什么主角总会看到红衣的ANNA？总之就是剧情有些地方挺荒诞的，没那么神。
画面：1/10。画面效果真心是垃圾中的战斗机了，除去这个，分辨率默认锁720P，而且你开DP.EXE可以流畅玩但不能全屏，你开DPLAUNCHER.EXE能设置全屏玩，但就会卡很多，载入也慢很多，这是什么奇葩设定。
音效：6/10。大部分背景音乐都是挺赞的，人物配音也过得去，但整体音效一般，在对恐怖氛围的营造上算不上给力。
操作：6/10。用的手柄玩，鼠键应该操作更方便些，就说说手柄的感受。射击+QTE的对战操作没什么快感，虽然游戏默认支持手柄，但全程玩下来手柄没震动过一次，我的是360手柄。BOSS追逐战里，拿手柄玩真心蛋疼。还有最终BOSS战，辅助瞄准简直坑到家都不认识了，全程手柄手动瞄准个小东西，别提我有多想摔东西了。好吧，或许我技术不到家。
游戏系统：3/10。主角在游戏中会长胡子，你可以选择刮了，衣服穿久不洗会有苍蝇围着飞，但这些对剧情，人物关系都无任何影响，想吐槽的一个就是，有洗浴室但不能洗澡，你要做那么生活化那就做做完整啊。有饥饿值和疲乏值，低了似乎会主角人物状态上的惩罚，没细究，一直是保持满状态，没什么特殊加成，睡觉吃东西都可以补充，感觉也是很鸡肋。还一个时间系统，不做支线的话还是挺无聊的一个设定，当然你可以去收集东西来打发时间，如果你是收集控的话。另一个是钓鱼，可以钓急救包弹药等，钓上来显示的不是3D对应物品，直接一个方形图案，很雷人。还有金钱系统，钱多的我都不知道怎么去用，物品么还有携带上限，而且上限设的真的狠低。以上这些系统设定，确实丰富了游戏系统，但又觉得可有可无。

Причудливая, странная, неописуемая атмосфера действительно наличествует в DP. Но лишь на первых порах и в те частые моменты, когда игра передирает подчистую всю фабулу «Твин Пикса». И речь идет не только о зарисовках общего характера а-ля «агент ФБР в провинциальном городе идет по следу злодея, уведшего на тот свету младую деву». Сценаристы Access Games, не мудрствуя лукаво, взяли копир и перенесли в DP всех персонажей, все декорации, сюжетные события и даже диалоги (!) «Твин Пикса». На добродушного простака Энди тут всегда найдется помощник шерифа Томас, на даму с поленом – дама с котелком, на лесопилку Пэкарда – лесопилка Гринвэйла, а на Диану – Зак. 

Да вот незадача, разработчикам не хватило бесстыдства, чтобы стащить все, абсолютно все достоинства сериала, вплоть до последней буквы и запятой. И если вступительная часть игры легко и добродушно передирает его заветы, вводя местами то там, то сям новых, бессмысленных персонажей, то дальше на эстраду во всем своем уродстве выходит творческая немощь самураев из Access Games. Не вдаваясь в дебри спойлеров, замечу, что финал DP есть совершеннейшая ахинея, обставленная тупо и некрасиво. 

И где тогда искать спасение, если не в сюжете и в атмосфере? Альтернативы нет – в игровой механике и только. Которая хромает. Которая еле волочит ноги и спотыкается о каждый угол. 

Тут есть открытый мир. И вправду – открытый. Маленький, но открытый. Совсем мертвый, но открытый. Не поощряющий исследований, но открытый. Одноэтажный, но открытый.  

Кое-где проклевываются по-детски наивные, неописуемо скучные, занудные головоломки, по степени умственной вовлеченности сходные с заданиями на затрапезную миссию из Call of Duty. 

Присутствует возможность прокатиться по провинциальным дорогам на машине, чья допотопная маневренность вполне сравнима с танком времен Первой мировой или, ближе к финалу и долгожданным титрам, с обмылком, елозящим по сторонам от шутливых поворотов руля. Езду как развлечение смело отписывайте в утиль еще на старте. 

Туда же, в клозет, отправьте и побочные задания. Они едва ли имеют отношение к сюжету и преимущественно сводятся к изжившей себя еще пару десятилетий тому назад формулировке «пойди, найди и принеси». Никаких расследований, никаких допросов и прочих детективных штучек – ничего этого не ждите, а лучше готовьтесь к невзгодам курьера, которому нужно явиться к клиенту строго в определенный час и при определенных обстоятельствах. 

Полноценное расследование в игру тоже не завезли. Как детектив, она –  невообразимо слаба. Обращаясь к расхожему стереотипу об английских детективах, можно сказать, что в DP убийцей окажется дворецкий, который всю игру будет нахально размахивать окровавленным ножом, хамовато заявлять об отсутствии алиби и запанибратски вещать о том, что убийцей он быть не может по определению. 

А в остальном готовьтесь к тиру, проложенному по непомерно длинным кишкообразным уровням, где активно практикуется художественной прием имени Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V. Притом сама стрельба  реализована наиотвратительнейшим образом, с гуляющим ходуном прицелом, с напрочь отсутствующей отдачей и врагами, которые, как губки, лопают свинец если не ведрами, то уж точно совковыми лопатами. 

И наконец, играть в DP без установленной поверх игры заплатки (зовется DP fix) в буквальном смысле опасно для здоровья. Отсутствующее сглаживание, ровно одна текстура «пышной зелени», которой измазаны все горы, равнины, холмы и лужайки, довольно быстро превратят ваши глаза в расплывчатую жижу. К тому же, игра в своей PC-обертке ревнива и крайне нестабильна. Готовьтесь целовать рабочий стол. И часто, без густоты.

It has a crashed a lot of times for me.

As a game I have mixedfeelings.
First impression was a low budget game with terrible writing and voice acting, yet for some reason I kept playing.
The story got somewhat interesting and made me wanna see the ending.
Halfway through the game the story just takes a turn for freaking weird. It's a shame cause it had could have been a very interresing story.

On the gameplay side there are a lot of things wrong with the game.
The driving for one is abysmal, you would have more luck driving concrete then cars in this game.
The shooting is a bit so so but entertaining enough.
There are a lot of sidemissions which are basicly all very short and very boring.
The writing of some of the dialogue can be absolutely terrible, whilst the writing of the main story is not to bad.

Oh and make no mistake this is not a horror game not by a long shot!
It's more of a murder mystery game, yet it's so weird it's hard to follow what is actually going on.

Still even in all it's flaws I would recommend trying it.

[b]Deadly premonition[/b] проект для очень, очень узкого зрителя, игра понравится одному человеку из 10, и тот, кто поймёт её, кто увидит в ней все плюсы, будет шокирован и очарован этим великолепным приключением. Я всегда говорил и буду, что нет ничего печальней в игрострое, когда заведомо шедевр делают кривыми руками или на худой конец не опытными. Энтузиазм есть, а работают плохо, отсюда теряется приличная часть впечатлений, если не все в целом, но, слава богу, тут хороший случай. К минусам можно отнести очень слабый графон, причём местами, но я моментально привык. Главное ради чего стоит запускать игру естественно - сюжет, да он немного трэшовый, местами нелепый как в прочем всегда было у японцев, но при этом он обладает просто диким интересом к его познанию и раскрытию. Каждый элемент в игре практически гениален, но сделан плохо или вообще отвратительно, не доделан, не додуман до идеала, и если вы научитесь мириться с этим, то получите несказанное удовольствие, даже пройдя игру просто быстренько по сюжету. Аналогов у [b]Deadly premonition[/b] просто нет, это 100% самобытная игра, да элементы из других игр присутствуют и в большом количестве, но в итоге получаем абсолютно новый expirience. Лично мне игра выступила прекрасным сериалом на 5 огромных вечеров, сломя голову я бежал с работы, включал и просто проваливался в игру, в эту прекраснейшую атмосферу детектива. Собственно львиная доля повествования сериального, была взята из старенького и крутого сериала[i]""Твин Пикс""[/i], если кто не смотрел, советую. Ну и лучший плюс, после сюжета - персонажи, они добрые, хорошие, живые, с юмором. Всех знаешь по имени, а к концу игры ловишь себя на мысли, что помнишь какую еду предпочитает единственный врач в городе. Собственно говоря, об итоге, это чисто сюжетный проект, настолько сюжетным последний раз наверно был только [b]Heavy rain.[/b] Любителям серьёзного геймплея, тут, увы, делать нечего.

It has a doom-laden yet sleepy atmosphere, it mixes the grotesque with the mundane to excellent effect, its characters are fascinating, its hero is a monotone FBI agent that follows his dreams and intuitions with deadpan seriousness, its musical themes expose and mock the manipulative nature of music in games/tv/movies (corporate training video jazz played in dramatic moments, dissonance when ordering a sandwich), and so on.

And yet when talking about its parts, the game is terrible. The horror sections of the game are awful because you can't walk and shoot at the same time. The map is unnecessarily large. It's sort of impossible to stumble into the wide range of side-missions available. The game has to be played with the its wiki open somewhere in the background and so the experience is never totally random or immersive. Accessing items and maps is difficult. Even then the map is impossible to use. Driving is awful. The animations look like The Sims c. 2004. And so on.

And so it's more than the sum of its parts, and this is why those in defense of Deadly Premonition have made the case for it as an example of 'games as art'. As a work of fiction, it's very good, and as a game, it is awful.

But so it is worth comparing to other games that favour things like atmosphere and narrative over technical game-ness. To the Moon and The Walking Dead, for example. These games are adored by critics and gamers alike, but on the level of gamerliness, don't really add up to much. The Walking Dead's parts can be described as a glorified point-and-click, To the Moon as sort of the same but with even less agency on the player's part. So why is Deadly Premonition hated when those others are loved? 

Those other games knew what they were, and so they cut unnecessary 'game' parts out to streamline themselves as works of interactive fiction. But with Deadly Premonition, you're forced to play it. It makes the mistake of thinking that it could ever work as a conventional game.

You will drive for fucking hours, memorising directions from the map only accessible from the pause menu. You will yawn as York walks through doors but first checks what's behind them and this process somehow feels like it takes hours. You will yawn as you shoot ghosts from a stationary position. You will quit the game as you take a wrong turn somewhere and your car turns around really slowly and then hits a tree. You will wonder why the map is so large as you are driving for fucking hours and memorising directions. And these are all relevant criticisms because you're forced to do all of this and all of this will happen

And yet you will delight in York's schizophrenic monologues to his imaginary friend Zach. On tedious drives you get Patrick Bateman-esque descriptions of 80s films and film scores, both insightful and disturbingly relatable. You will want to check up on townsfolk as they're genuinely interesting. You will wince as York mentions cutting off peoples' heads, peeing in their skulls, and drinking it, over dinner. You will be seduced by the game's drowsy tone, and every now and then the shift into horror will genuinely disturb you because for an hour or so you were comfortable. You might even get scared of the Raincoat Killer, although encounters with him are Quick time events and so feel like minigames.

You might not care enough to solve the mystery at hand, but as with Twin Peaks, this is beside the point.

Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine. 

Here's a list as to why it sucks:
Crashes often
Plot is barely explained
Plot holes
Graphics are terrible
Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme]
Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently)
Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?)
Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often)
Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use)
AI is weird
Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...)
Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways)
There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))

And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are. 

Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!

I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song ""Life is Beautiful"" holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable. 

Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story.

Главная роль в этой игре, представляющей собой сэндбокс с сайд-квестами, отведена агенту ФБР Йорку Моргану - в некотором роде аналогу небезызвестного Агента Купера, но с куда более странными тараканами в своей прокуренной голове и кофеином вместо мозгов. Страдает раздвоением личности. Само собой, такая особенность здесь неспроста и преподнесёт немало интересных сюрпризов игрокам, отвыкшим от неординарных игровых персонажей. Сюжет - выше всех похвал!

A few hardware issues:
#Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 & 7.1 surround is a no-no)
#Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is       resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all.  This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.)
#Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)

All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky.  The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.

The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.

The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.

The controls are not that great.

And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.

So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).

Для начала хочу сказать, что про игру перед покупкой ничего не знал. Видел пару скриншотов и роликов, но толком ничего не понял. Выбор основывался на рецензиях в стиме, которые оказались очень лестными. 

  Начнем с сюжета. Первые часы подется он в размеренном темпе, НО ближе к середине игры интерес к событиям взлетает до небес. Честно говоря, меня так затянуло что я сидел 5-6 часов не вставая. Ближе к концу события разворачиваются так стремительно, что ты просто сидишь с открытым ртом и единственные слова, которые слетают с уст, это матерные слова и междометия, характеризующие степень твоего шока. 
  Но все это относится к диалогам и роликам. Геймплей же наоборот немного отвлекает от всего этого. Сам по себе он представляет, что то среднее между Silent hill и Resident evil (начиная с 4ой). 
  В игре много чем можно заняться: рыбачить, собирать карточки, выполнять побочные миссии о паранормальных местах и т.д. Пока я играл я думал, что соберу все плюшки, карточки, и выполню побочные задания. Первое время так и было я бегал выполнял и собирал. Но потом, когда меня затянул сюжет, я уже не хотел ничего, лишь бы узнать, что будет дальше
  Так же мне приглянулась музыка. Оооо ломаную мелодию, игравшую при появлении убийцы, я долго еще не забуду.
Минусы есть... точнее сказать минус тут один, но я напишу еще пару своих придирок.
  Мне не понравилось, что город не выглядит как одно целое. Приходится много ездить на машине, и чаще всего пейзаж за окном  это лес.... супер. Так же мне не понравилось, что все магазины и бары работают строго в свой график работы... Ладно когда это магазин работающий с 8:00до 20:00; но некоторые заведения открываются только на несколько часов, а афроамериканец работающий в оружейном магазине вообще вампир.... он работает с 21:00 до 6:00. Время в игре идет медленно. Часто чтобы его скоротать просто спишь или выполняешь другие задания. 
 Главный минус это огрехи с графикой. Галстук проваливающийся сквозь персонажа или же главный герой, который лег спать и ползет (баг) спиной по кровати, проходя головой сквозь подушку. Но все это не смертельно. Например, те же баги с графикой делют игру круче. У меня часто был баг из-за которого главный герой курил 2 сигареты сразу (1 в зубах, 1в руке). Это как герой боевика с двумя пистолетами, вдвойне круто :D 
 Иногда во время разговоров у героев не открывается рот, а иногда наоборот (он открывается, но герой не движется). Такое ощущение что у разработчиков либо не хватило средств, либо их очень торопили.

 Видно, что люди старались. Частенько игра показывает хорошую работу камеры в роликах. И если вы готовы закрыть глаза на минусы, то вас ждут незабываемые ощущения. Это одна из тех немногих игр, проходя которую меня зацепило. Заслужено в моем топе лучших.
Это приключение я запомню на долго.

 ФУуУуух 
 Только что прошел игру. Рецензий до этого не писал. На часах 5:30 утра....
 Приятной игры.

Я узнал ,что это баг, а не задумка разрабов только на последнем боссе ) , разрешение 720р и т.д. НО сюжет, юмор и музыкальное сопровождение перекрывают все недостатки .Ради  них стоит ее пройти . Как уже не раз упоминалось- сюжет и некоторые персонажи смахивают на таковых в Твин Пикс . Еще один минус -отсутствие локализации . Поэтому я ее прошел только сейчас ,как нашел русификатор. Над русификатором трудились ZoG , но у них были проблемы со сроками выхода (они постоянно их откладывали). Поэтому кто-то не выдержал и выложил бетку перевода ( с ней игра проходится на 100%). Но это уже другая история .

Pelin päähenkilönä on eriko... eriTYISagentti York. Ja York-parallahan ei ole kaikki inkkarit päässeet kanoottiin asti. Kanootti ajelehtii tyhjillään virran mukana, pari intiaania yrittää hädissään roikkua vielä veden varassa laidasta kiinni pitäen ja loput ovat hukkuneet ajat sitten.

Yorkin esittely on hyvä aloittaa siitä, miten hän itse esittäytyy. Aina, kun York tapaa uuden ihmisen, tahtoo hän kohteliaana ihmisenä esittäytyä ihan virallisesti virkamerkin kera - huolimatta siitä, että toinen osapuoli tietää Yorkin jo entuudestaan. ""Erityisagentti York"" ja virkamerkki tyylikkäästi käsivarsi suorana esillle. York-parka ilmeisesti luulee, että näin saa toimintaa jokaiseen esittäytymiseenkin. Ei, ei saa. Tahatonta komediaa tosin senkin edestä. Lisäksi York puhuu mielikuvituskaverilleen jatkuvalla syötöllä, saa kuvitteellisia puheluita, tripahtelee kahvikuppiinsa ja kaiken huipuksi hallusinoi missä ja milloin vain.

Onneksi York on kuitenkin niin tottunut tähän menoon, ettei hätkähdä hallusinaatioista tippaakaan. Kerälle käpertymisen sijaan hän taistelee tiensä läpi näkyjen ja jättää ne sitten välittömästi taakseen. Mitä sitä nyt arkipäivästä hätkähtämään. Yorkin mielestä nopeat pikkupuzzlet (tiedättehän, ne vakiot, mitä on varmaan jokaisessa pelissä, ne sellaiset ""mitäs tässä pitää... ahaa, joo, näin. *klik klik* Läpi meni."") ovat suurtakin suurempaa ""älyjen taistoa"", joista kannattaa kuittailla hyvä tovi. On vielä arvoitus, miten York on erik... erityisagentiksi päässyt. Joko FBI:n on käynyt niin kovasti sääliksi reppanaa, että ovat päättäneet antaa virkamerkin ja erityisagentin arvon ihan tuosta vain tai sitten peli päättyy siihen, kun kuvataan jossain mielisairaalassa olevaa Yorkia leikkimässä poliisiauton näköisellä pikkuautolla.

Autoista puheen ollen: Pelissä on ""realistinen"" liikenne, jonka toteuttamiseen on nähty ""paljon"" vaivaa ja osaamista. Huonon ohjattavuuden vuoksi auton nopeutta on pakko pudottaa ja tällöin näkee kaikkea kiinnostavaa. Vastaantulevat autot ajavat ojaan ohitettuaan kohdan, jossa pelaajan kuuluisi olla menossa ja katoavat heti tämän jälkeen maan alle. Arvoitukseksi jää, tuhoutuvatko ne maan alla vai jatkavatko salaista, maanalaista reittiä takaisin lähtöpisteeseensä, jotta voivat kohta ajaa saman reitin uudelleen. Ja parkkipaikalle kääntyvät autot eivät pysähdykään parkkiin, vaan jatkavatkin käännöstään läpi parkkipaikan. Tyylikästä.

Perinteistä selviytymiskauhua tästä on turha odottaa, mutta viihdettä tämä kyllä tarjoaa. Tovin pelaamisen jälkeen videoita ei pysty enää katsomaan nauramatta, sillä jokainen sekunti saa odottamaan entistä enemmän mitä seuraavaksi tapahtuu. Lopulta sitä nauraa jokaiselle videolle riippumatta mitä siinä tapahtuu.

Kannattaa ehdottomasti pelata huumorintajuisen kaverin seurassa. Syömistä ja juomista pelin aikana täytyy välttää tukehtumisriskin takia.

Peli on sellaisenaan karmivaa katseltavaa johtuen lukitusta resoluutiosta, mutta helppokäyttöinen DPFix korjaa asian ja tekee ison eron grafiikkaan. Pakollinen lataus, sanoisin. Kaatuilua ja muita ongelmia pelissä esiintyy ilmeisesti suhteellisen paljon, näiden ratkaisemiseksi löytää erilaisia vinkkejä kyllä netistä.

Kaatuilun ja muiden mahdollisten ongelmien vuoksi voikin olla hyvä idea odottaa, että peli on tarjouksessa tai jossain bundlessa halvalla. Kyllä tämä ainakin muutaman euron arvoinen on ihan kevyesti.

While not great at a technical standard, Deadly Premonition has some of the most memorable moments in gaming history. A great story, an open sandbox world, interesting characters and a huge variety of other in game tasks to complete besides the main story.

One of the most interesting things about DP (not deep pen) is the atmosphere. Tasked with trying to bring a killer to justice, you and a motley crew of under staffed local law enforces team up to tackle the rain coat killer. A mysterious individual who is going around town killing innocent women. The setting in the game is just amazing. As I said before, it's not a great technical achievement, but it doesn't have to be. Gameplay over graphics is always a motto I have said and stuck by. Set in an idyllic town set in the mountains you generally feel alone and constantly fighting to find out where to take your mystery solving crew next. 

One scene has you hiding from the rain coat kliller as he chops down the door with an axe. Do you run? Do you hide? It's frantic and engaging and people will love the humour in this game. It's a light touch that is needed at certain points throughout the game.

This game is an utter joy to play and you will easily get 40+ hours form it.

This is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.

Did you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.

Mr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.

Please, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present. 

If you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it.

However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years.

Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it.

The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the ""So bad it's good"" type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain. 

Everything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.

The gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.

The game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.

The game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.

The game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp5krDoflLI&hd=1

Do I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.

Deadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.

Basically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.

But even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.

Which brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.",1402648322,1413370109,True,25,0,0.718654513359069824,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Los gáficos parecen sacados de 1997, límitado a 720p y sin ninguna opción gráfica para configurar, además, el rendimiento es pésimo y cada dos por tres deja de funcionar. Alguna que otra vez las cinemáticas van lentas y hay que reinciar el PC para solucionarlo. Los controles pueden dejar de responder de manera aleatoria, no todos son redefinibles y los niveles de aceleración negativa en el ratón rozan lo absurdo. De manera ocasional puede distorsionarse el audio.

El gameplay es tosco y simplón, solo hay un tipo de enemigo durante el 99% del juego, los puzles son simples y tediosos, el pueblo es innecesariamente grande y el control de los coches deja muchísimo que desear.

La historia no tiene ningún sentido, las cinemáticas son un conjunto de diálogos absurdos y en la mayoría de los casos la música que las acompaña, además de inapropiada,  suena demasiado fuerte dificultando escuchar a los personajes. A todo eso hay que sumarle que cada cinemática parece tener su propio nivel de volumen, a veces suenan muy alto y otras ni se escuchan.

Cualquiera de estos factores por separado sólo podrían pertenecer a un juego mediocre, pero si lo mezclamos junto a una gran cantidad de misiones secundarias y objetos coleccionables, le sumamos lo pintoresco de la mayoría de personajes que conforman Greenvale y todo ello revuelto con grandes dosis de humor obtenemos una combinacíón muy difícil de superar.

The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch.

If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play.  I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene.  This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again.  Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying.

Deadly Premonition is a game I have only played for five hours, but am completely in love with. And by all rights, I shouldn't be. The graphics are PS2-era, the combat is mostly a Resident Evil 4-esque ""stand still and aim with a relatively poor laser sight"" system against enemies, the voice acting is often laughable, the music is repetitive (I'm pretty sure there are only about five or so tracks) and often plays at the most random and unfitting of moments... It's a recipe for an absolutely terrible game.

In fact, I quit during the first half an hour, regretting my buy. But something... Strange.. Urged me to go back to it. Perhaps it was my desire for a survival horror game that I've never played before, or just that I was bored out of my skull and decided to give it another chance, I don't know... But I'm so glad I did.

The first 20 or so minutes is a really bland, boring, linear shooting section with minamilistic horror at best, but once I got past that, the game, and indeed the world, opened up. 

That was my first surprise: the game is open world. It's quite large, too, filled with interesting characters, side-quests and locations to visit. And facial animations, oh lord, those facial animations. The main character sometimes smiles a smile so horrifyingly terrible that I'm almost convinced it's actually a genius ploy by the developers to show how Detective York might actually have some sort of severe autism and is incapable of natural emotion. He sure seems like it, sometimes.

Detective York is the strongest point of the game. An antisocial FBI lone-wolf detective/criminal profiler. York's character ranges from amusing, to awkward, to being an absolute arse. He's completely foreign to socializing in the 'normal' way and doesn't care to hurt feelings if it furthers his case. He also has a (perhaps unhealthy) interest in the murders of young women, knows everything there is to know about terrible 80's movies and... Oh yeah, did I mention he also talks to himself? The mysterious Zach (who I'm certain is actually supposed to represent the player, but there might be a big twist that I don't yet know about) seems to be some kind of imaginary friend, or split personality, that York often converses with, though you never hear Zach converse back. 

York is also an absolute genius, as proven at multiple points throughout the game. He solves riddles, rolls his eyes at stupidity and sees those miniscule details that solves cases that no-one else seems to see. He's also good at reading people, too. This leads on to the second strongest point: the plot. I won't spoil anything, and I haven't gotten too far yet, but so far I'm absolutely enthralled by this game's story. The characters are all memorable (if unintentionally awful and hilarious) and the crime, concerning that of the ritualistic slaying of the town beauty Anna, is brilliantly thought out and genuinely interesting to experience and solve - which is the main storyline of the game. 

Gameplay-wise, Deadly Premonition has so far been split into two sections: the ""open-world"" section, during which one is free to travel (except for certain missions) around a clearly polygonal and badly textured landscape that is somehow full of character. York can interact with people, go to stores, complete side-missions, solve puzzles and look for clues pertaining to the case. He must also keep tabs on sleep and hunger, which both decrease over time and give debuffs to his stats. 

The second section is the combat section, which is almost a dungeon crawl. Here, York encounters supernatural enemies and phenomenom, and has his run-ins with the games primary antagonist, The Raincoat Killer. As explained earlier, this section mostly involves shooting or battering down enemies (with melee weapons that break over time), solving puzzles and finding clues. A friend has told me it also grows to include chase-sequences and hiding-sequences in the future. York also has limited stealth capacity, in which he can hold his breath to become invisible to enemies. This has limited use, but is a good addition non-the-less. Shooting involves standing still and aiming the weapon, though guns have a rather difficult to see laser sight which makes aiming at distance hard. Enemies are zombie-like, but can have sudden bursts of unnatural (and creepy) speed and groan out things like ""don't want to die"" when you kill them. The two primary stats in combat are health and heart-rate/stamina. Health is self explanatory, while stamina is interesting in that it contributes to your tiredness, but also decides how long you can sprint and hold your breath. Your stamina recovers quickly when idle, so it's not a big problem. 

One of the most interesting things about these supernatural sequences is York's reaction.. Or lack thereof. He doesn't actually seem to give a shit that all these completely insane and clearly supernatural-in-origin things are going on. He never reacts negatively, nor does he ever tell anyone or even so much as ask ""did you see that?!"". It's part of his charm, and makes sense in that it adds to the possibility York might actually be a fearless, no-fuck-giving psychopath, or at least a cold-hearted bastard. 

I HIGHLY recommend this game to EVERYONE. This is one of the few games that gets a perfect score from me... An absolute 10/10, despite the poor graphics and PS2-era gameplay.",1399915742,1399915810,True,1,0,0.518201291561126709,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.

The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.

The next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.

The rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.

Heavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.

Deadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed.  And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your ass off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.

But it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.

Deadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.

Deadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience. 

And it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits). 

The PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.

But it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.

Deadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.",1399206317,1418734321,True,262,2,0.902727842330932617,9,True,False,False,False,,,

You as a detective York investigate the murder of a girl, and the further you go the better story gets. But not everyone will like this game because sometimes it gets weird - one moment you are terrified due to some horrible things happening and then a few seconds later characters make stupid jokes and laugh. So not everyone will like this mixture.

I can't recommend it to everyone due to some other issue - stability. The port is not very good. Some people can't launch it at all, some others complain because game crashes every few minutes. I had a few problems, but luckily managed to complete it without any serious problems.

Pros:
+ Lovable characters in a charming setting
+ Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing
+ Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot
+ Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore

Cons:
- Frequent crashes (both random & reproducable)
- Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs
- Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX
- An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food & sleep were almost never needed)
- Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable
- Terribly timed and overused QTEs
- Tons of muddy, low-rez textures
- Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes
- A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game


Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.


Spoilers below, you have been warned!

I went into Deadly Premonition expecting ""Resident Evil with FBI Agents"" and instead received ""Shenmu with Zombies"". While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.

Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce ""supernatural"" elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 & 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.

All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.

While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with ""Previously during the investigation..."" segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.",1396846896,1396847107,True,1,0,0.458566516637802124,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The jankiness of the PC port evaporated along with the essential widescreen patch (YMMV however) and what was left was something that was in equal parts charming, kooky and memorable. It's an action adventure that wears its influences with pride and revels in its clunkiness.

W Deadly Premonition wcielamy się w rolę detektywa z FBI - faceta gadającego ze sobą, najwyraźniej chorego na rozdwojenie jaźni i róznego rodzaju obsesje. Ale w grze nikogo to nie dziwi. Nikomu nawet na myśl nie przyjdzie zakuć go w kaftan i odesłać do wariatkowa. 
Jak na agenta FBI przystało , Morgan (sorry York, a może Zach) przybywa na amerykańskie zadupie rozwiązać sprawę bulwersującego morderstwa. Mieszkańcy owego zadupia to banda stuknietych psychopatów, przerysowane zachowania i brak ich autentyczności cały czas przypomina że to tylko gra i do tego japońska. Dialogi i towarzyszące im animacje postaci potrafiły sprawić u mnie opad szczęki, cud że me oczy i uszy nie zaczeły krwawić. 
Gra oprócz głownego wątku pozwala nam ""nacieszyć"" się misjami pobocznymi, z reguły dość prostymi - znajdź cos , przewieź kogoś itp. podczas poszukiwania których możemy pozwiedzać sobie Greenvale. Niczym w GTA ;) siadamy za sterami samochodu i eksplorujemy okolicę. Fizyka jazdy zasługuje jednak na osobna wzmiankę - chociaż w zasadzie to jest ona [u]nie-do-opi-sa-nia[/u]. To trzeba przeżyć samemu.
Sekwencje walki , których w grze nie brakuje, są dość wyraźne oddzielone od części fabularnej czy ekploracyjnej - najbliżej im chyba do Residenta 4 - takie miałem przez cały czas skojarzenie (są dość anemiczne i archaincze aż głowa boli).

[b]Grafika[/b] - jest brzydka, stara i obleśna - jakbym spotkał na ulicy to bym wiał gdzie pieprz rośnie. Warto poszukać fixów które pozwolą na grę w 1080p czy dodadzą jakieś efekty graficzne, ale nie myślcie że to coś pomoże.

[b]Dźwięk[/b] - o ile nagrane głosy są dość adekwatne do postaci i zagrane w miarę dobrze to cała reszta woła o pomstę do nieba, efekty dźwiękowe, bełkotanie zombiaków, czy odgłosy silnika samochodu nie są tym do czego przywykł współczesny gracz. Muzyka na początek dość neutralna po paru godzinach zaczyna doprowadzać do szału - należy tu wspomnieć że te kilka wystepujących tematów zmienia się w zaleźności od sytuacji czy nastroju. Och jeszcze przewodni kawałek wokalny - chyba miał zachwycać - ale kogo, chyba członków związku głuchoniemych (bez obrazy).

Na moim kompie gra nie zwieszała się (może raz) , jednak po zainstalowaniu modów 99% wykorzystania radka 7870xt przy takich wizualizacjach to chyba przesada. Grałem padem i było znośnie - nie wiem jak z obsługą klawiery i myszki , podobno nie najlepiej.

Ale zapytacie czemu w takim razie grę polecam ? To proste, [b]bo gdzieś w tym wszystkim ukryty jest jakiś klimat, nieuchwytne coś czego brakuje wielu dużo lepszym grom[/b], a poza tym skoro JA skończyłem Deadly Premonition to WY też możecie, PRAWDA ? Niezapomniane wrażenia gwarantowane.

So the two of us got on like a house on fire. Due to the low budget, the gameplay mechanics, graphic and sound aren't all that refined. Despite all that this game has charm and a lot of it. Its twin peak setting is pretty unique and there is lots to do in this open world survival horror. In fact this is the first true open world survival horror game I can think of (Silent Hill doesn't count). Despite the simple gameplay mechanics it does play like resident evil 4  with its over the shoulder gunplay. While the controls really need sorting out, the game is still fun to play. However while the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have a few glitches, this PC port has lots. There is nothing game breaking but you will find a lot of missing textures, frame rate problem and sometimes mechanical problems like the controller not being responsive. This is best played with mouse and keyboard because the controller controls are clunky and are pretty much broken for the most part. 

Despite all its flaws I had a hell of a time playing this. There is a reason why I have bought this on every platform and that reason is because of its originality.

1.- Always save your progress!
2.- Execute the games as windows 98 compatibility mode and run it as administrator.
3.- To avoid black screens when you quit the game manually, minimize the window game and close it with right click.
4- When you start playing the game ok, then it starts dropping the framerates and keep 20fps, minimize the gaame and close the window. Enter the game and load your progress and game will run fine smooth again. Do this every 1h of gameplay.

There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious game, or possibly several. The writing is clever, the humor is odd in a good way, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story is really what kept me going, that and just wanting to see what the game would throw at me next. Usually something completely unexpected, especially when it comes to dialogue.

It's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least decent and often genuinely good. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying. 

Combat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.

The freeroam stuff, while novel and ambitious, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective, unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing. It's a shame the game doesn't actually utilize the world simulation aspects more, as apparently all characters have meticulous daily activities which you can observe by peeking through their windows and following them around. You just don't have any reason to do so, other than curiosity.

Thankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse instead of a controller, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend (the player). These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the main character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.

The music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have a weird dissonance between the music and the feel of the scene. Some of it is probably intentional, but it's hard to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely great, and it's definitely an unique soundtrack. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.

Basically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you. Or not. The divisive reputation is certainly well deserved as even though I've spent quite a number of hours in it, it's still hard to recommend the game to anyone that isn't me.",1394663059,1516642197,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Jugabilidad: Perfecta. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, y cuando quieras. Cada personaje esconde un mundo, un mundo que tú puedes explorar, desde la conserja del hotel, hasta el cocinero del restaurante esconden secretos. Eres un agente del FBI, y puedes hacer lo que hace un agente del FBI, investigar. (Ahora, si te vas directamente a la misión principal como un loco, luego dirás que el juego está capado)

Gráficos: 4K. Sinceramente, es algo que cuando acabas el juego, realmente los prefieres así, como si fuesen ""old school"". Yo pienso que unos gráficos triple A lo único que hubiesen conseguido en este título hubiese sido tapar su magia. Por así decirlo, al no tener un aspecto visual impresionante, nos fijamos en todos los pequeños detalles de este gran título, que creedme que son miles.

Sonido: Aquí hay 2 cosas de las que hablar. Sonidos, hablando de efectos de sonido, como puertas, diálogos, armas, etc. y BSO. Los sonidos, están bien, pero hay alguno que quizá no pegue en su sitio y parezca que lo han metido a presión. Y hablando de la banda sonora, es simplemente... maravillosa... una obra maestra. ¿Habéis visto Twin Peaks? Pues volveréis a experimentar esa sensación que sentíais escuchando las canciones compuestas Por angelo Badalamenti. Y si no la visteis, creedme, vais a experimentar algo totalmente mágico.

Ahora, el punto fuerte de este juego, es la historia, y a su vez, la mezcla de todos los anteriores apartados, que hacen una mezcla genial. 

20 Horas de trama principal, y 20 horas añadiendo misiones secundarias, una OST de cine, una historia que no tendrá pendientes de York y compañía el 100% del trayecto, y una experiencia que no podremos olvidar nunca.

Живые, необычные персонажи, мрачная и чарующая атмосфера города, затерявшегося в бескрайних лесах Америки, интересная, интригующая до самого конца история, замечательный протагонист. Городок живет своей жизнью, там всегда есть чем заняться, есть большое количество сайдквестов и секретов, даже некоторое оружие вроде РПГ и огнемета можно получить только при выполнении определенных заданий. Все это вместе не отпускает от игры, хочется пройти ее до конца и узнать чем же все закончилось. Это положительные моменты.
Из отрицательных моментов могу выделить:
- Качество самого порта. Фиксы накатывать обязательно (в стиме есть инструкция по употреблению, к прочтению обязательна) и даже с ними случаются вылеты (сохраняться лучше при любом удобном случае), графика времен PS2, 30 фпс (с другой стороны они стабильные и не падают). Если графику еще можно пережить и в этом часть очарования игры, то вылеты сильно портят впечатление. Особенно когда ты ехал 5 км до пункта назначения а сохраниться не успел. А ездить в игре приходится довольно часто.
- На фоне отличной истории, душевных диалогов и красивых катсцен игра выдает странный геймплей. Боевка в Deadly Premonition крепкий среднячок, не плохая и не хорошая. Весьма странным, хоть и слегка оправданным решением было выдать с самого начала пистолет с бесконечными патронами, при этом холодное оружие ломается после десятка ударов. Ну понятно что мы играем за агента ФБР и махать бейсбольной битой вместо стрельбы из табельного оружия ему не с руки, да и я очень люблю в таких играх стрелять, но враги-то тупые и медленные, поэтому выживача не чувствуется. Так же местами переборщили  с QTE, там где можно было обойтись без этого.
При всем при этом игра настолько душевна, что о минусах как-то и забываешь. Пока не натыкаешься на них в очередной раз. Потом снова забываешь и по настоящему наслаждаешься игрой.
Стоит ли играть в Deadly Premonition? Определенно стоит. Она дает тебе такие ощущения, которые очень редко встречаешь в современных играх. Я влюбился в эту игру с первого взгляда и не был ей разочарован несмотря на ее недостатки до самого конца.

On one side, it's a mechanical mess. Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).

But on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.

It is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of ""Weirdest game I've ever played"", ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show.

As a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like. shit. It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.

As a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.


The Gold:
Really quirky casts
WTF is wrong with this music?!
The amazing attention to details
York's amazing knowledge of old movies


I can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is [spoiler]the dog[/spoiler], but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that [spoiler]fur coat[/spoiler]. (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered.  So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so.  Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome.  In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where.  You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business.  If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games.  You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about.  I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.


The Unnecessary:
Your piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientation
Clunky combat and driving controls
End game railroading
DBZ boss battles and worse dialogue


Time for the really shit parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem...  Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.

This is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. ""Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!"" You kill the asshole. "":cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111"" Fuck. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game. Any boss battle with more than 2 forms is considered obnoxious. Your boss dialogue is contrived, half assed, simply moustache twirling level evil. Where's that button for taunting or bitch slapping my opponent!? Have you dealt with the final boss in Ace Attorney Investigator? Yeah, that really dragged on didn't it? Remember: time crunch, memory leak, game explode? Ugh. I've actually had to skip quite a few vital plot scenes before the boss battles for fear of the game crashing. (and I couldn’t stomach the big bad’s writing anymore) It turned out to be a smart move, because it DID drag on. Why why WHY? You had such a great start...

I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.

A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:

I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.

Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.

There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer. 

I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.",1392896574,1392896713,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time. 

I can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable. Provided that it works...

・バグで落ちやすい（これが致命的。フォーラムのバグ回避方法も万能ではない。）
・グラフィックは一昔前の低解像度
・モーションが微妙

・ガンアクションの操作が独特
・車のガス欠が足枷になる
・日本語対応していない（そんなに難しくはないので、ほぼ支障はない）

良い点
・ストーリーの出来が良い（評価が高い理由はこれ）
・キャラクターが立っている、グラフィックが悪い割には表情が豊か

И как-то мой взгляд пал на Deadly premonition. По описанию все выглядело весьма заманчиво, но одно смущало - очень низкие рейтинги. В свое время известный американский отдел IGN дал игре оценку в 2.5 балла, сказав, что играть в нее это  настоящая боль. Но интерес взял свое и в итоге я приобрел игру и начал играть.

Что можно сказать - это одна из самых лучших игр, в которую я когда-либо играл. Простая, на первый взгляд, история окажется полна неожиданных поворотов. В этом и заключается главный плюс игры - в ней потрясающий сюжет, в котором поначалу создается саспенс, а по развитию атмосфера нагнетается все больше и больше. Это тот тип игры, где вы будете сидеть в ожидании того, что последует дальше, а узнав новую деталь, будете удивлены, а это создаст еще больший интерес к последующему. Каждый персонаж уникален и интересен, у каждого есть своя история, привычки и ближе к середине, они станут вам как родными. Чего только стоит главный герой - не буду спойлерить,  мы же не хотим рассказать им больше нужного, верно Зак?

В остальном Deadly Premonition - это открытый мир, который можно исследовать с весьма устаревшей графикой и немного скучным геймплеем, где нужно убивать однотипных монстров. Но, как и было сказано, именно история держит в напряжении до самого конца, а исследовать город интересно только для того, чтобы узнать поближе персожей и их истории.

Можно говорить очень долго о том, насколько Deadly Premonition уникальна, но подведу итоги. Если вам нравятся тип игр, где сюжет - это самый важный аспект игры, где вначале задается огромное число вопросов, и вы по мере прохождения будете потихоньку получать на них ответы и складывать полноценную картину - то это то, что вам нужно. История настолько интересна, что здесь расскажется обо всем и про все и в конце не останется никаких вопросов. Если вы хотите просто пострелять, полюбоваться графоном - то просто обойдите это творение. Но если вы любите лихо закрученные мистические истории, то Deadly Premonition должна обязательно быть в вашей коллекции.

Verdict?

A++++++++++++++. 1000 out of 100

The greatest game I have ever, ever played. More deserving of the title 'Game of the Year' than any single game ever. Better than Ocarina of Time. Better than Fallout. Better than Grand Theft Auto. The true Famitsu would've given this game 280 out of 40.

Let me explain my scores up there some more. The graphics look like they belong to a game from the middle of the PS2 era, the controls are horrific. The music is amazing, but most of what makes it amazing is the timing of it. Sitting down around a table somber just after someone died? Bring on the whistling! But what truly makes this game shine, is the story and the characters. Every single character is interesting and lovable, though not always to the same person - for example I hate Raging Bull Jack, but I'm quite sure someone out there thinks Jack is hilarious.

For $24.99, this is one game you should not miss out on. So buy it, and get hype for the greatest game ever.

Разработка начиналась на PS2, в итоге игра вышла на XBOX 360, а потом была портирована на PS3 и наконец на PC. За устаревшую графику, неудобное управление, многочисленные глюки, практически никакую боевку, дурацкую физику автомобилей её не критиковал только ленивый. Но это как раз тот редкий случай когда играют не смотря ни на что. Переигрывая почти всю игру из за пропавшего из инвентаря ключа, ломая джойстик в QTE сценах, ведя автомобиль из края в край карты по 5 раз за миссию и проклиная создателей, люди играли в нее. Почему? Все просто - сюжет и атмосфера. 

Охарактеризовать сюжет можно одним словом... вернее двумя - Твин Пикс. Агент ФБР Френсис Йорк Морган приезжает в глухой американский городок расследовать убийство молодой девушки. Ничего не напоминает? Однако надо учитывать то, что игру делали японцы и в итоге получилась ядреная смесь из forbidden siren, silent hill, fatal frame и собственно Twin Peaks. Главный герой  руководствуется подсказками от утреннего кофе и проводит расследования мест преступлений  в ""альтернативном"" городе. Не говоря уже о том, что у него явно прогрессирующее раздвоение личности. При этом сказать, что он не дружит с головой нельзя. Зак - его лучший друг :)

Атмосфера... Очень хорошо передана атмосфера тихого американского городка. Но как сказал Стивен Кинг - именно в таких городках творятся всякие ужасные вещи. Персонажи, так или иначе связаные с расследованием очень хорошо проработаны... и их довольно много. Практически у каждого найдется, что сказать Главному герою и о чем попростить (некоторые дополнительные квесты, хоть и необязательны но здорово облегчают жизнь). Игра происходит в так называемом открытом мире. Герой не занятый на миссии может побродить по окресностям, половить рыбу, пособирать карты. Вломится в дом к подозреваемым размахивая удостоверением агента ФБР к сожалению не получится, но полноценную слежку при желании организовать можно.

К сожалению игра абсолютно линейна. Что бы вы не делали концовка одна. Главный герой иногда отчаянно тупит - особенно под конец. Вы скорее всего догадаетесь, кто в игре главный бяка задолго до Йорка с Заком вместе взятых. 


Любителям японских хорроров игра категорически рекомендуется к ознакомлению.

NO, it gives you a marker to that mission and keeps telling you to come back, so in order to get to the mission I have to drive half way across town to the only sleeping bag not behind locked doors over half my cars gas. Oh did I forget to mention that? Cars have gas, so if you didnt do what I did after about an hour of searching for the sleeping bag and look it up online, you'll run out of gas and be screwed. The Enemies are a complete joke they are ALL ""ghosts"" that do nothing but bend over backwards like a haunted yoga instructer, never actually doing much besides walking slower than the earth turns towards you. They do get weapons but then all the do is just hold them up to thier faces and again never actually do anything. All in all dont waste your time, the game is terrible, the plot works mostly but the game is so horrible broken and terrible that you'll never want to get past the second case with out uninstalling it. 1/10",1391340088,1391340136,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love this game, I didn't want it to end. It's a good game and that comes despite it's inherent jankiness. Lets face it, the graphics are terrible, the combat is repetitive and boring and it crashes far too often. But those aren't what's important in this game.

York is one of the most interesting game characters I've played. He's a pleasure to get to know as the game peels back layers of his personality and you come to genuinely care for him.
The town, Greenvale, feels more alive than many game towns. It's full of personalities that while they may be one note quirks, are interesting and often have a reason or a story behind their quirk. I recommend you do the side quests which uncover these stories. 
The game makes you care about it's characters and that makes the story have impact. I won't spoil the story because you need to play it yourself.

This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.

I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...

First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these ""quests"" are like ""find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM"" (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), ""find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)"", ""find sheriff's dumbbell"", ""find sheriff's assistant's keys"" and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...

...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like ""guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff"" and just push you through till the end. Seriously, fuck quests I didn't finish! Fuck exploring! Surprise, motherfucker!

Deadly Premonition Review:

I usually have an average experience on most modern horror games like Outlast for example (I'm a very picky person on what I think is a good horror game) but this game gave me the best experience in the psychological, mystery horror genre & I'm going to try to explain why.

Well for starters this game has one of the most interesting main characters in the world of horror. His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) & he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his ""Profiling"" skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) & the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).

One of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is ""Bat shit crazy"" (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) & I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) & I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the fuck off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories & the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend & my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer & we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) & the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.

Overall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown & to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review & I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).",1390814986,1417500124,True,10,0,0.626897752285003662,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Геймплей:
Мы же расскажем им про тело....тело игры, Зак? (я, агент ФБР Фрэнсис Йорк Морган, все важные вопросы решаю со своей лучшей половиной). Нет ни одного способа конкретно описать жанр данного творения. Ясно, как божий день, что перед нами песочница, но в ней нет обычного песка, а тот, который остался весь какой-то непонятный и разговаривает. Во-первых: это игра в открытом мире, во-вторых: это тотально заточенная под сюжет игра (сюжет - весь мир вокруг вас), в-третьих: это самый настоящий триллер (Лектор, привет!), в-четвертых: это детективная история с настоящими расследованиями и свидетелями, в-пятых: это хоррор, не очень страшный, но все же, в-шестых: это прямо-таки театральная драма с колоритными персонажами и их проблемами, в-седьмых: это комедия с характерным японским оттенком юмора. Это игра, которой на вас, как на игрока плевать, она самодостаточна и не собирается вам ничего объяснять. Вам вообще сразу дадут понять, что тут таких не любят. Блджад, такого как эта игра никогда ещё не было. Как будто Пикассо и Ван Гог нарисовали картину ""Три Медведя (утро в сосновом лесу)"". Все, больше никаких комментариев о геймплее, обязательно играйте сами.  

Сюжет:
*Кручу пальцем у виска* Он есть, он везде, он понятен и непонятен в одно и то же время. Главная фишка сюжета в том (прям как в Масс Эффект), что он практически полностью выстроен на персонажах (живых или мертвых), а не на записках и фотографиях черных ящиков. Не хочу повторяться, но каждая песчинка игры - это сюжет, постойте..я вру, сюжета больше, чем самой игры. Сюжет настолько нетривиален, что порой возникает впечатление. что вы находитесь в палате № 6. А ещё это Твин Пикс. 

Графика и саундтрек:
Графика - слабая сторона игры. Даже не столько текстуры и эффекты, а тот факт, что все это безумное великолепие сделано лишь под 720р. Конечно, благодаря сторонней помощи можно обойти это ограничение без проблем, но осадок остается. Саундтрек - просто нечто, буду краток это рок и при первой скидке (любой) я сразу же его куплю.

Итог:

Ich bitte euch, vertraut NICHT auf den Metascore, das ist die Meinung von vielen Zeitschriften Kritikern Blah Blah Blah... Die Meinungen zu diesen Spiel sind zwiespaltig, aber ich verachte und verstehe die Leute nicht die diesem Spiel 1 von 10 geben oder sonstiges da dieses Spiel es nicht verdient hat!!!
Ihr habt es hier mit mit einem Survival-Horror-Game zu tun was eines der ersten Xbox-Games war und jetzt seit kurzem sowohl für PC als auch für die PS3 rauskamen. Das alles haben wir den lieben ""Swery"" zu verdanken der diese Spiel auf andere Platformen rausbrachte. Auch ein großes danke an die Community und Steam die dieses Spiel auf Steam veröffentlicht haben.

!SPOILER (naja worum es im Spiel halt geht, ich erzähl euch nix von dem geschen)!
Okay in diesem Spiel handelt es sich um einen FBI-Agenten namens Francis York Morgan (""just call me York, thats what everyone call me..."") womit ihr es schon mit dem besten Charakter seit langem zu tun hat. Er ist allerdings nicht der Einzige, der so ein starke Persönlichkeit ausstrahlt. Im ganzen Spiel nur liebevoll gestaltete Charaktere mit ihrer ganz persönlichen Story! Klasse! Mir persönlich hate es Spaß gemacht, allen zuzuhören. Naja, York wurde in die Stadt Greenville befördert um natürlich einen Fall zu ermitteln. Anscheinend kommen die Leute mit der Situation nicht klar. Und ihr habt immer einen Gesprächspartner im Schlepptau. Sein Name ist Zach. Was? Ihr denkt noch einer vom FBI? Nein! York hat eine zweispaltige Persönlichkeit! Doch bevor ich hier zuviel schreib reden wir jetzt doch mal über den schlechten Teil des Spiels...

1. Vielen wird die Grafik nicht gefallen, so war sie auch auf der XBOX und das ist ziemlich schade, denken sich viele. Aber da das Spiel ein Open-World-Spiel ist und es soviele andere Details hat, sowie schöne Räume und schöne Landschaften und so weiter...
2. Die Steuerung! Ja selbst mich hat sie anfangs aufgeregt aber das ging dann auch nach einer Weile.
3. Die vielen Filme! Ich hab mir alle Filmauschnitte im Internet angeschaut, da ich sie nochmal sehen wollte und gesamt sind es 6 Stunden die man da guckt! Mir hat es Gefallen und man ist mit voller Spannung dabei! Doch für manche wird das nix sein...
4. Kapitel 2 Bug! Bei mir geschah es, dass das Spiel ab diesem Punkt nicht mehr ging. So geht das nicht! Daraufhin habe ich mir einfache einen Save von nem andern gedownloadet und zack, mach weiter, trotzallem unnötig und die nervigste Stelle im Spiel!!! Also wirklich...

Ich könnte ein Buch schreiben so gut finde ich das Spiel aber ich lass es mal lieber.

Ich Zähl mal auf. Es sollten sich diejenigen kaufen die:
- eine gut erzählte Story möchten, mit sehr gutem Soundtrack
- die Twin-Peaks mögen, denn es sind ein paar Elemente kopiert, was auch geil ist
- die nix gegen ein wenig japanische Einsätze haben
- die nicht so auf die Grafik sondern auf di Details achten
- schonwiedermal viele Stunden vor dem Rechner sitzen wollen
- auf eine leichte Priese schwarzen Humor stehen
- und, und, und ...

!!!NICHT KAUFEN, wenn:
- ihr unter 16 seit, möglicherweise begreift ihr die Story nicht und das ist bei diesem SPiel sehr wichtig
- ihr nur Storys wie von Call of Duty, Battlefield, Resdient Evil, Left 4 Dead mögt
- ihr Filme immer überspringt
- ihr nicht viel lesen wollt
- Grafik euch wichtig ist
- ihr auf geiles Gamplay baut, die Shooter-Passagen sind nicht sonderlich spannend und das wurde sowie RE 4 und RE 5 gemacht (halt stehenbleiben, zielen und schießen)

Da gibt es garantiert noch soviele Sachen die ich vergessen hab doch ich rate euch wirklich dieses Spiel ne Chance zu geben. Die Entwickler von diesem Spiel haben sich echt Mühe gegeben und das spürt man auch, dieses Spiel wurde mit Liebe gemacht!

Ich werde es öfters durchspielen und öfters davon schwärmen aber so ein geiles Spiel hatte ich seit langem nicht

VON MIR GIBTS 9,5 von 10, da ich die Klreinigkeiten nicht all zu fein find, die hätte man einfach beheben können aber vielleicht hätte das ja uach das Spiel zerstört! Für mich Das Game of the Year 2013!!!

That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character.
While I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.

For a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well. 
For starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible (""Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!"").
Deadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.

Usually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.

Additionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back.
Before playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.

Gameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables. 
At some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the ""Profiling"" feature expanded.
Profiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all.
Turning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters.
So I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant ""gameover, try again!"" (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues.
Deadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.

Story/characters/music:
The thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather ""foreground"" music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too.
Setting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting.
However from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks.
The main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then?
Again I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.

It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.

This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.

Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this ""Director's Cut"" had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.",1390081929,1390108158,True,2,0,0.528465569019317627,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Lo siguiente es la jugabilidad, tosca, torpe, por momentos ridicula, las persecuciones son la cosa mas lamentable que he visto en un videojuego, y creo no exagerar.

I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).

Even if this version wasn`t completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the ""Director's Cut"", the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.

There are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.

While general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.

This is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own.
The only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?

It hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.

The game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.

To sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files. While it didn't happen to me, thankfully, I have read about instances where other players' save data was corrupted, forcing them to start over. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.",1389787420,1511690328,False,19,0,0.630687415599822998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you enjoy a good narrative, like I do, this game certainly delivers. The story is very reminiscent of Twin Peaks, but not so much that it seems unoriginal. The narrative is engaging, and the voice acting is good, but the graphics do sometimes create unwanted comedy. The graphics are strong PS2 quality, so they are perfectly acceptable. The real problems with this game arise from the mechanics. While the mechanics on foot are similar to the mechanics used in Resident Evil, and Silent Hill games, the driving mechanics can make the game a chore to play. While there are some nice immersive elements in the cars, like wipers, the driving can get very irritating due to the floaty controls. The cars feel like they have no mass, and fly across the road very easily, with the exception of the police cruiser which has the best controls out of all the vehicles I have tested, and in case of collision the cars stop with no momentum.
           Deadly premonition delivers a great story with good voice acting, and it clocked in at 16 hours on my first playthrough on the ps3.

I love those ""unique"" games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this game…. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed...
Negative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess I’ll write about everything what I didn’t had positive opinion…
Sound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!).
Ragdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little.
Graphical look: this game looks like 2005 game.  Well at least it is at acceptable levels.
Enemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2).
Boses: during the whole game you encounter X (I won’t spoil exact number but it’s only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point. 
Cutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. It’s related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there aren’t a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if you’re as am I more interest in a story it won’t bother you a lot).
Dungeons: once you’ll play your 4th or 5th dungeon you’ll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These “dungeons” are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards).
Loading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads “Press Start button” (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game won’t crash) I’ll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) I’ll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hell… I can even compare this games loading to  Windows 7 booting time… AGAIN 10-20 seconds…).

Optimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasion’s game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenes… It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: “Do you want to save?” I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). So… In summary it crashes whenever it likes… Don’t forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even can’t replay some chapters (I couldn’t replay chapter 7 even after 20th try…).  Not sure… Maybe crashes related to AMD card I have…
For those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes:
Increase game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this “increase” method works only on 64-bit systems
Use DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Souls… Devs couldn’t add support for high resolutions).
SET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark “Run as an Admin”.
Shutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion list…).
And yeah… Never do anything to stress your computer during this games’ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature).
For those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..

So if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestions… That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).

The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. 

The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.

It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. 

As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. 

Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. 

Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. 

The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). 

The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.

Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”. 

These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. 

Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.

To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.

Многие из вас, наверняка, что-то да и слышали об этой игре. Да, это идеальная смесь Сайлент Хилла (в его лучшие годы) и Твин Пикса (второй сезон). Уникальность этой игры состоит в том, что второй такой нет и врядли когда-либо будет. Это безумная смесь детектива, психологического триллера, ужасов, драмы, комедии, смешанной с неким подобием ""симсов"" и приправленной толикой чисто японского безумия. Но всё это очень органично вплетено в игру и её повествование, которое играет здесь ключевую роль. Не буду вдаваться в подробности сюжета, скажу лишь, чтобы понять все отсылки и шутки игры, очень рекомендую предварительно ознакомиться с Твин Пиксом. Сам сериал великолепен и игра не цитирует его дословно, но вспоминать его с улыбкой во время игры вы будете часто.
Как я уже говорил, сюжет его подача и персонажи играют ключевую роль, держа на себе всю игру. Ибо остальные её компоненты либо откровенно недоделанны (езда на автомобиле сравнима с управлением вертолётов в старых GTA), либо ужасно глючат. Графика времён PS 2, причём времён не лучших, хотя и DPfix исправляет ситуацию, делая её более-менее удобоваримой. Игра часто будет выдавать вам ""краши"", так что чаще сохраняйтесь:). Про боевую систему лучше не вспоминать, ибо более ужасного TPS ещё мир не видел. 
А саундтрек божественен! Эту игру ни в коем случае нельзя покупать отдельно от саундтрека, ибо он здесь даёт уровень Акиры Ямаоки (в его лучшие годы).
Подводя итоги я буду рекомендовать эту игру людям, которые устали от одних и тех же проектов, подаваемых под разными названиями, которые хотят чего-то действительно новенького и необычного, которые ззнакомы с творчеством Дэвида Линча, которые не понаслышке знают кто такие Team Silent и, конечно же тем, которые просто хотят насладиться великолепной игрой.",1388991521,1388991521,True,41,1,0.753790199756622314,3,True,False,False,False,,,

This is one of the most bizarre games I've played, if you're tired of predictable plot twists and flat characters this game will certainly prove refreshing. Part murder mystery and part survival horror, there's rarely a dull moment and some unusual enemy design and stealth mechanics make the combat sections feel distinct from other 3rd person shooters. The game however, is not without its faults.

I played this title with a keyboard and mouse and the controls feel muddy at best, the sensitivity settings at the lower end make no apparent difference and the controls feel unwieldy. I'm unsure whether it's caused by aim assist or some form of mouse acceleration, but the shooting sections often feel more like a game of wrangle the cursor rather than precision gunplay and whilst this does create some tense moments, it is at best frustrating and at worst infuriating. If this was a conscious design decision it is in my opinion a misplaced one and together with a downright abuse of quick time events a certain degree of patience is required.

If this is puts you off the title, that's a pity because the story is more than compelling enough to keep you playing and the town of Greenvale and it's residence are well realised. If you are willing to put up with its flaws deadly premonition has a lot to offer and is wholly deserving of the praise it's received. It's a title that lacks polish but certainly not character, and is well worth considering.

   Your character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head.

He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom; in fact, one of the main, recurring ""side-quests"" of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee. And when he does find a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded ""The Pickles"" on the label), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay.

    There's wooden crates, in various public places. You can ""push"" them. But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash. Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel in which absolutely no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish. To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to test this theory, though). 

   Next, there's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror. Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring theme of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself / his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns, and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever). 

   I mean, c'mon...I love 1983's The Deadly Spawn as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm in the process of driving to a police station to find out some information about a real-life murder victim. Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your ""tiredness"" meter, of course; there's a ""hunger"" one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and whatnot).  

   Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - ""come back tomorrow"" - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department itself, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and lo and behold, find some pistol ammo in it. As you do. Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, but if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that ""This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation"". I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare MURDER case...

   What...waitaminute. You're STILL reading this review? Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function? And don't even get me started on the -

   No, look...seriously...I'm done. I don't even want to think about this any more. Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE. I wanted this game to be good. It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...

   Oh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight. And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me. I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night. I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS. I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep. I can't take it any more. I'm sorry. I just can't...I just can't...

Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a ""so bad it's good"" game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the ""shooting bits"" were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.

If you can.

The lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.

So in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the ""wall-crawler"" enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means. 

Some people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not. Maybe in a year (or more), the game will be patched up and as nice as the Dark Souls port. Until then, I consider this game an Xbox 360 exclusive (the Playstation 3 Director's Cut port is even worse than the PC version, don't touch it please!).

Buy this port if you like a gamble, Zach.",1388508074,1415517067,False,46,1,0.64538109302520752,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.

It's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.

Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.

The combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear ""noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!"" about over 9000 times.

Though Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.

В ней можно найти много минусов: плохая графика, дурацкие QTE, кривое прицеливание и т.д., однако все эти минусы перевешивает повествование. Начинаясь как аниме-детективчик, вдохновленный Твин Пикс, Deadly Premonition уже в скором времени начинает рвать шаблоны, принося логику в происходящую чертовщину. Если любите игры с сильным сюжетом, где герои заставляют вас сопереживать - это игра для вас. Сама игра скроена по старым лекалам, известным по серии Resident Evil - ходим, отстреливаем монстров, решаем простые головоломки, сохраняемся у печатной маши... эээ... у телефона, да. Только тут еще добавляется сбор улик, примеркно как в L.A. Noire. К финалу однообразный геймплей немного приедается, но твисты сюжета заставляют не обращать на это внимание. Еще нужно предупредить, что игра очень любит вылетать по поводу и без, так что частое сохранение строго обязательно. В общем, если не боитесь трудностей, то Deadly Premonition станет глотком свободы в современном мире простых, шаблонных игр.

If you want to bash Deadly Premonition, just go ahead. There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience.
DP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy.
The story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching.
One of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters.
The day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around.
The dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while. For fans of Twin peaks and X-files, this is essential.

Trouvez lui tout les défauts que vous voulez c'est extra laid, mais Deadly Premonition est a mon sens un des jeux les plus marquants jamais vus, que l'on aime ou que l'on déteste, en tout cas moi je l'aime énormément, et c'est sans conteste un jeu dont je me souviendrais toute ma vie, un jeu qui laisse sa marque au même titre que les mgs.
Et je ne suis certainement pas le seul à dire ça, allez voir l'avis des joueurs <3

Deadly Premonition fait parti de ses jeux TRÈS très rares à qui l'on pardonne toutes ses lacunes, a qui des graphismes pas vraiment au top lui donne un charme absolu, a qui la maniabilité hyper ""rétro"" le personnalise à merveille, a qui un certain décalage s'il n'était pas présent ne ferait pas ce qui est tellement marquant dans ce jeu. En tout cas, c'est mon avis.
Oui, j'ai aimé ce décalage sonore/situation. Pourquoi faut-il absolument un assemblage parfaitement dans la même veine pour que cela soit cohérent ? Moi j'ai trouvé ça très cohérent, une chose de plus qui pour moi enrichit l'univers si particulier du jeu.
Oui, j'ai carrément adhérer au concept du jeu, avoir des horaires à respecter, les heures qui passent en tant réelles, la météo à surveiller de près, qui, quand elle varie, change quelques éléments du gameplay (on ne peut pas faire certaines missions secondaires lorsqu'il pleut, ou, au contraire, pouvoir faire celles qui ne peuvent être faites lors des beaux jours). Je me suis laissé emporter par un scénario que j'ai beaucoup aimé, que j'ai trouvé excellent et bien amené. J'ai pleuré, rigolé et ai frissonné à certains moments. Je me suis attaché à ces personnages et à leurs personnalités bien particulières et propre à chacun.
j'en suis tombée amoureux.
L'ambiance est tellement.. Je lui ai trouvé tellement de charme, tellement décalée et envoûtante. 
Bref, vous l'aurez compris. Ce jeu, je l'adore.
Les personnes qui osent mettre ne serait-ce qu'en dessous de la moyenne tout ça parce que ça ne ressemble ni a un Uncharted, ni à un God of War, devrait se poser quelques questions sur leur statut de gamer. Parce que quand on est un vrai gamer, on a le droit d'avoir ses propres goûts et ne pas aimer certains jeux. En revanche, descendre un jeu qui n'avait pas les moyens d'être super bien aboutit techniquement mais qui a osé apporté sa propre vision de jeu vidéo, alors qu’apparemment BEAUCOUP de personnes on su passé au dessus de cela et l'aimé tel qu'il est, c'est carrément honteux. Au lieu de se la jouer gamer dans l'âme, apprenez ce qu'est et ce que devrait être un jeu vidéo : quelque chose d'unique, marquant et qui vous fait vivre pleins d'émotions. Et j'ose dire, Deadly Premonition, pour moi, l'a fait.

 Mais ne le regardez avec des yeux de juges, ni jouez pas avec un cahier de charge, profitez simplement de son univers, prenez simplement ce qu'il veut vous apporter.
Et, je suis sûr, que vous l'ayez aimé ou pas, Deadly Premonition est pour un joueur une expérience que l'on n'oublie pas.",1386129326,1646255614,True,24,0,0.690755784511566162,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This one right here. 

I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.

I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did. 

I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself ""I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!"" I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.

It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!

Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort.

Deadly Premonitions is the rare example of a horror-comedy in video games and is an absoloute must play for anyone.

However, the PC port is plauged with issues. Vanilla, it's default locked at 720p with no controller support and requires some hoop jumping to get it to run at a playable rate. The DPFix mod fixes the resolution and even adds some graphical options, the game still lacks controller support and crashes constantly to the point where I can't get past the beginning of the first driving segment because it keeps crashing as soon as I hit the accelerator button.

It's a good game, but the PC version is plauged with issues, and some things remain annoyances from the console versions, like the map in the pause menu being completely useless.

If you absolutely must get it now, get the console version. Even with framerate issues, it's at least playable. If you can wait, then do so because when it works, playing Deadly Premonition at native resolution at 60 FPS is awesome.

You talk to people, like these weird kids and you collect items to use on things, like this fuse box. Lollipops and donuts can recover your health. 

The game takes on a wider open world feeling later on and between missions you return to this home base of sorts, to get more incomprehensible chunks of plot thrown at you.

Die Steuerung ist ein graus, auch die hin und wieder eintretenden Bugs (Abstürze, Nicht-reagieren der Spielfigur, etc) nerven mitunter, hindern auch den Spielfluss. Woran ich mich weniger störe, dass das Game von Haus aus keine 1080p Skalierung bietet. Fan Mods und patches helfen hier mittlerweile ab. Die Portierung hätte wahrlich besser sein können. 
Auch etwas abgestimmter auf Maus und Tastatur. Empfehlung ist hier in der Tat ein Gamepad zu nutzen (ich mag die Dinger wirklich nicht, mir ist es lieber ich sehe mich mit der Maus um und gehe per Tastatur, da habe ich schlicht mehr Übung drinne)

Allerdings macht das Spiel durch seine ungewöhnliche Atmosphäre alles wieder wett. Die Story ist für ein Spiel ordentlich durchdacht und absurd obendrein, muss man natürlich mögen. Inhaltlich gibt es viel zu tun. Die Gegend will erkundet werden, auch abseits der eigentlichen Aufgabe. 
Die musikalische Untermalung ist teils mit absoluten Ohrwürmern gefüllt und fast jederzeit passend und wertet die ohnehin schon fantastische Grundstimmung des Spiels ungemein auf. 

Wer Lost Highway als Glanzstück des Films benennt, ist hier richtig. Wer Silent Hill hoch und runter gespielt hat, wird hieran ebenso seinen Spaß haben. Resident Evil Jüngern kann man es auch noch empfehlen. Wer japanische Popkultur mag und sich schon so manchen verrückten Kram von denen angetan hat, herzlich Willkommen.

The ""side quests"" are also very  different from what you're used to, they mostly revolve around getting to know the people of Greenvale, and actually this is how I spent around 3/4 of my almost 40 hour playthrough... just getting to know this town and the people living in it. York (and Zach) the 2 in 1 detective, George the king of the town, Harry the weird millionaire who always wears a mask for some reason... and even though you get to know the characters very well, they still managed to keep the thing that are important well hidden, lurking in the background, just so they can surprise you with it later. The story and the narrative are just perfect. Same could be said for the soundtrack and the voice actors, all top-notch.

It's plot, characters and setting are just that engaging every time you come back you still have a great time.
The story may sound familiar if you have watched twin peaks in that a girl is murdered in a small town out in the boondocks of america and its up to FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to solve the crime (Call him york by the way, everyone does) but as he arrives in the small town of Greenvale things are not what they seem 
with strange phenomenon involving red seeds and a legend of a killer in a red raincoat that only appears on rainy nights.
The game bursts and ozzs with personality and charm from the music that plays in the opening menu to the way that York interacts with Zach (his special friend) about b-movies.
The directors cut that was originally released on PS3 boasts a new scenes that expand the games ending and also tell the story in a different way.
The PC version however brings very little to the table by only offering halloween themed suits for York, Emily, The Raincoat Killer and a car skin and even though the game now runs past 30FPS it just doesn't feel right at that speed as it feels to fast...
Another issue is that since the directors cut features reworked movement it feels clunky on the pc without a controller while if it used the original versions tank style controls (which I actually liked) then maybe it wouldn't feel so wierd on PC.
The last issue that I have that wasn't addressed in the directors cut is the timing of certain music I will give you an example You're examing a dead body and this forboding unerving music is playing then suddenly it changes to light hearted jazz I will admit I got a laugh out of it the first time around and this is the only time I can really remember this happening.

All complaints aside
Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is a game that you have to own
Everything about it feels right and it was the game to renew my faith that games can exceed the bar in many aspects without needing multiplayer, graphics with volumetric lighting (otherwise known as WANK)
You are a fool to dismiss such a fine game and even more of a fool to insult it

It's easily my favorite game of all time, even though I admittedly picked it up with some hesitation when it first released on the Xbox 360 at $20. I bought this version 7 years ago when it released for my Vista, unaware of the issues of this port.

That being said, this port is god awful. Somehow using Windows 8.1 and no video card, only the integrated graphics, I was able to finish it in it's entirety. I played it without installing the Windows .NET or PhysX that it tries to auto-install on bootup. I did not install DPFix. The port itself is barebones with only the option to customize your controls and use a controller or a keyboard and mouse setup.

I routinely made save backups after reading about corrupted save files, but luckily did not have any corruptions.

I had 2 hardlock crashes where I had to restart the whole system, 8 crashes with errors, and a couple crashes on startup. One time the game just would not start, no errors or anything. I ran the main program as administrator once, and never had the issue again. The crashes seemed random, although during the 'wait after the diner closes' part of the story, I opened the gate, smoked until it closed, and then stepped into the mission circle.

One other part that blocked progress was being stuck in the Milk Barn unable to leave, but I believe this happened on the PS3 version so I remembered to just smoke until it forced me out of the store.

There were problems rendering miscellaneous objects in the main world, but no issues otherwise. It was mostly just fences, parked cars and tombstones that either would not load or load after 5 minutes.

Playing with only the integrated graphics I was averaging about 20 fps, the worst part was the 'running' segments where you have to alternate left and right repeatedly, the last boss took about 5 minutes to even get to the next phase. And the instant kill QTEs were nearly impossible during the Raincoat running segments.

My greatest fear was crashing during the Boss Rush mode, but luckily that never happened.

With all that said, I do NOT recommend this port unless you have no other way to play Deadly Premonition (on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 or Nintendo Switch). At least with Steam's refund policy as well as the fan patch, you can always try to see if it works for you and if not you can get your money back. I read that using DPFix should rectify a lot of crashing as well as open up display and resolution options, I will try it out when I upgrade my Windows 10 computer sometime in the future.",1383123159,1600567602,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.

As a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means  you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.",1383101934,1383101934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At first glance it’s a clunky RE4 clone with bland combat  that looks more at home in 1999 on the Dreamcast than a modern console or PC. But if you play past the first area you’d start to see what makes the game truly great and why its become such a beloved cult classic, its writing. DP’s cast is a gaggle of lovable goofballs with all their own weird quirks, most prominent of all being the protagonist, York, who loves spending time shooting the shit with his imaginary friend named Zach about John Hughes movies and The Ramones, divining the future through  the morning coffee, or going around town staring into people‘s windows.  It’s no secret that DP is practically Twin Peaks: The Game and it wears it love for that show and all kind of 80‘s pop culture on  its sleeve. The plot is actually rather good too considering and it actually gets pretty damn dark but it somehow all works because the game’s characters are likable enough for you to care. DP is just a game full of enthusiastic charm and it has a creativity that most AAA games lack. If you can look past the dated graphics and  sloggy combat you’ll find an endearing game in all its honest B-movie cheese.

Be warned though that this port isn’t all that great, but the same dude that patched Dark Souls is on the case and it looks like with his help this will be the definitive version of the game. So if you’re a bit on the fence wait until that comes out before buying it which shouldn’t be too long.",1383099157,1385424190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn't content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition. 

There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it's utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.

Deadly Premonition is all that. It's impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game.
