UPDATE: After dig in and research with multi-player mode with this game, I guess I can't really blame Steam or GOG or anyone for not have VS AI supported.

In this game you have to fight Major Mylar, a sussy baka who has taken over the tan army and is pushing the entire green nation at the brink of destruction. It's a top down strategy game where you need to watch what happens to your soldiers, how much ammo you have on your weapons, and enemy positions as you go through the game. This game has extremely intense moments when you fight off against hordes of soldiers, while keeping your own boys alive and well. This game features many really fun moments, like the second mission, airfield mission, tank factory defense, zombie island, and more. The game also does a fantastic job making the player feel like they are all that stands between victory and total annihilation of your army. There's some missions that tend to have a lot of trial and error moments but this game can be beaten reasonably quickly. Some parts really show their age, the graphics of the game will instantly show how old it is, but despite being old it still is endearing. The A.I. of your allies, however, can sometimes get goofy when trying to follow you around tight corners, but getting stuck unless you move them yourselves or try to walk around the corner again.

With their sequel to Army Men they've really taken the ""tactics"" part of the genre seriously and I'm liking the change! Missions feel much more fair than in the original when you die as most of the time it gives you a wide range of strategies to choose from with the looser, more open levels. The game seems much shorter than its predecessor with only a handful of levels, but hey, quality over quantity right? They've kind of sacrificed the gritty wartime atmosphere however, with Sarge sounding more badass and other soldiers having quips they often say. They even named General Plastro for the first time (he was simply known as the tyrannical Tan Commander in AM1).

I wouldn't say all changes are good, however. The music is no longer those military drumbeats throughout every level and is instead mostly low bitrate tunes of classical music. Sounds like an improvement, but for a realtime tactics game set in a war environment it's seriously unfitting and distracting as hell from the gameplay. I just turned it off since it got on my nerves as soon as it began, and I'd recommend you do the same too. Also the new control scheme with all the tactical stuff you can do does feel pretty awkward, and although your allies AI is much better than the previous game's, it's still not that good and they can and will just screw you over as they do not prioritise the mission's objective as far as I can tell.

It still has a lot of awkward, cheap jank from the first game. One of the most revealing areas of this is the 7th mission, where you get screwed over by you and enemy soldiers constantly getting stuck on invisible walls and bullets hitting stuff that it shouldn't be hitting. Firing at zombies is also hellish because of this, you have to basically completely rely on the old man to kill them since most of the time your bullets just phase through them.

Overall a pretty good Army Men all things considered. It's better in the first few stages and gets much worse as you progress due to cheap jank and poor level design, but it's still a pretty solid game.",1618842316,1624014004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ARMY MEN II
Genre: Casual Action
Release: Q1 1999

( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.
( ) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.
( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.

Unos 12 niveles, dificultades diferentes, arrancando por la Cocina de una Casa tras pasar un portal, volviendo a Casa, la llegada de los Tanques para proteger al Tren, protección del espía azul en el campo aéreo, la isla de las minas (estaban por todos lados), volviendo a la entrada de la casa, con los soldados suicidas que llevan un petardo en su espalda y la llegada al nuevo portal, la isla de los zombies, soldados multicolor formados por partes de otros y el doctor loco que los creaba con unos generadores, un pequeño recorrido por un desierto en búsqueda de la bola 8, un nuevo portal, la mesa de juegos, el área X, el fuerte lleno de soldados amarillos y la gran final en una habitación con un gran jefe final, pero eso no es todo, si queres saber más como termina, jugalo te lo recomiendo!.

Agradezco a Global Star Software (2K Play) por su publicación ya que fue quien compro a 3DO después de su bancarrota.
Que podemos decir… corre en Windows 10... impresionante!

-If you are Army Men fan, just buy the game.
-Works with Windows 10.
-The game is the same as when it was released. (I think)

I have always wanted to play this game during my childhood, but at the time I couldn't get this game. So, this is my first time playing the game (However, I have played Army Men and Army Men Toys in Space before). 

Here are some pros and cons comparing to Army Men I.

Pros:
- The controls are better than Army Men I :
   > You can use your mouse to aim and also to move by left-click (in Army Men I, you have to use keyboard to rotatate/aim).
- Better squad controls/system :
   > You can order them individually (attack, defense, hold) but you can not fully control them like Sarge.
   > In campaign, your squad member can level up, which increase their HP. Not sure about other stats.
   > In campaign, at the end of a mission, if your squad members are alive, they will go with you to the next mission with their improved stats.
   > Squad mates are smarter, more useful, easier to control. And they comes with variety of weapons.
- Improved graphics.
- Difficulty options
- Great story potential and news characters. but.... (see cons)

Cons :
- Game is shorter, I think.
- Weird music choices, I don't know how to explain this (lol), but it's not that bad.
- Story sounds interesting and has high potential, but executed poorly and has little impact on missions.
   <<<<<< SPOILERS  ALERT>>>>>>>
   > There are 4 antagonists: Major Maylars, Dr. Madd, Rogue Green colonel, General Plastro. 
   > The introduction of MM is very interesting but his role is only that he took over the Tan army and that is only implied. At the time I don't even know that, I still have to fight the Tan army like usual. No impact to the story. What was the point of this guy???
   > Dr. Madd is a guy from Grey army who creates zombies and other technologies. This character is good in his way.
   > Rogue Green colonel. His arc is good but the only problem is that it is implied that something/somebody makes him go rouge but in the end there is no answer to that.
   > General Plastro, it is implied that he was taken over by MM. So, it make sense that he is not mentioned in the game that much, I think. 
   > Few back story dialogs/radio/in game voice to explain the current situation on Major Mylar take over. I don't mind few CG cutscenes (it's an Army Men game not MGS) but if they are going to have some more complex story, they should do a better story telling.

Good game! Brings back my childhood.

[h1]❄ “啊~塑料的味道。家，温暖的家~”[/h1]

　　1999年，如日中天的《玩具兵大战》的第2部横空出世，4.4厘米高的Green国中士(Sarge)又开始了他的征程。上海育碧将系列的第1部和第2部引进中国，不仅进行了界面汉化，还请上译厂录制了中文配音。我初次接触《玩具兵大战》系列就是玩的第2部，它与《帝国时代》1和2成为了我最早玩过的正版游戏。

　　还记得，当时是借了对门小伙伴的光碟来玩，正版光碟的好处是音乐动画一应俱全，不便之处是要一定插入光碟才可以游玩。网上的光盘镜像版则需要虚拟光驱才能运行。小时候接触的PC游戏不算多，每个都翻来覆去玩过很多遍，因此感情自然深厚。那些在回忆中熠熠闪光的暑假夜晚，我用MP4反复翻阅早已熟稔于心的《玩具兵大战》系列攻略，心中是那么快活和满足，那些绿色兵人的战争与冒险，胜利与悲剧，让我心心念念，着迷不已。直到7年前，我写完原创精华帖[url=https://tieba.baidu.com/p/806615878]《玩具兵大战2全十二关练级攻略》[/url]之后，才暂时告别了这个我最珍爱的游戏之一。

　　Steam进入我的生活后，我也曾充满期待地搜索过“Army Men”，虽然并无所获，但我知道Take-Two（2K的母公司）收购了《玩具兵大战》的版权，有朝一日，这个被遗忘了十数载的游戏系列，说不定会复活归来——现在，它来了，终于来了。虽然这冷饭[u]没有任何重制，不能调分辨率，无法用Steam截图，而且不出意料地没有官方汉化和中文配音（毕竟那是上海育碧代理才有的）[/u]，但是2K做得实在漂亮！

　　大喜过望的咒骂，咀嚼冷饭的哽咽，不如一句亲切的问候：中士，欢迎归来！

[h1]❄ 塑料小人国与凶险大人国[/h1]
[list]
    [*]游戏背景
[/list]
　　《玩具兵大战2》在剧情上延续了第1部的结尾。塑料世界的绿国与黄国、蓝国和灰国处于战争当中，游戏主角绿军“中士”在战斗中进入了一个神秘的传送门，来到了人类世界。此后，他与他的小队来回穿梭于两个世界，化解种种危机。
[list]
    [*]游戏创意
[/list]
　　3DO当年想到制作玩具兵题材的游戏，是很高明的：一来避免了出现血腥场面，降低了游戏评级。2K新发行的《玩具兵大战》系列都被ERSB评为E级（适合6岁及以上人群）；二来可以充分利用玩具兵自身属性和与人类世界的关系，做出天马行空的游戏设计。当年《玩具兵大战》就是靠新奇独特的游戏创意打出一片[b]塑料江山[/b]的。

　　顾名思义，游戏里的士兵都是玩具兵，最大特征就是他们的塑料身体。子弹打在塑料身上只会打出塑料碎片，不会流血，连断肢效果都温和很多。而我们又知道，塑料最怕高温，因此火焰就成了玩具兵们最忌惮的东西。最有效和最有趣的杀伤方式就是使他们融化。令人称奇的是，玩具兵的国度俨然是人类世界的翻版，有易燃会蔓延火势的绿色森林，亮闪闪的蓝色塑料海洋，还有各种军工高精设备，简直是“物产丰盈，无所不有，原不藉外夷货物以通有无。”

　　但是，在神秘力量的作用下，玩具兵世界和人类世界通过传送门连结在了一起。于是，我们熟悉的平庸无奇的居所，就成了玩具兵的致命异域：开着的燃气灶会轻易将玩具兵融化，搭好的扑克牌倒塌时可以把玩具兵压死，厨房和花园的蟑螂成了巨大的凶兽，背着鞭炮的士兵被当成人肉炸弹……甚至，诡计多端的敌军拿来人类世界的物品，妄图改造成玩具兵世界的毁灭性武器。

　　如同孩童的幻想一样，以小小玩具兵为主体的异样的审视角度，赋予了现实生活全新的意义，重新让它充满初识人间的奇趣，满足了我们的想象力，以反差营造出奇异的冲突，满足了我们超越日常的渴望。这就是玩具兵和一切身体变小题材的魅力所在。
[list]
    [*]游戏类型
[/list]
　　《玩具兵大战》系列绝大多数作品都是即时战术（RTT）游戏，第2部也不例外。玩家可以控制中士和其他士兵进行战斗，但不能进行采集、建造和生产发展活动，补充兵员的方式只有剧情安排和使用物品栏的伞兵增援两种。中士可以拾取最多6样武器，进行翻滚下蹲等战术动作，还可以给部下下指挥命令。普通士兵就只能操控他们进行移动、攻击等基本行动，不过他们可以累积经验值来升级变强。不得不吐槽的是，AI的寻路能力很差，经常在门口绕圈圈，另外他们还会站在障碍物面前开炮炸到自己……
[list]
    [*]战斗氛围
[/list]
　　除了玩具兵题材带来的新奇有趣之外，游戏其实也有紧张甚至令人恐慌的战斗体验。譬如，不时出现的伏兵或占优势的敌军使人感到战争形势的严峻，模仿电影《现代启示录》的第五关充满诡谲与疯狂，被绑上鞭炮的自杀士兵令人防不胜防，用不同塑料拼凑制成的丧尸发出瘆人的嚎叫……是的，玩具兵大战居然也有丧尸，我库里有80多款丧尸游戏，最早接触的还是《玩具兵大战2》。
[list]
    [*]音乐声效
[/list]
　　值得一提的是，游戏使用了大量古典音乐和经典名曲作为BGM，让人十分享受。顺序依次为：第一章，威廉退尔序曲；第二章，晨曲；第三章，春之歌；第四章，蓝色多瑙河；第五章，女武神的骑行；第六章，马刀舞曲；第七章，魔法师的学徒（来自《幻想曲》）；第八章，原创音乐“Bootcamp”；第九章，野蜂飞行；第十章，匈牙利狂想曲第二号；第十一章，原创音乐“Fortress”；第十二章，魔法师的学徒（来自《幻想曲》）。

　　各种枪械声效据说是真实武器的声效。人物配音尤其是中文配音可圈可点，刻画出了沉稳冷静的中士形象，与后来肌肉男中士有所区别（二者不是同一个人，前三部曲的中士就是Sarge，后来的肌肉男中士正式名称是Sergent Hawk）。

　　2代很有意思的一个特点是，给小队士兵使用医疗包之后，他们会说一句“谢谢你中士”，这是其他系列作没有的。

[h1]❄ 像珍惜玩具一样珍惜士兵[/h1]

　　如前文所说，普通士兵可以升级，让自己的血量变得更厚，武器从普通步枪升为重机枪、火神枪等。因此只要注意让士兵杀敌练级，就可以得到一支以一敌十的精锐部队，即便中士不出手，也可以轻松消灭大批的丧尸、黄军士兵甚至硬刚坦克。最鲜明的例子之一是，在第十一关开始，黄军会派出大批重火力部队，但我完全不用像攻略所说那样避其锋芒，直接将其就地消灭了，而我的部队完好无损。我根据这些经验，研究出了与“中士独狼战法”不同的“练级群攻战术”，都写在旧文[url=https://tieba.baidu.com/p/806615878]《玩具兵大战2全十二关练级攻略》[/url]里面了。

　　除了“培养强力士兵”这种实用性理由之外，之所以要珍惜士兵，还因为RTT游戏的一兵一卒来之不易，即便不损失一个人，打到最后一关最多也就17个战士，多乎哉？不多也。

　　最重要的是，真正的指挥官以保存部队为荣，以让士兵送命为耻。我从许多YouTube网友的评论中也看到了这一观点。这种强烈的代入感，或许也来自于我们童年对玩具的爱惜吧。RTT游戏里的玩具兵，并不是可以随意舍弃的塑料卒子，而是我们的伙伴啊。

　　最后，引用我7年前写的攻略结尾：

[code]如此，十二关的战役就结束了，中士率领的部队也成了一支精锐的队伍。看着身经百战的战士们胜利的神情，玩家作为出色的指挥官，恐怕也会为战友无一阵亡而取得胜利由衷自豪。这段回味无穷的峥嵘岁月，是属于你和你的士兵的：“你们的确知道怎样教训那些黄军混蛋，不是吗？”[/code]
