My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

В играх я предпочитаю играть за магов,  я исследовал мир, обучался,  затем я решил пройти единственный доступный на этом острове квест по сбору трех ключей с целью соединить их воедино и выпустить в мир некоего демона, которого впоследствии будет необходимо убить. Эти ключи находились в трех  подземельях:
Первое подземелье внушало ужас неизвестности,  ибо это была темная паучья пещера, на входе в которую  лежали тела отвратительных пауков, не суливших ничего хорошего. Однако впоследствии выяснилось, что вместо пауков в пещерах обитают жирные личинки, и даже самая сильная  и жирная  из них не смогла нанести мне хоть какой-то урон. 
Со вторым подземельем все было куда сложнее:  старые заброшенные шахты, в которых кишмя кишат крысолюды, они больно царапаются, а те, что посильнее, неплохо так бьют по кумполу зазубренным топором. На прорыв сквозь сумрак подземелья я потратил четыре вечера, с каждым воскрешением пробиваясь все дальше и дальше, пока наконец не зачистил комнату босса так, чтобы можно было прокрасться вдоль стен и выманить Thug Rat Leader в длинные коридоры шахты, где, после тяжелой битвы он был сражен моим Fireball. Вторая часть ключа была у меня в кармане, оставалось лишь выбраться из шахты живым.
Пока я искал замок, захваченный бандитами, я успел найти тропические земли, где меня сожрала пантера, и весь мой забитый найденным золотом лут был  похоронен  в высокой траве, приручил первую лошадь,  и вместе мы нашли захваченный замок.
Где меня зарубил бандит, а лошадь некоторое время спустя загрызли собаки.
К сожалению, Бандитское Логово стало неподъемной целью для одинокого мага. Коридоры были слишком узкими и короткими, приходилось то и дело пускать в ход меч, парируя атаки наседающих врагов, лишь незначительно облегчая себе поединки единственным скастованным заклинанием.
Даже несмотря на успешную зачистку пути к Bandit Officer, этот босс оказался совершенно неубиваемым. Мало того, что он очень быстро и очень больно кастовал Lightning, так еще и в узких коридорах парировать его атаки было абсолютно бесполезно: успешная  контратака наносила такой мизерный урон, что сперва я даже не заметил изменения в его полоске здоровья.
Зарубивший меня Bandit Officer был последней точкой пути одинокого мага.  Недалеко от замка осталась пастись  прирученная мной лошадь, которая, несомненно, скоро вновь одичает и сбежит пастись по девственным лугам Haven, груженная сумками со всем моим золотом, которое я предусмотрительно скинул перед своей последней самоубийственной атакой на Бандитский Оплот.
 
________
Кратко подытожим. Было ощущение исследования, графика на Ультрах примерно как в TES Oblivion. Наверное нужно было играть за война, а не создавать мага: возможно, если бы здоровья и урона было в 2-3 раза больше, было бы комфортнее играть. Бой воином более динамичный, нежели ""бей и беги"" тактика мага,  который все равно  превращается  в воина (причем никудышного) после пяти-шести заклинаний и опустевшей шкалой маны.
Играл без подписки, планировал приобрести после прохождения  квеста,  было интересно, смогу ли его пройти. Последний неубиваемый босс, кастующий молнии через стены практически без кулдауна, все мои надежды похоронил. 
Играя за Мага, какой-либо прогрессии в стиле D&D не заметил: на начальных уровнях маг убить никого вообще не может, на последних, имея более сильные заклинания, может убить одного слабого врага, а если ""бей и беги"" то и сильного. Битвы с боссами представляли собой монотонный процесс каста заклинаний до истощения маны, затем бегства из радиуса его обнаружения. Затем сесть у костра и повторить.
Понимая, что, после того, как я покину стартовый остров, меня будет ждать лишь еще больше подобных битв, я решил эту игру дропнуть. Проходить все это дело нужно в компании друзей или гильдии, но мне, как соло игроку, это не особо интересно.
Вообще хотел поиграть за некроманта, но, как указал выше, стартовый остров я не покинул, а на нем изучить некромантию невозможно.",1686515202,1686515464,False,1,2,0.5,0,False,False,False,True,,,

However this game has no story mission, or quests to accept. You simply learn about things that the world is working on and it gives you places to go and explore. But you have to talk to the townspeople, and the most useful ones are hidden in shady places.

Exploration is HUGE in this game. In fact, it's so huge that you must map the game yourself or find one online. MO2 is out but MO1 is still amazing, brutal, savage, beautiful and the spells are jaw dropingly intense to look at, except the low level Ecumenical is pretty normal, but this game intensifies in visual effects as it increases in difficulty. Elementalism changes the in game weather even to suit its spells.

Playing this game you have to separate yourself from the sunk cost fallacy, because when starting out, no matter how long it took you to farm resources for your gear, it can be taken away if you have not the skill to defend yourself. Vise versa you can have worst gear and still win if you're skilled enough.

This game has a high sense of realism, and I HIGHLY recommend both MO1 and MO2 as they are essentially the same game. If you're playing MO1 to see if you like 2 because it's free, you may end up like me and have over 400 hrs and still going strong without even bothering with MO2 lol.

Within 30 minutes I was able to outfit my player character with full leather armour and a wooden shield all made out of pigleather and wood harvested in the starter zone. Again from my brief experience it feels like a crafting players dream come true.

I can only hope that there is a second game coming that polishes the mechanics as well as establishes a larger community for the game as I can see the potential for something fantastic here.",1633398730,1633398730,True,4,1,0.561714649200439453,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game will NOT hold your hand. It gives players the freedom to explore their full potential in an open world environment. It is 90% toxic players and 10% PVE care bear situations. The players choose what happens here. That is the beautiful thing about it. We have the means to control the economy on a daily basis and control most of how the game affects the player base.

Guilds rule this world and are in a constant war between the 2 opposing sides.

On one end, you have the ones who want to run wild and free. These are the ones who enjoy the pain of others and when you react to their griefing ways, you fuel the reason for them to continue to mess with you even further.

Hate and revenge are common feelings you will encounter in this game. You will learn to accept and understand ways around the raw lifestyle this game throws you into.

On the other side of the story there are people who defend the defenceless. There are many names for them but these days everyone can state they follow a righteous path but in the shadows relish in the blood shed. Don’t be fooled by cheap words and speeches. Focus on how these people you are with act everyday. What they do and say will give you the truth about their intentions in this game. 

You will decide what path you follow because it is mainly one of these. Trust barely exists in this game even within guilds. People follow anyone who cater to their own personal goals. 

There are a few who walk a thin line of neutrality. This path is hard and everyday it becomes a challenge. You will need to focus on not pursuing your revenge due to the many losses you will encounter in this game. Acceptance is key and relying on the friends you make will help you forget and move on. Remember, in this game everything is replaceable. Just give yourself time to accept the simple truth that it’s a game and nothing more. Many people on this path try to focus on not being pulled into the conflicts, etc in this world. Many fail though. Reputation is hard to establish and easy to ruin. Trust is something many do not have but only a handful of people have and understand how hard it is to keep it in a game like this. With trust and respect equals a path where playing the game becomes a nice reality. You are able to enjoy the simple things and trade freely with everyone in this game. You simply need to not be weak and feed into the hate of this world.

Here's what to expect in terms of MMO's. I've got a TON of MMO time, so I do have a strong idea of the general mechanics.

Combat: Real time. Magic needs reagents and casting time considered, Melee is what you think it would be in an MMO. It's never going to be perfect, or 100 percent smooth, but they made a working model for FP combat pretty much in the early days of MMO. They're the ones who do it, and do it as right as it can be done for now. 

Crafting: The most in depth, and interesting crafting system I've ever seen. 

Guilds/Companies/Crews: Necessary beyond early game. This is not a solo venture unless you have NO time obligations.

Exploration: Phenominal. I wouldn't be surprised if people did not discover all the secrets of the first iteration of the world. 

Everything else: This game uses a lot of systems not used in other games. I can't make you play this game, but if you want an MMO that's really hard, but really rewarding, you've found it.",1624942473,1624942473,True,4,0,0.573265373706817627,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Devs, articulate to me a single reason why I should trust you a second time around with my money.
You literally spit in my face, and thousands of others faces, with the original Mortal Online a decade ago. Why in the world should I give y'all the time of day again? What separates MO2 from MO1, and what have you done as a company regarding internal changes and external communication with the mmorpg community to warrant me or anyone else familiar with your previous dubious shenanigans surrounding MO1 giving you any iota of our precious time or a single cent of our hardearned money?

Given that EA is heavily abused by developers and immoral publishing companies, seeing this game on here immediately makes me suspicious and has me thinking only of the worst when I see Mortal Online and your company making a listing on this particular platform.

What does John Q Public think? Does the MO team deserve our good grace, forgiveness and a second chance? Or are they out to defecate all over us again?

and someone said this makes me a strawman in middle of a field, so I responded...

""Is this some insult to comparing me to a strawman in middle of a field unable to move or do anything except one single thing and its this hatred of this kid? Maybe...for over 30 years I have sat here on my chair hating on this kid...kinda sad now that you actually compared me to a strawman who can't move on...but its too late now...I have to find this kid.

And I will show everyone what he did! He ruined my life and took my time and money that I spent getting that icecream! I spent months earning 5 dollars, so many chores I had to and I had to wash so many dishes and take out so much trash, and when I finally got the icecream cone I always wanted it got taken from me in seconds.

I just can't move on. So maybe I am like a strawman...which makes me sad...maybe...I do need to move on...""

The MMO community is very sad to be angry over an MMO after more than 10 years. In fact, I'd talk to my psychiatrist if I was so angry over a game for more than a month.

Expectations: woefully unfulfilled. This is the second review I've ever written. I was forced to do this because this game was so horrible that, humanity needs warned. 
Graphics: meh. Morrowind-like. I don't mind it.
Magic system: Not bad. A little annoying because you have to unequip your weapon to use a healing spell on yourself.
Skill system: For the love of all things holy, they never end. Too many skills to shake a drunk squirrel at. There are WAY TOO many. I mean, seriously, 41 categories, each one having 1-3 subcategories. One is literally Dental Lore. . . Why? Out of all these skills, you can only level a chosen few (not too upsetting, since some of them are pointless). 
The Community: From Satan's butt-crack itself. I've played some games with that housed the scum of humanity itself, but Mortal Online takes the cake. You can be murdered in the middle of town. With guards everywhere. Me and a friend were murdered and looted 50 feet from a guard. They did nothing. This same guy found us later, killed my friend, and I tried to defend myself. It said I was a criminal for hitting him back, and the guards murdered me. Oh, and when you are murdered, a window pops up and asks if you'd like to report it. Here's the kicker: if you CHECK the box (that says ""report murder""), it will NOT REPORT THEM . . . you're suppose to NOT check it . . . explain how that makes sense. The rules say that someone will be marked a murderer after 5 kills. This guy bragged about doing in all the time. . . still not branded. Nice going on the all the rule enforcement, developers.
World: Disgustingly big. You can run for 15 minutes, and  barely see anything. Tons of space, but nothing to fill it and give it any point. Like everything else, pointless. Skills, pointless. Guards, pointless. Laws, pointless. City that takes you 5 minutes to cross the street, pointless.

After playing this game quite a bit and giving it a fair chance, I feel finally ready to review. 

Mortal Online is a first person, full loot, fantasy based, MMO RPG. It is like no other game. 

It is truly a diamond in the rough, but.. extremely in the rough, so rough it's not shining. It's extremely disheartening because there is so much potential here, but for numerous reasons, I feel it never reached it.

+Wonderful music, very beautiful arrangements across Nave.
+A multiplayer reliant world. You feel like you matter as a player. Due to the low player count, people will know who you are and recognize you. You will matter during fights. You will be able to have a ripple effect across Nave, whether by creating a enormous guild, being a successful stealthy thief that will make a name for himself, etc. And that's something special that you don't tend to find in most MMO's.
+Amazingly well made and complex systems. Such as crafting, cooking, dyeing, potion making, thieving, scribing, amongst many others. You will get lost in the amount of depth these systems hidden behind closed curtains will offer. 
+Really fun pvp with great mechanics, thanks to its directional real time combat.
+Interesting PVE monsters with creative designs. 
+First person.
+The sheer *potential* this game has. 

But sadly..

-The most opaque, dishonest development team I've had the displeasure to find in a game. Their lack of transparency in many areas (security breach failure, rude moderators and development team members that have a hard time acting professional.. among many other factors) really is detrimental to the game and community. They're really trying, but it's just not good enough.
-The worst community I have *ever* seen in a game. Here you will find a disproportionate amount of griefers, cheaters, rpkers (random player killing) and generally unkind and rude players. For some (obvious) reason, this game has over the years attracted the worst of the worst. Do not walk into this game expecting an RPG experience. You will scarcely come across someone in the world who's willing to have a chat, roleplay, team up, etc. You will be killed on sight, which I personally find disappointing, as this game truly has the potential to offer a great RPG roleplay experience. Yet you end up with nothing but boring and repetitive PVP. The best moments I've had in the game where with the few other players I've encountered that have played along with a roleplay perspective, which just simply spices up otherwise mundane encounters. 
-Riddled with bugs. Most players in Mortal disregard and almost even *forget* bugs. We have come to accept them and not even mind them. This is not okay. 
-I personally find the mechanics to be quite clunky.
-Awful graphics. Some love them, I'm not one of those people. For a game where you'll be walking around for hours and hours, the world is empty and bare, a complete void. 
-A huge time-sink. If you don't like grinding or waiting hours for materials to process, this isn't the game for you. I have spent countless of hours mining, staring at my screen doing absolutely nothing. Getting around the world is tedious and takes a very long time. Over a 100 one of those hours I've spent in the game, perhaps even more, have been nothing but pressing the autowalk button and sitting back on my chair, travelling from city to city, resource to resource. It would be bearable if the world were a bit pretty or full of life, maybe even spiced with a bit pvp in between, but sadly, it isn't. (The last bit, is due to an extremely low player count) All in all, hours I will never get back. If you don't find pleasure in the act itself of grinding, I would advise you to not play this game. 
-Lack of lore. I *love* context. I *love* lore. I *love* immersion. I personally feel the most immersion in games when I feel like the world around me is alive. The NPC's are absolutely terrible. They are nothing but empty shells. Every single guard, bandit, banker, etc, in the world, no matter where they're located in Nave, feel the same. The characters in the world do not feel alive, they do not feel like actual people living their little lives in their respective cities. They feel like basic, boring, NPC's. For some, the amount of lore present might be satisfying, but not for me. This game has always left me wanting more from an RPG perspective.
-Lack of a good, encompassing tutorial. I have over the many years of playing this game, tried to get 7 friends into this  game. All of them with the same qualms: Poor visuals, horrible tutorial, poor mechanics, etc. 
-Not being able to try every aspect of the game without making multiple characters and even *accounts*. If you're looking into trying out this game, thinking you'll be spending at the most, 13 bucks, you're wrong. I've rarely encountered players that were satisfied with only one account. Which meant almost everyone was spending 26 bucks, sometimes more, on the game every month. With only one character, let alone one account, you will not be able to try out everything Mortal Online has to offer without relying on other players. This is a huge disservice to the game as well as, what might as well be, secret hidden fees. 

All in all, I just can't recommend this game. I really regret spending so much time on it. Sadly, there is nothing else like it, despite its shortcomings it remains a genre of its own, a diamond in the rough. So I begrudgingly play it.

I am looking forward to Mortal Online 2. 
Hopefully, its sequel fixes the many gripes I have with it.

Могу ли я её рекомендовать всем? Конечно нет. Игра рассчитана прежде всего на старых поклонников Ultima Online, Darkfall и схожими по концепции хардкорных ММОРПГ, где присутствует полный лут (когда при смерти с игрока падает вся экипировка и вещи из рюкзака), где есть свободное ПвП, где есть большая социальная составляющая, которая подталкивает как отдельные формирования игроков, так и одиночек к взаимодействию друг с другом.

Уникальные отличия от остальных ММО еще заключаются и в том, что это пожалуй одна из немногих игр, где нет инстансов и зеркал, а мир игры располагается на одном шарде, без разделений на сервера. То есть все игроки находятся в едином мире и могут свободно взаимодействовать друг с другом без каких либо технических ограничений.

Сеттинг Mortal Online выдержан в мрачных тонах средневекового фентези, поэтому здесь вы не увидите радужных единорогов и красочных фей. Мир игры расположился на двух больших континентах - Nave, где преобладает умеренный климат и Sarduuca, которая представляет собой огромную и беспощадную пустыню. Путешествовать по миру вам предстоит как на своих двоих, так и с помощью приручаемых животных, которых сейчас большое разнообразие. Телепортов и мгновенного перемещения в игре нет. Так же как и нет карты, поэтому вам придётся ориентироваться в этом суровом мире исключительно с помощью компаса и ориентиров. Это добавляет в игру еще больше приключений и интересных воспоминаний о путешествиях по миру игры.

Запомните одно, в мире Mortal Online нет безопасных зон. Даже в городе, который патрулируют стражи, вас могут либо убить, либо просто обокрасть.
Боевая система в игре представляет собой честный нон-таргет с системой хит боксов. Закликать врага здесь не выйдет лишь потому, что в бою вам нужно постоянно поддерживать определенную дистанцию, зависящего от оружия, выбирать моменты для атаки и зоны поражения противника. Если вы будете слишком близко к цели, то вы можете ударить не лезвием меча, а рукоятью к примеру. Стрельба из лука так же требует определённых навыков и спамить одну кнопку, как в других ММОРПГ, здесь не выйдет.

Помимо ПвП, в игре есть множество других занятий, таких как интересный и проработанный крафт, строительство, приручение и разведение животных, торговля и множество различных профессий, таких как мясник, рудокоп, повар, алхимик, архитектор, вор... Кстати о воровстве, Mortal Online пожалуй единственная на сегодняшний день ММОРПГ, где реализована полноценная система воровства. Вы можете не просто вскрывать сундуки, которые разбросаны в различных местах по миру, но и в буквальном смысле воровать вещи у других игроков, прямо из рюкзаков.

Система развития персонажа напоминает аналогичную систему из Ultima Online, где навыки прокачиваются по мере их использования. В игре есть скилл кап, по достижению которого, вы больше не сможете ни чего изучить, поэтому следует продумать свой билд наперёд. Но даже если вы захотели что то изменить в билде, то достаточно отнять необходимое значение очков и распределить их повторно на своё усмотрение. Характеристики персонажа и скиллы можно запросто заминусить и перераспределить в любой момент.
На бесплатном аккаунте, скиллы ограничены в 60 очков, вместо 100 у платных и так же нет возможности выучить определенные навыки, такие как воровство. Помимо прочего у бесплатных аккаунтов есть ограничения на торговлю.

Подведём итог.
Плюсы:
1. Старый, добрый хардкор по которому думаю многие успели соскучиться.
2. Песочница, где разработчики стараются по минимуму вмешиваться в происходящее.
3. Интересный крафт.
4. Реалистичная система боя.
5. Строительство.
6. Множество различных занятий.
7. Неплохая графика.
8. Хорошие возможности для ролеплееров.
9. Нет инстансов, зеркал и других шардов.
10. Отличное погружение в игру, благодаря виду от первого лица.
11. Интересная система магии.

А теперь пожалуй о минусах:
1. Игра просто изобилует багами.
2. Высокий порог вхождения.
3. Слабая техническая поддержка игры.
4. Слабый левел и гейм дизайн.

Но даже не смотря на эти минусы, Mortal Online занял уже давно свою нишу и пережил не одну современную MMO.

What is it: 
This MMO is be a first person sandbox role play game with full loot PvP.

The good: 
--A large library of skills to level up (Be a crafter, warrior, tamer, gatherer, etc.)
--Decent variety of races with different stats
--Single server for all players
--Credit to the devs for  adding new content throughout the game's life

The bad:
--Griefers abusing the criminal flag system in starting areas on newbies who don't know better. (Very bad for new player experience)
--Bugs that haven't been fixed when they were called out years ago.
--Dwindling population (I believe a direct result of the first two bullets.)
--Free to play players can't max out skills (Wish this effected speed at which you learned skills, rather than the cap)

With all this said, Mortal Online II is on the horizon. From what I've seen, they have a chance to fix the problems from Mortal Online I in a better engine. I really do hope they can straighten it all out, because I think this game could be very fun.

I played this long ago and called out a community member (lifetime sub i believe) for cheating which I had videos at the time. And because I didn't drop mentioning it to warn others I was perma banned and that player was never punished. 
The dev team has proven time an again with moderation of the discussions and banning of players from discord (never bothered that one myself) that they only want to take advantage of the cash cows of this genre that will pay them upfront large sums. 

Good for them just keep that in mind before paying for their next version which I've alpha tested to see much of the same. It's not worth the shelf price much less the monthly sub. 

That is if you are looking for a rewarding and balanced pvp experience that isn't curtailed by devs allowing their ""cows"" to get away with anything they want. Basically it's like playing an over priced half life mod on a private server where the devs are toxic.

This is my MO2 review for when it comes out:

 (Same MO community. Grief and Racism. Same MO Game. Crash and keep you logged in so you die in a full loot game. Simple fixes for both and yet still around in the second games alpha if you are hoping this ""Number 2"" was what you hoped the first one would be don't waste your time. It's basically MO1 with an upgraded engine. You can already see how they are laying it out and the fact they took the time to give penis physics but not cloaks shows you just whom they are looking to draw as an audience.

Mortal Online is something else for a free to play game.  I personally have only played as much as I could with the free to play portion of the game without ever diving into a single subscription with it. ( Do keep that in mind )

With a game much like Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, I feel this game has a similar way to treat skill gain. Each action you do from walking, to jumping, to crafting, to horseback riding, to combat, are all accounted for as you increase your character's skills. 

This drew me into the game as I love as your character can be made into however you want to play the game. You want to have a mage build? Focus on reading books and practice casting spells by hitting yourself with them. Want to be a legendary black smith?  Focus on crafting various pieces of equipment or hone your handiwork to one particular tool and make the best piece of equipment around. It is up to you to decide! With that form of freedom, it lets the user have things about them that stand out from someone else. 

Granted with being restricted to how high you can have a particular skill, kinda blows, in the free to play portion of the game. But that is just part of the game. I don't think this game is well worth having a sub. service when you will most likely need to dump countless hours into the game to get your worth from the game.

The biggest con I feel in this game is the amount of potential it has. The outdated feel to it, lacks polish of anything that would seem to be compared to other games. The only thing that I can see being better than this, is Mortal Online 2. Which is coming out whenever it feels like it. 

If I were you, I would dip your toes into this game to see how you will like it, but do keep in mind that you will be needing more than just a couple minutes out of your day to experience it. That is the only reason why I would recommend this game, other than that just wait until the second one comes out.",1604532221,1604532221,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It honestly baffles me how the devs can even in their wildest dreams think this game deserves a monthly subscription fee, let alone the same pricing as main stream MMO's. Playing ""free"" is really not an option. You will be steam rolled in both PVP and PVE. The world can be beautiful and begs to be explored however the roving bands of <200 ping pvpers screaming racial obscenities through their mics will find you. There is also the issue of thieves being able to pick pocket you in broad daylight feet away from a guard with impunity (unless you use their convoluted guard call system which is a crapshoot). The sad reality of Mortal online is that it is RIPE with potential. As stated before, the art and music are both beautiful and nostalgic, and the architecture of cities is unique (especially Tindrem). However the skill systems are NEEDLESSLY convoluted and require an obscene amount of time and RNG luck to master. Gear can (mostly) only be obtained through players who craft it. This would not normally be a problem, but with the low player count coupled with a limited amount of points to spend per character (you must purchase more slots with real money whether you are free to play or subscribed) , it can be difficult to gear up. The trading post is also on a town by town basis. You cannot have items delivered from another town. A problem compounded by Mortals' hands down most glaring issue: The community. I played with some good people who rarely killed for sport. Sadly, the vast majority of the games population is comprised of the worst trash humanity has to offer. If you choose to venture outside of major cities (where you still have to watch your wallet) , be prepared to be ran down and murdered by the marauding groups of non english speakers jabbering fractured insults into their mics. Melee combat is both clunky and HEAVILY reliant on connection. Most players have terrible connections and can simply ignore parries. I will not speak for the magic system nor the archery. PVE could be a high point if the constant threat of overgeared enemy players was not a thing. PVE monsters are visually pleasing for the most part if not a little recycled from one encounter to the next. Terrain can be your biggest enemy at times as well. With no fast traveling system you are forced to travel manually. The terrain in Mortal seems to be RNG based. Some mountains you can climb with ease, other times a small hill will stop you dead. Some hills can be descended with ease while others will plummet you instantly to your death for no apparent reason. Mounts can be ridden and animals tamed, offering what COULD be a unique interaction with NPCs, but remember, skill points are finite. I truly wish I could have stomached the community and combat enough to really explore every inch of the world offered. PVE or soft core servers would go a very long way in fixing this. Hopefully lessons where learned and Mortal 2 will fix all of this and more, but I doubt it.

По началу, о игре складывается вполне себе хорошие впечатления, но это только по началу! Чем больше вы играете в эту игру, тем больше ваша психика будет страдать от разрывов вшей жопы! И дело здесь не в плохом балансе, и не в читерах, и не сложности игры, и даже не в донате и месячной подписки! Дело в том, что игра ужасно баганутая просто вщи!

Понимаете, первое время вы шарахатесь, от того что после рестарта сервера, ваш перс проваливается сквозь пол, падает в некую таинственную воду, а затем там умирает со всем лутом что вы заработали своим честным! Вы шарахетесь, у вас жутко подгорит пятая точка! Но, продолжаете играть, потому что надеетесь, что больше в этой игре багов нет... Но, как показала практика, это всё предположения для наивных школеров! Когда, же я увидел, как монстры в данжах ходят сквозь стены, срезая пути. То есть, я так понимаю, с поиском пути и взаимодействиями с какими-то объектами, в этой чудо игре просто не запаривались! Но даже такой трэш, я стерпел, и продолжил играть!

Но, на этом говнище от разрабов не заканчивается! Когда, я свалил с нуболокации в игровой мир, в первом же данже меня вальнули боты арчеры, вы сейчас орнёте, стреляя через стены!!! Да, да! Создатели игры, поленились даже сделать адекватную систему наведения для мобов. Они тупо херачат терез стены! Магия млять... ))) И этот весь трэш в 2020 году. 
В общем, это далеко не все говно, но именно эта херня стала последний каплей кипения, когда я удалил это китайско/шведское говно к херам! Подругому я не знаю как это назвать...

В эту игру реально играют только мазахисты! И с такими багами игра должна быть в стадии пре АЛЬФА и полностью бесплатной...

NOTHING works correctly and the amount of things you can't do is extremely annoying. (like you cant cast spell with torch equipped, you cant rest with this instance, you cant stack spells, you cant, you cant, you cant.)
Besides the game is totally abandoned by the creators. The monetary system makes no sense, the fight mechanics is stupidly stucky and laggy, enemies passing (and hitting) through the walls and absolutely zero fun. Anything you try to accomplish is always in vain. 6h gathering stuff and you lose it all cuz you jumped form a small rock and took 1030 fall damage, 2 days gathering pieces for the demon boss and once you defeat him, the game just dont gives you the reward (which is a cape without any stats, just a cape). if you ask for help in the /help chat you got responses like ""shut the f*** up noob""

The good....

It APPEARS to have a great (or better) crafting game to it.
For a Free to Play game...the graphics are wonderful.

The bad....

You can never repair anything in the game I'm told. A relatively minor hiccup but I can try to understand why the devs do it that way-- to keep customers coming back to the crafter for more of the ""secret"" mixture. Whatever.

This is a survival sim. Unless you are a FULL veteran of the genre....be prepared to die (stupidly) HUNdreds of times.

Now the worst of it.... The ""help"" chat is WORSE than useless. As a matter of fact...it's filled with a bunch of ASSwipes that are savage and cruel. I'm not the only player that thinks so too. Coulda been a great game.... Here....let me summarize....

Less than eight hours in at the time...I'm a NOOB....I got that far. I'm SUPPOSED to find truly embarrassingly stupid ways to die. All I wanted at the time was find my corpse with all my gear so I wouldn't have to start ALL over again (naked with a sword). I had just died a second time falling off the same cliff I did the first time looking for said corpse. What do I do? I go to the HELP chat. Seemed like a good idea at the time. They started cracking JOKES about my mistakes. More specifically....I respawned at the ""nearest"" priest so I had less than zero clue where my original corpse was-- let alone where ""noob town"" was. After rezzing in...all I knew was that the town guards were dressed funny (differently). Without thinking...I made an off-handed comment (in the chat).... 

""Uh....I don't think that I'm in Kansas anymore...."" Some jackass in the chat then comes back with....

""What....you didn't click your heels three times?""

I could have killed him. Gratefully....there was the Internet between us.....

Other than I'm not happy with Albion and I want the newer/better graphics....maybe even a crafting system worth a snot....you tell me why I still play until I can't stand it. I'm on the noob island, right? At one point I was JUST trying to leave my corpse behind and get back to town so that I could get back to PLAYing the game..... I stopped in the middle of the road to side chat with another player (gotta love those...people you meet....they are usually MORE than helpful).....and two wolves found me.

Dead....UHgain....

I will say this though.....based on my experience with this game....I'll be GODdamned if I play the next one....let alone PAY for the son of a bitch.....

Кратко факты:
1.	Это симулятор ходьбы. Четверть умений персонажа посвящена его способам перемещения. Поход в ближайшую точку интереса займет от 15 до 30 минут ходьбы по локации. Быстрых и/или автоматизированных способов перемещения в игре нет.
2.	Из навигации только компас. Карты местности нет.
3.	В случае смерти потребуется добежать в виде призрака до священника. И это самый быстрый способ перемещения в игре. А после с привалами и одышкой возвращаться поднимать свое снаряжение. Если оно того стоит. Указателей на его место положения нет.  Таймера на исчезновение тоже нет. Все ваше добро – три неприметных мешочка в траве. Это самое частое и основное ваше занятие при исследовании игры и ее мира. Одно падение – это минус пол часа времени в режиме управляемой беготни.
4.	Однообразие, при видимости разнообразия: из всей уймы навыков получается только 3 типа бойцов  в 2 разновидностях – волшебник, стрелок, рубака в пешем или конном исполнении. Ремесленники узкопрофильные, без возможности совмещать другие типы активности. И да, слот персонажа всего один, дополнительные продаются в магазине.
5.	Бой – без целей. Бой сводится к комбинациям из действий: блок-удар-пробежка-бинты или прицел-выстрел-пробежка-бинты или каст-выстрел-пробежка. Как бонус для ценителей – управление боевым питомцем через команды. 
6.	Графика – картинка по типу TES-4: Oblivion. При этом неоправданно прожорлива.
7.	И где-то там есть ПвП, войны гильдий и прочее. Если у вас к тому моменту останется на них время и желание.
-------------------------------
Mortal online-the apotheosis of poverty and boredom.
Brief facts:
1.	This is a walking simulator. A quarter of the character's skills are devoted to his ways of moving. The trip to the nearest point of interest will take from 15 to 30 minutes walk around the location. There are no fast and/or automated ways to move in the game.
2.	Of navigation is only compass. There is no map of the area.
3.	In case of death, you will need to run as a Ghost to the priest. And this is the fastest way to move in the game. And then with halts and shortness of breath to return to lift your own equipment. If it's worth it. There are no signs of its location.  There's no timer for disappearing body. All your goods are three inconspicuous bags in the grass. This is your most frequent and main activity when exploring the game and its world. One fall – it is minus half an hour of time in controlled running mode.
4.	Sameness, with the illusion of diversity: from the whole lot of skills, only 3 types of charakters in 2 varieties are obtained – the wizard, the shooter, the Slayer on foot or on horseback. Artisans are narrow-profile, without the ability to combine other types of activity. And Yes, the character slot is only one, additional ones are sold in the store.
5.	Battle – non target. Fight is reduced to combinations of actions: block-blow-run-bandages or sight-shot-run-bandages or cast-shot-run. As a bonus for connoisseurs - control of a fighting pet through commands. 
6.	Graphics - picture like TES-4: Oblivion. At the same time unnecessarily voracious.
7.	And somewhere there is Pvp, Guild wars, and so on. If you have time and desire for them by then.",1578251181,1578251181,False,7,0,0.586270809173583984,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Joguei este jogo em 2010 no beta, porem joguei uns 4 meses somente, pois na época era muito hardcore pra mim.. e não tinha tanto tempo disponível pra me dedicar ao jogo.. então parei de jogar ele.

Agora em Dezembro de 2019 recebi um e-mail da produtora, dizendo que estava sendo desenvolvido o Mortal Online 2!! ai vi o video do MO2 e fiquei muito empolgado..

Ai resolvi voltar a jogar o MO depois de quase 10 anos.. então vamos lá.. 

O jogo melhorou 10000% desde que parei de jogar, em tudo.. gráficos, apesar de não ser perfeito esta bom pra um jogo que foi lançado a 1 década, O som esta bom também, jogabilidade melhorou bastante porem a movimentação é meio robotizada.. novamente, por se tratar de um jogo de 10 anos esta aceitável. jogabilidade, skills, craft, etc perfeito.. 

Aqui você faz seus itens, por exemplo você pode fazer um arco e flecha único, se você descobrir por exemplo uma receita fazendo um arco que tem 110 de força, e full distancia, com uma boa durabilidade, outro player não vai conseguir fazer igual, ou seja se você descobrir a formula magica você pode vender a receita, ou simplesmente fazer estes arcos especiais e vender pra todo mundo no mercado. isso vale, pra armas, armaduras, joias, encantamentos, comida etc..

Você pode ser um Fabricante de armas, Armaduras, Domador de animais, Cozinheiro..
Você não quer fabricar, mais quer ganhar dinheiro vendendo Matéria prima, pode por exemplo ser coletor de madeira, minério, plantas, açougueiro, pescador etc.. 

Ou então ser um guerreio, pra confrontar com outros players, ou ate mesmo ser um caçador de recompensas e ganhar dinheiro matando players que estão sendo procurados por outros jogadores..

Mortal Online é um jogo MMORPG de mundo totalmente aberto, você pode ir onde quiser, pode construir desde uma casinha pequena a uma cidade.

It mostly depends on you, with who you hook up. 80:20 for good guys (that is when you just ignore kids and aholes). 
It has bugs. A lot. Its not gamebraking. 
Awesome crafting, exploration and trading system. What kind of axe will you craft, from what material and for how much will you sell it, it really depends on you. 
Fishing, I just love fishing. Dont have to be genius to do that and it brings good money. 
I dont know about PvP, never done that. 
Never used magic. 
Love to go to cave to hunt white rabbit. Or to mine that shiny glimmering ore.
Simple, just having fun. Trading with people. For few years now. Great experince. 
Waiting for MO2. Until then, cya in MO :)

Im fascinated by the level of detail and things you can do and get better and from a sanbox rpg perspektiv, skills that you can get better at are for example Meditation, combatmanuvering, momentum, breathing skill, and diffrent types of crafting skills like fishish, woodcutting etc. Ive only seen the realworld and been in it for a short while before the patch but the haven world is big and lots of stuff to explore and learn. If you like a game with questhelper, arrows and directions exsactly where to go that either makes it more practical or straight up dumbs down the experience this is not a game for you. You will have to give it time to learn and use the compass to be able to navigate in the game. The combat is good but not great, the mecanics are okey with the parry timing and deppending on where you cut or spike you do more dmg. I heard that pvp is one of the  fun parts though and i havnt tried it yet. Since its a unique game with full loot you will need to contact some of the vets and reach out joining guilds i think to be able to manuver around the game saftly, you will have a bank to save your stuff in but ones your not a flegdling the game can be pretty brutal and you either like it or not. It has no questlog which is a bit strange but you kind of improve and make favours later i think, you think alot by yourself what to do, so to speak, and lots of things you can do to make gold in the game. I liked that it i felt that your learn skills and get better at it, thats how it is with most games but this the devs I guess really wanted to you feel that you start with nothing and get better and better. You can craft armours and name them.You craft both right and left hand not couples.

I have a pretty decent computer with geforce 1070, i want to max it but i had to bring some things down abit cause otherwise the combat lagged sometimes. Also the game crashed ones but I think they can work on that, haven is more steady now then in the beggining. Besides that i actually think that atleast in haven some places are beautiful with the sun and enviorment, animals etc, hope they will have the attention, effort and money to make Mo2 good and not rushed then it could actually be one of the hitgames of 2020-2030.  Some things are abit too much sandbox I  think, for example I was trading with a merchant, and I wanted to buy a pickaxe and it  was denied so i thought it was a bug but I had to press ""I"" and put the money inside the ""sell box"" then put the pickaxe in the buy box. Sure in real life you take up your wallet and give the shopkeeper or whatever money they dont take it out of your wallet but I had to ask the helpchat cause i didnt know. So etiher make it clear that your mental for the sandboxRPG aspect and thats how it should be or let the trade happen automaticly like other games.

There are some balances that they have to attend to i heard like mounts being op to fight from and boring to fight with so lets see how it progresses. 
It has no skins or such so they deppend on subscribers and i think it should be some ethical way to buy skins or pet skins that does not remind you around every corner that you should buy it but the option should exist to support them with smal one time fees if you like the game and give it time but still dont want to subscribe.

If you are intressed or like some of the things I said its definitly worth trying, the community was nice to me and a discord exists also.",1570973273,1571045052,True,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I guess most of this is more personal.....game breaking for me,but then again what are reviews anyway so..........

My first issue (and the biggest for me)  
The game is limited with remapping your controls.  I use the arrow keys to move so I like to use right shift and ctrl .....it is closer to my fingers than the left ones hahaha   
not in this game.....you try to use thos keys it defaults it back to left.
I can NOT use the extra keys on my gaming mouse.  Sure the game tells me I have mapped something to them but no matter what gets mapped to them....they do nothing

this alone is game breaking for me

the second issue I have.....
the subscription and char slots have NOTHING to do with each other.each is payed for indavidually. 
I for one like to have many toons that do diff things.....im not paying 9$ each to do that.......then the subscription fee. 
I know I dont have to pay for the sub.......however if i want to compete in PvP (the game is for the most part open PvP) with equally skilled/geared player (and when lucky better player than myself) then them 40 extra skill point matter.

not game breaking ......however......nickle and dimming your player base is just a shitty thing to do.

some games get the micro transactions right.....others dont


if some day they correct the key mapping issues ill come back and play this again.......ill even spend money doing it , but I cant play a game i can set the controls where i want.

Warnings:

""Free"" in this game means unlimited-limited trial. That means unlimited time, limited abilities. Or infinite limited trial if you'd like. Your skills are capped at 60 as a free 2 play. You cant craft good weapons, so don't. Paying for this game is somewhat expensive, but it is pretty worth it. Well, it would be if the game had more than 100 or so players.

Apart from the skill caps: theres barely anything else that a subscription does. Only other things would be thievery, wich makes it so you can steal shit from other's inventories like gold and jewels etc. You also get to own a house when you sub.

This game does not hold your hand. It's not for pussies, low-effort-mmo players and the like. Full loot system means you lose everything upon death.

And you will die.

And again.

And again.

And you will cry, but that's okay.

This is a game that will punish you for small things, and a game that will make you truly work HARD for what you want, especially as a f2p. 

I have been playing since mid 2k15. It definitely took me a month or two to decide I liked the game, and it's taken me years to learn everything I should know about nave. 

Before you continue reading, I recommend trying the game first, rather than taking others experiences as the best route.

Yes, many rumors about this game are true, such as a fairly unresponsive staff and a few *minor* bugs (a friend of mine crossed the bridge and ended up in belrim lol), and an extremely toxic empire known as RPK has ownership of ~70% of the map. However, these things often don't matter when you and your friends are genuinely having a blast killing giant grasshoppers.

Now for the subjective part of the review:
This game truly is wonderful, once you get around it's, uh, quirks. This is true open world freedom, there are no official restrictions, you can do as you wish. There are many guilds you can join in order to band together with others, dozens of character builds, and hundreds of hours of gameplay in the exploring alone, let alone dungeons, grinding, bosses, PvP, and crafting. This is the best game I have played, and I have decent amount if games on steam alone. Best of all, if you really know what your doing, p2p or a sub isn't even necessary.

Just download it and try, play a few hours. Don't let the pkers steer you away, there's always a way out of a situation in mortal online. Thanks for coming to my ted talk",1560873277,1560873277,True,37,8,0.747832417488098145,1,False,False,False,False,,,

How Difficult? Think of this as the Dark Souls of MMO RPGs. It's hard to learn, you die Easily, and if you don't take your time and get very angry at the game quickly, you'll end up in RPK or quitting the game because of how shit you became. This game requires time and patience to learn, you may not be fast or Strong at first, but if you level those skills you'll not complain about them any more. Or you could gram a Mount.
Is it grindy? Kinda, you need to grind certaint actions/read books to get better at the game and to get better Materials but you can take it at your own pace as there is not a single quest in the entiraty of the game
How's the Community? It's not Toxic if you're in the right part of the map. Just watch out for people with RPK under their name
What is the Games Possibilities? You can be a Necromancer Archer who crafts armour and then the Next day Be a Tamer who is a Expert at one hand. My friend also became death

Keep in mind however, I spent most of my time PvEing


All these people saying ""You need to subscribe"" are all shenanigoons.
I have Hundreds of hours and I've never subscribed.

----------------------------------------Things you need to pay for -------------------------------------------

-Creating a guild

-Building houses/keeps

-Pickpocket other players

-Top Tier Armor/weapon crafting

-You can only level skills to 60, but I see this as almost a blessing It only really affects mount speed/stam
                                                   (I'll get more into this later)

-Being a super late game mage that knows every necromancy spell and can change the weather


-------------------------------------------Things you can still do as FTP-----------------------------------

-Join a guild (YES even if you're free to play you can still farm hunt and tame animals, they would LOVE to have you)

-Explore the game and fight the majority of enemies, I've been in many guilds and have seen a LOT of the end game content.

-Kill other players, even if they pay to play. (This takes a bit of skill and knowledge however, I will explain later)

-Become rich----You might not make as much gold as some of these top tier craftsmen, but taming animals and adventuring for materials (Animal hides, plants, drops ect.) can make you a fortune. 

-Having a house---You might not be able to build a house, but I've been in guilds where they've made a guild shack where I wanted that I could use pretty much the same way as a house. 

-Have sweet pets--- As a FTP tamer I've tamed/dominated bears, demon dogs, wolves, crazy ride-able lizards, mammoth rhinos, yaks and a bunch of others.

                                                          FREE TO PLAY TIPS

So, first off your skills... as a Free to play your skills cap at 60, which definitely limits you but at the same time opens a whooole world of crazy possibility.

For example every player F2P or P2P has the same amount of points available to spend. So while a P2P might have 100 in maces and 100 in riding and 100 in armor you know what they don't have ? 

60 in taming
60 in swimming
60 in magic
60 in archery

But you don't have 100 riding or riding stam control which really sucks, I say put points into swimming(No one has swimming) and fight near water 

ect ect...

So you just need to be sure to lock your skills at 60 !!!!!
With all those extra points you can spec into many different things. Pick whichever you like :)



--But in all honesty if you want to join the big PVP guilds and just do team deathmatch all day you will probably want to pay.
--They do wars, and as a F2P most of your PVP will be 1v1 - 3v3 in the wilderness type stuff



Now To make money as a FTP early game can be tricky. Taming animals is definitely viable, there are donkeys which can get you started but if you don't want to tame you can:

---Farm heads like a pleb to get your skills up
---Get to meduli and pick up Bor, seadew and Cactus and whatever else you can find in the area just south by the water

---Once you get enough gold buy some armor and a mount, maybe read a skill book or two then go adventure and explore!!!



                       -----If you are afraid of getting ganked head into the desert------

--Go south of Tind and Meduli near the coast and go across the bridge to the Desert. Head to the Big ass tree in the distance and then go north west. 
-You will see a huge desert town, outside of the town and all around the desert there are Toghair plants, they are stalky and full of pink orbs you cant miss em
-Gather and sell those. Once you get enough gold for armor and a mount start practicing mounted archery on deer(springbok) until you can hunt the Ratzar workers
And just go from there killing different mobs. (Ratzar hunters will wreck you until your skills are maxed, they have nasty range)

If you die in the desert it's okay ! just ghost to the desert town and respawn there. I've almost NEVER been killed by another player in the desert you will be safer.

Except you may be eaten by Ratzar... or Die to heat exhaustion... I personally like it more than the mainland.

                  -------But there is SERIOUSLY so much to do even as a free to play---------

 It really fills that hole for needing a hardcore MMO that doesn't hold your hand. There's a very active community once you leave the starting areas. Some will gank you, others are excited and willing to help newcomers get a foot in. 
If you're sick of WoW clones that only care about graphics, copy/paste Rust and Ark survival games, all Battle Royaled out, and need something that is actually both challenging and rewarding, I'd suggest giving it a try. 
It's basically what you would get if Darkfall and Ultima Online had a dark bastard child.
Combat builds are complex and in depth. Crafting and farming is labour intensive but worth it. Crafters actually matter a great deal in this game unlike current ""sandbox"" games. *cough* Archeage/BDO *cough*
Also an actual sandbox MMO where tamers are highly warranted and needed, which means you can make a living off of hunting out rare mounts, taming, and selling for a lot.

If you like hardcore gaming this is it. Fairly realistic game play though very buggy at times. Outdated and somewhat abandoned the game is truly immersive and rewarding if you put in the effort. The start is somewhat slow especially if you've never played this genre. Though with time and patience you will master your skills or get wrecked in the process {all part of the game}. Biggest tip i can give you is do not get attached to your items. This game is a sandbox mmorpg where you lose your items on death though you can get them back if they haven't been looted. Some times it may feel dead, which i am not denying, but at certain times especially the weekends you will see a decent amount of people online. i Play almost everyday and usually have someone to play with even if i just meet them. Don't be afraid to explore though i would recommend starting in the city of Tindrem and reading some books first and build up a bit of your stats so you have a fighting chance against creatures and players. Tindrem is an interesting place and i believe it be fairly populated and you will have just about everything you need to get started. You can become a thief, fighter mounted and on foot, you can perform ranged combat on horseback as well on foot. Magic is in this game though it's a little pricey for reagents though the starting books are cheap. I also recommend you complete the tutorial. You get to choose a ""class"" though its not locked. It just gives you a book and a weapon depending on what you choose will determine the book and weapon. You will also be given 50 silver which can buy some books as well. Books will continue to be read even while you are off line. You can level other skills while reading books.The combat is similar to the Mount and Blade series. As well as The Elder's Scrolls series, more like morrowind and oblivion imo. But online and more buggy :). In total i would rate this game 7/10. Reason being that the developer's have abandoned the game almost. They do have a small team working on the game though if i'm being honest they don't really fix much instead add unfinished items or mess something up while trying to fix something else. The game has been around over 10 years now and is not as populated as it once was and some of the people who do play are not the most noob friendly though there are more who do than don't almost everyone you meet is not out to get you though  i would not turn your back until your certain they are your friend and even then always helps to be careful. I would recommend this to any player who has patience and is seeking to have adventures of sorts. Very fun game especially when you realize how huge the world is. I've been playing around a year and haven't even seen 20 percent of the world and i know players who have seen close to the same who have been playing far longer than i have.

Successful gameplay requires trusted friends to prevail, yet the community is toxic because there is more to be gained in the short term from killing a friendly player than from helping them. This has created a large group of players who treat the game like a death match where everyone is kill on sight. The end result of this division in community creates an exciting and rewarding experience for loyal guild players but a steep entry for new players.

Fair warning: I put a lot of my time into this game, expanding and leveling my abilities, equipment and character build and I tried recommended pve and pvp builds yet I never felt powerful or sufficiently rewarded for my effort so when I stopped playing this it left me wondering why I wasn't playing something else. The sense of accomplishment in this game is definitely ethereal and heavily fleeting, much worse than the same from any other MMO I have played.

I've been on and off with this game for a long time now, back in 2014 and before playing on steam originally so my hours aren't fully reliable.  This game can either really love you and give you something unique that no other game or MMO can give you, or it'll abuse you and make you frustrated.  The game itself is pretty great, they've also fixed a bunch of problems from the past and they've been trying to keep the game alive and fresh, and the PVE content is fantastic.  

Here are some good examples.  You have various dungeons all over, the fighting of enemy mobs is simple but rewarding and once you build yourself up you start feeling like a somebody, rather than some homeless man that can't do anything.  The skill system is another nice feature that lets you actually feel like you developed into what you were aiming for, as crafting and focusing on trade skills will develop yourself into a actual smith or miner or gatherer or builder or whatever you want.  You can for example be a butcher, which you start off by butchering animal carcasses you kill, selling the products of what you get from the carcasses, make money, purchase carcasses from people after putting a buy order up, then slowly build yourself up as you make more money and improve, then that smith will use your materials to do the exact same thing to make armor or weapons for people or to put on the broker as a source of income.  The economy is fantastic, it forces players to help players and it brings the community together in a way.  Everyone has their role in the world, and adventurers and explorers are also valuable.  

The big part that really brings the game down, but not too much, is the PvP.  For example, you can get looted whenever after death by anyone due to it's full loot system.  Now that isn't bad, and it does promote pvp which is good, but the pvp itself can be a little messy.  You have to block at the right time in the direction someone is swinging to parry the blow, and then hit them, meanwhile both of you are running around and the game itself isn't too good at managing what's happening because of the map nodes and just server lag.  Yet again that's no reason to really stop playing as you can always rebuild in the game and come back.   You just have to be prepared to get griefed hard and fast by players that only care about killing people because it's fun to them.  For example there's a certain guild, probably the biggest one called RPK that focuses on killing people, because they love having the freedom to do whatever they want, especially killing people.  It's a noble in a sense as they believe you should do what you want, but it's often only to kill players for no good reason.  You could be watching a duel going on and be completely naked and still get killed.  Does that mean you should give up? Nope.  

The bottom line is that you should come in expecting the wildest encounters, as you can meet some really funny people and have some great experiences that you wouldn't expect, but you should also understand you'll get abused hard, even if you're a cautious player.  Don't get me wrong, not all RPK is bad, or other guilds that focus on PVP, as I've met a bunch that were pretty cool, but there's always going to be that one guy.",1550825837,1550825837,True,10,0,0.593884527683258057,0,False,False,False,False,,,

That being said the GAME is a good game, a new experience from other types of pvp games seemed way more personal than anything with some good rivalries and great pvp moments.

Mortal has one big flaw when it comes to the open market that is easy to grief players who wanna be like salesman some prevail but many fail exp. Crafting bad stuff price flux and renaming books have plauged the market. Also the map reasources are just randomly scattered with no real thought to player economy. Map is also pretty empty some town lack uniqueness and are dull lack of events town champions or any kind of real ownership is killing it. The pvp is nice it seems quite skillful as a game can get what some people fail to understand it's hard to balance weps in games cause in real life these things were never balanced to match your opponent you just found a wep better than your enemies and smashed em with it. Now there are some just dump truck stuff they hauled in but for the most part I think it's fairly balanced with the weps. now the magic is a whole half rejected half admired thing in the game they have balanced it at one point and then destroyed it another fat mages are class I don't think was fully intended these are mages that go over weight scraficing movement for Max intellegence and psyche resulting in being hit 70 every 5 seconds  from range on a mounted horse so that movement penalty means dick pretty much a op character.

We all know that the game is for hardcore gamers. And we have to accept that. 
The thing that I want to ask you is to try and persuade the developers to make it free. They don’t understand that this game will have a lot of potential if they make it free. Nowadays people are not used to play this kind of games and won’t spend their money easily for subscription. They will play a free game and pay for in-game items (I don’t mean pay to win items).
So, about the review.

Monthly Subscription.
The game is free, this is plus point right? But wait.... You develop your skills up to 60, You can't build houses. You can't use thievery. And of course, like the developers said ""Every player gets one free character slot, and you can purchase additional slots up to a maximum of four"". 
So, I would say thank you about the one-character slot, you are so generous.
You are kidding me, right? Paying 9$ for every slot plus a subscription which allow me to tell you that the price is EUR 14.25 (incl. VAT EUR 2.85) while World of Warcraft or other companies have their subs in EUR 12.99 (in $ its 16,25$ for MO and 14,81$ for WoW). Include also what possibilities each company offers you in-game.  So, another gold digger company I would say. And for the last let me tell you that there are a lot of people who are using hacks. And some of them are here with the ""recommend comments""

About The Graphics.
The game has one of the best texture graphics that I have seen. Being an old player and checking a lot of games I can say that the game has one of the best ""world"" graphics. 
The character graphics, physics, and animations are bad but if they improve their engine, they can make them one of the best. Describing the towns and scenery in my opinion I have to say that they are one of the best out there. For players who come from other games I can tell you that the ""world"" textures are similar with The Elder Scrolls Online.

Let’s skip the part of creation of character which you need a lot of in-game time to choose what race is better for what you want to do.

The game is not very understandable since you are thrown in the game and you don’t know what to do at the beginning. The tutorial is poor so not worth mentioning. If you are waiting for other people to help you.... naaah the help system is so bad but, there is the 1% that are helpful. This is very bad because the game basically is moved by the players (quests, jobs, market). So, after many hours (not kidding) you will find your way.

Since I said about the way I have to mention that the game has no map (You can find one online but it’s not updated with resources or creatures or staff like that).
The stats about every item are not understandable and you need a lot of reading to understand them and of course craft them. Recipes like another reviewer said are sold for real money (That’s how you understand that one game is destroyed).

Physics.
Physics of mounts and players are bad. Seriously sometimes mounts are bugged and will not stop from running that you have to press repeatedly R button to dismount or run towards an obstacle (also with equipment and skills).
I love seeing new people dropped from their mounts while they are repeatedly press to stop or run faster. The animation is so ridiculous.
NPC sometimes will hit you from too far with melee attacks and after that they will come closer (believe me I mean it when I say that they hit you from far with melee attacks). Their hits are not visible but after some time you will learn to parry them with fantasy since first comes the damage and random it shows you the movement.

Last but not least I have to say that the game is worth trying out ONLY for FREE.
I don't recommend paying for this since there are more worth games out there to pay for them.
The only thing I want to ask from developers is for better improvement of the game like I said before and make it free at last after almost 9 years. In these 9 years they resolved some bugs but after 9 years the game is the same. Absolutely the same game with no graphic changes, not improvements. Only they added some staff like building. What they worth if the peak online population daily is around 40 people?
For other developers I have to ask them to make the same game with these changes.
I believe that if they ask for donations to make the same game from the beginning with better all the above people will support them because they need games like that.
I hope one day we will have one worth Mortal Online.

He fought for the good, and me and him raised and guided armies of 1000s to fight for our cause. Everyday, RPK would raid peacefull villages and leave nothing but blood. We fought for Tindrum in the most world changing war MORTAL ONLINE has ever seen. The Great War of Mortal, it was called. Deee and I fought RPK at the gates of tindrum, saving millions of lives. Commanded Ships, sent groundtroops, even invented spells to grant us victory. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht5Z7Ls0CBA&list=PL09S7DfMeH2ATrST7DKC47F93mPuEMTgj
....RPK has won, taken our armies apart. And with that, we were alone once more. The world of Mortal will never be the same. In our last efforts, Deeee and I invaded their mainbase as an army of 2. We were able to take down 2 Navy Commanders, and one wargod. But before we were able to take down RPK's King, we were caught on the headgod's bridge. We fought bravely, but after taken several arrows to the head. I fallen into the river. As I slowly bleed out, Deeee's anger emerged as he saw his cousin die. Tears ran down his face, as his worn shortsword began to glow. The blade his wield, transformed to the legendary weapon the SWORD OF TEARS. He took two slashes and whipped out half RPK's Army along with their airborn and navy fleets. He fell into the river behind him, and sank down. Legend says the Deeeee's amulent and My cape is still at the bottom of the lake. The amulent granted the user the strength of 1000 men, and the cape was said to give a man a power of the gods.

「正しく遊ぶためには有料月額性である」

ちょっと昔話を
今では既に大昔、UOは転換期を以て純然たるスキル制から逸脱した際、「UOの３D版が出る(誤」と大いにヘイヴンを沸かせたのが「ResonanceAge」現在のMaster of Epicである。それをもう少しハードコアにした感じが、このMortal Onlineだと言える。

3Dに関し、粗削りの度を越え正直手伝ってやりてぇと思うぐらいフィールドマップやら何やらの作りはひどい。スタックしないのが驚きだと考えれば、「MAP造形に関しては、貴方にとって過去最悪となるだろう」と断言できて仕方ないだろう。ハッキリ言って「これに興味を持つ日本人」にはMoEをお薦めする。

だが、制作陣からは、少なくともこのMotalが全盛だった時期の制作陣には、あの時代のUOの、現代風に言い回すのであれば「SAOに近いあの匂い」に対する強烈なオマージュを感じざるを得ない。解る人にしか解らない事を言っている自覚はある。

あの未成熟だったNETの混沌とした空気の中で、臨場感と出会いとそれらを取り巻くアクシデントと、半ばPK発祥の時代のあの悪意と、そこに纏わる善意や温かみ。何を以てそれを語るかと云えば下らない、「全裸が標準実装」と云う中学男子の悪意を掻き立てるには十分すぎるフレーバーだろう？と、我ながら警告なのか煽りなのか定かではない事を突き付けて見たくなる。

その点から女性には8割の強さで「勧めない」と言いたいが、「女性のハードゲーマーの求めるリスキーさ」と云う物はあいにくと私自身が男なので、その存在を認識こそすれ、理解の埒外であるとしか言えない。とは言え、強者のフレに囲まれ姫プレイ(或いは騎士プレイ)の真骨頂を構築し得る世界観であるのも事実ではあるだろう。

また、馬鹿正直にスキル値で殴り合うだけが勝負ではない。中学生や高校生の英語力であれ、社交(権謀術数)や利害関係が罷り通ると云う事は伝えておいて損はないだろう。努力する価値はあるよ？これこそが洋ゲーに於ける日本の弱点なのだから。

私自身、もう何時からだったのか思い出せないほどのゲーム全般に於いてソロプレイヤーなので、これ以上は言える事は無いが最後に、価値はともかく仕様(臨場感)として「所属50名に対し、安定期のアクティブは凡そ10名なんて普通だ」と考えるなら、割と気張った移住は価値があるだろう。純生産プレイヤーやポーターに意味が生まれるこの世界では、ソロプレイで月額を払っていく価値があるかと云えば微妙なのだ。「自分が帰るべき仲間達の下」と云う空想上の言葉が、意義を持つ。

Trzymałem Mortal Online na liście życzeń od 2014 roku, więc nie pamiętam nawet jakie myśli towarzyszyły mi w momencie, gdy go tam dodawałem. Wiem natomiast, że dałem mu szansę na skutek przeczytanych recenzji. Czy były to recenzje pozytywne czy negatywne, wszystkie wspominały o bardzo wysokim poziomie trudności i prawdziwej dowolności.

Gra studia Star Vault należy do gatunku MMORPG. Jeżeli jednak wyobraziliście sobie rozbudowany interfejs, cukierkową grafikę, piękne postacie, wykrzykniki z questami i świat wypełniony po brzegi wszelakimi aktywnościami, to na wstępie zaznaczam, że ""MMORPG"" jest tutaj wstawione ze względu na spełniane kryteria gatunku. Tej grze daleko bowiem do tego, co na co dzień kojarzone jest z MMORPG.

Tym, co na starcie wyróżnia tytuł i jednocześnie tym, co mnie osobiście kupiło jest fakt, że rozgrywka prowadzona jest tutaj z perspektywy pierwszej osoby. Dla wszystkich. Bez wyjątku.
Pozwala to na większą immersję podczas eksploracji świata, walki czy kontaktów ze znajomymi. Wszystko wydaje się ""bardziej namacalne"" niż w przypadku innych MMORPG.

Kamera pierwszoosobowa dodatkowo pozwala na zmianę systemu walki. Jest on bardzo podobny do tego, który kojarzyć możemy z serii The Elder Scrolls, tylko bardziej drewniany. W zależności od używanej broni białej (takiej jak chociażby miecze jednoręczne, dwuręczne, topory, buławy, kije bojowe, włócznie), wyprowadzamy wolniejsze lub szybsze ciosy, o krótszym lub dłuższym zasięgu. Dzięki temu walki PVP są bardzo skillowe i dają możliwość pokonania gracza lepiej rozwiniętego czy lepiej wyposażonego. Skillowy system walki przekłada się na pojedynki pełne ataków, odskoków, parowania czy blokowania tarczą. W grze występuje również magia i bronie dystansowe, ale to walka z innymi, stalą w stal, mimo że drewniana, przynosi największą satysfakcję.

A podczas walki lepiej się postarać, ponieważ śmierć niesie ze sobą poważne konsekwencje. W grach z gatunku MMO, oprócz zdobywania kolejnych poziomów postaci i rozwijania statystyk, ważne jest zbieranie wyposażenia. Wyposażenia, które wszyscy kochamy zbierać, ulepszać, kompletować i pokazywać innym. A w tym tytule, w przypadku śmierci, nasze wszystkie przedmioty zostają wśród naszych zwłok, podatne na kradzież przez innych graczy. Z tego właśnie powodu gotów jestem śmierć w tej grze określać mianem nawet ""permanentnej"", bo utrata legendarnego wyposażenia, to jak strata połowy statystyk. I to jest druga rzecz, która pozytywnie wyróżnia Mortal Online.

A jeżeli mówimy o statystykach i levelowaniu postaci, również one nie są zwyczajne.
Nie grindujemy, nie wbijamy ogólnego poziomu postaci. Zamiast tego mamy do czynienia z systemem levelowania poszczególnych czynności i umiejętności, i tak o to poprzez walkę z użyciem konkretnej broni - trenujemy posługiwanie się tą bronią, poprzez używanie bandaży podnosimy wiedzę anatomiczną, bieganie poprawia atletykę, itd. itd. Jest nawet technika oddychania, którą da się rozwinąć :D
Oprócz umiejętności i czynności, blokujemy i odblokowujemy główne statystyki, jakie mają się u postaci rozwinąć. Pula tych statystyk jest ograniczona i to ona świadczy o uzyskaniu ""maksymalnego poziomu postaci"". System skomplikowany, ale bardzo ciekawy.

Jeżeli chodzi o fabułę, to może i jest jakieś tło fabularne, jednak osobiście żadnego nie zauważyłem. Nie skupiałem się zresztą na wykonywaniu questów, bo tych i tak jest tylko garstka. Gra nie stawia nam żadnych blokad odnośnie tego czym powinniśmy się zająć, gdzie podróżować i co zabijać. Możemy więc skupić się na farmieniu golda z mobów, możemy rozwijać się pod kątem craftingu, oswajać zwierzęta i potwory, napadać innych graczy (gra nie nakłada żadnych kar za zabójstwa poza miastem, a nawet w mieście są one możliwe, więc zawsze trzeba mieć się na baczności), czy zwyczajnie eksplorować świat.
W Mortal Online można również poświęcić się budowie własnych budynków, które możemy stawiać gdziekolwiek w świecie gry. Nie wypowiem się jednak na ten temat szerzej, bo jedyne czego doświadczyłem w tym temacie to ogromne, monstrualne zamki i forty zbudowane przez jakieś potężne gildie.

Po wymienieniu tych czterech zalet wyróżniających Mortal Online (widok fpp, permanentna śmierć, rozwój postaci, sandboxowość), przejdę teraz do tych aspektów gry, które sprawiają, że jest ona niesamowicie odpychająca.

Nie będę opisywał tutaj wysokiego poziomu trudności, bo jest on zwyczajnie założeniem gry. Jeżeli ktoś rozpoczyna przygodę z tym tytułem, raczej jest tego świadom.

Zacznę od pierwszego problemu, jakim jest świat gry. Jest on brzydki i archaiczny, jednak nie odbiega wizualnie od tego, czego mogliśmy doświadczyć w 2009 roku, czyli w roku premiery (wbrew temu co sądzi Steam). I o ile przy dobrym gameplay'u można wybaczyć brzydką oprawę graficzną, przecież wszyscy znamy takie przypadki... to sprawa komplikuje się, gdy grafika jest do tego stopnia potworna, że psuje doświadczenia płynące z samej rozgrywki.

Nie zrozumcie mnie źle, Mortal Online ma swoje momenty, lokacje potrafią wyglądać ładnie...
Niestety jednak większość miejsc jest szkaradna... i pusta. Nie wiem do końca czy jestem sprawiedliwy w ocenie, bo może to nie jest kwestia oprawy graficznej, ale świat gry jest kompletnie pusty. W całej grze prawie w ogóle nie ma detali, miasta są opustoszałe, jedynie na głównym targowisku i wokół banku możemy znaleźć jakieś ciekawsze otoczenie. W budynkach, które możemy odwiedzić nie ma nic, to po prostu duże, drewniane pudła.
Poza miastami jest jeszcze gorzej. W trakcie półtora godzinnej podróży z miasta do miasta, w 6-osobowej ekipie zaczęły latać prześmiewcze komentarze w stylu ""Patrzcie! To krzak!"", ""O rany, kamień leży!"" I wszyscy zbiegali się, by oglądać kamień.
Wynika to z tego, że poza miastem otoczenie jest tak nijakie, że nawet kamień robi wrażenie.

Nie wiem jak Wy, ale ja wolę MMO, w którym oprócz dobrze zorganizowanych systemów, jakimi kieruje się gra, czeka na mnie piękny i zachwycający świat.

Drugą rzeczą, tą która oprócz pustego świata zadecydowała o porzuceniu tytułu, był nieprzejrzysty, toporny i zbugowany interfejs. Gracz nie wie gdzie i po co kliknąć, gdzie szukać jakichkolwiek informacji. Wszystko działa ociężale. Twórcy powinni zrozumieć, że toporny i trudny interfejs nie jest dobrym sposobem, by utrzymać wysoki poziom trudności.

Na koniec przywołam moją ulubioną sytuację z gry:
Odchodząc na chwilę od komputera nieodpowiedzialnie położyłem się na środku szlaku, licząc na to, że nikt nie będzie przechodził. Gdy wróciłem, byłem martwy, z informacją o nicku mordercy. Wracając z miasta nago, przyuważyłem, że mój morderca beztrosko trenuje za miastem na słomianych manekinach. Niedługo potem podszedłem w samych gaciach w towarzystwie moich dwóch, zakutych w pełną zbroję kumpli. I jeden z nich, KrojeChlebKolanem zaczepia mojego mordercę:

- ""Witaj. Słyszałem, że zabiłeś mojego kolegę. To ten tutaj, mały i nagi. Poznajesz jego nick?""
- ""Zabiłem go, niech to będzie dla nιego nauczką, że nie śpi się na środku""
- ""Chcemy Ci tylko powiedzieć, że jak wyjdziesz z miasta to jesteś martwy, będziemy czekać"". - rzucił Chleb, odwrócił się, a my poszliśmy za nim.
- ""Próbujcie!"" - krzyknął morderca, ale po po chwili zza pleców usłyszeliśmy - ""Dobra! Poczekajcie! Oddam Wam te itemy!""
No i rzeczywiście oddał :D Jak widać oѕяał ze strachu te swoje skórzane portki.

Podsumowywując - jeżeli chcecie doświadczać sytuacji podobnych do powyższej, chcecie zmierzyć się z tym trudnym światem i nie przeraża Was to, że jest on pusty... to szczerze polecam Wam Mortal Online.
Jednak jeżeli jesteście podatni na brzydotę, toporność i nieprzychylność - odbijecie się od tego tytułu jak od ściany.
Ta gra to jedna z tych, które albo się kocha, albo nienawidzi.

If you were expecting pots of gold, lepricauns and rainbows from a HARDCORE PVP game, then I'm sorry to disapoint you... this is not that type of game.

You WILL get toxic players in a game like this (I mean.. hardcore pvp, you gotta have players like this).
You WILL die a lot.
You WILL have to earn back everything you had.

But... that's the point of this game. To rage at one point, and to be happy to loot a player at the other. 
A community not so big, but for everyone to be put into ONE server, the number is more than enough. 

As for the toxic community, haven't encountered almost any during my 40 hours, I definetly will in the future though.

I’ve enjoyed it since I enjoy PvP, I think they did a terrific job at making PvP interesting and competitive in this game but outside of PvP the game is a mess. 

Just by reading the negative review around you’ll see what comes back over and over. A terrible game design, lack of content, no real power given to players in control of their land and no real revenues for holding towns and strategical locations. So it make all the territory control mostly for locking some ressources but before everything just to set up a place to regear before going for an other fight. The economy ingame is complete garbage and so is the social and political aspect. 

Unlike others that blame the community I prefer the say « don’t blame the players, blame the game ». The game and his design are the reason why this game as been a failure since it’s release. The devs must have some money away to keep it alive since release cause with the poor population they clearly don’t make the money needed to sustain the game.

I’m not even talking about lags and bugs that have been around for 10 years.

Saddest part is that it’s still my favorite MMO of all times. It just saddens me to see that they did not manage to go the right way in so many years. I believe some little changes in gameplay here and there could have made this game a great success.

It's extremely painful that I need to edit this review. Basically, don't play this game. The game has been hacked several times and people's personal information has been made public. Accounts were stolen, and screenshots of the people using the accounts were posted on their discord several times. Their response is to DO NOTHING and ban anyone making the accusations from their discord. Their chat moderator Erras is biased and likes to play god with who can or cannot speak in chat. The game is glitched and broken. Lag will cause you to die repeatedly. Basic game mechanics do not function. Hit detection is localized, so someone in Europe can hit you with a dagger from a mile away, while your long spear is out of reach when up close to them. Magic is only usable if you spend thousands of gold or real money. Whole sections of the game are completely empty. Creatures in a dungeon can walk through walls. They have an invisible Minotaur beast that can destroy a group that randomly goes invisible. The best part? The devs can be very petty. They will take control of creatures when they are angry and destroy your dungeon group out of spite if they don't like you. This sounds crazy, but it can be confirmed. 
The only way to be seriously competitive is if you pay to win by subscribing every month to unlock all your skill's potential. Even after you pay, you're info on the website is not safe and the server can be down for days with no compensation. The game has basically become Entropia Online, in that it's a money sink where you are literally buying access to a broken product that's been in beta for 10 years. As of now, they've been promising to add content for nearly three years with no progress made.  Basically, you're better off playing almost any other game.

i recommend it because i'd probably play it if my friends were willing to, but they aren't. last im touching this game, as it is practically impossible to solo.

i also highly recommend a subscription, all skills are capped at 60 until you subscribe, most of the collest things in the game (like Necromancy) require your skill for the task to be maxed out. a subscription also give you access to pickpocketing, so you too can ruin your fellow player's experience by thieving what valuables they have on them.",1542133681,1542133681,True,4,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

из плюсов:
1. свобода выбора, делай что хочу и где хочу.
2. боёвка, особенно в пвп очень напряжённая.
3. нет такой вещи как pay2win как во многих мморпг.
4. свобода развития персонажа развивай кого хочешь.
5. отыгрывай кого хочешь, мне лично пнравилас тема с предками кода ты выбираешь из какой семьи твои предки (зайдёт для тех кто любит рп).
из минусов:
1. чтобы прокочать перса апример чисто в война надо оформить подписку.
2. высокий порог вхождения некоторые игроки стоят сто часов и тупят в первом городе.
3. я лично часто по началу встречал игроков пк меня они сильно бесили но разобравшись в боёвке проблем представлять сильно не будут.
вот я и подвёл итоги: как видно плюсов больше, но советовать всем не могу: (история из жизни) приглосил друга в игру после туториала выбрал мага, здох от первого скелета (Walker) и сказал: ""Маги не рулят, значит игра не играбельна"", а я продолжил играть за война и мочил свободно мертвяков.

This game can be clunky, long standing bugs exist and the gameplay at times is rage inducing, but I always come back. For whatever flaws the game has it also has old school hard-core MMO features that you just don't find anywhere else. The game is a true sandbox. Build anywhere, be anyone. You can an open city, a mine, a stronghold, whatever. Siege other bases. Go around killing or be a roaming good samaritan. You can mix and match skills to suit whatever playstyle you like. People will cite metas and say that's the only class that's effective, but it's not true. As you become a better fighter you can diversify your character ie dropping some armor for magic. Crafting is complex and knowledge is not often shared. Many recipes for certain foods, potions or weapons/armor have to be discovered through trial and error and remain unique to the crafter who discovers it. Exploration is amazing. The world is full of secrets to find in the form of treasures, NPCs, resources and quests. After being released for 10 years the developers say there are still undiscovered mechanics or POI within the game. 

If you are into medieval combat similar to Mount and Blade and want to play in a large open sandbox with full loot PVP this is the game. You can play for free without time limit, but your skills are capped at 60 rather than 100. It is a common misconception that this is pay to win. This is a subscription based MMO with unlimited free trial. That being said many players are successful even in pvp to a certain degree as a 'freemium"" player.

I don't know why steam stops tracking sometimes, but this isn't the only game it's done it on. I have easily 800-900 hours logged so my opinion means something at least lmao. Okay, without further delay, let me make your life easier when you play the game, as you definitely should.
Step by step guide on how to play this game which covers my review:

1. Make your own goal: The number of paths you can take are immense and the game gives you an insane amount of options of how to live your virtual life. For example, my goal was to become the best swordsman in the world and build a sword school for new players. I didn't become ""The best"" but I was definitely *one* of the best swordsmen. I was more than a match for most players and could win most fights even when outgeared and outnumbered. I got a few friends from my guild together and we built my school. I taught new players how to swing a sword and said, ""My goal is complete. I have finished the game."" I had my time, and now I want so badly for others to have theirs. It's an amazing game, but you will get burnt out without a personal agenda. I hope my goal being realized gave some motivation, because anything is possible.

2. Join a guild. Once you have established your own personal goal, join a guild and find others to help you realize it, but also help them realize theirs. You cannot play this game alone. If you choose to fight alone, you will die alone. You MUST join a guild. It's the most important part of this game and you will be extremely discouraged from playing from the sheer amount of times you will be slaughtered. This game is aganzingly brutal to solo players AND new players so finding a group is the number two thing on your list to do as soon as possible. The game has no mercy for solo players and many will troll and back stab new players, so be on your guard.

This is the extent of my review. What, you thought I'd write more? Nah this isn't a guide. If you follow those two things above me, 95% of the negative reviews will no longer be relevant to you. I hope you get lost into this game as I did, and make something memorable happen. I will never forget my time playing this game and the friendships (And enemies) I made while doing it. 

As a side note, I was an avid player killer. I murdered and robbed my way to the top by stealing gear from corpses and stepping on others. Nobody was gonna stop me from making my dream a reality. This game is brutal, and players like me exist in plenty. I wonder if you can realize your goals in a different method than me... Best of luck to you, mortal. 

For those that understand: I'll always be ROT in my heart, even if this game is uninstalled and collecting dust. ;)",1538646380,1538646380,True,2,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game was amazing when I first started playing, and as I kept playing, it got better and better.

There's only one problem though: [b] If you play this game too much at once you will burn yourself out [/b]

This game is a hardcore experience, there's no doubt, but it doesn't mean you should play the game hardcore. Dying is part of the allure of this game, people that leave negative reviews usually have less than 300 hours, which is still the early parts, and if they don't know what they're doing they'll never leave that stage. My suggestion to any new player is to [b] JOIN A GUILD. [/b] Joining a guild is crucial for increasing your chances of staying, and don't go and join any of the big pvp guilds to start out with, find a nice noob friendly guild, many of them will hang around tindrem, and they'll help you get on your feet, and that'll get you started.

I'm not saying you aren't able to play solo, it's just not the way you wanna start. 

For example: After I came back, I hopped on and played with a couple of old friends, and had similar experiences to the ones that I had when i first started playing. Many players will remember their first player kill, or their first dungeon run, but I remember the first time I left tindrem. 

Tindrem isn't a noob trap like many'd lead you to believe, what it is, is a TUTORIAL area. It's a place for you to learn how to play the game. However, this game isn't linear, there's no one way to start a character, or to get gold, or to play. You don't have to start in tindrem.

So this is my new players guide:

0. Choose your race, and think about what you want to do with that character.

1. Start in tindrem, do the tutorial.

2. Choose your class: This step doesn't force you to become this, but if you're thinking about making a mage, CHOOSE THE MAGE CLASS, It gives you a magic book, which costs a gold, for free, and then binds it to your character. That mean's you wont lose it upon death.

3. Join a guild, find one in Tindrem that's recruiting, ask them for help with the guild, and if they make you pay for anything, like information, or help farming, leave them. They aren't good for you, and they don't care about you. Find people that actually care. Believe it or not, the oldies fall into 3 categories: The Trolls, The Guides, and The Indifferents.
These 3 groups will cover pretty much everyone you'll meet in this game at the start. The trolls will pick your pockets and tell you lies, because they hate new players. The guides will teach you how to play the game, give you useful information, and just be helpful in general. And the indifferents are just that, Indifferent. They won't really troll you, but they will fuck you up in pvp if you fuck with them, but they're usually bro's other than that.

4. Once you have a grasp of how to play the game, Travel away from tindrem, whether its with your guild, or if it's just to fabernum. Anywhere is better than tindrem, and there's one reason why. [b] In tindrem, all the gold making methods are known by player killers, and they will kill you and take your shit if you're new. [/b]

5. Once you get away from tindrem, learn about how to make some good money, Razorbacks are a good start if know someone who can butcher, and filling buy orders in meduli is also a solid way to get money as well.

6. This is a flex spot, but there's two ways you can go here: There's sarducca, and there's the jungle. Sarducca is a harsh ass place filled with giant insects that will rape you if you cant take them down, but thats where all the big money is if you don't have a guild that runs boss groups. In the jungle, theres a lot of ways to make good money, but its very easy to get lost if you dont have a guide, and that can spell the end of a character, because if you get lost, there's a big chance you wont get back out if theres nobody to help you, or if you dont have a guide. So sarducca is my personal favorite for new characters.

Extras: If you're gonna go to sarducca you will need heat resistant clothing, Dal Roba is the best for heat resistance IIRC, and Sarduccan Guard armor is really good for heat resistance too.

tl;dr Dont stay in tindrem too long, join a guild, dont give the game a negative review if you fail. 

Please don't give negative reviews if you don't like the game, it keeps new players from showing up, and the main complaint have is that the playerbase is nonexistent, and they aren't helping by leaving negative reviews.

Don't let recent strides in development fool you. Of a planned dozen or more landscapes and continents, only two have been developed and released. PvP combat competitiveness and ""balance"" is dictated by the whims of the ever fickle ""PvP/random player killer"" crowd, who often just ceaselessly complain on the forums until they get their way, usually resulting in the over nerfing of whatever it was that challenged or beat them.


If you find yourself having a beef with moderators or GM's, they will censor you, they will ban you, they will do everything they can to make your game time miserable.

Their corruption was immortalized when the Lead GM ""Discord"" under orders of Star Vault CEO Henrik Nystrom, aided the notorious (in game) hacker by the name of ""RUSSIAN"", due to the latter's friendship with Mr. Nystrom. Said aid was in the form of valuable materials in large numbers, gold coin in large numbers, and skill books of all kinds and rarities.


While it is true that there are very few, if any, games similar to this, and that the experience is unique, you will find yourself feeling a lot of emotions, mostly anger, contempt, and toxicity that you have likely never known before.


I strongly recommend avoiding this game. Because even after an 8-year run since it launched in 2010, they still have a corrupt GM team led by ""Discord"", and the company is still headed by Henrik Nystrom.",1529250320,1529250320,False,50,4,0.735174000263214111,6,False,False,False,False,,,

Perhaps the most hardcore game out of all of them, in Mortal Online players can attack you, or even kill you, anywhere you are. Players can steal right out of other players inventory at any given moment. The cities can be taken over by guilds and the Guards protecting the city can be removed. City Guards can be bribed with money by criminals.

Mortal Online is completely open world and sandbox. Players and Guilds can build anywhere they wish on the map. Guild keeps can be protected with Mercenary posts which launch arrows at players who come too close. Sieges can be launched against player structures and guild keeps, using Catapults, Weapons, amoungst other things to steal items and destroy opposing Guilds.

Combat in Mortal Online is unlike any other MMORPG out there, as you can literally do anything - ranging from Shooting Arrows on a Horse to Summoning the Undead to annihilate your enemies. If fighting isn't your thing, you don't have to. There are countless amounts of different activities which allow players to contribute to the world ranging from taming and breeding animals to creating the perfect set of armors and weapons.

Mortal Online has so many things that it's really difficult to put all of it in a review. If you are bored with cookie cutter Korean MMORPG's however, and looking to try something new, Mortal Online is exactly what you are looking for. The game has a few issues with poor hardware optimization, outdated graphics, and a few bugs here and there, but overall it's a game that pushes the bounds of what an MMO should be and is pretty incredible.",1527851587,1527851587,True,15,2,0.621439099311828613,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Egy hardcore játék, nyitott pvp világ, ha meghalsz az összes cuccod leesik szépen, és sétálhatsz vissza érte, már ha valaki nem lopta el mindet útközben. 

A crafting(barkácsolás) a legösszetettebb szerintem az összes létező jelenlegi játék közül. 
Példaként: Ahoz, hogy megcsinálj egy fa kardot: Értened kell a penge elkészítéséhez, a markolat elkészítéséhez, az adott fa fajtához, mint pl. Fenyő, és még értened kell azokhoz a műhelyekhez amelyeket felhasználsz hozzá. 
És képzeld el mi kell egy acél kardhoz...

A játkban bizony vannak bugok, glitchek, igen kint van már több mint 10 éve, nem az a 2015ös megjelenési dátum csak a steames. De egy idő után az emberek hozzá szoknak.

A karakter fejlődési system is nagyon bonyolult, lényegében 1200 képességpontal kezdesz, vannak fő képességek amik ebből az 1200 pontból vonnak le, és vannak olyanok amikhez nem kell. Egy képességet 100 pontig húzhatsz. 
Ebből adódóan, nem lehetsz egy mester kovács és állat szelidítő is egyben. 

A harcot leginkább a skyrimhoz hasonlítanám, de elég kezdetlegesen néz ki. 

Summa, egy olyan játék amit olyan embereknek tudnék ajánlani, akik sok időt szeretnek ölni egy játékba, hogy legyenek valakik, szeretik ha piszkosul büntet a játék. 

Else kezd ha casual vagy.

I have a mixed feeling about giving a good review, but in the end it really is a good game.

Most negative reviewers will be new players who were griefed early and felt like they couldn't progress or vets who didn't like the choices of the devs (which I don't blame them for since I disagree with them a lot as well). What it boils down to though is that the game is about freedom in an open world medieval sandbox that allows you to do and be what you want.

This game doesn't appeal to the general gaming community because it can be very unforgiving and you'll get frustrated when you almost have no power in preventing eventual loss for things you've worked hard for. If you're willing to play past that though, you'll find something really special in terms of player politics and lore that no other game can give because it's all player driven. 

tldr: Try the game it's free, but don't expect to keep what you own because you'll get griefed one way or another and lose it. If you're still interested after that, the game has a lot of unique experiences waiting for you.

I have not played a game before that has felt to me like a virtual world in the same way mortal online has.
I have like 70 hours in steam and closer to around 500 total from playing previously.

That being said, I still cannot recommend this game to anyone the way it is now, and the way it will continue to be, for these reasons:

-The Killing (Yes, RPK, talking to you)
  The killing in this game in regards to other players is extreme in this game, even for full loot sandbox. Of course you lose all of your items and you have to find a priest to resurrect you, return to your corpse, and see if your items were taken. Now, doesn't bad except that items make your character in this game and are most of the time hard fought to acquire (will talk about this later...). Furthermore, the community in this game is selfish and cruel, with very few players (and guilds) dedicated to a more peaceful, not PVP approach, to this game. This is presented in the fact that the biggest guilds in the game are PK guilds (RPK is one of those, standing for random player killing.. believe me not random, they kill everyone) and as they control most of the land you are hard fought trying to accomplish anything in this game without running into any one of these PK'ers on a daily or hourly basis. 

-The Economy
  This game is ENTIRELY player driven as far as economy goes. Crafting, building, weapons, even down to food all comes from players and all of these are necessary for players to get anywhere in the game. I like this part of the game actually, it forces players to actually utilize the crafting aspects of the game. However, where this falls short is in the fact that trading to other players is a challenge in and of itself. If you want to sell your wares you have to put them on a trade broker which each city, guild, area etc. all have their own trade broker and what you sell on the trade broker is localized. This wouldn't be bad if there were upwards of 2-3k players at any given point in the game and there was a lot of demand in say Bakti for tower shields, but this game has a hard time keeping 300+ in the game at most times ( I wonder why...). A continent wide trade broker would make this game in and of itself so that trade can flourish and people can both buy and sell a hell of a lot easier. (because I sure as hell am not traveling to tindrem to hawk wares carrying 300 gold plus of goods on my horse). 

-Combat
 Okay, this is a mixed batch for me. I love the system, all first person free targeting but I hate most aspects of actual combat (mostly PVP). The armor/weapon system needs an overhaul. The fact that players in full plate armor can outrun an unarmored person is by and large ridicolous. Furthermore, why can fully armored players have the same mobility? Why can they swing weapons as fast and turn as fast? This makes no sense to me whatsoever, regardless of how much training or strength the character itself has. If you come sprinting at me in real life, even if you are usain bolt, in full plate armor, im going to outrun your ass just saying. Also there are not enough combat skills IMO. This game appears to have a lot going for it in terms of combat but most players stick to the same thing over and voer because it is the only thing that works. A larger variety of skills and balancing out some of the already in place skills, would overturn a lot of the staleness of pvp combat in this game and open up players to different options than flanged mace and 2h weapon combat... 

-Skill System
 This part bugs me to this day, and it is something every player deals with and has coped with using various forms of opiodes and anti-depressants. There are wayyyyy too few skill points in this game, way too few. The fact that you only get 1200 primary skill points means I can learn how to craft weapons and that is it, or I can be a ground fighter/sword user and that is it, there is no room for improvement, no room for end game growth, hell most skills you grind out in the first day of playing and you are done, it is gearing from that point. The game relies way too much on actual gear and not enough on skills/attributes for the player. IMO making the attributes 6000x harder to level but making them 100x more useful would change a lot in this game, the fact I can go and set my new character to chop wood, come back an hour later and have max constitution says a lot that the stat means nothing other than some hp and using it for my skills. Skills also are useful, and necessary for a character in what you can and can't do but being limited to only 1200 points and stuck with that is detrimental. This brings me to my next and most important point

-MURDER SYSTEM/CRIME SYSTEM
 For a game that is open world open loot there are very very very few punishments for any sort of behaviour in this game, and the ones that are in place are just extreme. Get caught thieving? Death. Punch a person? Death. Whoops, healed a grey player now im grey? Death... But in other respects the system isn't harsh enough. The Murder system is just worthless. Basically you get killed by a player you can flag them as a murderer, if they get flagged 5 times they are a red player now and can't enter a city or be near guards without getting attacked. seems like a bad thing? no not really it is on a timer and usually they want to be red if they are killing people and just doing it to grief/steal whatever. IMO there should be rewards for players who don't murder and harsher punishments for those who do. Why do the upstanding citizens of mortal not get anything but ganked day in and day out? Why can't i get 10 extra primary points for every day I don't murder someone? and lose 10 if i do? up to say a maximum of 200-500 extra points? why not if i murder after not murdering for a while (talking blue players) that i lose all down to 1200 again and have to start over?? This system would deter people from murdering, let's say a soul point system where you gain or lose points in a system (skill points/attributes/an allignment etc.) that HEAVILY affects gameplay, as killing someone (IRL and in virtual worlds) should be viewed as not a light thing at all...

Well that pretty much sums up my feelings, I love this game but hate most of the community and the systems inplace to deter these people. I will keep an eye on this game for changes and see if it is worth picking up in the future. Hell, I would play everyday if they changed 1 of the things on my list, just saying..

PvP is pretty rampant if you arrive at the right times and talk to the right people. PvE can be done solo, but is highly unadvisable since this is a FULL LOOT game.

I used to love it, still do to an extent. I honestly can not recommend this game to people in the current state.

I'm going to start with the reason why I don't recommend this and then I'll finish with why I love this game and played it for so long.

There are a ""few"" key areas that this game needs to improve.
Some of these areas require changes in other areas as well.

TC & Sieging:
The TC system in general really needs a revamp along with the sieging mechanics. The idea is good, but the implementation is lacking.
The TC towers should be more substantial. They should be true outposts and not just a couple of sticks thrown together that a player can knock down in 20 minutes with a hammer. The keep should gain significant defensive bonuses based on the levels of the TC towers.

AI:
The game has AI, but they need to make greater use of it in both the PvE and PvP aspects. 
The current NPC system is extremely lacking. The Guards don't really do much. Guards in main cities should be much stronger and more controlling. Guards hired by players to defend their keeps, outposts, etc. should scale. Guards at a keep should be stronger than guards at outposts. Guards at the keep should be much more expensive to maintain.

PKers:
There is really no risk to player killing. They have a very basic murder system, but there are no real consequences. You lose a few stats if you die which can be easily reskilled by being punched for 10-15 minutes.
They should make the system harsher, the further you go into murdering the more stats AND skills you lose. EX: If you have 100+ murders and you die it should basically be a full character reset. All skills set to 0 and all stats set to 0. Now yes in the current murder count system this would be extremely harsh which leads me to my next point.

Alignment Flag:
Blue, Orange, Red, Green, Grey. This system needs to be revamped.
I think they should look at Life is Feudal: MMO's alignment system. I don't suggest adopting it entirely as it is overly harsh for a true hardcore sandbox mmo, but adapting the system to fit MO would be smart.

Guild:
The whole guild system sucks. There's no alliance tag. There's no benefit to being in the guild other than accessing TC and identifying friendly and wardecs.

Wardec:
A player should not be able to leave a wardec guild and then be instantly no longer at war with the other guild. The current system makes it far too easy for non-guilded players to participate in pvp and siege combat with no penalty.
A player should automatically go local grey to the guild that controls the territory.
A player should not be able to interact with siege equipment in another guild's territory without being in a wardec.

Tutorial / Starting Area:
SV messed up when they launched this game on steam and they really haven't made it much better.
They need to improve the starting city, area, and tutorial. The game doesn't give players enough information to get started. I realize this is a hardcore sandbox MMO, but if you want population you need to give players some time to get into the game before they get killed.

Tindrem:
This is a continuation of the tutorial / starting area. Tindrem is a shit show. The guards should be more abundant. The questing here needs to be adjusted. The ability to grief and kill noobs needs to be stopped.
As I previously stated I realize this is a hardcore sandbox MMO, but if you want population you can't have new players getting camped at the spawn.

Free To Play:
This game claims it is F2P, but realistically the F2P restrictions are far too harsh for anyone to be viable.
This system needs to be overhauled.

A lot of what I stated will be fixed simply by revamping the Alignment system.


Now onto the good.
I have 2231 hours on this game since Steam launch. The game launched on Steam August 2015. I played it for 3-4 years before launch. I had 3 accounts subbed almost the entire time.

This game has a lot of depth. There is so much to learn and so much to do. The information about this game is extremely limited. Most of the rarest secrets are so well kept that you'll never learn everything about this game. Most people become really good at specific things, but not many people know a lot about everything.

The magic system is amazing, by far one of the best and most interesting magic systems I have seen.
They are also expanding it and making it better with some of these more recent patches.

This game has so much potential, unfortunately it has been ruined by allowing a small group of ""wolves"" run the game and overpower the ""sheep"".

Wolf and sheep aren't meant in any derogatory way. The game needs people of all walks of life. You need crafters, explorers, pve'ers, etc. just as much as you need the pvpers. Unfortunately the hardcore PvP'ers that have set their sight on destroying the game and population have grown in mass and basically control the server now. It has become such a problem that many veteran guilds and players have quit the game. The game has mostly been reduced to Tindrem PvP and Griefing. 




TL;DR - It's a fun game with a lot of depth, but is mostly run by 1 group of players so you either join them or you die and are unable to enjoy the game.





UPDATE: 3/21/18
StarVault has just released a dev update two days after posting this review so I wanted to talk about it.
http://www.mortalonline.com/whats-next-development-update/

Tutorials:
It looks like a lot of what I talked about above will be addressed. Primarily when it comes to new players. Pretty excited about this, even though it doesn't necessarily apply to me I am happy to see that they are making move to cater toward new players to help them transition into this game.

Territory Control: 
A lot of the information they listed is pretty vague, but the fact that they acknowledge the issue is nice. The Alliance system, Control Towers, Territory Control in general getting any kind of revamp is a huge win. Very excited for this one. From past experience they generally follow through on the things they post even if it takes a little while.

Factions:
Did not expect this at all. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. It almost seems like they're adopting some of this from ESO? Not sure. The primary deciding factor on how well this will work is the value of the Faction Points and what you'll be able to purchase with them. I hope they will implement new skills, crafting, abilities etc. that you can only purchase with Faction Points. I do not want to see them pull random items from the game world to fill this FP shop.
By having unique items this will encourage all players to participate in the pvp and the items could then be tradable / sellable to other players for regular currency. This would give pvpers a reason to do the faction battles and it will not force those that do not want to participate into pvp that they may be uncomfortable with or unable to do.

As these patches roll out I will hop back in game and give it a try then update my recommendation.

UPDATE: 12/3/19
Alliance system: 
A good change that helped fix a lot of issues.

Factions:
A huge flop that nobody uses.

Tutorials / Haven (AKA the noob island):
Haven was a good patch. From what I understand it gives people an easier transition into the game and it does seem like some players have stuck around with it's introduction. I haven't actually gone and tested it out yet, but either way I think it was a necessary addition.

Overall following the Haven update, I think if you like hardcore sandbox games you should at least try it out.
Please keep in mind this game is nowhere near perfect, but a lot of it's issues make it what it is. It's a truly deep and rewarding game if you invest the time to learn it.

Just last night, i was walking through my guild im aligned with called SHOP, and saw a red, ran towards some blues who I had thoguht were LC killers, and then I told them where the red was and I got killed while transfeering almost 100g worth of equipment and supplies to vada from tindrem and lost thoose supplies. Yes I am pissed about loosing those supplies but it taught me a valuable lesson, which is to keep an eye on who a guild is at war with. The combat is harsh and it takes time to get used to it. Crafting is very expansive and the skill system is looked down upon by some people but it makes sense why they choose to do this, when you think about it. Think how often do you think it was in medival times that a architecht mastered how to use a sword or a bow when he was trying to learn how to build houses, the same can be said about black smiths. Honestly, you need to think long and hard about what role you wish to play in this game. There are in game glitches yes, but I personally havent had any happen to me in my experience. PVP is not easy if you dont have a good set of equipment and experience. You WANT AND NEED freinds to survive in this game other wise you cant do anything major. For example the Tindrem dungeons me and my freinds have tried to do have mainly failled because we dont have any reliable tanks, I am the only archer so I am the only one who can reliable deal with the bloated undead, and we dont have any reliable healers.

I AM HAVING A BLAST! 

Cons:
Sometimes its just plain janky, teleporting mobs etc. (yes really, that's the only con for me)

I spent last night trying to defend a town from murderers and chasing a pickpocket across mountain tops. I have not had fun like this for ages and yes, i have played all the 'big' mmo's

Are people griefers, yes
Will people con and trick you, yes
Do you tell people where you are, NO

If you value what player driven gameplay is then try it out, IT IS NOT CAREBEAR so dont expect it to be.

My favorite MMO of all time was Asherons call on the Darktide server (PVP) and this takes me very close to that.

There are also nice people out there, I have been given 3 sets of armour weapons etc. The skills system is simple in theory but easy to get wrong, love the crafting.

You do not find specific guides (there are some, the game has no map, thats a good thing) or tips becasue people dont share info if they dont know you because that give you an edge.

Beginer tip: A torch lets you see the way at night.......... but also tells everybody where the Pinata is......

Just ask anyone, they call it ""Sardookie"" for a damn reason. They need to auto kick and disconnect laggers and fix the exploiting going on in the PVP. They need harder rulesets for going red and murdering people in general needs to be far more difficult. Guild priests should not entirely prevent statloss. Guild PVP relics should be more of them to compete over. Resources like tephra, should be elsewhere. Tons of mining nodes need to be added like coal, galbinum, all the sedimentary and igneous rocks should have spawns. Ironwood should spawn more often. Where the Fuuuuuuu are the blackwood tree nodes?

First of all this game is the best, entertaining, breathtaking game I've ever player so I recommend this game for every kind of player, because this game is so deep and you can do anything you want;  
 you can be weapon crafter, armorcrafter, bow crafter, shield crafter, engineer that can construct buildings, mage, warrior, archer, extractor, tinkerer, sculpturer, tamer, and so on... You can be all of them too but to be good at anything you have to  specialize under some branch, like real life. So you have total 1100 primary skill points and there are 2 type of skills; primary and secondary.  You are not limited with secondary skills but to have secondary skill that be in effect you need to have it's parent skill. That's why you need to be wise on your skills.
Secondly, this game is full-loot hardcore pvp game. When you die or kill someone everything can be looted, which means if you walk around with cool looking heavy armors it brings you power on the other hand if you die your enemy will have this power. 
Moreover gameplay is good for pvp. You can only play on first person view which makes game as realistic combat game.
You don't have to level your characters, you can do anything you what. Only skills and their levels matter.

Maybe I'm not good at writing composition but I tried to explain how this game looks as much as I can. Just give this game a try and you will see that it worths!

И всё потому, что разрабы делали её для каких-то мифических идеальных ролеплейщиков, без учёта людской психологии.
В игре есть все возможности для ролеплея: куча навыков - социальных, крафтовых, магических, воинских, 3 расы, 10 народов и их гибриды, возможность создать кого угодно и отыгрывать его. Но ролеплея нет: ты либо упоротый ПКшер, либо 90% времени убегаешь от упоротых ПКшеров. Если тебя могут убить - тебя убьют. Если ты купил новую шмотку - тебя убьют, чтобы получить эту шмотку, даже если убийца может честно купить её себе хоть десять раз. Если на тебе нубские лохмотья - тебя тем более убьют, потому что вдруг ты клановый курьер, тайком первозящий тысячу золотых. Если ты попросил новых знакомых тебя проводить, то тебя точно убьют: либо эти самые знакомые, либо очередные охотники на клановых курьеров, потому что ну кто ещё будет ходить между городами с охраной? Навыки ты никогда не освоишь, потому что удочки продаются в одном городе, учитель рыбалки стоит в другом, и там же можно заработать денег на покупку удочки, но стоит тебе выйти с охраняемых улиц города - тебя убьют и отнимут деньги. После каждой смерти ты теряешь всё и начинаешь копить деньги и ресурсы сначала. В городах есть банки, но они бесполезны, так как класть туда имеет смысл только то, что тебе не пригодится в других городах.
Единственный шанс - вступить в гильдию, но из-за постоянного прессинга ПКшеров никому в гильдии не нужны экперименты: тебя спросят, кем ты хочешь быть и дадут готовый билд, убивающий всю романтику свободного развития на корню.
Почему так происходит? Да всё просто: никакого приложения сил, кроме ПК игра вам предложить не может. Совсем. Если ты играешь воином, то всё, что тебе остаётся ПК или гринд монстров, который даст тебе ресурсы (которые ты не сможешь использовать, потому что не крафтер) и увеличение навыков и характеристик, которые довольно быстро упрутся в кап. Никакой тактики в ПвЕ боях нет: ты либо тупо сильнее противника, либо подыхаешь, либо кайтишь. Мобы тупы и ничего, кроме как атаковать, не умеют. Если ты крафтер - ты крафтишь, причём не всё подряд, а что-то одно (броня, оружие, луки, здания, еда, зелья), потому что иначе тебе не хватит очков навыков. Если ты добытчик (шахтёр, охотник, дровосек, ботаник, рыбак) - ты без конца добываешь 1-2 ресурса, которые продаёшь крафтерам. Чуть разнообразнее игра за магов, но им нужны реагенты, на покупку которых нужны деньги, которых магам-то, как раз, брать и неоткуда. По сути, в игре просто НЕТ ПвЕ контента, а все усилия игроков сводятся к прокачке ради ПвП.
Есть какие-то данжи, с бесконечным респом мобов и без всякого ЛОРа, есть НПС, которые могут скупить у тебя добытое, продать расходники, указать дорогу, или чему-нибудь научить, но, боже упаси, не дать задание. Разработчики объяснили отсутствие квестов их нелогичность, дескать НПС будет 70 раз на дню просить разных игроков принести лекарство его больной дочери. Ну так сделайте динамически генерируемые одноразовые квесты, в таком случае. При чём отмазка тупа до ужаса: респящиеся каждую минуту мобы, требующие постоянной зачистки данжи и раскиданные по городам бесхозные закрытые сундуки с ценностями, для прокачки воров, логичны не более, но они в игре, почему-то есть, а квестов нет.
Принесённый в жертву реализму глобальный чат привёл к тому, что всё общение между игроками происходит в закрытых чатах в Дискорде, а внутреигровыми средствами коммуникации не пользуется никто вообше: в крупнейшем городе игры на доске объявлений одна запись, чат молчит, а половина разделов аукциона девственно пуста.

Лично я тут так и не увидел хардкора: отсутствие квестов - обычная лень разработчиков, а отсутствие глобального чата, в наш век мессенджеров, усложняет жизнь только одиночкам. Я увидел только сырую и недоделанную (спустя восемь лет разработки) ММО с претензией на реалистичность.

UPD:
В игре фактически нет справки, даже по клавишам управления в профессиях: Как рыбачить мне не смогли объяснить и в гильдейском чате в Дискорде, потому что НИКТО там этого не знает. Не в смысле удачных мест, наживок и тому подобного - это-то, как раз, вполне нормально, для хардкорной игрушки, а даже саму механику процесса рыбной ловли: какие клавиши нажимать, как понять, что клюёт, как подсекать рыбу, как её тянуть. Если тебе не удалось какое-то действие - тебе никто не скажет, почему: то ли тебе не хватило характеристик, то ли навыков, то ли снаряжение не то, то ли управление другой клавишей гадай сам, дорогой игрок, платящий 300 р/мес за подписку, нам, разработчикам, справку писать недосуг, у нас тут хардкор. Мы лучше напишем очередной навык, которым никто не знает, как пользоваться, или которым никто не пользуется, потому что ингридиенты для него стоят столько же, сколько собственный замок в игре, или который нафиг никому не нужен в игре без ПвЕ контента. Гайдов на сайте игры практически нет, а имеющиеся описывают какие-то совершенно неочевидные аспекты геймплея, но не объясняют даже, зачем они нужны. Например, там есть инструкция, как ловить души погибших НПС в клетку духов, но не объясняется, зачем бы кому-то понадобилось бы это делать. Нет, логически понятно, что этот навык пригодится шаманам, или некромантам, но нигде вообще ни слова не говорится о том, как за них играть. Игровая справка есть, но содержит какие-то издевательские инструкции, вроде таких: ""Навык Рыбалка используется для ловли рыбы, чтобы использовать его вам нужны удилище, леска и крючок"". Всё. И они серьёзно полагают, что, во-первых, эту информацию надо специально доносить до новичков (а я-то думал, рыбалка нужна для приручения котиков, какая досада!) и, во-вторых, что её достаточно для овладения навыком. Вот, серьёзно, удочку я собрал и, даже, (О, ужас!) закинул в воду без всяких инструкций. А как ей рыбу-то вытаскивать, ребят?
Ещё я долго пытался стрелять из лука, пока добрые люди мне не сообщили минимальные требования к силе у самого плохонького дальнобойного оружия. Нет, в принципе-то всё логично, но где банальное уведомление о причинах неудачи? Реализм? Не смешите меня: в реальности я бы понял, в чём проблема, с первой попытки - сложно не заметить, что тебе не хватает сил натянуть тетиву.
Баги и лаги: твой персонаж уже в игровом мире, но тебе ещё 20 секунд показывают экран закрузки. В игре с фулл ПвП и фулл лутом, ага. Мало того, при входе ты проваливаешься сквозь текстуры причала и когда игра отмирает твоя тушка уже лежит на дне реки хладным трупиком, без всяких ПК, круто, правда?
В виде призрака исследую, по приколу, какой-то данж. Когда мне это надоедает - активирую функцию переноса к ближайшему алтарю возрождения, ибо обратно идти долго, и... оказываюсь на чьей-то закрытой гильдейской базе. При этом, там стоит здоровенный камень, на котором на чистом английском написано, что это - блокировщик порталов. Ладно, я - одинокий мирный нуб, но что мешает таким же способом проникнуть внутрь рейд-группе конкурирующей гильдии? Пытаюсь написать ГМу в игре, но выясняется, что проблему надо уместить в 15 символов (Шта?!!). Пытаюсь написать на форум игры, в раздел багов, и выясняю, что там надо регистрироваться отдельно, потому что игровой аккаунт, используемый для доступа к остальному сайту, почему-то именно на форум и не распространяется. Ладно, регистрируюсь. ""Ваша регистрация похожа на автоматическую и была отклонена, пожалуйста, свяжитесь с администратором"".

Mortal Online had some key aspects that LOOKED promising, however, the lackluster environment, extremely repetative and sluggish combat and gathering system, and the shear lack of objects in the world, completely dig it's grave.

If they weren't bad enough on their own, the ""skill"" system has a TON of features, however, your extremely limited to what you can actually specialize in, negating over half the the world's feeling and value.   While some state this is for economy, the economy is garbage.   It is simply for ALT chars to grind (gather materials) while another ALT crafts, and your ""main"" character then uses the materials.

This kind of game play makes an accouant able to do just about everything by themselves, at a huge cost.... which is instantly noticed when you log in... the sheer lack of players.

The world is 3 to 4 times larger than it needs to be, and I don't just mean city to city, but within  the city structures themselves, everywhere is designed to have ""loads"" of players with carts, wagons, horses and such around - but none exist.   There are groups of NPCs that take up maybe 200 square meters of space, all near each other, and then a vase open air of buildings and random NPCs that don't have any conversation or reason to exist outside of ""let's have people here""

This game, quite obviously, got ""popular"" because of it's ""Full Nudity""feature - which allows you to see others... nude.  Keep in mind the only way to see YOURSELF nude, is to take off clothing (which takes 2 seconds per part to put on or take off btw) and open your paperdoll, because the game is COMPLETELY IN FIRST PERSON. 

Being in first person is fine, but the way the camera shakes, bobs, and aim is terrible (possibly due to low skill values, but I can't be bothered to put hundreds of hours into gathering materials to make arrows to train archery so my shots are more accurate in a game I am not willing to play more)  - - the camera can make you nauseus at best, and furious at times as shots that ""should have hit"" missed completely.

Now let's take it to the darkest side.  The starter zone is open territory for ANYONE to just come up and kill another player.  yes, the murdered can report as such, and with 5 - yes FIVE counts of murder, they get flagged as a ""murderer"" in game, and have penalties... however... 5 is a lot for such a game, especially since you can naturally remove these counts and keep track of them with a simple command, so you can literally kill new players, take any gear they have that you want (meat, leather, and starter money is most common) then grind off the murder count and repeat.

This is a HORRIBLE system for new players to try to adapt to, as instantly they lose all of their belongings, and, have a death penalty in play lowering their max HP/Mana/Stamina etc to boot (which stacks and gets worse with each death)

Movement is horrid, slow, and jaggy, combine with massive over-sized terrain and you have a nightmare to walk anywhere.  Swimming is worse, as you can literally drown with low skill level, quite easily. (and the noises it makes when swimming are sub-par)

This game has a lot of promise and features - sadly NONE of them are implimented in ways that make it desirable. The UI and controls are a joke, the Inventory is a nightmare of slots and weight managment, the skills are all ""repeat use to get better"" with some of the more desired ones (like cooking, so you can restore stats) taking much too much effort for basic foods.


Your better off with just about any other MMO out there... this one is now filed under ""mom's basement of trash mmos"" and I wouldn't even call it an ""MMORPG"" anymore because I found 4 bots, was killed by 1 player, and saw LITERALLY no other players around me the entire time playing.",1518221653,1518221653,False,15,1,0.591537833213806152,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I can no longer in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. What you see there was posted on the forums recently, and it highlights the developers disregard to change anything. That's not a player, it's a ""Death Knight"" pet that can 1-2 shot you.

The game has amazing potential, but there are so many broken systems and that's just one of them. There are also 100+ instant hp pots and 300 hp over time pots that less than 1% of people have access to or will ever have access to.

It's not a game of skill, it's an arms race that was already over many years ago and now with no one left to use the weapons on, they only serve to drive away what little remain or decide to try the game.

Again, the game has a great concept, it feels to me a lot like a medieval EVE Online with the territory control and alliances and such. With the new update stated for release to address many of the issues I previously had, we are making progress. 

I love the hardcore mechanics, the loot dropping, the territory capture, the city building, hiring your own guards, and so much more.

Server performance has improved some, but still needs work especially if a wave of new players came in, many would leave as the servers would not handle the additional traffic. 

I will continue to give the game a try and encourage others to join as well. However the combat mechanics should be addressed as well. The sword fighting is boring as can be, I am not even sure how to go about that currently, but the mechanics are very clunky. Feels like you hit, they hit, you hit they hit. A Glitch exists that allows NPC walkers to attack from many meters away when they should not be able to etc, but small things like this should be addressed. The main issues I have are the new player experience which we will see how they address this with the 'New Player Island'

Also, PLEASE adjust the obsession with leveling skills. This takes even EVE Online to a new level. You should not need to increase resting, running, and about 30 other tedious tasks that sure, seem realistic but in the end take away from the fact that in the end this is a game and we want to feel like we have accomplished something, not just jumping in place to level a skill.

Why you might ask? Well I'm going to tell you a story....

So I've been playing for about a week and when i started i didn't think much of it I just wanted to try a different type of game, and I'm really glad I chose this. So when i first started me and a friend began at Tendrem one of THE MOST populated towns. This game goes so in depth, this town has a common district, the slums, and the rich district, which 50% percent of all players never go to the slums or rich district because they don't even know its there! They just stay in the common district because that's where you start off. 

So anyway back to the point, me and my friend learned that this started town is full of murderers thieves and well if there is alot of people in one area it starts to attract red players (known murderers). So after we learned this we tried to leave. when we left the safety of the city gates we checked the mountain side to make sure no reds were waiting up there. But to our dismay we didn't see the red named Archor and he killed us... 4-5 times because he could! while yes a portion of this game is pvp we didn't have the gear to take him on so we had to wait for him to leave so we can try getting our bodies back. After he finally left we got to our bodies (takes 30 min before a body to disappear). Then after that problem we finally hit the small little town called Maguli. everything was fine we got a guild invite, they showed us how to play properly, they gave us starter money, donkeys to ride, all just because we had the balls to leave tendrem.

So later in the week we are playing we finally decide to move to the guild keep in a different continent (yes its a whole other island, desert island, that you get to cross a bridge to get to, and its a player build bridge). so while we run there we see some really cool stuff, like a giant npc city called Beth Jedda, really cool new monsters to fight even the ratzar queen (this thing is like a giant spider that is 2 stories tall and at least 20-30 feet wide) which we never faught they just showed us this thing because they were gonna farm it soon once they get enough players to help. So we finally get to this city and this city is impressive its quite large with three section, the fort the resurrection area and the crafting/trade area. so after this we start breeding horses i would tame them and if they are rid-able/breed-able i would look at the stats and if it has high stregnth and dexterity i would give it to my friend and I would keep it if it has High speed and Dexterity. So after a little while i realize i have to go all the way back and buy more spell components (kind of like full metal alchemist you give some you get results) so i get my fastest horse and my friend grabs his strongest horse and we run all the way back to meduli which is like a 20 min ride since we know how to get there.as i got more materials and we were getting ready to leave a 2 reds came by and ended up killing my horse... yea i was mad... but then they left so while my friend stayed back i left to get another horse by the time i got back i forgot to feed the horse and i lost it due to low loyalty then the reds came back but this time instead of just me and my friend there were 5 fully geared blue players, 2 were from the guild hero 2 was from warden, and 1 wasn't in a guild he was just running around healing all the blues. so we were sitting there watching this huge war go on with the reds and the blues. after 15 minutes one of the reds died and the other ran away. I was happy because i actually held my own against the reds (i'm also a spell caster so it was difficult)

im not saying this is a good game but its definitely a in depth interesting game. there is something for everyone whether you want to be a red player, a pickpocket, a known hero, artisan, tamer, fighter, archer, or even magic user. Within the 172 hours I've played I've gotten 3 people to join this game and we all agree that this is a unique game and is very interesting.",1517067613,1517067613,True,18,1,0.683734357357025146,0,False,False,False,False,,,

and by that I mean everything in this game is a time investment which is a little annoying, but the concept, combat, adventures and community is what really makes this game great. I'll explain what's so great about each

Concept -
   What I absolutely adore about this game is the idea that 90% of the game is determined by player choices, the economy is player driven, the guilds are player driven. Being in a 200 vs 200 player raid or running away from 40 people is one of the most intense feelings I think that i've ever gotten from gaming.
Combat-
   Be me
   practicing with friend who is new at the game
   thinks its a good idea to fight with tourches on my stated free to play character
   fighting, everything is going good'
   gets a parry
   [i]tourch does 80 damage[i]
   decapitates friend
   
   but for real though the game highly rewards thouse who are good at timing and fighting monsters stratigically to have heals going around and changing the agro is very stimulating and requires real teamwork in order to be very effective.

Adventures-
   I've been on numerous hour long adventures with one of my friends and they usually end up in us finding something really crazy, getting killed by something very crazy, finding people who are really crazy, drowning in a lake due to accidental macro activation in steel armour, falling of mountains, killing each other, killing each others hourses so we have to walk.

      There's alot of different people on this game, you have the bullies  rpk*cough cough* and then you have everyone else, but even though i've lost numerous precious gold coins in risar heads, axes, and steel... I still love them, because it makes the game chaotic, if the game was friendly then you wouldn't have to worry about if theres someone waiting at the entrace of risars when you leave.

The system for everything is extremely hard to pick up, it takes a lot of time and effort to stop making grotesque foods even when following guides on food prep. Spent a lot of time grinding the graveyard and thankfully didn't have my coins stolen randomly by players.

Would recommend the devs rework the entirety of the pickpocket system or scrap it altogether, it's not a fun system.

The method of crafting could be improved with a handful of beginner recipes to help get players used to how the system works and then leave the rest open, I spent a lot of time and resources that amounted to nothing.

As for the pvp, it can be fun, and going into areas where there are no guards with a lot of people around leaves you on edge, especially in the deeper portion of the graveyard, I was helped by other people who went in and the monsters i found were pretty fun to fight even when underleveled.

The access to creating a house or guild seems to be pay to play only, it was a real shame because my group of friends really wanted to have the ability to use that stuff, instead we just stuck together and never did things alone.

maybe 20 hours into it my brother and his friend ended up falling into the sewers where a guy was stuck unable to leave cause the guards would kill him on sight, both of them fought and ended up killing the guy for his high level gear not too long before we quit.

All in all i'd say 5/10, there's potential but it's all poorly implemented or locked behind a pay wall that seems a bit too high for my taste",1516216114,1516216114,False,2,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

У меня сложилась такая ситуация:
[code]
Прошёл я значит туториал, пошёл убивать монстров на кладбище, заработал деньги, купил мечь лучше, дорогую броню для своего статуса, пошёл снова убивать зомби, всё хорошо, качаюсь... Как вдруг, собрат по убийству НПС нападает на меня, убивает, а потом шкериться в кустах чтоб сбросить статус убийцы. 

Тогда я потерял почти всё, та как в игре фулл лут(как потом оказалось, не на особые предметы), благо в банке деньги храню.

Прихожу через время снова, всё чисто, его нет,  резкий удар в спину от другого игрока.

Тогда я потерял практичиски всё.

Ладно, бывает, я уже очухался, купил новый сет брони, подешевле. Нашёл нового друга, он помог мне зачистить городские катакомбы на выходе из которых нас убивает наш с вами первый знакомый. 

Тогда я потерял всё.[/code]

It supports alot of different play styles.

I found this game looking for crafting MMOs. This game didn't disapoint.. at least for me. Crafting can seem pretty in depth at first. Although it's pretty simple once you have some exposure, there are a ton of different ways to make a sword by its blade, core and hilt.. let alone clubs,spears,polearms,axes,bows,daggers,the 15+ different types of armor. All different weights, lengths, and mixtures of the hundreds of available materials.

This game has alot of PVE to it. It also has leaderboards that aren't hard to get onto, despite the game being out for as long as it has. Personally, I built a fortress in the middle of nowhere and I have gone the last 6 weeks without being griefed. It's great because my carebear playstyle is supported. It's a friendly environment to transport materials to trade with local guilds. If you read this, download the game, and are sick of being griefed and killed you can always PM me. I'll welcome you into my pallisade and show you how to make some gold.

Lastly, the pvp in this game is great. There is ""a way"" to pvp. As long as you understand what others focus on in combat, there is so much room to shine with actual skill. The community is decent sized, but its still small enough to where if you are a great pvper, people will know. I do hear alot of complaints about lack of pvp availability. This is not my experience but I thought i'd voice it so that you know what to expect.

P.S. This may be biased, but it is based of my personal experience. I have never had any trouble with the devs that made me feel they were biased. Which is something I see alot of people contradicting. I do believe there were two issues over the years that could have been handled differently, but the outcome turned out just fine. The best advice I can give regarding this is being polite to the devs and trying to work with them goes along way.

Everyone quit playing so the people who invested time in order to pvp, have no one to kill but newbies who log into the game. No new players are sticking with the game. Just look at steam charts. Negative 10% growth per month. Game will be dead in 6-8 months.

My first goal was to buy a mount so I could carry more loot to sell. I spent a few days training skills for domestication and creature control. Then spent several days getting gold together so I could buy a mount from the broker. Finally had all the pieces and ready to get mount. 

First I get my gold and go to broker. In the 40 secs I am looking for the mount I want to purchase. Someone comes over and picpockets me taking all my gold. The perpentrator got caught but he didn't get flagged for pvp. Guards didn't attack, and if I attacked him, the guards would kill me..... BROKEN SYSTEM

So now i go grind some more gold in the graveyard. I get murdered several times by veteran players who take my newbie gear and trash it. I report them for their murders and nothing happens. No consequences. In a few minutes they are running by the guards waving at them laughing at me. Guards just wave back like they hadn't just murdered someone several minutes ago. WTF..

Finally I get enough gold to buy a mount and train it. I wait until no one is in the auction house. Run in and buy my pet receipt. I go to stable and take out my donkey. I have the mount for 10 secs, and some jackass kills it for fun sitting in the middle of the city. Guards kill him, and he loses a little newbie weapon. While I lost the mount I had been trying to get for many days. WTF?

I played EVE, Darkfall, Albion, and a bunch of other full loot hardcore pvp games. This game is utter garbage. The rules actively encourage veteran players to kill newbies since there is NOTHING else to do in the game. It is the only way they retain their current toxic playerbase of 10 year olds.

Stay away. I strongley suggest you watch out for the release Crowfall. I am testing in alpha right now, and it seems like it could be pretty good. Crafting system is going to be the best I have ever seen. I don't suggest you run and join the alpha.. wait for the release.

I will give some examples from my 'gameplay' experience that have ruined it. The first time I played it was alone,I fell into water in the tutorial area and couldn't get out and res myself due to glitched terrain. Uninstalled. Second time was with a friend,and imagine this in an mmo: there is no party system and there is no map. Only reason we found each other was because it was the same tutorial town,but I'll add to that later. Then we actually had some fun smacking mobs around with the crappy combat and running around,until we left the town and ran to  a graveyard. There we got killed by a spider but luckily made it in time to get our loot back. Afterwards,we started walking towards an interesting looking area,near a lake,at which moment I made ONE step into the water and got pulled into the whirlpool of death (aka glitched and was forced to swim,run out of stamina and die at the bottom of the lake.) My friend died too due to the lack of stamina. Couldn't reclaim loot because it was lost to the depths. Uninstalled. Few months later...We tried again. To add to the aforementioned map-lacking system,this time we tried spawning at a guild town,and ended up in two different places. I get that its not realistic to open your map and see a dot on it symbolizing your friend's current position,but is not realistic to have a map? There is a fan-made one that helped us find each other,and then we ran,and ran some more,had some fun in a dungeon and quickly ran due to 6 skeletons rising from the ground. After that we realized the one thing good about this game: the comedic value. Two hobos with piss-poor swords walking and running like there is a cucumber up their asshole murdering pigs was funny (it was me and him in beginner robes). Afterwards we traveled for a while,through an oddly dead but kinda charming world,just looking for content,and we decided to craft,and the crafting is alright. A really cool thing was just how many skills there are,its quite impressive. Breathing,walking,running,tasting,every subsection of a major stat possible (example: agility isn't agility here,its everything movement related). The NPCs are retarded and ugly as shit,but so are all of the models basically. We did the graveyard stuff again,got bored and uninstalled. I gave this game a shot 3 times,and each time my soul got crushed a bit more. The only good things about the game aren't actually good enough to replace/compensate for all the bad ones. Give it a shot,maybe you'll enjoy it,but I think that there is little to no fun to be had here.

Yup, it's buggy, most are - especially survival games. Yet this game gets mad amounts of hate for it.

All that's outta the way. This game has the most in depth crafting i've ever seen, the different gear you can make and materials you can use is crazy with different appearances for every single piece that you change. You can build a castle, keep, town, fort, or just a simple house almost anywhere in the world. There are siege weapons and many different mounts to ride. Beyond mounts just about every creature in the game can be a pet. Beyond that you can summon demons and various undead with necromancy.

Become a fighter, trader, escort, mercenary, screaming peasant, whatever it is you want to be. The skill system works similarly to The Elder Scrolls in that you learn by doing. Some skills are learned from a book which your character will passively read while playing or offline. Literally any combination you can think of is possible.

Loads of dungeons and hidden areas, many hand crafted npc cities and minor camps. Tons of monsters both real and fantasy and everything has something to drop. 2 whole continents to fight over, bigger than any maps available in other survival games.

Over all it's hard to describe what all you can do with this game, since there are so many options and not everything is common knowledge, you may stumble upon a precious secret not many know of and that just doesn't happen in datamined games with overflowing wikis of information.",1510179877,1513825503,True,11,0,0.531288802623748779,0,False,False,False,False,,,

To me, this is one of the greatest, deepest, most enjoyable, exciting, unique, adventurous and thrilling game I have ever played.  Seriously, the rushes and adventures that come out of a good MO day are like no other.  That being said, to enjoy the game I suggest these things:

1:  Commit at least 20 hours to really getting your toes wet with it.  
         I remember almost quiting a few times in the first hours of play because I was so overwhelmed by the complexities and was also not at first impressed by the combat.  However, given a bit more time to become fully immersed and to start to realize the mechanics behind the once daunting leveling systems, things really started to take a unique and exciting light.  After having my first major tragedy and first real success, I started to see just how far the rabbit hole goes.

2:  Bring your Creativity and Imagination into this one.
         Seriously, go back into ""pretend"" time when you play this.  Just use your mind!  You are given pretty much zero direction or instruction in anything, however when you think creatively, you'll find that the mechanics and answers to every question are all thoughtful, logical, and makes sound sense.  This is the part I am having the hardest time describing.... everything is intelligently, deeply, and richly designed is such a way that your imagination really becomes the limit.  So many times I've read the cliché ""Open Sandbox!  Do what you want!"" am regularly let down by the ""freedoms"" in those games, but MO has really impressed me with it's opportunities for freedom of player expression.

Leveling is something akin to Oblivion, where you can level skills even like Jumping, and do so simply by doing it.  To improve your Axe skill, just use an Axe.  Everything breaks down into ridiculous subcategories in a good way, expecially the knowledge trees, like ""Zoology"" breaking down into all of the proper subspecies and geni categories of the actual science.

You can fill all Secondary Skills all the way up, but only have 1100 Primary Skill Points to spend.  This is the same for P2P and F2P players, the difference being that a P2P player can assign up to  100 points on a single Primary Skill, while F2P players max out at 60 points per Primary.  You can shift these stats around even after all spent with an interesting +, -, Lock system of allocating the points.  There are just SO many Primary Skills, to be truly great at something, you will need to specialize.  I realized this most as I went into Taming, which is far more than just ""Taming"" = 100.
You'll want knowledge of the species to increase your ability, Taming, (Advanced) Creature Control, Domestication, Beast Mastery, etc etc.  To craft, you'll need far more than ""Armoring."" 
 You'll need an understanding of the ores and minerals you are infusing into your armors and weapons, how to use the Forge, the Kiln, the Armor Crafting Station, and all other stations you'll want to use, like Bow/Shield/Weapon.  

Some skills cannot be learned by engaging in it alone, but must be learned by reading a book on the subject.  Getting your first dabble into the magic schools is done in this way.  Even your Book Reading skill goes up as you read and even that has subcategories like ""Skim Reading!""  Books are read in a way similar to how Elder Scrolls Online did their crafting trait learning.  Some books can take a real week or more to get through if you're not a good reader or if the subject is something dense.  Even your Running skill is broken down into things like Running Technique, Breathing Technique, and Sprinting, and Swimming has subskilled like Diving, Crawl Stroke, and more.

Full Open World PvP creates for unique rushes, stresses, planning and cooperation with others. There is also Full Open World Building Construction, both personal and for Guilds.  The Guilds actually control territory across the realm, can build entire cities, and populate those cities with NPCs.  Fully functioning cities have been built by players that are more active and thriving than the built in cities of the game.

At first I thought Combat was super sluggish, clunky, outdated, and lame. Given some time and experience though and finally getting a grasp on the Parry System, it is really addictive, rewarding, and fullfilling.  There is a ton of skill in the combat.  Attack and blocking can be done from 4 sides, depending on which way you first move your mouse as you are attacking/blocking.  All attacks can be charged for extra damage and a properly timed block will be a ""Parry"" which allows for a quick and powerful counterattack.

Early on I was terrified, and rightly so.  Even the lowliest of creatures and dangers about, feeling every bit of the fragility of my own Mortality.  I love how as your skill as a player increases, and not just your stats, you  really start to feel a sense of pride, power, and accomplishment as you look upon the things which once caused you such fear and woe.

The world is quite large and fully open and explorable.  At first impression, it was TOO big and overwhelming.  It seemed unmanageable, untraversable, and even though it was all ""open"" to be explored, it felt inaccessible.  Now, having done a good bit of traveling across the realm I think that the size is just right.   Your first terrifying hike on foot to a new city could take hours lost and wandering helplessly, searching for any sign of the vague landmarks given to you by strangers in the previous town.  Later, you'll find yourself well mounted and soaring across the plains, confident in your direction and ability to reach your destination by dawn's first light.

The world is full of dungeons, adventures, riches, and plunder for the bold to possess, but serious danger lurks too in every shadow.  There is zero forgiveness and one mistake or a surprise encounter with a squad of maurading PKers could lead to the loss of every last one of your precious possession.

I'll never forget my gf's and my first real rush.  We had just planned and successfully executed our first venture from our start town MorinKhur to the primary start town of Tindrem, which was awesome in and of itself.  Upon arriving, we were quickly met with a request from a passing player and hired on as mercenaries to gather some precious horns, which could only be found from Minotaurs in the highlands a days journey by foot.  I'll never forget the three of us venturing far into the wilderness, delving into the heart of the mountain, and battling those bullmen in the dark depths of the earth.  We successfully returned with the loot after a narrow escape from several members of a Guild of killers (PYRE) and banked more gold than we had otherwise made in the last 3 weeks of play lol.  It was so epic.... but that's what this game offers.  There is no quest giver who says ""get me some horn from the minotaur.""  It forces you to create your own objectives, form your own parties, make your own goal, and choose who you are in the world.

Crafting is INSANE.  The resources are numerous and an understanding of them (Skill Points spent in the Knowledge of the material) is necessary for their well use in creation.  Weapons alone have the handles, hilts, blades, etc all of which can be uniquely forged and crafted with a variety of materials, each with their own merit.

If you do not like these things you are going to have a hard time enjoying it. I left at the time because the game was being driven in a direction of making it a medieval quake arena instead of a sandbox but I have returned recently (August 2017) to check the game out and a lot of improvements have been made that are making me fall in love with Mortal Online again

Now obviously the game is not perfect but here are some bullet points for you to digest:

- Freedom to make your build, you can make it a straight fighter, refiner, crafter or whatever but the system shines when you can find a mixed build that works 
- Full loot PvP - if you hate full loot games there is not much of a point of going with MO. This said there are areas of the game where these things don't happen as often (example, the continent of Sarducaa is usually more peaceful than Myrland) 
- The game is not F2P. Consider it instead an unlimited trial which is great for anyone wanting to try out the game but if you want to be competitive you will have subscribe at some stage.
- Free placement of structures allowing you to build your own town (guild recommended if you don't want to be driven insane) 
- Dungeons. Simply the best dungeons you will ever experience in any game - mostly because they feel like real dungeons. The echo sounds in the caves, the lighting conditions (or the pitch dark if you don't bring a torch) the real sense of discovery. The game is worth it for this alone. 
- There are bugs. It is a small team and the bugs can sometimes be annoying, especially in a full loot game but the devs seem to be actively working in the game so hopefully this will be less of an issue. 

So in conclusion, I fully recommend the game if you are tolerant to:
1 - PvP
2 - Full loot
3 - Some bugs

Reason 2 I also encountered freezing from taking my weapon out plus a couple other things which could get me killed so there's also that, Just to clarify I did not crash so it has that going for it and onto my final reason.

After going to the priest I find out that the priest won't even help me because I picked up a worm... so after a few minutes I can finally respawn so I go back to grab my stuff and before I get to the graveyard a random naked player with a spear appears out of nowhere and stabs me and kills me immediately and the guards don't care even though I'm marked as innocent.

After 2.7k hours i have to state, that this game is one of a kind. 

But it goes without it flaws, sadly the community over time has slowly passed on. But the remaining hardcore/fanboys are still around and keeping the game very much alive.

Currently there's a semi-large war between a few minor parties that is kicking the population, but for how long will it last and how long will it take to silently quiet down? Who knows.

Pro's:

Great combat, u legit cannot find a better type & kind of a combat system like Mortal Online around in any other MMO.

Economy, the game's economy is solely player driven, which can at hard times make it very difficult to get your resources/items for a ""Fair price"" 

Dungeons, While there is a few dungeons in the game, some remain un-discovered (this was proven by one of the devs on the official forums roughly 1 year ago from this updated review) 

Other dungeons can pose a challenge if u are brand new and have no idea of the AI Monster mechanics and the boss mechanics. Understand there is no actual ""Boss"" in these dungeons, but rather stronger creatures that the community considers a ""Boss""

Player skills, the game gives a player loads of options when it comes to being a trader, hunter or just a player looking for a fight. There's well over 20 combat skills and another additional 10 - 30 secondary skills (which is skills under the main skill, confusing at first i know)

When you first start, you will start out like a complete utter ""noob"" or as they call it ""Fledgeling"" which basicly means u have bare minimum knowledge of running & walking! 

Over time u increase your skills and become faster & stronger just like a average MMO, but the skill grinding is not as tedious as other mmo's out on the market.  


Cons:

While the game is great, with overall flow of player crafting & trading the game struggles to keep a healthy and strong community to maintain the overall Player driven economy. 

Unlike EvE Online, where they hired an actual expert team within economy to monitor the player driven economy to insure there would never be a market crash or crisis.

Player skills: While the game has great addition to the wide variety of skills, it forces you to subscribe to enjoy the full game, by full game i'm talking about having skills to 100/100 as f2p (Free to play) u are limited to 60/100 and thus must be very selective on what you actually want to do. 

Community: The community is very much a serius, and hardcore driven. Yet this tend to scare away new players, that have never in their lifetime tried a game like this, or even the game itself. The community is also at times extremely agressive and takes ""Honor"" (in most cases) very seriusly, and will use that as a reason to target a person/clan/alliance.

Despite the community being overly aggressive on new players coming into the game, the developers won't do anything about it, unless there's obvious evidence about personal attacks or threats towards the real life person behind the character. Besides all that, the developers very much lets its community run its course. That alone is a scary thought for a game that possible could be considered a MVP of MMO Genre of its kind.


Overall: 

The community is strong, and hardcore and does anything it can to keep this game alive. 

Yet there's still remnants of the old, and overly extremist and aggressive part that still to this day haunts the game. 

The game's developers Starvault or knows as SV, recently (4 - 5 months ago prior to this updated review) announced Mortal Online 2, and now most of the community is holding it's/his/her's breath in expectations to see how that will end up. And one of the main developers have stated, this is once in a life-time moment for him and his team to turn the game they have envisioned into THE Mortal Online.

Great game, you get a free for ever Trial for a restriction of 60/100 on skill point with all the skills in the game. 

I mean f2p for ever!? Ain't that freaking awsome?! 

Got well over 2k hours, and i have to say, there's always something going on in this game, are you a casual who don't got time to dedicated to much time? No problem, we got clans/guilds just for you! 

Are you a hardcore pvper and looking for guilds/clans always in conflict and always against someone? No problem! We got that as well!

The game is the most sandbox I could ever have hoped for - the grind is none existant and knowledge is power - something that no other current MMO can achieve as well as MO does in my opinion.

The best thing about MO in my opinion is the community - we have just the one server and the same names and faces will come to attention time and time again. Although the community may come across as quite Fearce and rude, it is actually a culmination of passion for, what is essentially, a form of intricate political roleplay. Do not confuse hostile conversation with a toxic community, but instead, join a guild early in your play, get involved with the politics and enjoy the unrivalled immersion that no MMO to date can give you other than MO

Sadly though, the game is completely ruined by the player base. This game has taken prey on the new folks to a whole new level, as you have longtime vets going to low level areas to hunt new players and literally take everything from them. The sad part is, most never get to enjoy time away from cities, by the time they get a bit of gear to leave, they are murdered relentlessly back down to nothing. But, if they do make it past the gate, they are again murdered relentlessly by roving groups. The pvp is fun, even knowing the risk of losing everything. But to be constantly killed, with no real chance at getting ahead since you lose everything, add in that the player base is small, but constantly teeming with trolls and lowbie hunters and the picture is clear, this game is dead. The community is terrible, though you will admittedly find a few good people along the way. But when its such a player run game (the economy, the cities, the wilds, player created towns, ect), the viability of the game is dependant on the players, and the community of players as a whole is worse on Mortal Online than in any other game i have ever played.

i did have a little fun playing this game, but definitely not anywhere near the $93.65 they have charged me, which doesn't include the ""international Purchase Fee"" i was also charged every month.

to anyone thinking about playing this game, i would suggest staying far away from it. because even if you chose to play as a free member they will still have access to your steam account info, and might be able to figure out a way to steel from you, like they did to me.

over the next week i will be filing reports with my local police department, the MasterCard company, the branch of the US government that issued the card, and contacting Steam support to try to get this game removed so that my fellow gamers will not be tricked into having their money stolen by this company.

If you become a good combatant you could even take on paying players with those skill caps. They do have an advantage.

Now on to my own review.

1. Easy to make gold, easy to lose gold.
2. You don't farm to PVP - you farm and can use the gold towards being PVP. No one has a gun to your head. (Or sword)
3. One of the best First Person swingers out there. I've played Roma-Victor, Mount&Blade, Chivalry, Xyson. Nothing compares to the adrenaline I get in PVP. I once broke into a guilds small fortress sneaking behind one of their guild members and getting in before the gate closed. I sat in there until every one else left. Killed the guy - then killed their NPCs and looted what I could. (They hunted me down for no reason, it was my revenge.)
4. Crafting is so lucrative and in-depth I can't even wrap my fking head around it. Even after hours of research. I said fk it.
5. The world is so massive, there's just no way you can safely explore all of it. Unless you rode with 20 others.
6. You make friends, and you make enemies. I mean true friends and true enemies. I see you we rolling together. I see you, you fking dying. Betrayal is all too real.


Now even though I give this a thumbs up. I have to shed light on the things I wish didn't go on.
1. Veterans preying on all the new players that arrive in Tindrem and all other places. (Really? You have a lot better opportunities than preying on some one holding maybe 5 gold.)
2. I wish they would increase Fledgling status to last a lot longer as it takes a lot longer to learn and enjoy this game.
3. Toxic Community - I mean I would rather rip my dk off than talk to most of the players. Even though I was once part of a small guild that was filled with awesome players. (God we had lots of fun.)
4. The Devs lying about things. (Why can't you just tell the truth about what you're going to fix, or what happened. We grown.)
5. The bugs/exploits that are still there and it just seems like the Devs are either too busy on other stuff like expanding the world (Which is ridiculous, there's not even enough players that play this game to expand on.) or releasing new content to even try and fix these things. I repeat, it seems.

All in all I really enjoy the time I spend in the game. I'm drunk a lot of times I play it. I wouldn't say it was a waste of money for me. I've thrown away money on worse things and terrible games. I still play it from time to time. Always drawing me back.",1502616489,1502616489,True,16,0,0.607342362403869629,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The graphics. I have a very good computer, GTX960m, 16gigs of ram, 6th gen i7 CPU, yet, at the lowest setting, the framerate is just shit. This is is making the game unplayable because combat requires accurate aiming. And this is a game with the graphics of 10 years ago. just wtf.

Lack of content and story. I get it, it's sandbox. Minecraft don't have a story. But this ain't minecraft. There are huge cities that's pretty much empty. Buildings that are just fillers, serves no function, nobody lives in it. It's just creepy.

Lack of responsibility. Naked thieves that will pick your pocket, and if you manage to catch them, they lose ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. There are no consequence of death except dropping everything on you, which is nothing for these people. In real life, there are fines, jails, and everything. No shit in this game.

GUI. the details. Using the GUI of this game is just torture -- too much drag and drop, point and click, when it could have been a right click, a key press. It seems the people designed the GUI knows nothing about GUI designing. Not to mention the ""mouse mode"" idea, which is just ridiculus.

Just go play something else. This is not worth your time.


====== Review when i first played below

I really want to love this game. It have everything I wanted, but just poorly balanced, and the whole system in disrepair. 

Here's some examples why I'm giving a thumb down:
-- Sprinting feels roughly the same speed as not sprinting at low skill -- Makes no sense an adult can't sprint.
-- UI size does not scale with screen resolution -- Can't read anything at 1920x1080 because of it, not to mention the font just make the whole.
-- Buying stuff from NPC is awkward, need to ""sell"" your currency in exchange of items you're buying.
-- You can ""train"" mining or wood cutting through action (actually mining), but not without first learning that skill -- Why can't I just pick up a pickaxe and hit the rocks? Don't make sense. The idea of talking to npc to get skill makes sense, but it would fit better to increase the skill and make it more viable at low levels
-- Graveyard, an area meant for beginner to practice combat, is just not viable if you did not choose the combat skill set. How else are we supposed to practice combat?
-- Logging out require you to wait -- I understand if you quit before like 20 seconds its not safe, still, should be an option for people who don't care to not wait that long.

tl;dr the play at a beginner level seems not very interesting, I can't run at all, and the GUI is illegiable.",1502418053,1502775012,False,10,0,0.560804426670074463,7,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a game where you learn new tricks and counters to other people each time you log in. It is a game where taking your horse (okay... maybe you ride a donkey, we've all been there) out to get some boar meat and rare spices to cook a filling meal is an epic quest. You're looking for murderers that are out there hunting people for easy loot, you're looking for dire wolves, undead minions, maybe a mercenary mage that might cross your path and eat, claw, or sacrifice you. You're making sure some group of bandits aren't sneaking through the trees with bows drawn as you close on the boar. It is intense, and the reason it is intense is because the game is harsh. You're not going to die, say, ""Well I should get another level and try that again"". Instead you're going to rage, remember the name of the guy that killed you, and sit at work/school tomorrow just plotting your revenge. You're also going to run in to other hunters out there, you're going to form a tense partnership and hope they don't backstab you while you both watch each other's backs on the hunt. You're going to develop alliances and guilds with those guys that have earned your trust.

This game is not for everyone. Just as everyone that has a computer is not a gamer. This game is for gamers. People who accept not planning ahead means death, and death is harsh on this game, as gamers prefer. The community is great. I have seen reviews of people raging about how toxic it is, but they claim being killed is toxic... No being killed is because you weren't a real gamer and didn't learn the lands you were walking in to. Ask for help, and everything is explained, in fact it might be over explained since there is so much to this game and it requires so much to lean. Asking how to skin a pig and sell it could lead to five paragraphs of help from people breaking it down in a sentence, to others taking the time to explain every single little thing you can do to squeeze an extra copper out of the bones of the pig you are slaughtering.


If you want to get some cool gear, not worry about the weather, time of day, recent reports of brigands, or if your character has grabbed a bite to eat and go out to win a fight against a boss with a bunch of awesome lights that make you think you have skill, this game might be to hard for you.

This game is one of a kind. You have complete freedom to do whatever you feel like. Explore, pvp, pve, pick pockets, engage in toxic politics and wars or become a merchant kingpin.
You can be a travelling merchant, peddling localised items from one end of the world to another. You can be a gatherer for complete strangers by using the broker buy orders system. You can be or do almost anything. You can steal from anyone anywhere.. but watch out for the guards or witnesses!

I never had so much fun in a game, as I have had in Mortal Online. 

I have played this game since the q1 of 2013. My steam hours does not show this, because I only recently started to use steam for the game.

The pros for Mortal are too numerous to list- but most important is that it is a full loot pvp mmorpg. Character creation is completely free, you make the character that you want, only limit is the amount of primary skill points.

The cons are numerous too, and you should be aware of them:
It is an old game, and you see this in the art/graphics. But hey, the weapons and armor are modelled after realistic gear and does not look like some anime cartoonish wow thing :)

There are many many bugs. You can get stuck on many things, some npcs like to move within walls of dungeons and other very annoying stuff.

There is NO official manual for the game, and the game is extremely complex. If you want to do anything more complicated than fighting, you are forced to spend hours reading guides on the official forums.

Population is old and a new player will have some difficulty convincing other players that he/she is truly new and not a spy for another guild.

The game community is slightly toxic. 

This game is not truly free to play. The f2p set a skill cap that prevent you from wearing heavy armor and from learning thievery. Dont waste your time with the f2p. As f2p you will never amount to anything but a hybrid lightweight fighter/tamer murderer in the capitol.

The game is a first person only MMO, if I was to describe it I would say think about a game that is like elder scrolls but done right!.

Pretty much every thing in this game is in depth and takes a long time to understand but once you get the hang of it you can get sucked into even the littlest parts of the game, such as going out into the world to find and tame animals with the right stats that you want to then use a breeding stock for your own mounts and animals or extracting raw ores from the rocks and then refining them into metals to sell or use to craft.

The game has a unlimited free trail but you are restricted to only having 60 effective skill points in any one skill, you can still level that skill up to 100 but until you sub you won't get the full skill point advantage. 

This is enough to let you understand the game and work out whether you like it or not, the game is not free to play you will not be on the same level as some one that subs.

I wouldn't say the game itself is bad, infact it seems to be good for exploration, content wise probably not.

The main problem is the community and the content lock until you join one of the major guilds. Basically it is incredibly hard to have any fun in this game without joining a major guild of the game, no room for solo players unless you plan to pay $40 USD to the developers for character slots and an additional fee every month for the subscription.

The game, is dying. It is dwindling on a suprisingly large loyal playerbase which I believe are really just there to troll and grief, which is fine to a certain degree. This is a game, it is meant for people to have fun in.

My problem comes with the insane amount of hours you have to dump into this game, the amount of developers who do nothing and how little control with the community there is. I understand this is a Hardcore MMO however a game which allows players to hunt a newer guy down until they get bored or the player quits is just stupid. This, is called Harassment. Back to what I said about many of the devs doing nothing, either they never log into the game or they do just to close your review and tell you to ""Eff off"" if you re-open an unsolved problem.
The quote has only happened once however devs have ignored me and many others numerous times even going to the point of closing every review we open on an issue.

There are obvious exploiters in this game, the anti cheat does nothing. The devs can't really do anything unless they catch them in the act, going back to 87% of the time devs say they are watching the guy when they are really cooking their food or something irl. This allows the exploiter to get away with his acts for weeks, or even months.

I specifically do not recommend this game because of the community, it seems nice at first until you leave Tindrem. Then it hits you like a brick, the combat is broken and a lot of hits do not even register, some NPCs are bugged to the point they have infinite health and the griefers who kill the games playerbase are not penalized since all they have to do is leave their computer up and their character in ghost mode for a night, then they can log in and massacre a couple people in town.
Still, I am all for losing everything on me when I die, it is when people obviously abusing the system and finding loopholes get away with it, to the point of getting dev support is when I draw the line.

The game still has potential but the dev team needs to be reformed, get people in there that know what they are doing and care about the game. I know of about 2 devs who actually do their jobs while the rest never log on or log on and close tickets randomly without viewing them.

Please comment your experiences to bring more awareness to this, all dev responses are welcome if it is a calm conversation.",1499547254,1504136226,False,4,0,0.464231967926025391,0,False,False,False,False,,,

O jogo é feito por uma empresa indie, portanto é claro que possui alguns problemas:

- Griefing na cidade inicial (Tindrem).
- Bugs, muitos bugs. Com o tempo você acaba lidando com eles do melhor jeito que pode.
- O jogo não é amigável com iniciantes, portanto tudo se torna difícil de aprender. Horas de pesquisa na internet e ajuda de uma guild resolvem este problema.
- Gráfico e Engine desatualizados, mas que pra mim não é problema.

Apesar destes problemas é um dos melhores MMORPG que já joguei. Imersão incrível, uns pontos positivos:

+ Aprende skills de acordo com o uso.
+ Open pvp com full loot.
+ Criação de castelos no mapa com controle de guilds. 
+ Cercos a castelo de guilds.
+ Casa no mapa aberto / sem instância.
+ Sistema de reputação.
+ Clima dinâmico. (Por ex. você ve uma nuvem no céu lá longe, e naquele local estará chovendo de fato e se ela estiver a caminho de sua direção, logo choverá onde você está).
+ Sistema de sobrevivência (Sede, fome, temperatura,etc.)
+ Melhor sistema de craft que já vi em um MMORPG (Várias opções que dependem do crafter).
+ Melhor sistema de pesca que já vi (Escolha entre varas de pesca, isca, tipo de anzol, tipo de linha, profundidade do anzol).
+ Coloque uma roupa com a pele de seus inimigos.
+ Colecione cabeça dos seus inimigos.
+ ...

Theres tons of negative reviews from people that have spent little to no effort understanding or researching. This game is not newbie friendly thats the truth, but so damn rewarding when you figure out the path you want to take. 

I've been gaming for 20ish years starting with Quake, Doom, Ultima Online, EverQuest, Darkfall and about any other real PVP game out there even some FPS shooters (grab my attention for a whole 2 weeks then im over it)... This game tops all of them and honestly feels like a Mix between Ultima online and Darkfall with alot more undiscovered aspects.

I can talk about this game for hours on this review and simply not cover everything, I've played since Beta and still learning every day / trying new builds and skill combos to tweak my build.

In short you have 1100 skill pts to what you wish kinda the same set up Ultima Online had. endless racial combos for different stat attributes that all affect dmg/runspeed/stam/health. You can be anything you want Tamer, Thief, Fighter, Mage, Crafter, Fisherman, the list goes on. Amoung the Endless possiblities of crafting hundreds of different weapon types with different materials. This game is hands down unmatched by anything content/depth of knowledge it takes to ""master"" the game.

All i can say is try it and give it a chance, also if you see the numbers off steam... It's not accurate.. most people launch off non steam client. Just to give you a idea... Mortal Online forums have 90k+ accounts. Probably around 4-6k active accounts currently. Hope this helps, this was also my first game review that i feel needed to be posted.

Enjoy! :)

jumping it still shait at lvl 50 so ceep that in minde.

Point positifs pour moi:

Bonne immersion
Pour ceux qui désirent roleplay c'est un jeu révé
Monde ouvert sans temps de chargement
Qu'un seul serveur,donc aucune instances(cool et en mème temps non j'expliquerais pourquoi)
Quand l'adversaire le permet,combat plus ou moin skilled(si il n'exploit pas,cheat pas,lag pas)
j'ai bien aimé l'ambiance dark fantasy du jeu,qui au debut me rebutait pas mal mais une fois dedans plutot cool
Les moment d'adrénaline pur qu'un bon jeu immersif peut donner
Le craft,l'aspect sandbox qui vous donnera enormement d'objectif si le coeur y est
Le fait que ca soit un Quasi oblivion online,j'ai trouve ca cool


Les points négatifs selon moi:

Trop de bug,trop d'exploit de la part de vétéran qui savent comment ca marche
Ping très mal géré en combat,dans le sens ou moi qui vient de france,bah faut qjprenne en compte qy'a des breziliens et qles breziliens ca lag et que du coup bah je le touche pas pck il lag et que lui il me touche et que c'est drole lol.(tout les combats ne sont pas comme ca evidement,mais... trop pour un jeu a abonement)
Communauté bien trop élitiste,j'entend par la que la pluspard ont leur vision du jeu bien fondé,aller a cette encontre et tu n'aura pas d'amis,deja que de base c'est difficile de trouver des ""amis"" sur ce jeu.
Une communauté pas si basse que ca mais,tout le monde vient a connaitre ton nom au bout d'1 mois mème pas,asser pour t'insulter en tout cas ^^.
Le support est bien trop inconstant en therme de qualité,et ne pas remboursé ma dernière transaction ou je n'est pas pu jouer du mois(bug,déco,crash) la solution a ce problème aurait été de passer par un vpn pour jouer a mortal,allé sur le deepweb avec un vpn ok,passé par un vpn pour juste jouer a un jeu... moais(ca sent a peine le pet cette histoire m'enfin,pourquoi pas x)).

au final j'ai passé de très bon moments sur ce jeu sincèrement,j'ai eu la chance de rentré dans une guilde Fr qui m'a appris les bases ""essentiels"" pour pouvoir comprendre un minimum le jeu,stuffs etc,ils on été globalement sympa avec moi. Mais au final je trouve ce jeu bien trop plastique,que ca soit les graphismes,les mécaniques de jeu saccadé(j'ai jamais vu un système de magie aussi réaliste et pourrie a la fois sans déconné T.T)

Bref,j'ai joué a des tas dejeu online,compétitifs,aussi pourrit soit il,mais j'ai jamais rencontré autant de bug,de gens égocentrique(j'ai joué 6 ans a lol,jamais vous verrez une video de moi sur le net,j'ai joué 6 mois a mortal,deux video de moi en train de me faire débrouissaillé l'olive,pour vous dire la mentalité du truc. pourtant lol les gens égocentrique... bref^^

Conclusion:de très bonne idées,une bonne immersion, trop d'ego,BIEN trop d'ego,un support négligé,qui n'aura comme seul initiative,répondre aux évalutions négatives sur steam. En bref,ca vaut pas 14 e par mois ou 13 e jsais plus,ca m'a gavé xD



Edit: Ayant éssayé de lancer quelques stream sur mortal,j'ai vite compris mon erreur,streamstalk tout simplement,Des mecs bien stuffs viennent te casser la guelle alors que t'essaye d'apprivoisé des vieux ânes,pas de mortal online sur twitch donc,dommage pour la communauté qui ne demande qu'a trouvé des nouveaux joueurs ^^"".",1498113345,1504754588,False,16,3,0.639021933078765869,5,False,False,False,False,,,

-They release big content patches that are not balanced not even tested and they relay on the customers to do this testing expecting the very ppl that pays for the mothly subscription to test and report bugs. So you will end up dealing with nasty things like items desapearing from your banks/chests, loosing pets, being stucked on the map, falling through the world map and waiting for a GM for more than 30 min to get any sort of help.

-GMs dont have proper logs so when you loose an item or pet because of a bug they just give you the: ""we cant do anything, have a nice day"" standard SV support team answer.

-They have players working as GMs, they denay it and they erase any topic on the forums but the community knows.

-GMs very often dont know about the mechanics of the game and you may get Jailed for extended period of times just because you where using this mechanics. Try to explain to a gm how portals work.

-They have a number of bugs i personaly reported and i am prety sure others also did, some of this bugs have years there with no posible fix in the horizon.

-The crafting/prossesing materials mechanics are totaly broken and are realy boring to do. If you want high tier gear be prepared to spend your payed time watching a progress bar for hours or Alt+Tab your game to other while a macro do nasty boring tasks that no player should ever do on anygame. Want wood, ores? Be prepared to watch a three or a rock for hours with the only interaction being to switch your pickaxe.

-They introduced a very bad Territory control system that allow players to exploit it placeing structures over unreachable locations. The siege system is boring and static. The new ""free house system"" last patch they introduced is a bad joke in terms of quality and balance. House are easy to destroy and hard to build, doors are buged and for some desynced players they look open but for others they look closed. House chests are broken and you may loose items if you use them. 

-There is a realy sad history of hackers harrassing the allready damaged game population and the company staff cant just handle with them aparently. It is common knowlidge how easy is to cheat and how basic their anticheat mesure are. Expect ppl using speed hacks and aim bots. expect the servers going down because of DDoS attacks, runing the experience for everyone.

It is a sandbox game where you are free to do whatever you want, of course you would encounter some retarded people who like to grief and shit on new players. But the thing is, that stops most of the players from explring and learning what this game really is about.

Despite most of the players never realizing this, the game has amazing overall idea, great concept, and even lore.. 
There are lots of different, complicated mechanics in the huge sandbox open world filled with mysteries. 
Pvp is just amazing (once you learn to fight and get your skills right), it is really skill based, like chivalry, but has factors that make it even more realistic, mostly because of the player freedom. You need both skilled players with different roles and thoughtful strategies to win large scale battles.

The sad truth is that 99% of the players will never get to experience the immersiveness, all the freedom and possibilities and the in-depth core system of this game, because they got killed numerous times in the graveyard of the cancerous city named Tindrem, and quit the game, having explored less than even 1% of the world and learned exactly nothing about what you can really do in the game, except dying and losing everything.

Even if they don't quit, they would become one of those players who do exactly that, because they would feel they are getting their 'justice' in doing so. 

And what happens after a while with those people?
'1/10 worse game evr, minecraft 10x better,  also i don't like dying in games '

Game has potential and one can always experience great things while playing, if he has the right mindset and does not quit or lose his ideals on the first hardship.

[h1]Updated old review[/h1]

Any TRUE RPG fans out there like myself?

If you've not played Mortal Online yet you need to hand over your gamer card ASAP. If your a true fan of MMoRPG's than this game will be right up your ally.

Over 100 skills JUST in the crafting system alone. FULL open world PvP with REAL real-time combat. And HARDCORE death penalties! Non of that cheap conventional level/class system like in your everyday modern online RPG's. Rather a Skill based attribute system to REALLY TRULY build your own custom combat game style. 

Want to learn magic? Read books, want to get better at fighting with a swords or bows? Use them more often. Want to run faster and longer? Than run till you can no longer run!

So the game is an unlimited trial. If you pay 15 dollars per month, you experience the full capacity of your character. Pay 2 Win is irrelevant I guess, since, as FarmerJoe says below, they are not a F2P game and they are trying to make it more clear to newer players that this is not a F2P game, but an unlimited trial.

My experience of the game was: 

- So many words when making a character. Kinda if I were to describe history to aliens and not take into account they don't understand what a Canadian or American is. ""The Bashravan took the Isolana from the Katatanka and the Ulusophis caught Manacookis from Isofritz, and because the warlike Kukutana stole Hahanana"" sort of thing. When I see fantasy do this I just cannot get motivated enough to read into every nook and cranny of the key-word history, so I just picked one race as my grandpa-grandpa-grandma-grandma-father-mother-self etc. My objective was to get a feel for the game anyway and not waste so much time on something I could remake later if I really was interested in the game.

- Picking attributes, I thought: Definitely one of those games you have to research a lot on first, if you want the right stuff. I would describe the entirety of character selection as unintuitive, since stats are an arbitrary language not explained in great detail to you. I just went 100% intellect and thought I would research it all later.

- Character screen glitches out on me, my age is stuck at 80 and won't go down. 

- Game seems like a fantasy Rust. Kinda interested now. Maybe I will research into the technicalities.

- Finds it's Pay 2 Win in everyway that a Free to Play game can be, except I'm corrected that it's not free to play, just free to partially experience. 

Well, I really suggest making it free to play. 50% on steam. Lots of people saying the moderators and GMs don't give a pudding about the game. I have no motivation to subscribe to an old and kind of rigid-feeling game like this. Tons of other options to pick from. If the game were like 10$ to get into and the rest non-P2W cosmetics, like how Rust can make your sweaters appear differently when you craft them, sure I would definitely give it a go.",1497082436,1497122724,False,2,0,0.477002531290054321,1,False,False,False,False,,,

A Hardcore Full Loot MMORPG with no loading screens and Beautiful Environments (Some areas need graphic updates)
In the past the environment/towns seemed Barren due to lack of NPCS however they have simply fixed it over the years with new weather, Voip System, New Magic Schools and a new House Revamp.

I spent most of my time playing this game as a simple crafter in the fancy town of fabernum, Once i had successfully became self sufficent with supplying myself aswell as the town i than decided to explore with others which blew my mind of what much more i had missed out on.

I can't understand why this game isn't Huge or known by much old UO fans but damn it has kept me coming back to it every now and than, Even after my subscription has run out i can still login to my characters like my thief and go around and lockpick some chests for money....like seriously what game allows you to do that.

Further more on the F2P/Free Trial aspect i do see people tend to complain about it however the game is still playable you can still level all your skills to 100 however you will notice that the skills are capped at 60, You can technically Level your guy to the ""MAX"" than subscribe and finish off a few additional skills like heavy armour training and you're 100% ready for combat.

What personally makes this game enjoyable more than others is the theme of a Gothic/European/Mythological world with Weird ass creatures and a Fair feeling of magic that you're not always Getting NUKED like other MMOs.

The crafting is honestly the best ive come across in any MMO, Different materials for hilts and blades and styles that they look in change the properties of the weapon which can than be used as a fast stabbing spear or slashing polesword.
Hell you can even make rediculous weapons like a Lance with a hammer head (It may not be the most efficent weapon but goddamn it gives you the freedom to do so.

A friend (who is a game developer) and I started up last night, met each other in the tutorial area and laughed a bit at the interface.  Nothing awful, a little awkward to get through the menus but once we had it figured out we quickly made our way to the bunnies. He watched me tame mine and streamed the silly coercing animation.

The future looked bright as he chose animal tamer and I went with archer. Just after leaving the tutorial, he took a couple of minutes to tame a dog. Naming it, we stumbled our way around the city looking for some action. We found the graveyard. While he and I were attempting to communicate via voice chat (which is awful btw, christ) another player came up behind him and stabbed his dog. ""not your dog"" the player said, then handed him a corpse. I watched the guy stab it, so I know he did it. My friend gave him the benefit of the doubt, and after we discussed it on his channel, he said he was writing the player's name down. The player lingered for awhile.

We began combat with a skeleton. While still in our two hour grace period, the player stepped in front of my friend's weapon swing, I assume flagged my friend for combat and then proceeded to stab him twice - to death. I was wildly flailing at the skeleton, didn't notice that I managed to strike him as well, and he killed me also.

We came back and our corpses were looted, left with only our heads and some rags. The Pièce De Résistance for me was when I tabbed out to talk to him, the game forced my alt key to emulate being held down and I had to force restart in order to tell him that I was uninstalling this.

But if its for you, its seriously for you. This game is about specialisation, finding the goal of your charicter and becoming talented at a singal persuit; theiving, magic, fighting, crafting. You won't be self sufficient, you'll need otherplayers to acomplish anything and no singal player is untouchable. For that matter.. in this universe, no city, town or capital is either. 

The player based market and economy make the game feel dynamic and alive. But, its not an easy game. There is little help in just about anything, your going to stumble your ways through crafting, never really understanding exactly what combination of weight, materials and designs work best. But thats the persuit we love. If you just adventure that's fine too, but be prepared to die a lot and when you die, be prepared to accept the costly consiquences. 

My enjoyement of this game is exponential, intially i absolutely rage-hatted everything about it. But, in time, you learn to love every difficulty that made those first few hours so damm intolerable. 


Now, for the bad stuff. The graphics are fairly aweful, or at least the animations are just so terrible and that make imersion a little painful at times. That said, I dont think its why people play... but it is also 2017.  The FTP (free to play model) is a bit of a lie, while you can free to play you'll suck and be able to acomplish nothing. At least its not pay to win though, and once you subscribe you'll unlock all the higher level skills very quickly, so there's no rush, do test it out. The downside of the free to play model is that the skill growth can be trash-trash-trash-(limit of FTP)-semi-trash-epic. Which is kind of sad, but grinding skills is fairly easy and so the game becomes about fiding matterials, locations and recipeis to etablish yourself and trade.

Anyhow, give it a go. You'll be pleasently pissed off, then thrilled you pushed through.

TL:DR if you want to run around as a uber-leet-lol-cake cartoon orc in wow: this aint for you. Want something more challenging, serious and worth while where every small aspect of the world matters. Welcome, but you wont get a tutorials (or at least a useful one)

Отличная игра для тех, кому не лень включать мозг и задавать вопросы.

Подробнее: 
Если вы любите бегать от стрелочки к стрелочке, от НПС до НПС, то игра не для вас.
Если вы любите убивать 100500 ваншотных мобов в секунду, то игра не для вас.
Если вы жутко боитесь потерять горячо-обожаемый вами шмот, на который потратили пол года задротства, то игра так же, не для вас.
И даже если вы не можее терпеть серьезные баги, из за которых будете по глупому умирать, тут тоже пролет.

Если же вы любите тщательно, продуманно и осторожно подходить ко всему, от изучения мира и механик игры, до сражений, как ПвЕ, так и ПвП...
Если вас не отпугивает английский язык и вам не страшно вступить в клан, дабы разобраться, что к чему...
Если вы способны найти себе занятие в свободной игре с кучей возможностей, без притягивания за уши...
Ну и если вас не страшат различные странные, багованные, несправедливые явления в игре...
То, вероятно, игра вам может понравится.

Лично я, весьма критично относился к игре, отпугивала подписка и общая хардкорность, даже отложил начало игры до лучших времен несколько лет назад. Да и сейчас, когда я подсел на игру, все еще остаются спорные моменты (та же условная бесплатность и баги), идеальных игр, увы, не бывает и эта тому прямое подтверждение.
Но вся атмосфера и многогранность игрового процесса, которые еще нужно уметь раскрыть, пересилила возможные риски и я начал играть.
На данный момент почти безвылазно играю уже несколько недель и не перестаю узнавать для себя что-то новое: 
Интересные места, данжи, территории со своими особенностями, рандомные сокровища в различных формах и проявлениях, хоть и весьма ограниченные, но их можно открывать для себя не один день или даже неделю.
Множество профессий, требующих тщательного подхода, играя которыми, можно месяцами узнавать какие-то особенности и не терять интерес.
Не шибко продуманные, но от того не менее веселые клановые войны и простое ПвП.
А так же множество других интересных и не очень, моментов.

До этого пробовал множество различных ММОРПГ, которые цепляли в разной степени, но после всего пройденого, эта игра смогла меня зацепить, уж не знаю на сколько, но смогла.
Потому могу посоветовать просто попробовать ее и не делать поспешных выводов, не гарантирую, что игра вам понравится, но я сам ее открыл для себя не сразу, потому дайте ей шанс занять частичку вашего времени и, возможно, даже частичку вашей души :)",1495959420,1495959556,True,27,3,0.642657041549682617,2,False,False,False,False,,,

While the game has decent graphics and a lot of potential it has many more downsides than up. Too many new players get slaughtered without having any kind of real chance and no real defences against PKers. You get 2 hours of fledgling which limits some thing you can do and is no where long enough to gain any kind of strength to save yourself from others who like to kill weak players. There is 0 defense against being forced into a PVP where you will drop all items you had and most likely they will be stolen also after you're dead. If you're a new player you might as well not even try to defend yourself because you will be 1 shot killed maybe 2 but unlikely you'll live that long. Even in the tutorial ""Safe"" town you will still get screwed over. Also, pickpocketing? Really? If you're new well too bad people will pick pocket you and take your garbage items just so you can't build yourself up out of being a noob. So, overall if you are thinking about playing this game, don't. Unless spending the next 2 or 3 months being killed and stolen from repeatedly sounds like fun to you and you are defenseless against it. Honestly now that I think about it I'd give this game like a 5/10 not even a 6.5 really. So, what these people who made this game need to do is go back an fix a lot of this trash. If nothing it give new players like a week of not being able to be killed by Red Players or stolen from by pick pockets. I mean come on, give people at least a small chance. 2 hours is no where near enough time at all. Like, it's a fucking joke honestly lol. It takes 2 hours for a new player to even figure out wtf is going on lol. Like just... no it's just stupid and it's garbage lol.

К сожалению, на тот момент, требования к железу были очень высоки, а мой песональный проигрыватель пиратских дисков с играми - на старом АМД процессоре обещал взорваться после первой же секнунды запуска Мортал онлайн. В итоге: я со слезами на глазах, распечатал себе плакат Мортала, дописал на нем фломастером - ""Я нищеброд"", и стал судорожно копить и собирать деньги на новую машинку. Итак 4 года назад на 2х ядерном АМД (черт бы побрал этот теплоагрегат) я попробовал запустить игру - ЕСТЬ! но ФПС до 10, лаги и фризы...в общем пришлось удалить после 3х часов игры - ибо так играть было невозможно от фразы - ""да пиZдеC, что за ...!?!?""
И вот я с ноутбуком I7 8gb оперативки, 4 видео  - запускаю снова и ....13 фпс, лаги и фризы....
7 греbbаных лет и ZHOпошная оптимизация!!!!  Да как так то!??! 

А вот так: разработчики сами увлеклись проектом настолько, что Мортал начал развиваться не ""вширь"" - исправление багов,  повышение оптимизации,  поддержка пользователей на уровне технических вопросов, а  в ""ДАЛЬ"" - Мортал оброс новыми фишками, крафтингом, скиллами, плюшками, плащиками за донаторство и пр.

У молодой команды нет времени и средств на то, чтобы разобраться с техническими проблемами игроков, поэтому они сосредоточились на тех, кто Может играть без проблем с железом.

Если пройтись по Геймплею (не смотрите на то, что в стиме у меня 8 часов наиграно, на старом аккаунте я смог высидеть 40 часов)., то есть мног плюсов:

* Нет системы уровней - качается то, чем вы сейчас занимаетесь.
Если ты разделываешь кожу - твой навык качается по мере разделки туш)
* Возможность играть бесплатно с ограничением в 60 уровень ваших скиллов (т.е. если хочешь докачать навык или скилл до 100 - плати абонентскую плату)
* Довольно таки простая возможность заработка - прокачай  любой навык  и бегай к торговцу, торгуй!
* Реализм - решил сбегать ""пописать за таверну"" в темный уголок - наткнулся на воров.
* Крафтинг - твори, создавай, собирай и вари, строй и украшай!
* вючные животные - купи осла, навесь сумки и иди собирать лут - мобильный завод на копытах!!!
* интересная система боя -  слишком близко ударил противника - это удар рукоятью, а не саблей - поэтому незаслуженно ударенная  кулаком в харю туша - может дать достойную обратку Вам))
* Захват замков (в том числе НПС шных городов)
* детальная обнаженка (это просто мечта юного дро44ера!!!) - но, что приятно,ее можно отключить в меню настроеек.
Получив скалкой в жбан от жены - я быстро разобрался где и как отключить эту опцию.

недостатки:

*школота (ворье и просто мракобесы с нездоровым чувством юмора и прокаченным файтингом кулачного боя)
Хочешь долго и интересно играть - вступи в гильдию! Игра явно не для Сингла.
*оптимизация  -см. выше.

Итог:  Отличная задумка, но такое ощущение, что игра делается только из-за интереса самих разработчиков, которые счастливо творят себе свой собственный фэнтезийный мир, пилят бабло на идее и не оглядываются на проблемы.

Many of the negative review is about getting killed or griefed within hours of starting the game. You get a 2 hour grace period of invulnerablity from players to complete the tutorial. After that, you're on your own. This is a HARDCORE mmorpg, expect to die often, lose alot and even rage at times. EVE online players will be familiar with this type of game. 

PROS:
-Very indepth crafting system, be it cooking, alchemy, weapon/armor crafting, materials are obscure and nothing is laid infront of you. Experiement and find the best combination to suit your needs.
-Lots of PVE content. Dungeons and caves scattered throughout the world, Large diversity of mobs to kill, butcher, and farm.
-Exploration, Almost none of the content is explained by the devs. you have to go out there and discover it yourself. Like finding a mysterious key on a body, or finding a hidden cave, or a locked door in a dungeon. Figure it out
-PVP, Open world pvp, need I say more? Somebody disrespected you, or has something shiny? Go kill them. There is a criminal system where you get flagged for criminal actions and city guards will attack you, but hey, if they can't see you...
-Territory control, Also part of the PVP system, guilds can build structures and control towns, other guilds can wardec.
-Combat System, 3 general styles of combat, Melee, Archery and Magic. With a mounted style for each. And with melee combat you have Direction blocking/Parrying, Directional attacks. 

CONS:
-Dated graphics if that matters to anyone. Looks a little old, but not bad.
-Griefers. Yup. There are people that will murder others just for fun. 
-High risk, everything is loss on death. Can be frustrating at times, but very profitable at others.
-Pretty complicated, not your average game sense HARDCORE. Youll need to dedicate a bit of time to look into things if you wanna avoid many problems down the road.
-Trolls. They are everywhere. Don't onesidedly listen to all the help you get. 
-The community can be toxic at times, or very nice. just gotta find the right people.

CONCLUSION:
Do you: Like EVE Online, Enjoy complicated and in depth crafting systems, Exploration, PVP with high risk high rewards,
Do not mind dying often, Enjoy a true hardcore game,  Love wars? If you said yes to any of these, well go ahead and try it. Steele yourselves because death comes to all, no matter how good you are.

Towns are ""safe"" but that doesnt mean you cannot be murdered in town, it means you have access to the help of guards if you are attacked, just like in real life if you are too far away from a cop and someone wants to kill you they will. If you wish to give this game a trial I personally recomend you consider weather you are able to handle death even as a new player. Changes to the game come and go but one thing that remains is player interaction, this is the best part of the game even if you are just traveling the rush of passing someone you can feel the tension between eachother, out in the wilderness of nave it is a constant standoff. This game is one of my all time favorite, its not the best designed hell its not even the best looking, but if you give up on the game before you can see its full potential and give it a real try you are missing out on a world of adventure and excitement every turn you make is a rush every decision must be carefully made. Good luck in the World of Nave.

TLDR: The game is not for everyone, give it a try longer than an hour and talk to people to understand how the game works before you give up.

The community is also really awful and rather toxic. For all the ""find people to work with"" comment I have seen and gotten, I never met anybody who was actually inclined to help.

And getting stuck in walls. That was dumb.

Objects sometimes seem to be floating on nothing (including flora).

This game has things in it that I really, really enjoy. The crafting seems super awesome, but is completely overshadowed by the fact that you just get killed and looted so often.

Quick disclaimer; This'll be quite the review! Head on down to the ""Bottom Line"" if you've not got the patience or time to read through this wall of text!

As a newbie with a little over 60 hours in the game, this'll cover my first impressions along with what I think the game does wonderfully, and what could be improved.

I highly reccomend giving this game a try for yourself if you can muster the courage to work things out on your own, or have enough of a thick skin to interact with the community and it's wonderful and not-so-wonderful members to ask for help when needed!



[h1]-- First Steps --[/h1]

As a newbie, you're dropped into Mortal Online and greeted by a familiar quest arrow pointing you to the nearest NPC, who will teach you the ropes and get you up to speed. 

However, don't think that 'up to speed' means sprinting the 100m like Usain Bolt! 'Up to speed' in this case means gently strolling accross town with a basic understanding of a part of the game's mechanics. :)

Basic swordfighting, interacting with NPCs, crafting armor and taming wild beasts -- bunnies in this case :) -- are on the menu during Mortal Online (MO)'s first few minutes. Once you have ran a few errands for NPCs to get to grips with the game, you meet the captain of the guard who opens the world of MO up to you, and you are free to go!

By free to go, I mean litterally free to go. Once the first few steps in the game are taken, you are left to your devices with a handful of good information -- accessed through the (H)elpful Information menu -- and basic gear -- rags for armor and a good ole' basic sword!

The rest is up for you to decide! Want to make the best armor possible? Want to become a renowned mage, feared by many? Want to run around naked and sing songs to the people of the land on top of your lungs? It's all possible! 

Yes. I've seen a naked dude run around singing songs -- well, it was more like screaming... Don't ask.

As a side note worth mentioning, this game does include nudity in the form of a tick box in your options, so that when someone unequips all armor, they are genuinely naked, as opposed to the usual MMORPG 'I've got no armor or anything else equipped but I still have clothes'.

I found this nudity somewhat age-gates the community to a certain level of maturity, or atleast mostly. So I'm not against it whatsoever! Plus, to some of us -- me included -- this just means a more immersive experience! :)


[h1]-- First Impression --[/h1]

Visually, the game shows it's age. From what the community has told me, it is over 10 years old, released in 2005-2006, and that is appearant in the graphics. Very reminiscent of Oblivion without the soft blur and fantasy elements to it. Very gritty, the game's color palette is quite down-to-earth -- litterally, most things are earth-colored. I quite like it, as it makes me realise that I'm not in an overly fantastic setting!

Gameplay-wise, it is very hardcore and deep. Everything you can think of besides your granny has a 'skill' related to it, which gains experience the more it is used, making your character a neverending growing and changing work of art. 

The game is also what is reffered to as a ""full loot"" game. Meaning that if you are slain, you drop your entire inventory; hotbars, equipped items and all. This makes the risk factor of the game skyrocket when you learn that PvP is non-restricted, making nearly the entirety of the gameworld undoubtedly dangerous, adding a kick of suspense to your expeditions and general going about your business in the Nave -- the name of the gameworld/realm you are thrust in.



[h1]-- First Issues --[/h1]

As a newbie in MO, I learned as much as possible from the tutorial, and read nearly every single article within the (H)elpful Information window and skimmed the ones that were obvious.

However, after a solid 45 minutes of doing the turotial, getting to grips with the controls and UI and reading the aptly named helpful information, I was left with one question:

""What now?""

The game does a decent job at introducing it's basic mechanics, but not it's core concepts. I was warned quite thoroughly that ""it's dangerous out there, store your stuff in banks or you run the chance of losing it all"", but I wasn't told much else after the tutorial, which felt quite.. unsubstantial? 

A good tutorial makes sure that whomever comes into your game gets hooked. It facilitates player retention and makes it so that newbie players are all at a certain level, it evens out the playing field by having everyone know the same basics.

However, MO's tutorial puts every newcomer at the mercy of what the community will tell them, as most of the information is found either on the official MO Forums, or shared through the in-game ""/help"" chat.



[h1]-- Bottom Line --[/h1]

As far as I'm concerned, the game has very very deep skill and crafting systems which I have, do and will enjoy for the forseeable future. It's neck-deep implementation of PvP mechanics along with satisfying character growth and promising player interactions make it very unique! 

However, it does still require additional polishing for it to become a *fantastic* game!

Here's a quick TL;DR of the two small additions I'd put in the game to make it into a must-play!

[list]
[*] A fuller, more explicative introduction to the game, covering a tad more bases than it currently does.
[*] Bugfixes and more polishing of the already present content (books, drawing paper and taming/pets come to mind).
[/list]

At the moment, I'd definitely consider MO to be a must-try-for-a-decent-amount-of-time, as it needs a bit to 'grow on you', but rewards you with a very satisfying experience overall, and the potential for meeting great people to form bonds with!



[h1]-- Conclusion --[/h1]

I can talk about Mortal for days on end, but for the sake of this review, I should point out some major pros and cons, as well as mention some important things you should know.

Pros:
Actually pulls off the ""RPG"" part of ""MMORPG.""
Huge map.
Massive variety in different locations and their styling.
Knowledge actually is power, there are many things you can discover and use to your advantage.
Pretty good non-hotbar oriented combat, with diverse playstyles for different character archetypes.
Your character isn't confined to classes, they are able to have freedom in allocating skills as they please.
Diverse playerbase.
Interesting territory control system allows for guild politics and conflicts to be believable and intriguing.

Cons:
Bugs.  A lot of annoying bugs.
Lag, the servers are located in the UK, if you aren't in Europe expect at least 100ms ping.
Nodelines, possibly the least intuitive loading mechanic in the history of games, not only is laggy and disconnecting from the experience, but also is the source of many annoying bugs and weird occurences.
The optimization is pretty abysmal considering how old the game is.
Graphics are, according to most, rather ugly, although I don't think they're particularly horrible.
Hard to get into for most, as the new player experience is currently very poor, although this is subject to change soon.

Conclusion:
I cannot, nor would I want to, cover all this game has to offer in a Steam review, but all I can say is this: if you have spare time, and a willingness to pick up the game and deal with bugs and other issues, this game is the very definition of a diamond in the rough.

Creo más de 2.000h de juego son suficientes recomendaros al 200% este juegazoo.

Requisitos del jugador de Mortal Online:

-PACIENCIA (los inicios son muy duros).
-RELACIONATE con los demas jugadores, buscate una Guild de tu idioma o pais y veras lo que es jugar al MO (este juego esta pensado para la interacción entre jugadores, tu solo no puedes ser todos los roles).
-NO PREJUICIOS: No judgar un libro por su portada, me muero de risa cuando leeo analisis de este juego, de jugadores con 20h o 5h de juego. En ese tiempo en Mortal Online, no has salido ni de la cuidad inicial (Tindrem), la cual es lo más Toxico que tiene este juego, ya que es donde nacen los pjs y donde más trolls hay!
-LO BUENO VALE DINERO: Querer pagar por el trabajo de otros, un juego de 7 años actualizado cada 15 dias, hay que pagar por eso! Este juego NO es free. El sistema de Free to play, es una demo que te muestra la cascarilla del iceber, un % del juego para saber si te puede o no gustar este juego. Encuentra a jugadores de tu pais y paga un mes (12€) y luego si no estas enganchado hasta las trancas, vete a jugar a otro juego (Es preferible a mi entender que pagar por un juego de 19,99€ y luego hecharle 30h de juego y no volver a jugar a él jamas).
-PVPero, no te tiene que encantar el PvP, pero si almenos toleralo, ya que la base de este juego o de un FullLoot (pierdes todo lo que llevas encima al morir) és el PvP. Si te gusta darte de ostias con los otros jugadores este juego te ofrece una infinita variedad de maneras de hacerlo.
-FARMERO, todo cuesta oro. Vas a tener que hechar bastantes horas, solo o con los colegas que hagas en el MO, matando npcs para conseguir ese oro y poderte comprar buenas armas/armaduras ( las del cementerio no sirven ni para esconderlas).

Si te has leido este toston, te lo agradezco mucho y seguramente te picara la curiosidad de probar este magnifico juego! Yo te ofrezco mi ayuda en tu inicios, pregunta en el chat de help, por Mouzor o por la Guild WEED, la unica activa de habla hispana! No te arrepentiras ;)

I played the game for a long time. I honestly love the game, but it's not for everyone. It's the kind of game where you're litterally not safe anywhere. It's hardcore, and if you die you lose everything, you fall in the water you drown if you're too heavy, you eat the wrong plant, you get sick. Tons of secrets and a fanbase that does not cater to those who are looking for an easy time. If you're persistent and find unique ways to solve your problems, such as, I make a lot of friends who help me to stay alive, you'll succeded. So, to the positives of the game.

You get one character, your reputation really matters, people remember your name and your face. There's no map, you have to learn the areas by exploration or through paying others for a tour. (and it's a huge world.) There's no quests really through npcs, players make the quests and shape the world. No where is safe, take oppertunities to either become a public paragon and benevolent person who saves others, or use those same issues to your advantage for your own gain, reputation is everything. 

This game is as close as you're going to get to real life in a video game in a lot of ways.

THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU RAGE, everything counts, everything is important, including learning when to be safe and when to take risks. Treat your life in game like real life.

Normalmente los analisis negativos son de usuarios con pocas horas de juego, yo llevo alguna más de las reflejadas ya que no empleo el lanzador de Steam, cuestion de prestaciones ...Vayamos por partes....

ES cierto que el juego esta mal optimizado, tiene algun bug y que graficamente es mejorable, tambien es cierto que si no tienes una cuenta de pago las posibilidades de tus personajes estan ""capadas"".  Lo que algunos no se paran a pensar es que si un juego lleva funcionando tantos años por algo será.... Por otra parte tengamos en cuenta que quienes programan juegos quieren viivir de ello, en mi opinión la profundidad del juego bien mercece la cuota que pide. Pero claro queremos un juego bonito, barato, actualizado constantemente, en el que podamos ganar con facilidad y sin pagar ni un duro. Pues nada chaval, luego en tu trabajo  ves a currar 24/7 y sin cobrar, que es lo que estas pidiendole tu a los programadores, o te compras un juego de esos de 60 euros, te lo pasas en 40 horas y a criar polvo en la biblioteca, en fin...

El juego no es duro, es ""muy duro"", esto no es un WOW, nada de niveles, nada de ""target"" sobre el enemigo, y ya puedes bailar alrededor haciendo combos estupidos e irreales con un arma del tamaño de tu caballo, nada de mapa ni de flechas luminosas de neon indicandote el camino. El juego cuenta con full PVP en cualquier parte, no hay  "" zonas de confort"", algunos dicen que la comunidad es bastante toxica, no es cierto... La comunidad es una coleccion de bastardos malnacidos que te sacaran los ojos a la primera ocasión, vamos como en el mundo real. Encontraras gente que te robará, te explotará, te engañara, te matara, y todo ello a veces sin obtener ningun beneficio, solo por placer, solo por que ""puede hacerlo""

Lo unico que no haran en sodomizarte, y creo que es solo por que el juego no esta preparado para ello, ( de momento), pero tambien encontraras gente que te ayudará, te orientará, e incluso te regalara equipo y armas, aunque solo te duren cinco minutos antes de perderlo todo... EL sistema de crafteo es profundo y complejo, mostrando un amplio abanico de posibilidades que incluyen, entre otras muchas, cocina, construcción,  doma, domesticación, alquimia, pesca y asi ""ad infinitum"". 

Muchas de estas habilidades son profundas y complejas, lo cual requiere un personaje dedicado en exclusiva a ellas, olvidate de tener un personaje polivalente, aqui la gente si quiere hacer algo bien se especializa, lo normal es que los personajes conozcan en profundidad un par de oficios.

Esto, unido al extendidisismo PVP del juego, ocasiona algo que le quita algo de color al juego, y es la cuestion de las razas. Hay muchas y puedes mezclarlas, ya que a la hora de generar el PJ podemos decidir sus lineas de sangre y antepasados. 

Naturalmente la gente tiene ya optimizadas las ""builds a la hora de hacerse los personajes. 
¿ quieres un arquero  montado"" pues para que  este totalmente optimizado tiene que ser de una raza determinada y unas habilidades concretas.

 ¿ pero bueno, es que entonces no existen arqueros humanos en este mundo por ejemplo ?, pues no... nadie los llleva simplemente porque hay razas mejores para ello. Eso a mi modo de ver le quita color al juego en su vertiente de Rol, pero todos sabemos que a la gente le gusta el Rol hasta que llega otro y le parte la cara a su personaje, entonces se olvida del Rol y saca otro clon de  "" el arquero de la raza tal, totalmente optimizado y bla,bla, bla "").

Que le vamos a hacer, cosas del PVP, no obstante algunos insistimos en nuestra estupidez y contamos con personajes inutiles que lo pasan mal a la hora de sobrevivir en el juego, mi cocinero por ejemplo, matame, que solo podras robarme un taparrabos y cacharros de cocina, aun asi te matan no creais, supongo les divierte "" matemos al abuelo ese que esta pescando en el puerto. ""

En fin, Mortalonline o lo amas o lo odias, pero aqui sigue y todos los dias entran jugadores nuevos, nueve de cada diez se van llorando a casa a jugar a MMPORG blandos,  uno de cada diez se queda....

En el juego la mayor parte de la economia y muchos  de los recursos de crafteo, estan en manos de los jugadores, los clanes (guilds en el juego ), pueden construir casas, villas, e incluso fortalezas y ciudades en el mapa. De este modo puedes pasar por un sitio por segunda vez y encontrarte con que el paisaje a cambiado. Por cierto, aqui preparar un asedio, maquinas incluidas, es toda una odisea.

Muchas cosas en el juego son ""top secret"", como las recetas de alquimia. Podras encontrar Guias y ejemplos de crafteo  y recetas en ellas, estas adquieren el formato de libros escritos por jugadores que puedes comprar en el juego. Alli encontraras la manera de comenzar a caminar, pero el resto del camino lo tendras que hacer solo, la información es poder...

Concluyendo:

Este ""analisis"", que más bien es un apresurado resumen de mis primeras impresiones, abarca una insignificante parte de lo que supone Mortalonline, con lo cual cierro esto recordandoos que :

-El juego, y la mayor parte de los jugadores, emplean la lengua de la perfida Albion, foro del juego inlcuido.
- StarVault es una compañia pequeña, aun así el juego esta constantemente actualizado y en constante mejora.
- El Alma de este juego esta en su profundidad y en como encajes a tu PJ en esta aberrante y cruel sociedad medieval, no                 es su apartado visual, recuerda; la parte visual es susceptible de mejorarse en muchos juegos, su naturaleza, concepto y construcción ya no tanto.
- Emplea una cuenta de prueba antes de decidir si lo compras.
- Dale un vistazo a Guias, analisis y tutoriales, en video y archivos de lectura,  antes de intentar jugar.
- Dentro del juego la union hace la fuerza, busca gente con la que hacer cosas juntos.
- No hay mapa del juego, busca mapas en la red y emplea la brújula y tu orientación, cuidado a la hora de hacer turismo, aun así, te recomiendo que no dejes de intentar viajar y ver mundo.
- El juego requiere una suscripción mensual, puedes comprar ""slots"" para nuevos personajes, la gran mayoria de loa jugadores habituales tienen más de un pj, esto es necesario, o util por cuestiones de tiempo, debido a la naturaleza de algunos oficios, magos por ejemplo.
- Las macros son muy utiles en este juego.

Me dejo en el tintero, por olvido y desconocimiento, muchas más cosas, descubrelas tu mismo, el diablo de este juego, también vive en los detalles.

Mi analisis es positivo, ya que este juego a mi naturaleza como jugador le resulta atracivo, en ti puede ser diferente, el objetivo del analisis es invitarte a juzgar el juego por ti mismo, no pretende decirte que sea bueno a malo para ti, pues no te conozco lector.

No.  Just.  No.  Cancer at every turn.  The game needs a LOT of work.  However, it is fun if you have people you trust playing with you..... Even then, watch your own goddamn back.

In the help channel you're just as likely to get a smart ass answer as you are a correct one.   Next, let's ignore the fact that even in the tutorial zone, you'll get killed and/or your pets will get killed.  Then let's ignore the fact that the very first place where noobs are sent to train and level is a cess pool of random ganking by high level characters and neither the players nor the devs seem to give a shit that it only serves to chase potential players away.  The game promotes high level characters running around naked with nothing but a weapon, smashing random noobs or their pets and suffering only the loss of a cheap weapon.  If they do kill you and manage to get away from the guards, in TWO MINUTES their flag goes away and they can walk past the guards like nothing happened, with all your gear in their pocket.  Thieves are broken to the point it encourages them to run around totally naked.  You can become a criminal and be killed just for looking at another player's inventory. Mages cost an absolute fortune to get started and to be any good, you need to spend hours using autohotkey to spam damage spells on yourself in order to skill up.

But ignore all of that.

Here's the real fun.  If you own an AMD processor, you're screwed.  You'll have to reduce your audio settings to CD quality or you'll lag out immensely when you die.  Next, you'll have to turn the game's graphics down to the absolutely lowest settings, otherwise the memory leaks after an hour become so intense that you're running at 5 fps.  And then there's the random crashes with render errors.  They always take place at the most opportune moments, like when you're in a pvp fight, or you're running from something trying to eat you.  The help channel will tell you precisely why these crashes happen.  The game has not been optimized.  I think it's been out for what, 7, maybe 8 years and they still haven't optimized the graphics code?  Compared to fps games like Rust, the graphics look ancient. And when you turn the settings down in order to keep from lagging out, they look even more horrid.  Bugs abound.  Creatures falling out of the sky, rising up through the ground.  Crossing the bridge to the 'new' continent with pets and you most likely won't have any pet afterward or you'll find yourself hundreds of feet above the ground.  And that new continent came out in an expansion 2 years ago and they still haven't fixed half it's bugs.

The game really had potential once upon a time.  I really wish I COULD like this game.  But the fact that noobs are given ZERO opportunity to learn the game (there isn't even a wiki to document things) before they get swords shoved up their asses by griefers who've played for years makes this game a closed loop.  Only those who have been there will stay there.

*** Response to comments ***

I understand Mortal perfectly, and I understand it's market. It's for seal clubbers. It's for puppy kickers.  It's for people who feel better when someone else feels worse than they do.  Randomly killing player mounts in town is not PVP.  It's griefing.  Camping the area where noobs are sent to make coin with high level toons isn't PVP. It's griefing. Killing minutes old players in the tutorial area is not PVP. It's griefing. All of this is promoted because the consequences for griefing are a minor nuisance at most. If you're the type person who'd enjoy setting ants on fire with a magnifying glass, you'd love Mortal. That's the niche it fills. 

I played EVE Online. For YEARS as a matter of fact.  Yes, there is griefing in that game.  However, you're not going to grief in EVE without consequences.  You grief often enough those consequences force you into low sec or 0.0 where you have to WORK to restore your status.  In this game, just wait a few minutes and you can go griefing again.

TLDR: This game promotes and makes money off the disinhibition effect. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect.  

So, whether you enjoy trolling, griefing or just standing in the middle of a populated area spewing obscenities or racial slurs over voip without repurcussions, whether you're a narcissists, psychopath, or even a sadists, you'll love the fact that you can PAY a gaming company to ignore and even cater to your psychosis and the game breaking bugs will seem irrelevant.",1491263692,1492393924,False,70,6,0.781904339790344238,9,False,False,False,False,,,

Mortal Online is a hardcore MMORPG which sports a diverse amount of skills, with skill based progression, full loot PvP, an interesting crafting system, housing and many other things that should in theory make it a worthwhile game. But it is not. For a game released in 2010, it is exceptionally ugly, uninspiried, poorly designed, huge and empty. 

I tried numerous times, redownloading the game, getting back onto the server, playing for a bit, and then putting it back down as it is simply an unbearable experience. The world is huge, and empty. The first city you start in is filled with empty space, poorly put together buildings, horrible render distance, outright fucked textures and clear misunderstanding of scale. Instead of making impressive, small but impactful areas, it instead goes out of it's way to make getting from place to place as tedious as humanly possible, starting you off with a snail pace to traverse the flat and empty environment. 

Now, that would be passable, if not for the constant crashing, bugs, lag spikes, and a complete lack of immersion or wonder due to poor art, lazy environments and an utter lack of a hook to ger you interested in the world. Do I want to get past the initial grind and have fun in the late game? No, not really, the game gives me no reason to want to play it. 

And it is a shame, really. It's a game for a very specific niche, if you do not mind incredibly slow and clunky early games, with some cool stuff you could do later, if you can get past the movement speed and the bland world. If the shitty artstyle and utter lazines shown by the fucked up materials present throughout the starting area alone do not sound like a huge turn off, give it a go.

Think of what ESO was supposed to be and that's roughly where you're at imo. 
There is a deep crafting system that takes time and attention to detail to ""master"". A full loot pvp system that lets you claim the spoils of war from the corpse of your enemies after battle. A rather large open world map full of caves/dungeons to explore, materials to gather, things to build/craft, enemies to battle, NPC AND Player built cities. That's right, you can build anything from your own personal shack to an entire guild empire that controls half of a continent (that happened).
There is everything to do from fighting 50 ft bugs  and treasure hunting to just sitting around on the edge of a pond and spend the day fishing ( even fishing has it's own system to catch various fish with different baits, depths etc).

With over 1k hours on steam and an easy 3k+ before and after steam I can say the game has held my attention for a very long time. It has been a favorite that I check back in on every now and then even when I thought I have moved on and probably will continue to do so for a while to come as the devs have been on a roll with updates as of late.


I'm not going to lie... there has been a list of bugs that trailed on for a while there (silly AI and other minor bugs), but like I mentioned the devs of the game have been pretty on top of things and most of if not everything is far better than earlier days. Not to mention all sorts of new stuff being added pretty frequently. New mobs, magic types, armors, new housing and more have all been added fairly recently and in a short span of each other and that isn't even half of their planned content. 


The biggest problem I see is that it can be overwhelming for new players with everything to take in and get accustomed to (especially the full loot/open pvp aspect). If you are willing to stick around long enough to get the hang of the game you won't be dissappointed. Try bringing a friend or two, or look for a guild/friends in game as it can be 10x more fun with a buddy having your back :P.

P.s- While many players are actually pretty helpful and friendly, some are just a nuisance.Leave the city you start in immediately and head anywhere else, all the griefers and trolls live there to pick on new guys giving us all a bad rep .

Joguei por pouquissimo tempo o jogo, mas foi o suficiente para fazer-me decidir recomendar ou não o game. 

1o. : você só pode ter um personagem, pra mim é até interessante. Imagine um cara com 10 personagens e cada um com uma habilidade especifica, ele poderia jogar sozinho sem comprar nada de ninguém e não movimentar a economia. Mas há a possibilidade de COMPRAR slots extras. O engraçado é que na pagina do site ainda informa que é melhor comprar um slot extra do que ter que lembrar de várias senhas. 

2o. :  A criação de personagem é bem interessante, cada raça com sua especialidade, árvore genealógica, customização... Não tenho do que reclamar disso.

3o. : Os primeiros passos foram um pouco complicados, prefiro jogos que não te expliquem cada coisinha do jogo e te deixem se virar, acho mais desafiadores e interessantes, gostei disso. Mas o que achei complicado foi o sistema de batalha, matar o meu primeiro porquinho foi um sofrimento já que mesmo colado nele a espada não lhe dava dano, tive que bater num porco grande pra conseguir acerta-lo (Mais pra frente no jogo, depois de passar o ""tutorial"", decidi ler um pouco as informações de ajuda e descobri que segurando Alt, você pode dar estocadas e assim eu consegui acertar os animais mais facilmente.).

4o. : O tamanho da cidade é interessante, achei a ideia dela ser grande e com muros altos bem interessantes, a primeiro momento parece tudo muito bonito, até você começar a andar por ela (há outra análise falando sobre essa mesma coisa). Praticamente as quase 3 horas de jogo foram resumidas em tentar sair da cidade para descobrir o que tem do lado de fora, sem contar a parte onde você começa, de um lado descobri uma cidade que aparentemente foi totalmente queimada e a partir de um certo ponto está inundada (?), por ali encontrei uns ""bandits"", que me deram dois hits e eu acabei morrendo. Do outro lado eu encontrei uns animais e uma floresta um pouco mais adiante. Caminhando por lá, encontrei algumas estruturas criadas por outros jogadores, continuei passeando e me deparei com um castelo de outro jogador, ao tentar passar por ele (estava a um distancia consideravelmente distante do castelo) comecei a ser alvejado por algum mercenario contratado pelo jogador, fiquei um pouco confuso do porque ele estava me acertando, afinal eu estava só tentando passar e não cheguei perto do castelo. Passado o perigo, continuei caminhando um pouco e encontrei mar. Decidi então caminhar de volta para a cidade, mas a monotomia, falta de vida naquela floresta e velocidade de corrida do personagem me fizeram deitar pra deixar o personagem descansando e desconectar. 

Outros pontos : Achei interessante poder criar casas, formar até uma cidade em volta da sua casinha... Fui atrás de entender melhor, descobri que você precisa pagar a assinatura pra poder fazer isso. Ok, até que é justo. Pra manter a casa você precisa pagar impostos. Bacana, bem real. Se alguma guilda construir uma cidade pela região e decidir cobrar impostos numa área e sua casa esteja nela, vai ter que pagar impostos pra eles também. Certo, tudo perfeito e lindo até ai, o problema vem com a informação de que pra você poder pagar os impostos você precisa sempre manter a assinatura, se deixar de pagar os impostos sua casa vai levando dano até ela ser destruida (???), seja por ter esquecido de pagar os impostos ou por não ter pago a sua assinatura pra manter a casa em pé. Então jogadores F2P não terão suas próprias casas, ou vivem nas de suas guilds e amigos com assinatura ou vivem como andarilhos. 

Conclusão : Bom, com tudo isso, eu não indicaria o jogo. Pode ser bacana jogar com os amigos, mas não vejo como algo que prenderia por muito tempo quanto jogos de sobrevivencia onde você pode construir sua casa sem pagar uma assinatura. em vários pontos que deixam a desejar e deixam o jogo cansativo.  Enfim, o jogo tinha uma idéia muito boa, mas na minha visão não funcionou tão bem. 

EN - US (Google translator helping a little)

I played for very little time in the game, but it was enough to make me decide to recommend or not to.

1o. : You can only have one character, for me it's interesting. Imagine someone with 10 characters and each with a specific skill, he can  play alone without buying anything from anyone and not moving the economy. But there is the possibility of BUYING extra slots. The funny thing is that on the site page there is the information that it is better to buy an extra slot than having multiple passwords.

2nd. : Character creation is interesting, every breed with its specialty, family tree, customization ... I do not have anything to complain about that.

3rd. : The first steps were a bit complicated, games that do not explain anything and let the player on his own, I find more challenging and interesting, I liked that. But what I found complicated is the battle system, killing my first little pig was a pain because my sword wasn't hitting it, I needed to hit a big pig to get it right (More forward in the game,after the ""tutorial"", I decided to read the help informations and found that holding Alt you can give thrusts and so I managed to hit the animals more easily.).

4th. : The size of the city is interesting, I found the idea of it being big and with high walls very interesting, in the first moment seems very beautiful, until you start walking through it (there is another analysis talking about this same thing). Almost 3 hours of game time I played has been summed up in trying to get out of the city to find out what's on the outside, not to mention the part where you start, on the one hand, I discovered a city that was apparently totally burned out and from a certain point flooded (?), I found some ""bandits"", who gave me two hits and I ended up dying. On the other side I saw some animals and a forest a little further on. Walking there, I found some constructions created by other players, I kept walking and I came across a castle of another player, trying to get through it (I was a distance far from the castle) the mercenaries started attacking me, I was a little confused because of that, I was trying to get by and I did not get near the castle. After the danger, continue walking a little and I found the sea. I then decided to walk back to  town, but a monotony, lack of life in that forest and character running so slow made me lie down to let the character rest and disconnect from the game.

Other points: I found it interesting to be able to create houses, to form even a city around your little house ... I went behind to understand better, I discovered that you have to pay the signature to be able to do this. Okay, it's fair. To keep the house you need to pay taxes. Fine, real good. If a guild builds a city in the area and decides to charge taxes in an area and their home is in it, they will have to pay taxes to them as well. All right, everything perfect and beautiful so far, the problem comes with the information that for you to be able to pay the taxes you always have to keep the signature, if you stop paying the taxes your house will take damage until it is destroyed (???) , Either because he forgot to pay the taxes or because he had not paid his subscription to keep the house standing. So F2P players will not have their own homes, or live in their guilds and signed friends or live as wanderers.

Conclusion: Well, with all this, I would not indicate the game. It may be cool to play with friends, but I do not see it as something that would hold for as long as survival games where you can build your house without paying a subscription. There are several points that leave the game tedious.

I'm a man of my words, so I actually came back and try it out. Unfortunately, my review remains the same. Looking at the release date, this game would have been real awesome back then. The problem is, it has not aged well. Even though the developer is still currently updating it, the updates don't provide a lot of feature that is enough to revitalize the game.

I don't blame the developer, this is a great game. It's just living in a sunset era where the concept no longer appeals to the general MMO market. That, and the appearance of numerous competitors really don't help.

I'm not going to list all the problems with the game in my review, you can easily search those up in all the other negative reviews, e.g. always-on PVP, griefing players, etc.

The thing is, the gameplay is similar to (or is being imitated by, if that makes you feel better) other games like [i]The Elder Scrolls Online[/i] and [i]Conan Exiles[/i], both of which fare better in terms of eye candy because they're new. Of course, Mortal Online is free-to-play, but if you've played the former two games, you'd feel a bit, say, ""empty"" inside because the pace of Mortal Online is horrendously slow.

In all good intentions I cannot recommend Mortal Online to anybody. However, don't take my words for it. If you have a friend who's asking you to join him in the game, by all means go ahead.

When you start off, the game feels dated, ugly and just a big buggy;
But when you get into the game and start to dig, you realize that the depth that it holds compared to other MMOs out there right now is unbelievable. 

This is not a game that you can just jump in and casually play. There are no quests. You are dropped in a world and you make of it what you can. The crafting is amazing. The comunity controls the economy and the weapons you have access to. I have been playing for a week now and I've barely scratched the surface. It took me 3 days just to get comfortable enough to leave town.

I was so sick of every MMO out there being the same. You quest, quest, and quest some more. It is boring. There is no danger anymore.

EVERYTHING in this game feels dangerous; Like a challenge. If you go out with a friend it legitamtely feels like an adventure and it may take you hours or even days to find your way back to town if you are new and you get lost in the wilderness.

Seriously? the devs think that paying over and above the price of a AAA game is fair for this, yet they are very quick to talk about ""how they are a small company"" when it suits...

Nothing difficult or challenging about the game but an awful lot of pointless frustrations and bugs make the experience totally unenjoyable.

I wouldn't describe the game as ""F2p"" you get an trial with limited skills, this is fair enough right?

Normally yeah but you litterally cannot do anything with the skills you have available, want to craft weapons? well you can craft a certain type of weapon at a skill cap, trying to explore the crafting system and advancing the skills, still unable to make anything better than the initial ""worn short sword"" that you get, simply because of the skill caps, It should be advertised as a limited trial because that's what it is, if you've more money than sense, then dive right in, the devs will love you.

Such a long boring grind to collect materials, to extract a material from that, in order to extract another material from that in order to, well you get the idea, but at each step you need more skill points in order to extract the next material in ever decreasing amounts. The skills race up the way very quickly, an hour or so had me at max atributes, good right? well no, totally nothing to work towards except a massive load of material gathering only to find out that you need not have bothered. You're still unable to make anything better than the rags and short sword you're able to make, unless you've got a few toons.

In order to make iron, you need to mine ore, turn that ore into something, turn what you get from that into something else, each time using a catalyst that makes no sense putting water directly into a forge for example, you just don't do it, water puts fire OUT, totally unintuative. then once you've got all of that you need to mix it in with more of the ore that you got all of that stuff from. And if you're able to do that with your one free toon then THAT IS ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO and you won't be able to do it to any extent hat can get you anywhere in the game.

It's not even a good mining and wood cutting simulator.

Let's try combat, one of the poorest AI's I have ever encountered, some mobs will happily stand and let you swing at their head, others will run past several players and attack you for no reason, you can add people to your friends list but there is no way to productively play with them as far as I can tell because anytime you try to help them fight something your weapons auto sheathe and you get the message ""You cannot attack an innocent player, please click"" 

Awesome eh? you try to help your friend and end up standing in the middle of battle with no weapon drawn, it's THAT poorly thought out.

So still thinking that the concept of the game is a good one, you look into the subscription options, you figure, ok it's free, you need to subscribe to get the most.

This is also the worst subscription plan I've ever encountered in a few of decades of gaming,

When you subscribe you get access to stealing and to more skill points, also the cap is removed and you can go up to 100, well that's all you get, no extra character slots, ""stealing"" basically you are untouchable, you can outrun any free player, you can outrun the guards, the only warning you get when you're being stolen from is a text message in a chat flooded with spam.

So you pay your £10 a month sub and you can finally maybe do one thing to a decent skill level, you then have to buy more character slots, if you don't want to be this guy who just stands in the one spot click a button repeatedly.

So for example you wanted a crafter to suport your fighter, that's £40 right out of the bat, not counting that you need to keep paying the monthly sub. Why £40? Well you need your fighter toon, your armour toon, your weaponsmith toon AND your materiel harvesting toon, allthough you will probably need two of those due to the uninspired crafting, they've tried to make it ""interesting"" it's not, most of it's pointless, all of it is unintuitive.

So that's £160 just for your years sub and character slots, to maybe be able to do something effectively in the game.

Not only that but it's the same for anyone you want to play with.

Do the devs HONESTLY think that's a fair price for what you get for it? well apparently, the ususal stuff about ""small companies"" etc, Well hows about these ""small companies"" only take on what they can afford rather than passing the cost onto the ever decreasing player numbers? 

How about they actually have a long good look at themselves and what they are asking people to play because for that money, I could buy a holiday in Sweden, never mind play a very poorly executed game from there.

The information about all of this is very limited as well, you go onto their wiki for information about a book and the wiki simply says the same text as the book does,

The only good thing I have to say about the game was how quickly a GM responded to a ""stuck"" request, it's totally possible to walk through the side of a bridge and fall into water that you can't get out of, even if you did have the skill points to put in swimming.

This is only one of many, many bugs and glitches that I have encountered in just a short while, I've had expensive skill books simply ""stop reading"" and vanish, I've had skill points dissapear, items dissapear, 400 skill points vanished over night, can't even be bothered opening a ticket about it, the game is just that poor.",1486835055,1486835055,False,5,0,0.497345209121704102,2,True,False,False,False,,,

К этому ещё стоит добавить излишне усложнённую систему создания вещей и абсолютное отсутствие внутриигрвой экономики. Что и послужило основным поводом отложить данную игру. Дальше же пойдёт обьяснение чем же эта игра по настоящему больна.

Если вы хотите помогать другим, общаться, переживать приключения вместе с друзьями и получать удовольствие от игры, то есть всё то что вы обычно делаете в остальных MMORPG, то эта игра не для вас. Единственное развлечение которое можно найти на ОБШИРНЫХ просторах ""Murder onlain"" это убийства игроков-новичков и смерть от более злостных убийц. Если же вы, вдруг решили заняться чем либо другим в этой игре (обозначаю цифрой) то всё пойдёт по следующим сценариям (буквы):
1. Вы пошли на охоту против сильных существ чтобы продать их когти, зубы, мясо и заработать деньги на новый лук.
а) Вы преуспели и обарботав более 50 трупов существ своим ножом для разделки, потратив примерно час времени и заработать денег чтобы купить лук который нанесёт на 1 единицу урона больше. Вы решаете повторить свой заход чтобы заработать больше денег на новый лук. (Повторить вариант прибавив дополнительные параметры)
б) Вас на обратном пути встретила группа Игроков-разбойников и забрала все ваши вещи, лук, добычу и вашу жизнь. (обнуление параметров)

2. Вы решили создать хорошую оружие и броню для своего друга лучника чтобы вы вдвоём могли сразить тех разбойников и сделать мир чуточку лучше. Для этого вы выкапываете все пни, все камни которые можете найти в охраняемой NPC зонах и за два дня ""игры"" и потратив все свои очки развития на ""Множество разннобразных"" навыков создания одного лука и сделав своего персонажа абсолютно бесполезным в бою. Вы таки завершаете своё оружие мести.
а) Ваш друг лучник сумел с помощью созданых вами вещей отбиться от разбойника потому что разбойник был один и не имел такого хорошего друга. (повторить вариант с новыми параметрами)
б) Разбойник был не один. Они забрали все те вещи которые добыл твой друг и все вещи которые ты для него создал себе. Твоё оружие мести попало в руки зла. (Обнуление параметров). 

Думаю этого достаточно. Как вы видете в итоге вы всё равно прийдёте к выводу что стремиться что либо создавать бессмысленно. Легче забрать это у других приложив минимум усилий и получая прибыль ничем не рискуя. Если же вы как и я по моральным принципам не можете приять этот факт то - поздравляю, вы разумный человек, и в этой игре вам делать нечего. Оставьте эту игру маньякам и садистам, пусть пар выпускают, отрываясь друг на друге.

where do i start? well this is  guess is the new version of the review because apparenly my old one was unhelpful according to people


ok well i havent played the game in a sec, but im getting the urge to come back... i just need to get my pc fixed :D


what is this game? this game is a full loot sandbox where you can do whatever you want.

And people do what they want, run around naked taking your shit if they want too :D

why full loot? well people like a challenge, and the ultimate challenge is to be punished hard for the mistakes you make, this is where full loot multiplayer comes in.

do i like this game? oh yeah i do, and no i just hate it to the ends of the earth...
why so mixed? well its easy to rage, ""this guy came in in op armor and juust one shot me and took my sword!
hahaha the times... but i met some of the best people on this game.. some of the worst, there is no global chat

its a REALISTIC hardcore game, all local chat :D. but lucky you there is a help chat to ask for help. it wont last forever though.

next is the game actually free? yes and no, its free but restricted, unless you subscibe. look at my hours, all of it has been done as f2p. just be smart. its a game of skill not who has the best stuff.

how ""sandbox is it?"". why what a handsome question! you can literaly do anything, feel like farming undead in tindrem to the end of days, go ahead. want to explore and get lost forever till you get back randomly? do that as well. want to craft? as f2p you are limited, but you can sell to other f2ps! want to tame and breed mounts? do that as well! 

another thing to note is this game has no official map, so itll be hard to explore without getting lost :D

This is a truly amazing game. You will die and you will lose stuff but as you learn the game you will die less and make more. you just got to remember to only travel and carry things you can replace. alot of people who try the game never leave the starter town. they die and quit. its not a easy game. the world is massive and has loads of places to explore and you can have Player to player experiences like no other game. 

look for a guild. the game doesnt just tell you were to get things. joining a guild is a great way to get knowledge from other players and become viable to defend yourself and make things for yourself sooner.


10/10 the greatest MMO ive played. i have way more hours in this game than steam says as i rarely play it with steam open or even use steam and have played it for years before it was on steam. there is bi-weekly bug fixes and it has some of the friendliest Devs ive seen in a game

the Lead Programmer Sebastian is The Man

give it a try and dont just stay in the first town. explore naked. visit towns. talk to people. dont let the griefers and player killers get you down. skill up join people and practice so you can avoid and kill them.

--------------------

Questions: 

1.  Are you tired and/or burnt out on all the MMORPGs out, or coming out, on the market?

2.  Do you want to play a game where EVERYTHING you do is an accomplishment and reinvigorates that sense of discovery you had when you played your first MMORPG?

3.  Does the idea of an open loot system (you lose everything you are carrying when you die) fill you with a sense of excitement and adventure?

--------------------

Overview

Mortal Online is a Fantasy Sandbox MMORPG that takes familiar elements from games like Ultima Online and Runescape, and takes them to a whole new level.  The entire game is played in first-person, and there is no functionality to change the view to third-person.  All combat and actions within the game are based off of targeting with your reticle, so if you want to hit a boar in the head then you need to aim for it's head.  Character progression is based on skill points rather than levels, and you only have so many skill points to use.  You aren't safe anywhere, not even in cities, so always be on your guard, but don't turn into a jerk, just be wary.

--------------------

Skills

Skills are broken down into a ton of different categories that are based on Parent and Child relationships, so a player would need to learn Armor Crafting (to a certain skill level) before he/she can learn Soft Armor Crafting.  Many skills you can begin learning just by attempting to do them, such as chopping down a tree or mining for ore, but other skills will need to be learned by reading skill books.  Skill books can be obtained from Libraries (for a price) or from the Auction House, players can begin reading these (some can take 8 hours or more) and the reading timer will continue to countdown when the player logs off.  

I mentioned that you have a finite number of skill points to use, and in the beginning, you will burn through over half of these pretty quickly.  Don't panic!  You can lock skills that you don't want to increase anymore and you can even decrease skills you aren't going to use to get the skill points back to use on something else.  This can be confusing at first, but this really allows the player total freedom in choosing what their character does without letting characters become masters of everything at once.

--------------------

Combat

Combat is based on using your aiming reticle and blocking or dodging the attacks of your enemies.  I haven't done much of this yet, besides slaughtering herds of innocent pigs, but I think it is very engaging, sort of a melding between Skyrim and Mount & Blade combat, but better.

--------------------

Magic

No comment at all on this, but it is very in depth, with required components for spells.  Healing magic, for instance, can require water.

--------------------

Crafting

The crafting in this game is intense.  I repeat: the crafting in this game is INTENSE.  There are spreadsheets and emulators online that help players calculate the required components to create other components to finally (maybe) create the item they want to create.  There is more than one way to make a particular piece of armor, and some components will make the end item heavier or cooler etc.  I think this is an amazing part of the game, but it is not for the faint of heart.

--------------------

PvP

Mortal Online works on a flagging system.  Here is the breakdown:

Fledgling: Yellow
Innocent: Blue
Criminal: Grey
Murderer: Red
Hidden Criminal: Grey with Blue Stripe

Basically, if you do something negative to someone then you will be flagged Grey, unless that person was already Grey.  The flagging system is one of the most important parts of MO to understand, so check out this Beginner's Guide for more information : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519329793.

--------------------

Conclusion

Mortal Online is a really in-depth game, but it is most certainly not for the casual player, and I don't mean the time-casual player, but the player that is more instant gratification.  If you want your cake and eat it too then this game is not for you, but if you want to bake your cake, eat some of your cake, then sneak around to hide your cake in the bank until you can share it with your guild mates then this game is for you!  

You can try the game for free, and all F2P Accounts can use skills up to skill level 60.  What that means is that you can raise your skills above skill level 60, but you can only use the skill at skill level 60.  I highly recommend subscribing to the game if you are 8 hours in and enjoying it.  The subscription costs less than other MMORPGs, and it is well worth it to support such an awesome game.

--------------------

Grimstein's Personal Tips

1.  Buy the Reading Skill Book (yes, that's an actual skill book) and begin reading that right away.  That will allow you to read other skill books more efficiently.

2.  Find a Guild on the official MO forums.

3.  Get out of the starting city.

4.  Turn up your graphics and other options as high as you can.

5.  Only keep what you immediately need on you.  Bank your money until you need to buy something, and keep your skill books in the bank until you want to start reading them.

6.  If you are going on a long journey, such as to join up with your new guild, bring along some food and bring everything you can with you.  Banks are localized, and if you store something in Tindrem, you will have to go back to Tindrem to get it.

--------------------

I hope my review helped you make an informed decision.  There is so much more to Mortal Online than I touched upon in this review, but I hope it gives you a taste of what's in store if you play.  Good luck, and I hope to see you in Nave!

It offers freedom, exploration, PvE, PvP, world building, great graphics, open world. A true sandbox for an MMO, and the most immersive game i've played. It has a STEEP learning curve but that's what makes it great, it is not an easy game.

No levels, just a skillpool you decide how to use and the forced first person was jarring at first but it really adds to immersion and now I can't live without it.

The game does have it quirks but its much like the Elder Scrolls series in that it comes with the territory. If you like the elder scrolls and can handle the hardcore nature, you will love this game.

It can be harsh and can be frustrating but is more so rewarding and fun overcoming challenges. I've played many MMOs and this game offers a unique experience that can't be replicated.

In this games current state I was just unable to play it. And I'm going to explain why in the classic Pros And Cons format. So let's start with the pros.

+The game is clearly similar to ArcheAge where it's objective is to give the player as much freedom as possible. That includes professions, building houses, BUILDING KINGDOMS and rallying with other players. Not enough online games do this and it's instantly won my favor for this alone.

+ There's actual nudity. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Definitely didn't see this coming from a Free To Play game. In fact it gives you the option to toggle it in the preferences menu. This game isn't rated PG as far as I'm aware and I'm sure there's probably a sex scene somewhere in here too. 

+The character customization is basic however kinda detailed. You know how in GTA Online it has you pick a mother and a father for your base character generation? This game has something similar except it generates your base stats and race. I thought that was pretty cool and worth mentioning here.

Now for the cons. And if you've noticed, I only mentioned three pros. I'll explain why later.

-In order to play this game at a playable framerate I actually had to turn all settings down in the pop-up menu. The first time I played the game the framerate was genuinely abysmal. I thought I wasn't even going to get as far as the tutorial. This isn't right though since my PC has enough power to run Crysis at a playable speed which is a game known for pouring 90% of it's money into the graphics. (Still a good game tho.) So essentially you need a super computer to play with decent graphics. Hope that Youtube careers working out for you, Youtubers.

-The combat is... bad. Not bad in a way as when you attack someone you have to deal with a cool down on all abilities or anything giving the enemy ample time to hit you. It's like Skyrim's melee system only done poorly. I don't even know about the magic or ranged system.

-And here's why I only mentioned 3 pros. The game is honestly kind of bland. Not bland in like a Runescape sort of way where everything from the graphics to the gameplay is trying to get you to stop playing the game. I mean it's bland in a way that dissolves my interest to continue playing it. Obviously the games set in a gritty Witcher-esque world considering you encounter asshole characters in the tutorial right along side discovering this game features nudity, which under different circumstances would rope me right in to continue playing. But the problem here is that it was obviously developed by devs who probably haven't worked on an MMO before. You can tell just from looking at the detail of the tutorial stage. It's way to open and the tutorial ASSAULTS you. It doesn't really do a good job explaining things either. It pretty much just gives you the basics, pats you on the butt then expects you to figure things out from there.

Do I reccomend the game? Maybe not in it's current state but definitely as a game in itself. I genuinely wanna come back to this game once things have been sorted out and it stops being clunky and forcing me to look into a bland mess of a tutorial. I want to play this game once it's more able to handle hightened graphics and I want to see what it could turn into. It's very, VERY rare for an MMO to give you as much freedom as to see people naked which is why even known it my experience was kind of a mess I WANT this game to do good which is why it's getting a thumbs up from me.

Here's hoping this game goes places...

[b]EDIT[/b]
So I tried playing it again and I missed a few things.

+I love the Oblivion approach they took to the stats system where doing things like simply running will increase your speed and endurance. That was really neat

-The community is awful. While I was trying to grind walkers in the graveyard there was an asshole clipping into an enemy I was attacking trying to get me to hit him. And I did. And then he killed me. In town. Alright I'm going to get this right out of the way and say THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN SOLVED. Simply just dedicate a server to PVE where you can't damage fellow players and dedicate another to PVP where you can. That way when an asshole player clips into an enemy I'm attacking I don't accidentally hit him. And nobody will be able to attack me. I get that their trying to make a game maybe similar to ARK or something but... no actually no I'm not forgiving this. If this game doesn't have dedicated servers for different types of vs then I'm never playing it again.

Do I still reccomend the game? Yes. But I ain't playing it anytime soon unless these issues are solved.",1485572275,1485697487,True,8,0,0.489173829555511475,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Quick words of advice: YOU WONT ALWAYS RUN THAT SLOW, FINISH THE TUTORIAL, READ THE BULLETINS IN THE HELP TAB, READ BOOKS, LOOK UP GUIDES AND BUILDS, JOIN A GUILD TO MEET PEOPLE, DONT ATTACK THE GREY GUY, IF YOU DIE DONT USE THE NEAREST PRIEST BUTTON, RUN TO ONE OF THE RED BEAMS IN THE SKY, TRUST NO ONE, IF YOU DIE, KNOW THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS REPLACEABLE. Last but not least, give the game a chance. It still needs work and there is a huge community of players who need your help to continue to give the game life. There is a whole new world aside from what you have already experienced or are going to experience when you first log into the game. First thing you should do: learn how to play the game. Get a grasp of what skills are available. You're opportunities are endless. You just have to get out there and look for them.",1485528337,1485528337,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hmm... let me see.  It is a lot of things... good, bad, and down right frustrating, it can be one of the best times you have had and one of the most mind numbingly boring times.   But overall it is a really decent open world sandbox.  

I have played Mortal Online off and on since Block B of beta, I can say that the 1300+ hours of gameplay recorded by Steam is no where near the amount of time I have in this game.  While I would not call it a gem, it is a real find, and the original open world sandbox first person PVP full loot game.  It came out in a time when everyone was terrified of doing something different, a small group of mostly incompetent coders got together and formed Star Vault and created Mortal Online.   Which for the first year was absolute crap as SV worked tirelessly to fix the millions of problems the game had.   After 7+ years they have about 900k of those problems fixed and the game works 95% of the time.   Which is better than most games on STEAM.....    The community is mildly toxic, very PVP oriented, and not affraid of telling you where to shove it if you annoying them.  

Overall Mortal Online is at the very least worth the download and free to play perma-trial time.  Who knows you may like it... but if you dont, its free.

First person
Open world (No instances)
Fantasy based 
Online Multiplayer
Realtime, directional combat
Full loot

For the longest time I could not find such a game, a quest that to me seemed strange because I thought everyone would love this experience.

One day, I found Mortal Online.

At first, I did not like the game, I only saw it with my blanketed, jaded gamer eyes. 
It took me a long time and a good group of people to really get me into the game, and even then it took another year before I started playing seriously.

I now play mortal every day, and have done for a long time. 
I only play other games when the server goes down for its daily restart.

This game is not like other games, it is a hobby. 
This game will require you to invest a large portion of your time into it, but what it will give back is something no other game that exists can offer.

If you have the patience, the time and the drive to seek adventure, you will find it in Mortal Online. 

Everywhere you look, there is complex systems hiding behind what may seem to be simple mechanics at first. 
Systems you can discover and learn, recipes and methods, secrets you can choose to share with others or keep for yourself.

The combat in this game is truley skill based, it will take a long time for you to master it. 
When you do, you will gain respect from other players, and fear from your foes.

This game is a living world, everything in it has substance. 
Choose to interact with it or not, however if you do you may find yourself lost in its vast possibilities and opportunities.

to Mortal Online.

I say this because there are those who have played this game for quite a number of years now and have come to love it, and I am one of them. If you want depth, freedom and complexity in a truly hardcore and unforgiving world, there isn’t another title out there like it that I know of.

My hours played here on Steam may be few, but that's because I've only recently switched to playing the game through Steam instead of the old launcher. I first played this game way back in 2010 then left for the most part, until September 2013 when I returned for good and have been playing it ever since as my preferred MMORPG over all others.

At first glance, this game may not seem like much, but once you’ve earned a decent amount of gold, crafted a set of gear for yourself, made a few friends and seen the world outside Tindrem city, you begin to appreciate just how vast and intricate this game really is. Then you realise that you’ve only just scratched the surface; there is the player-driven economy, guilds and individual players going about their business, and much more.

You can be any character you want, and pursue whatever activity you wish. If you’ve ever played The Elder Scrolls or Ultima Online, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. There are no traditional quest hubs that have you moving from one region to the next as you level up. There are, however, plenty of players who may have something that needs done or need help with, and if you’re interested then you can lend your services and make your mark in the world in a meaningful way. That is just one of the myriad of ways you can keep yourself busy and occupied, all it takes is a little imagination and creative thinking. Even after playing this game for over three years, every time I login there is always something for me to do.

I could keep writing a long review but it would probably be best if I said that this game is not for the faint-hearted or those who don’t know how a sandbox game is meant to be played. If you’ve never seen this game in all its glory, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

At the very instant you finish the tutorial you are introduced to the wide open world that is known as Mortal Online. 

Firstly it is worth mentioning that there is a small group of players that sit outside the gates of the tutorial city waiting for new, ill-equipped players to appear so they can gang up on you, overwhelm, and kill you within seconds. I did not discover this from experience as much as I had people scream at me not to exit the city because apparently a clan regularly camps the ""noob city"" 
The community is helpful but at the same time rude and completely annoying. When I logged in the first thing I saw in the chatbox was about 6 people comparing the size of their character's junk, but we'll get onto that later. If you ever have the displeasure of hearing the barely functional speech option in the game, and manage to understand anything in the game aside from static, you will realize most of the players who are on this game are 12 years old or younger. Trust me, adults don't speak like the cast of Sesame street normally.

On to the real deal, game mechanics. It's a weird puzzle of interesting concepts that are executed in horrible ways. The game uses the unreal engine, which has given us rather excellent looking games such as Red Orchestra 2 and Killing Floor, among many others. Unfortunately, the graphics in this game are far more akin to one of the games I compare it to, Mount and Blade, but lack all the features that make Mount and Blade interesting. The game's combat mechanics are more similar to Chivalry and Mount and Blade, but unlike both of those games, come off as clunky and broken in many cases, with the so-called emphasis on enemy weak points being completely pointless because striking the head of the enemy always does the most damage anyway. But this is a MMORPG, surely there are better features in it than just the combat and graphics? The game has interesting movement animations, and is completely in first person, but not immersive enough to become interesting. Permadeath isn't actually permadeath, it's just generalized respawn timers and a ""spirit realm"" that offers absolutely nothing to do while you wait. 

How do you die? well that's simple. Steal in front of a guard and he instantly hits you with a lightning bolt which will kill you no matter what you have. I tested this theory by grinding undead corpse heads until I had the best armor available, and he still kills you in 2 hits. He hits instantly, and there is no way of blocking magic explained in the tutorial. 

RPG mechanics? You learn new skills by reading books, they give you a starter book to read after you finish the tutorial. It takes 6 days real time to read the book, and there is no way of speeding up the process. There are features that are locked including max skills for ""paying"" players.

I left the game before even trying to do real PvP because the PvE in the game was already so horrifyingly bad that it felt appropriate to quit. 

Never play this game, leave it to be one of the dead MMORPG games that fade into obscurity like the cancer they are.",1485202216,1485202216,False,8,1,0.524635255336761475,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Хочу в двух словах рассказать о такой противоречивой игре, как Mortal Online. Играл я в нее года три назад, потом забросил, сейчас что-то снова заставило в нее вернуться. Не знаю насколько затянет и затянет ли вообще.

Начну с хорошего. Игра уникальна по своему геймплею, не смотря на всю его корявость и убогость графики, игра затягивает своей свободой. Вы вольны делать все, что захотите, хотите печь пироги? пеките! Хотите убивать других игроков, убивайте! Хочется воровать? Воруйте. Мир игры огромен, я и сейчас с восторгом вспоминаю, как исследовал его, находил небывалые по красоте ущелья, бродил по горным хребтам, по колено в снегу и выживал в пустынях. Монстры на любой вкус, есть безумно сложные, которых тяжело одолеть и от которых проблематично убежать, есть слабенькие, на которых приятно качаться. Мир в игре живой, он живет своей жизнью, вы в нем обычный персонаж... От которого по началу ничего не зависит. :) 
Теперь о минусах...
Много багов, игра тормозит на моей, далеко не самом слабом ПК. Из нового особенно ничего не заметил, открыли новый континент, но зачем? В игре не так много людей, что бы открывать новый, пустой континент...
Я ожидал от игры другого развития, новых интересных скиллов из ультимы онлайн, например яд... Это была очень клевая фишка в УО. Ожидал так же, что переделают систему тайминга в игре, так как считаю что не совсем правильно, когда прирученое тобой животное при смерти пропадает навсегда и его нет возможности воскресить, даже за очень дорого. Разработчики стремятся к хардкору, но мне такое стремление не совсем понятно... Ладно фулл лут, во время ПВП, я считаю это правильным, но добавлять хардкора в интерфейс как-то глупо... Воры... Отдельная тема, в городе полным полно воров у банка, которые могут легко свиснуть все, что вы заработали... Тоже сомнительно... Игра которая на 70% в городе состоит из воров, ну как то не айс. Магия... магии в общем то нет, есть пятерочка заклинаний, которые работают через одно место. то есть лучники стреляющие как пулемет и почти не прицеливаясь, это норма для ПВП игры, а вот магия это читерство, которое надо ужимать. :)

Игра не дружелюбна к новичкам. Боль и страдания ожидают новичков везде. :)

И да, мне не нравится ПВП в игре в том виде, в каком оно есть сейчас... Бегают друг за другом два калеки, сначала один за другим, потом наоборот. Смысл отбежать в то время, когда у тебя мало ХП и отхелится, потом вернуться в бой... Посмотрите видеоролики, не впечетляет.

ПВП ниче так если только ты найдешь новичка голого, то его можно убить за 1-2 удара... Вот и все ПВП пожалуй.
Да и скорости перемещения персонажей в ПВП какие то высокие... Нет хардкора, есть экшн, который не особенно впечетляющий.

В общем какие то противоречивые мнения у меня об игре сложились, но я пожалуй скажу, что игра мне нравится. И я очень надеюсь, что игра будет развиваться и становиться интересней и красивее. Главное, что бы не было застоя и что бы разработчики игры вкладовали свои силы в действительно стоящие нововведения, а не в пустоту.

Сейчас так мало игр, похожих на старую добрую Ультиму Онлайн, а так хочется, что бы такие игры были.",1485155516,1485155516,True,7,0,0.524603426456451416,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Devs refuse to do whats good for the game and are now adding fancy stuff even know theres been problemtic bugs since day 1

-PvP consists of nothing fun because the game doesnt have the player base because the devs refuse to update the game into unreal 4 or buy ads for the game

-Keeps making new stuff for mages yet nothing new for the rest of the roles in the game

-Building and siegeing are both aids and doesnt matter because the GMs let people exploit without punishment

-Dev legit nerfed a my gold income even know I was the only one doing it and wasnt making that much off of it 

-Removing the rest of the fun stuff from the game that is currently keeping the game even alive

-Game is Controled by a single guild who exploits because the devs and gms are scared of them considering they are half the games player base

-I generally just want the game to die at this point.

*Old Review*
Mortal online is not an easy game to get into
The only reason I am suggesting people to get into it now instea of before is the fact that they are acutally now working on the game very hard
Instead of just adding new ""fancy stuff"" they are actually working on the game's bugs and messed up parts
It feels good that they have started to clean up the game

Now that's out of the way this game is hard for new people to get into
because most of the new people are simpled minded and try to kill whoever they can, 
Try looking at the bigger picture don't run around tindrem for your whole time playing trying to get cheap kills here and there
Try Talking to the players using help chat, learn how to make money and skill up your character. If you havent found a guild by then you could always try the forums, Which also have all the guides you neeed for pretty much everything. 

I wouldnt suggest taking advice for anyone who hasnt played this game longer then a few 100 hours because you acutally need to spend 100 hours just on learning the basics of how this game works, even with that said it's not as complex as I make it out to be, it's just the newer generation of people don't tend to understand games like this.

Pros:
-El concepto es brillante. Es el primer sandbox que veo tan completo. Un mundo en el que exploras, construyes, creas tu equipo, domesticas animales, cocinas...todo lo que puedas imaginar tiene cabida en Mortal Online.

-Absoluta libertad para hacer lo que quieras. Puedes ser un mercader si eso es lo que te motiva y recorrer el mundo con tu burro cargado de materias primas con las que comerciar. Estarías como una maldita cabra, pero podrías hacerlo.

-En cierto sentido es un survival, ya que si mueres pierdes tu equipo. Le da un toque muy interesante, aunque aumenta mucho la hostilidad, tanto del juego como de los jugadores.

-La banda sonora está muy bien.

Contras:
-Habilidades capadas para quienes no paguen suscripción. Esto afecta tanto a tus habilidades de combate como a las de crafteo. Está muy feo hacer algo así, ya que debería ser el mayor premio para quien decida meter horas en el juego siguiendo el modelo que le venga en gana, tanto si paga como si no. No apoyo para nada este modelo de negocio y creo que los adeptos de este juego, que lo hay y no son precisamente pocos, gastarían gustosament su dinero por skins y similares. No se puede abrir una brecha tan importante entre los propios jugadores.

-Es un juego tremendamente complejo. Si de verdad quieres inmersión, lo recomiendo, pero más vale que te unas a alguna guild, veas vídeos en Internet y consultes guías. Porque el juego requiere tiempo...y lo peor es que el tiempo que inviertes no tiene ninguna recompensa.

-Es absolutamente necesario que crees tu personaje dentro de unos parámetros exactos dependiendo de la raza que escojas. Algo que límita mucho la libertad que parece tener al no haber clases ni niveles. Nada más unirme a una guild me instaron a crearme un nuevo personaje, lo que puede ser una buena tocada de pelotas si ya has invertido unas horas en mejorar el que te has hecho felizmente siguiendo tus propios (y equivocados) instintos.

-Los gráficos son muy mejorables. Diría que me recuerdan a Oblivion, pero sólo en los vídeos. En el gameplay está más cerca de Morrowind.

Conclusión: al ser ""free to play"" no vas a perder nada por probarlo (bueno sí, tiempo). Creo que, por lo general y aunque particularmente no pueda colocarme en ninguno de los extremos, es de esos juegos que o lo amas o lo odias. Y si lo amas, puedes amarlo mucho.

If you have played similar games you will have no problem getting yourself sorted. Finish the initial tutorial to get a skill pack to suit the part of the game you are most curious about or you'll lose that opportunity for good. Your skills are capped in free mode, but there is plenty of room to master the basics. I chose a crafter skill pack and after one trash set of armor and goofing around for a few hours I went back and crafted decent entry level armor on my first try. Reading books to learn skills is VERY time consuming, so choose what to read carefully. There is even a ""reading"" skill. Just being able to use certain materials requires basic ""lore"" knowledge, so that would be a good start for crafting. A specific combat book on ""avoiding knockdowns"" will improve multiple skills and take forever to read, so stick with tiny gains in basic stuff so you can learn enough on your own to decide where to focus your reading time.

The graphics are slightly old and not the best, but graphics don't make games bad. There are a few bugs here and there. But for the most part, this game is extremely fun.

Overall this game is entertaining, and you will love it, if you care to spend time with it. The reason it has so many bad reviews is because most of the players don't leave the first town; Tindrem. The Graveyard, where most new players go, is filled with other players who want money too. But it can sometimes turn into a huge PvP battlefield. Criminals and Murderers sometimes go in there for fun. It is extremely annoying to everyone there. So I recommend new players going on MortalOnlineMap.info and using the map to go to Fabernum.

Just want to say, this game has improved so much over the years, it used to be clunky unoptomized with bugs out the ass, but it keeps getting better w/ each year, Star vault has really stepped up there game, def worth a look if this sort of niche genre is for you.

Recently had a full texture overhaul for player characters, and world textures.


Pros:
Massive open world
Huge map
Player Driven econemy
True Sandbox
Full Loot PvP
Extensive Crafting systems more indepth then you have likely ever seen in another MMO
Consistantly updated every few months, big content patches a few times a year
ever expanding immersive world, full of lore.
No hand holding, when they say ""hardcore sandbox MMO' they mean it.
Politically Driven


Cons:
Incredibly Steep learning curve.
Huge timesink ( You will often find your self loseing 6 hours completing tasks you had set for yourself for the day.)
Unforgiving community (its hard to find the good guys in a land of cutthroats and griefers)
Still some minor bugs, but they mostly smoothed everything out in comparrison to the old days.
Not solo player friendly, expect to do a lot of networking.

Pros
-World is massive
-Tons of crafting
-Decent character build/customization
-Decent combat system

Cons
-Towns are huge NPC's scattered for the most part
-HUGE learning curve (very small information/play instruction for new player)
-^ This one would not be so bad if the community was helpful in the slightest. (they are mostly troll child like players)
-The game is dying quickly
-What remains of the community is a small few of highly invested players (Vets) who take much pride in killing new players and destroying any hope of this game surviving.

In closing - I have very few hours due to the PK players who refuse to let new players even get into the graveyards (Starting zone newby area, key for learning combat and early farm for gear and books you will need to progress.)
I would love to delve into the game and see what I could achieve but the game death has left the community bitter and troll strong. 
For a free to play I do recommend a try at this game if you enjoy having your first few hours of grinding, crafting, learning wiped out in a volley of super bored vet bambi slaughter.

It stays true to the RPG component of the genre - unlike certain titles that produce highly streamlined, monotonous, instant-gratification gameplay which seem to hand out gear and don't rely on a community aspect at all. All things in the game are player created and player run - the gear, the politics, many of the buildings (castles, towers, etc) throughout the world, even. I must say, if you're a very casual player you may not see the point in putting time into this game. If you are easily frustrated by being attacked by another player, this is not the game for you. If you are interested in a very challenging world where you must learn to defend yourself and your party from any possible lingering threat, where nothing comes easy, and where a battle could break out anytime, you've found what you're looking for.

I would liken Mortal Online to Ultima Online in many ways. The game has a complex skills system which allows you to build a character the way you would like it built, and leveling is much like it is in Skyrim where by performing actions, you gain the levels. The world is a largely open-ended sandbox, allowing players to do whatever it is they desire, assuming they have the necessary ability, and guilds and solo-players alike wage war and create conflict anywhere in the world they see fit. Crafting has so many different levels to it, and you will find that it is best to rely on other characters to fill in some of the gaps that you are missing when it comes to combining components of each individual crafting system (from people who took different skill line paths than you) to produce something greater. Collaboration is very much key in many components of this game, which I think is vital to an MMO's success. 

Some things unique to Mortal Online that may entice you: 
-Mounted Archery (Mounted combat in general)
-Taming of beasts/mounts and breeding of those beasts to produce better creatures
-Dark open world dungeon delves (that anyone might join on or interfere with)
-Graded hitboxes (where you hit your target and what they are wearing there is taken into account instead of damage being weighed against all armor worn)
-Fully lootable player corpses (with the exception of their banks)
-Pickpocketing other players (pay to play only feature, but makes sense)
-Many secrets hidden around the world that can teach your character strange and powerful forms of magic. 

Understand that while the game is free to play, and while free to play characters are capable of achieving plenty, free to play characters are limited to 60% of the maximum efficacy that skills can provide (60/100 effective points in skills is your maximum). I would strongly suggest giving the game a try, since it is free to play, and if you're interested in seeing the heights you can achieve with maximum results enabled, subscribe and join a guild to play with.",1482525858,1511492982,True,4,0,0.525843441486358643,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I repeat I wanted to heal him at to top it all off when I finally ticked the box and healed him suddenly a guy with a huge sword came running at me and instantly killed me and then proceeded to kill my buddy.

Stay away from this game. I had to play from multiple accounts from other friends too btw so I can properly test it as it only gives you ONE character roll at the start. So I have a lot more hours on the game all up.

It is a subscription based game, and does not offer the quality it should for a sub. The game is worth around a single 30 dollar purchase, if that.

Its garbage.

The notion of ""it gets better later on"" is really getting on my nerves at this point. If I have to spend 100 hours for your ""better"" part, then thanks but no thanks.

Aside from that, it is an open world RPG, is it not? The site advertises ""next gen graphics"" and content, and the freedome to do what you want in the game and create your own story.

Nope, you have to be part of a guild. The world lacks any society structure that actually works ore resembles anything of immersion. From the fact that people roam around doing whatever they please (very welcoming, even though I was barely bothered and left alone knowing the system does not account for half the things in the game is sad) to directions been given in exact meters. ""The gate is 417 meteres north west from the well, derp!"".

Everything about the immersion to this game completely turned me off, and I wanted it so bad to be good I simply could not stand even a single minute longer without ANYTHING of the first dozen of hours giving me some form of interest.

It gets better later on? Hardly worth it, if I am to play 100hrs to get to finally be excited about something in the game, then thanks but no thanks.

As an RPG player, I also would not recommend this title at all as it truly does not give you a role playing sense of rolling a character as you see fit.

The only ""hardcore"" thing about this game is that others can kill you all day long. This is not hardcore, its exploitation. Street Fighter or a top end fighting game is hard, you need to learn it and it aint filled with cheap sh!t. This is just a pointless experience.

The graphics are the last thing that could of saved it for me. In hopes that it could create an immersion in a world that I could actually love. At which point, I would have stayed longer and tried my way in it. What for though? When even the graphics look like Oblivion and a game from 10 years ago. Animations are clunky, combat is even clunkier (loved seeing ""top tier"" friends duel each other, they looked like a bunch of unrealistic tarts going at it)... I can't find any redeeming quality in this game other than the artwork and the detail put into the lore (sort of, like the races and all).

The concept of what they were going for is AMAZING. Hence why I tried it out. The payoff, hardly worth it. And all this in a subscription package? Please... No, just... no.

Instead they gave us a cookie cutter shitty mmorpg in a morrowind dress.  Then I tried Mortal online.... all stats, no character levels, or locked skill classes. A vast depth of skills to learn and choose from. Skills that only get better from use.  No lame NPC's sending you on dumb quests to kill 10 rats or badgers or some garbage.  No more diapers children!  Full looting if you die....but there are laws just like the real world.  Murderers and criminals cannot simply kill you in town and of course you can always stash your things safely in the bank.   HOnestly this is the game that Elderscrolls online should have been.   I wish these developers all the best.

For starters, it is a subscription based sandbox MMO with a free to play system that offers a ton of freedom. This is a very complex, difficult game with many bugs being actively developed by a small team. You can play the game without paying anything and partake in pvp, pve and do just about everything without a time constraint on your free to play time. They do, however, place a level restriction on how high you can raise your individual skills; this game has a TES Oblivion style leveling system rather than a traditional MMO leveling style. You can still be a meaningful part of groups as a free to play charater, but will have a hard time competing 1v1 as a free to play.

This isn't a game for everyone, it is as hardcore as the genre can be and nothing about it holds your hand such as other MMOs will. PVP is free for all and non consentual, and safety is something you have to make for yourself not something the game provides. That being said this game is incredible and as far as I'm concerned, the best sandbox MMO out there. The map is very large and allows players to construct their own houses/keeps/cities in which you can run public towns with guards or control large territories as a guild and charge taxes as landlords to those who build on your territory.

All of the professions are well thought out and require thought to materials used to make whatever it is you are crafting, as well as the things you craft are highly customizable. This includes gathering professions, they aren't just ""go around and gather this"" you have to refine raw materials through multiple steps to make quality products, and the better your character is, the higher your yields. This leads to a very interesting crafting system that is unparalleled in other similar games. While the crafting system 

All loot is regional, so if you want to transport your goods across the world to be sold somewhere else you actually have to transport them, or pay someone to transport you / guard you during transport if you don't want them to be taken from you. 

The combat is very similar to the game ""Mount and Blade"" in that attacks and blocks are directional so when fighting someone not only do you have to time your parries, but you have to parry in the direction of your attacker to successfully block. Though mortal's UI and inventory suffers from poor responsiveness and just feels bad. 

All in all, this is a cool game but the developers are a meme and the game is dying/dead. There's one large guild that destroys anything you try to build within or anywhere within their territory, which is most of the main continent of the map. It's largely unplayable and until the devs turn it around (hopefully with MO 2), you're probbably not going to have a good time here as a new player.",1480368680,1567555637,False,0,0,0.494825124740600586,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Wenn du ein Arschloch sein willst und dich lange genug ummetzeln lässt, kannst du wahrscheinlich irgendwann das gleiche machen, aber ansonsten bietet das Spiel nichtallzu viel.
Was ich dem Spiel anrechne ist sein herrvoragendes Craftingsystem, das ist wirklich sehr gut geworden nicht zu schwer und nicht zu leicht.Aber im PVE hat man zum Beispiel sich teleportierende Gegner, gezähmte Tiere sind bei weitem schwächer als wilde und damit unbrauchbar im Kampf. Und wenn man denkt in einer bewachten Stadt ist man sicher täuscht man sich.Die sogennanten Wachen würden selbst von einer rheumakranken, blinden Schildkröte getötet werden.Eine aus meiner Sicht gute Idee wäre z.b ein PVP und ein PVE Server, respektiv ein einzelnes grosses PVP Gebiet. 
So wie das Spiel im Moment ist kann ich nur sagen, wartet bis genug Leute keinen Bock mehr haben sich verarschen zu lassen und schaut zu wie das Spiel stirbt, weil das ist der Weg den das Spiel gerade einschlägt, da ich kaum denke dass das Spiel sich so lange finanziert da man jetzt schon merkt wie die Serverleistung sinkt da dass Spiel zusehends laggy wird.

I have given Mortal online a lot of chances, but there is a limit. I have been In Vadda hoping it would be better than in Tindrem. Of course not, everyday I get killed IN vadda and outside. The Guards do not do anything, whatever I am told they are useless. I have lost the motivation for this Game. No PVE value, if you want to be PVP and cause havoc among Players it is the perfect Game. I have a lot of ideas but I don't think this game is worth it. I will continue playing because I paid the monthly sub, but then I will be gone. 
This game is great as it is one of the kind but my patience has reached the limit.
The crafting is great and the combat is also good, but to be killed everyday and not to have a chance to do something seems unfair in my eyes.

Когда-то давным давно... я познакомился с игрой Готика 1. Игра меня просто поразила своим миром и взаимоотношениями. Я проходил ее не один раз. Потом проходил все серии игры ""Готика"". С тех пор я всегда искал данный жанр RPG. Когда стали популярными ММО-RPG я все надеялся найти нечто подобное. И вот на просторах интернета мне попалась данная игра Mortal online. Сперва я думал, исходя из названия, что это из серии Mortal Kombat. Прочитав отзывы и посмотрев скрины, я понял, что я нашел что-то новое, чего раньше не было. Игры по типу LA2, WoW встречалиь пачками, но все они для меня были аналогами с разным пейзажем и NPC.
Скачав игру и начав в нее играть, я окунулся в невероятный готический мир с невероятной, на тот момент, графикой, которая и на данный момент остается на достаточно выском уровне. Чего стоит посмотреть только на закат или восход.
Когда вышел на охоту, то был приятно удивлен, что NPC животные вели себя по разному. Например, когда охотился на кабанчиков одни убегали, другие нападали, бывали и те, что сперва нападали, а потом убегали. Заметил еще такое, что когда был в брызгах крови к травоядным животным было сложно подойти. Тут нет такого, что убив волка из него выпадут штаны, кусок железа или монеты как, например, во многих ММО, в т.ч. ЛА2.
Есть еще много о чем можно рассказать про эту игру. И free pvp (в том числе и в городе), и full лут :). Система крафта - каждый может создать реально экслюзивную броню, лук, оружие, кторого второго на всем сервере больше и не найдешь... Выплавка металлов практически идентична реальности...
Да, есть минусы, та же графика, многим не нравится готический стиль... На первый взгляд игра выглядит старовата, но в этом, на мой взгляд есть плюсы. Поиграв в эту игру 2-3 недели и немного погрузившись в этот полностью свободный захватывающий мир, остауться играть по настоящему адекватные и строгого готического, я бы даже сказал спартанского, мышления игроки.

В общем я рекомендую данную игру всем, кому нравится данный жанр. кто ищет что-то новенькое и интересное.

My favorite element of the game is that it is ""100% hardcore"" also known as ""full loot."" If you die, all of your gear falls on the ground. In turn, anyone you kill, you have full access to their loot. Assuming you can escape with it!

My second favorite element of this game is that there are ZERO classes. You can have a mage in full plate if you want. Or a warrior class that wears leather and shoots a bow. Or an archer that can put his bow away and stab you with a dagger. Its really whatever you want. You use skill points like credits toward primary skill points. You can spend them however you like as you build your character. 

I would suggest trying the game. Get through the tiny tutorial, and go to the graveyard. Make some money, and join a guild. You won't regret it.

Побегайте там в какую оыбчную ММО,или еще что то казуальное.Тут жесткая игра которая яростно даёт по щам,все весьма сурово.
+ Очень высокий порог вхождения(наверное все же плюс)
+ Фулл дроп при смерти
+ Тяжелая прокачка аля Морровнид при юзании навыка
+ Очень мрачный сеттинг
+ Хардкор.

Очень хардкорная игра,в духе старой школы так сказать.Вот как раз и этого сейчас не хватает лично мне. Мрачность и хардкор,самый сок...но...НО теперь перейдем к минусам. Все бы хорошо,но прокачка весьма ораниченна,хотя и кажется по первой что тут можно качать овер дохрена,что Енд гейм будет долог и велик,ибо чтоб прокачать мастера на все руки,придется угробить хотя бы 2к часов. Но нет,тут все в этом плане оказалось грустно. Универсала не выйдет,даже через пару лет игры(хотя полный универсал совсем не нужен).Это сильно печалит,конечно мои 10 часов мизер для оценки Енд гейма,но все же. Его не заметно даже на горизонте,его тут просто нет видимо. 
Ну а теперь про стандартное,графон - дерьмо,ну да ладно,хотя можно было бы движок и обновлять.И вот тут мы упираемся во второй самый главный недостаток,катастрофическая редкость обновлений.То что могло бы перекрыть многие минусы,но нет, и тут жопа,уж простите. Ну и плюс корявая анимация персонажей,и вообще механика боя.Хотя сама механика интересная,если грамтно атаковать и отходить то можно ввалить и крутому игроку и мобу,вопрос прямых рук так скажем.Но все равно сделано через зад достаточно все это. Как понял система гильдий и всего с этим связанного тоже слабо развита,а жаль,это же ММО.
- Ограниченная прокачка
- Отсутсвие ЕндГейма
- Очень редкие обновления
- Общая корявость анимаций и криворукость дизайна,я серьезно.

Очень хотелось бы сказать ""ДА"" этой игре,ибо хардкорных игр очень мало,но минусы слишком перекрывают все это дело.

П.С. В октябре вышел очень большой апдейт с добавлением Некромантов,новых комплектов брони и т.д. Но это все уже не важно,ибо грустно все равно это. 

П.С.С.В игре есть подписка,дающая прокачку в 50% выше,и возможность воровать. Надо ли оно вам,вопрос интересный. Ибо разрыв между навыками будет не малый.

П.С.С.С. А вообще за игрой следил давно,еще когда она была в другом магазине,который закрылся.Но там она совсем сырая была. Хочется конечно надеяться создателей что то толкнет в сторону улучшения игры. Но ОЧЕНЬ сомневаюсь.

That said, let me begin.

Many people have a problem, or several, with Mortal Online. Some of them:
-""The game is too hard!!!"" - Yes, it is. It's probably the most punishing game I've ever played, and I have played the Souls games. It's a matter of taste. If you're a casual gamer, and there's nothing wrong with being one, this game is definitely not for you.
-""It wants you to put too much time into playing it!"" - Again, that's true. In Mortal Online, you're not a valliant hero of the day, not at all. You're a mere peasant, a worthless sack of flesh and bones, and you need to actually work on improving your character. I suppose many like that aspect in theory, but not so much in practice.
-""There's no auto-travel and it takes a long time to move between areas!"" - I don't like this aspect myself, but it's there to make it more likely for you to get murdered along the way. Don't like the fact that your character is fragile and can get ambushed at any time? That's perfectly understandable, but it also means you probably won't enjoy the game.

And...

-""The skill cap!"" - Absolutely. I definitely hate subscription-based games myself. I'd rather Mortal Online cost something like 30 euros and let you play without the skill cap, and you could buy cosmetic upgrades etc. with real money, or something like that. In Mortal Online's defence, many MMO games can't be played AT ALL unless you're subscribed, and you can still play Mortal Online for free if you're that way inclined. Is it enough of a reason to not make me recommend this game? No, it's probably my favorite MMO game of all time.

Those were the cons, 3 of which can be pros, depending on what you like.

What about the ""pure"" pros, though? Let's see...
-The community. It may seem weird, since you have tons of unfriendly RPKs (Random Player Killers), so why do I like the community? It's not just the occasional banter in the chat, but also the fact that when you get ambushed and slain, you can go back to a town and report the murderers to other, more combat-savvy players, who will then group up and take out your enemies - it creates an amazing sense of unity, at least for me.
Or you can form a caravan with other players before venturing out of town and only hope that they don't backstab you. This sense of constant danger is, in my opinion, AMAZING for immersion!

-The mechanics. The combat is quite in-depth, you have an incredible amount of various skills, you can do anything from cooking to forging weapons, which brings me to...

-(Almost) endless possibilities. You choose who you are. Want to be a great hero? No problem! Want to tame powerful creatures and then sell them and ride some of them yourself? Go for it! Or perhaps you want to be a miner? Can do!... Again, this brings me to another point, this one might be either hated or loved...

-You choose your own story! There are no quests apart from the tutorial part. Maybe one, where you're simply told that you can slay the undead in a graveyard and you'll get some money for it. You're not controlled by anything or anyone. The only quests that you might get are from... other players/guilds!

Also, one thing that needs mentioning: The skill cap, again!

The skill cap can limit who you can be. If you're subscribed, you'll be able to craft excellent gear, but if you're F2P, not so much. You can still be a great F2P tamer or a warrior, though, or just be a bit less-skilled weapon/armor-smith and sell your items for lower prices, to less-demanding players!

Ein Spiel welches sich nicht so einfach in eine Kategorie quetschen lässt da es unter der der einfachen Oberfläche Größer und Komplexer ist als es den Anschein hat, und es wird stetig weiterentwickelt.
[ Nicht ganz so kurze Review, kann Spuren von ""Spoiler"" enthalten ;) ]

Fangen wir mal mit dem technischen hintergrund an, es baut auf UNREAL 3 auf , von daher wirkt die Grafik zuweilen etwas angestaubt/ Klassich/ Retro , Die Maps der zwei Kontinente sind recht groß ( vor allem zu Fuß, auf einem Reittier relativiert es sich schon dramatisch) was die Hardware (Grafikkarte) durchaus fordern kann ( Mein System ist jetzt nicht das Schlechteste aber ich Spiel es aus Stabilitätsgründen auf LowDetail). Der Server läuft ""relativ"" Stabil 23,5h Stunden am Tag, ca. ne Halbe Stunde ist Täglicher Reboot (wird auch genutzt für Update, etc.) zu Spitzen Zeiten kanns aber schonmal Ruckelig werden.

Zum Gameplay, CharackterBau, und so ...
Das Spiel ist First Person Only(POV) und so wandert man immer aus der Egoperspektive durch eine Mittelalter-Fantasy-Welt.
Das Spiel is ""Englisch Only"" !!!
Man bastel sich einen Charackter und hier zeigt sich schon die Große Koplexität 4 Hauptrassen mit unterrassen sowie Alter und Größe bestimmen den Rahmen für Körperliche und Geistige Atribute [ im Spiel kann pracktisch alles in diesem festen Rahmen nach oben oder unten geändert werden, nur passt evtl. der gewählte Rahmen nicht aufdas was man Spielen will ], zudem kann noch des Geschlecht gewählt und am Kopf/Gesicht Modeliert werden.
Nun wählt man noch einen Startpunkt. Zu empfehlen sind Tindrem oder MorinKhur da diese einen kleine Starterbereich mit Tutorial haben. Verlässt man das Tutorial oder Startet in einer andern Stadt/Wilderniss beginnt der ernst des Lebens, 
Stichwort  Hardcore Survival , ohne Quest von einem Questgeber sthet man da und muss sich klar werden was will ich eigentlich machen ? [ Wer in Tindrem Startet bekommt diese Frage schon beim verlassen des Tutorial bereichs und etwas Ausrüstung dafür] Wer ein Krieger  oder Schmied oder sonst irgendetwas werden will braucht die Fähigkeiten( Skills) dafür , diese gibs aus Bücheren, bei Tutoren oder learning by doing und so kann es schon etwas Zeit brauchen bis man alle Fähigkeiten zusammen und gemeistert hat (Achtug grenze für F2P bei 60 ).
Mit seine Fähigkeiten und Atributen muss man sich dann gegen die Welt und adnere Spieler durchsetzten um Geld zu machen um sich selbsts und/oder seine Gilde weiter zu bringen. Wie erfolgreich man dabei ist entscheiden die Skills, deren Effecktivität wird dadurch bestimmt wieviele Punkte drin Stecken ( max 100) für Primäre Skills steht ein forrat von 1100 Punkten zur Verfügung. 
ACHTUNG: hier der wichtigst hinweis zu Skills und Artibuten, den deren Efecktivität ist Expotentiel ( ansteigende Kurve nach oben) Die Mitte liegt ca bei 60 und das ist der enorme untershied zwischen ""Free to play"" und Abo/Sub. Man muss schon richtig gut sein an Maus und Tastatur als F2P um ,bei gleicher Ausrüstung, gegen einen Kontrahenten zu bestehen im 1zu1( oder der muss halt fehler machen, ist auch nicht schwer)
Anmerkung dazu wie bereits erwähnt es ist Hardcore, sprich es gilt das recht des Stärkerern/Besseren, man sollte deshalb immer damit rechnen von einem anderen Spieler getötet, beklaut zu werden und ein Pferd ist auch noch dran ( du kommst aus dem Supermarkt jemand schlägt dir den Kopf ab , klaut deinen Einkauf und zündet noch dein Auto an) 
Aber auch die ergebnisse bei Wirtschftlichen Sachen( Rüstung Scmiede, Metzgerrei,etc.) ist enorm.
So noch kurz zur Welt, es gibt jede Menge Tiere/Monster/NPC zum Farmen deren fähigkeiten varrieren von Babyeinfach bis nur für Profies, deren Intiligenz ist aber eher low. Auch dieverse(teils verstekte) Höhlen/Dungens sind auch reichlich vorhanden.

Es gibt sicher noch meher zu sagen, aber das alles in Worte zu fassen fällt mir Grad schwer.
Mein Tipp, schaut es euch F2P an lernt die Welt kennen mit einem wegwerf Charakter , gefällt es euch macht ein Reroll des Charakter zu dem was ihr machen wollt( sucht Infos über Builds vorher),sucht euch eine Gilde, Baut ihn auf dann erst Abo und durchstarten, auf dem Weg dahin habt ihr euch schon an den rauen Umgang und das Sterben gewöhnt.

I'll update with upcoming experience.

Starting out is slow, and the tutors aren't all lined up in front of you. Walking and running is very slow, this game isn't for the lightly seated. 

You have a certain number of hours to make use of the help chat, but don't always count on them to answer questions. Google might be able to lend you a hand.

Prepare to spend at-least half an hour walking between tutors in Morin & Toxai.

If you don't mind losing items, dying will grant you far faster movement. Not to mention, while alive, there are certain, possibly player laid gates, which can't be opened without a password or breaking it, a Herculean feat. 

Any crime besides murder warrants 2 minutes of NPC hostility and not being able to resurrect. Murder warrants 8 hours of it.

Grinding can be repetitive, but sometimes entertaining. 


[h1]Suggestions[/h1]

Will be updated once more complaints arise.

At this time, Mortal Online is rather unrefined and messy, with wooden pathways floating above the ground, messy combat mechanics, a lacking interface, and unimpressive landscaping.

For instance, you cannot click a friend on your friend's list to message them. 

You have to type ""/w friendsname"".

You have to wait until the first attack animation is finished before clicking to attack again.

Should make it so you can hold/click left mouse mid-animation to prep for next attack.

Oh, and you can't Teabag very well.",1474352460,1484542129,False,9,1,0.473788142204284668,0,False,False,False,False,,1474461079.0,"Thanks for the feedback!

Что понравилось:

[b]1. ХАРДКОР.[/b] Игра не прощает ошибок. Каждый свой шаг нужно обдумывать, осознавать риски. Обычные 
мобы порвут парой укусов. Большинство игроков с радостью обворуют, ограбят или просто убьют ради 
фана. Плохо кушаешь и не спишь - слабеешь. Носишь с собой ценности - обворуют. Не заботишься о 
питомце - он сбежит (или сожрет). Нацепил новую блестящую броню и вышел погулять за город - 
готовься выкупать ее на аукционе в лучшем случае. Глобального чата нет. Со смертью теряется все носимое.

[b]2. БОЕВКА. Нонтаргет.  Ближний бой с возможностью наносить удары с разных сторон, блокировать и парировать тоже с разных сторон. Система стрельбы из лука, когда целиться нужно ориентируясь на наконечник стрелы, учитывая гравитацию, дрожь в руках и ветер. Магия с подготовкой и выполнением заклинания. Также магам нужны различные порошки (без нужных веществ заклинания не будет), книги с заклинаниями. Попадания по разным частям тела могут вызвать разные эффекты, причем бить рекомендуется по незащищенным частям тела.

[b]3. ПЕСОЧНИЦА С ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬЮ РОЛЕПЛЕЯ.[/b] Строить домики, писать книги, рисовать, крафтить, готовить блюда (например из голов врагов). Придется выбрать свой путь заранее и хотя тут можно развиваться в любом направлении, генетика родителей и характеристики при создании имеют большое значение. Многие отыгрывают свои роли, квестов тут нет (ну кроме обучающих), чем заняться придется решать самим.

Что не понравилось:

[b]4. ДОНАТ.[/b] Свободные аккаунты серьезно ограничены. Можно посмотреть игру, но для полноценной игры все-таки нужна подписка. Уровень навыков ограничен со 100 до 60, некоторые (например карманные кражи) не могут использоваться. Вы слабее в бою, хуже передвигаетесь, добываете меньше ресурсов, крафт хуже. Хочешь ногебать - плати. 

[b]5. БАГИ.[/b] Самые разные и неприятные, от вылетов и зависаний до дырок в тестурах и проваливанию сквозь карту. Вещи в инвентаре могут ""исчезать"" становясь невидимыми. Поведение мобов трудно передать. Мало того, что мобы хардкорны, так они еще и могут проходить сквозь текстуры и преодолевать горы. Крысы в канализации (из-за круглых стен трубы) бегают  сохраняя вертикальное положение по потолку и стенам, прячась в текстурах от ударов. Один раз я наверное полчаса пытался запустить игру, сначала вылет, потом невозможность залогиниться. Ожидание, когда закончится таймер и снова вылет. У друга с которым играл в какой-то момент вообще пропал звук и пока не появился. Совершенно глупая механика с факелами - они освещают поверхность только для вас, но сосед видит лишь угли и вынужден двигаться в темноте.  

[b]6. Player Killers.[/b] С одной возможность убить кого угодно в любом месте и в любое время радует, но тут похоже это стало основной целью игры. Орды красных осаждают города новичков не давая им выйти, убивая даже голых бомжей. Некоторые города они вообще умудрились заблокировать стенами не давая физически покинуть город.

[b]7. УНЫЛЫЙ МИР.[/b] Малый онлайн, кругом уродливые пустые развалины городов, животные которые стоят на месте и реагируют только на игроков если вообще реагируют. НПС с одинаковыми фразами в разных городах. Похоже идея была во взаимодействии игроков и возможно отыгрыше роли, но большинство похоже занимаются набиванием фрагов. Ну может я просто еще не весь мир посмотрел.

В итоге многие приятные вещи портят баги и игроки. Попробовать можно, если хорошо с английским. Очень жаль. что каких-то альтенратив нет и скорее всего не будет.

It was created on an Engine that was not made to support huge open worlds like that and because of that it limited what you could have in the world in therms of environment... it`s just ugly and i`m not even talking about the graphics but the art is just extremely sloppy and it seems like something that came out straight from Second Life. It`s empty, flat and ugly...

It`s world building 101 mate... you don`t make an enormous flat land...

I`m not the kind of player who will love a game because of it`s graphics... I play many very outdated MMOs, but I can`t forgive bad level design in general. Cities are not supposed to be that big in games nor that flat. Verticality is very important when you decide the elements you are going to put in a scene to draw the player`s attention. Buildings are oddly far from each other and always seem to have the exact same tiled textured repeated along it`s VERY flat walls. People will notice...

Now I haven`t played a lot of itself because I simply couldn`t get past that first ugly barrier but from what i was able to see the game does acomplish it`s main objective which is having a super open experience in which the player control`s it`s own path. The gameplay itself felt clunky to me, but it`s playable, specially for a UDK open world game... that`s an actual achievement in my opinion.

Maybe the level design increases with time since that first starting area was probably one of the first environments they made for the game, but I don`t feel like it`s worth it to go through all of the bad to find something good, but again, apart from the level design and environment art being really low quality, the game itself seems to deliver what it promisses.

 You actually can eat other people also in-game, looks like you can walk around fully nude also.  New players get a few hours before ""protection"" wears off, if someone kills newer players, they are flagged as Criminal and the city guards will attack them.   There are gangs of players in the wilderness that kill solo players for loot.  The skill system is that you read books, that take large amounts of Real time.

Free to Play means create 1 character and can level skills to 60.  This game can be called Pay to Win and Pay to Play since you have to pay subscriptions to level skills past 60 and have more than one character.  P2P character have more advantages over F2P characters also.

Does have extensive crafting, pet training and gathering system.

I found the game rather laggy on my computer, breaks in the sound, with bouts of rubberbanding.

Try it, if you like Hardcore PVP games like this. I suggest you read other reviews and do research if you start playing also.

I was relunctant to leave feedback because there are room for improvement, but the neglect have forced my hand. My Steam showed 0 hrs but the game have non-Steam client that I have used for years. So, I trust that you can over-look my 0 game time hours and not see this malicious, libel, but an honest review.

This game compromise too many time. When server population are down, GM and owner of Star Vault make patchs to cater to the old members. when server population are up, they reverse and make patch for newer people. It is always a bottom line for them to bring revenues. They can't please everyone but can't upset their last remaining people.

Lately, the rule about blocking off major content, like the town of Morin Khur, in the game have been flush down the toliet. The rule is there but not enforce in much to disappoint the remaining players.

The game economy operates around butchering and macroing extraction or fishing. Over the year, they banned fishing macro, but the damage for macro is not contained. People who have made their money, kept it. The rule about botting and macro are hilarious because there aren't much different between botting and macroing but they add their opinion just to not upset their old players that will max train their character in 5 days in macroing. Most people who sold lowest price on metal are likely those who macro extraction. In a way, Mortal Online is Macro/Bot Online. You either macro or butcher, extract, and fight in the game.

People have argued for siege mechanic and tempt everyone to siege them. But, in a way, you are sieging their macro fueled asset. In some case, Morin Khur, a blue town like other major game content where the rule about blocking content of the game will get ignored.

So, you play Mortal Online, you can play however you like to play it but understand how much compromise the company will bend to let abusers bend their way of mastering Mortal Online. The future of Mortal Online have been altered by blocking content and doing massive siege which again paid for by macro economy.

Abusers are the richest people in the game. Don't ever forget that! This game need to be re-name as Macro Online where computer program of bot or Star Vault's viewpoint ""macro"" are playing the game for the player. And, I can understand that macro is allowed and that using it isn't abuse. But, you still abuse the fair gameplay aspect of gaming. In a way, you let steroid change your body to outperform those who work hard. 

A well known player who I don't name have 10 accounts. All assigned to macroing. In a way, Star Vault see this as ""revenue"" and doesn't interfere with judging on the Ai's level of Macro to make sure it isn't a bot. Star Vault had rule about not having VM running in the game. What kind of computer that run 10 accounts would be able to run macro task efficiently and precisely?

Update:

They decided at the last minute to make boundaries around Morin Khur and Toxaii unbuildable. Although, the change was needed. It came late.

Aiming matters as opposed to targetting systems you find in wow (a big thing for me); you aim for the head, you do more dmg. Has taming in case you feel like turning it into pokemon XD

I had my mount before the end of my first week, so not another just run and run game. 

People Will help you, just try to avoid come off as overly helpless; asking how to do stuff shows you are looking to get shit done, but having people hold your hand all day or being rude to those who offer help will cause the obvious; people won't wanna play with you. Even if you need a good bit of help, just show some patience and you'll easily find people willing to help you from giving you free gear to helping you figure out the tricks to making exactly what kind of character you are looking to build

Active community/updates, new necromancy class. Game isn't super graphic intensive (means more players and more frames.... YAY).

Other than that the only thing you need to be aware of is ""blue blocking"" where people may attempt to run in front of your attack for the sake of getting you in trouble with guards/other players and getting you killed.

If you get a murder count of 5 you go from having a blue name to having a red name, and need to wait for a cooldown in order to lose that status, otherwise guards will kos and other players dont get in trouble for murdering you either.

IF YOU DO GET KILLED IN TOWN, YOU DO NOT NECESSARILLY LOSE YOUR INVENTORY; if you didn't break the law, it is a crime for someone to take stuff out of your dead body and said theif will have the guards shooting lighting bolts up their asses if they try to grab your stuff.

Tinderem is an awesome starting zone; mounts up the hill outside of town for taming, a small little fountain with some wolf's brush to make food for said mounts that is inside the castle city. The really neat thing I like about starting out there is the graveyard within the castle you can go and murder various lvl skeletons/zombies, which drop basic armor and are decent to farm for their heads (about 1 gold for less than 10 min of getting your stats up choppin up zeds).

If you get a little bored and feel adventurous, you don't even need to leave the city, you can just go down the tunnels at the graveyard or go deep in the sewers and find plenty of rats/bandits willing to murder your ass on sight.

The free to play option makes it so that you'll never stand a chance so go ahead and use the f2p the first month and then go sub if you contnue to play. The players take full advantage of the pvp anywhere and working for a week to get a resource can be taken away from you in 5 seconds. You can't get people to group up and help each other cause everyone wants to do their own thing but the devs are developing it into a game where you have to be a group or can't get anything done. So you can never get anything done. The game is slowly dying though cause there are alot of ass holes that play the game and they are ruthless in attacking anyone anywhere, you're never safe, never.

Mortal Online ist ein ungeschliffener Diamand .. hier und da hat das Game Kanten und Ecken aber das hat jedes Game.

Um es kurz zu beschreiben .. 

Mortal Online  ist das was du daraus machst .. hast du keine eigenen Ideen oder Ziele .. DANN SPIEL ES NICHT !!
Du bekommt vom Spiel nicht viel hilfe ein kleines Turtoriel damit du weisst was auf dich zukommt, aber das wars schon.
Und ja das ist auch gut so .. das Spiel hat dadurch seinen Charakter ..

Die meisten schreiben F2P ist nicht spielbar genau diese spieler verstehen den Sinn nicht .. klar kann man alle skill nur bis 60 NUTZEN aber man kann sie bis 100 trainieren .. 
abgesehen davon ist das game skill basierend .. du kannst locker mit einem f2p account Paied Accounts besiegen .. es kommt immer drauf an wie gut du bist und das ist das was das game ausmacht ..
Viele schreiben .. ich geh aus der stadt und bin direkt tod weil ein spieler auf einem pferd mit einem bogen auf mich schiesst ;) ... LOGISCH  wenn ich zufuss laufe ist klar das ich gegen einen Bogenschützen auf einem Pferd keine Chance hat.
Dieses Spiel ist in vielen Dinger realitätsnah .. was die meisten Spieler nicht verstehen und deswegen rumweinen .. klar verlierst du alles wenn dich einer tötet oder du an einem Mob stirbst .. so ist es halt .. 
Ja und das macht das Game aus .. Spiel mit freunden in einer gruppe und du wirst sehen das blatt wendet sich .. trage Waffen die Dismounten .. dann kannst du auch einen berittenen locker besiegen denn wenn er am boden ist ist sein vorteil weg ..
Deswegen .. dieses Spiel hat richtig potenzial man kann SEHR SEHR viel erreichen und machen da einem kaum bis keine Grenzen gesetzt werden .. 

Die negativen Rewiews sind spieler die  noch keine 20 std das game gespielt  haben .. wie kann man sich da ein urteil erlauben ich selbst spiele schon 500 std und hab noch nichtmal 1/3 gesehen .. 

deswegen wer interesse hat .. mich einfach anschreiben wir sind die grösste Deutsche Communtity  und helfen gerne weiter den Anfangs schweren Start zu ueberstehen..

Es ist kein Carebaer Game ..",1471203306,1471203306,True,4,1,0.523335278034210205,0,False,False,False,False,,,

UPDATE: For some reason it says I only have 0.3 hours. This is a big lie, I've played for quite some hours! It's probably a bug in some form.


Not going to use too much time with this review. You got skills that increase on use (or study, depending, but usually can be raised by both), you can get a certain amount of skills maxed, or mix it up how you wish. In this game, it's open PVP with a couple ""safe"" towns, full loot apart from very certain starter weapons (I think the worn shortsword's about the only weapon that doesn't drop on death, because it's that bad of a weapon). You will die, at least once, so don't be surprised when you do. Dying really isn't that bad, you lose stuff, but you still have your skills intact and you're not permanently dead, so don't get too attached to your items/mounts. Just as you can die, others can too, so there's opportunity at others expense, which is pretty much the name of the game.




Mortal Online gets a bad rap, and that's because bad things CAN happen to you, and some people don't really get that, or take it well. Losing stuff really isn't that bad, you can bank most of it, and it gives you enemies to make, maybe even friends. For those who are looking for something different and refreshing compared to the MMOs that feel like there's no consequences for anything, Mortal Online provides a great experience for those who like danger, character skills AND player skills, as all are combined that make this game what it is. Take some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt, it's very common to write a negative review when angry about something that just happened in-game, far more common than writing a positive review. Just try the game and decide for yourself, but be ready to win big, or lose it all when you roll the dice; It's a big thrill!




P.S: Your skills are capped at 60 if you are free to play and you can't use thievery skills. To get the skill cap of 100 and thief skills, you need a premium subscription. You also only get one character slot unless you purchase more. So I wouldn't really count this as a good ""free to play"" MMO, but it's a GREAT subscription MMO with unlimited trial!",1470509707,1470510122,True,10,3,0.545493900775909424,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Mortal online, as I'm sure many reviews will point out, is not for the faint of heart. You will die. More than you intend to, but rather than analyze the gameplay I am going to tell you my experience, because that is what MO is all about. (summary at bottom)

Day 1: Wow this game is beautiful *cue dramatic opera music* the blume is perfectly balanced to add effect but not obscure the marvelous garden before me complete with a variety of trees, flowers, and an aqueduct. The person that convinced me to play eagerly awaits my arrival, and laughs when I ask about quests. There is only one quest in the game and that is the tutorial, it teaches you the absolute survival basics and nothing more, but you get a lot of free stuff at the end so that's pretty cool (some of it actually saves you a LOT of gold).

Day 3: This crafting is amazing. No other word for it. The depth and variety of recipes you can try be it cooking, alchemy, armor or weapon crafting, simply dumbfounded me. 100h in I can barely craft any useful armor. At this point some will say ""ugh 100 hours to get almost nowhere?"" and stop reading, but don't. Because what I will tell you is that due to the depth of crafting, infinite possibilities, and unique difficulty of getting useful materials, every piece feels hand forged as though it is a part of me.

Day 5: My first encounter with a red. I just bought my first horse, it is a magnificent purebread desert horse, agile with high stamina. I tab out to check the map while riding my horse at half speed. Before I can tab back I am on the ground, my mount is dead and my friend is running for his life. Utter chaos. A large man on a horse the size of a car mows him down, I am desperately dodging his moves but to no avail, I die on the spot and he loots my corpse... Peasants unite! I, while hopelessly rummaging through my bank wondering how to make up my gold hear that a group of random players went out, fought and carted him to death, and that someone got my gold. They promptly returned every single piece without so much as asking for a thank you.

Day 7: Things are going pretty well, I can consistently gather materials safely and outrun most threats on my new horse. Enter someone I now consider a very close friend. We joke about rope dresses and whatever other manner of fucked up things in the help chat. You'd be amazed at how much you can come to like someone spending 40h with them in 3 days lol. I couldn't help but trust them because well... they got my jokes and seemed like a really chill person. Come to find out a bit later that this person is slow to trust and I think I'm crazy because they trusted me pretty quick. Point I'm making is, no MO does not always have the best community (I personally know how bi-polar help chat can be as I am a frequent user), but among the common rabble there are real people, with real feelings, that can actually be pretty nice. Look for the diamonds in the rough, not the sticks in the mud.

I drowned because my horse threw me into a river while I was wearing heavy armor. I have been pk'd twice (which some would call lucky). The armor I make could barely suffice for PvP. But you know what? I love this game. And it is not F2P it is unilimited trial, I should make that very clear. A lot of people say ""skill caps are 60/100 for free players"" but might I point out ALL players are limited to 1100 primary skill points. I am still free, and ya know what? I don't mind, if anything for the time being it allows me to have a wider variety of skills than a paying player. Do I plan on subbing? yes. I do. Do you necessarily have to? no. But that's all I have to say, decide for yourself :) and if you want free stuff from time to time, feel free to add me on steam and message me when you're on MO, I can spare some better than average gear.

The Mortal Online devs have stated that they are making a sequel , Mortal Online 2 , but will continue to work on MO1 until everyone is accustomed to the sequel (more info to come).

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Mortal Online is possibly the greatest mmo of all time due to many reasons: 

• Directional based combat - swing left , right and middle to attack from all angles , do the same for blocking to create a simple yet intense combat system - in first person perspective for immersion.

• Full loot open world pvp game with 2 continents and loads of real players , monsters, and peaceful / aggressive animals alike spread across 3 different biomes .

• unique character creation class with 6+ races that takes age and lineage into account complete with attribute and skill trees to fill out (there are no item or character levels , just a pool of 1100 skill points and a huge list of skills to choose from - you make a character that's UNIQUE TO YOU !). 

•Three types of magic schools (more on the way) ; ecumenical - of this as elemental magic, fireballs , lightning strikes , healing and anti-healing magic in this branch . Spiritism - become a ghost and trap other spirits (ai and human) using them as reagents for your spells , and shoot laser beams from your frickin' hand ! Necromancy - the most new and most interesting by far , raise the undead and have them fight for you , summon a ritual abomination that can be customized depending on the dead carcass you use to create it and it can be leveled up to evolve it's attacks, summon a ghostly Shade to be a back up mage for you as well ... on top of all these creatures you can perform over 12 unique necromancer spells invlolving blood and dark magics!! Become a wizard harry !

- New patch added custom house building, over 4 different styles of architecture to choose from and the textures of your house will change depending on  the materials you use to build your house!

• Explore ruins , caves hidden underneath waterfalls , massive rope bridges above hundreds of feet of jungle , Asian-inspired cities built into the side of a mountain, and large capitol cities (one nestled into the grassy steppes , another in the wide-open insect infested desert) . Over  30 different cities , towns, hamlets and ancient wonders to visit spread across 2 different continents 

•A height/weight system that can be altered after character creation , which affect damage bonus , health pool and more .

• Ai guards protect innocent ""blue"" towns and the blue players within , but don't let that fool you , guards can be killed , they are not everywhere all the time and you CAN BE hurt , thieved from, and murdered anywhere in the world of Nave ! Be careful !

• Unique armor and weapon system that allows you to customize your character ANY WAY you want with mix and match armor (hair and tatoos are limited) 

• Dungeons filled with special bosses that drop legendary loot and chests filled with random and static loot , some of it very valuable making treasure hunting a real career ! 

•A large taming system allows you to tame, train and use over 4 dozen unique monsters at your disposal if you choose to be a tamer (to fight for you or to sell) . These animals /  creatures grow in size as you train / take care of them , they also adapt new attacks and some even evolve into stronger beasts !

•Mount system WITH breeding : ride horses , donkeys , mules, camels, lizard horses (lyks) , and Molva beasts (bull rhinos), with a one of a kind breeding system built into the game you will be trying to find the perfect looking mount for you and your friends to explore the dangerous world with ! 

•skill based combat system ensures that you will have an intense , first person experience in EVERY battle , wether it be fighting an AI skeleton or a player controlled Murderer . 

•create a modular house anywhere and customize the look of it using different materials , also create furniture and furnish your house !

• largely complex crafting system - craft weapons , bows , shields , armor (12 + different styles of armor and over 50 types of materials/metals to use for all crafting !)

• Meteorite drop system - watch a cosmic star fall from the skies as it actually tears through the atmosphere of Nave and crash lands randomly , leaving a defening sound which can be heard for miles .. after the meteor cools down you can mine it for precious (very valuable !) metals that normally must be refined by an experienced player controlled metal refiner 

• relic / relic weapon drop - Similar to the meteors , these relics are statues that can be placed at guild reliquaries to provide passive bonuses such as leveling pets much faster , also sometimes a temporary (sometimes not temporary) ""relic weapon"" drops , imbued with godly powers , it makes anyone who wields it powerful beyond imagination .

• player versus world : lots of creatures to farm for all sorts of materials , which can be simply sold, or traddd to crafters to make armor , weapons , shields and bows (soon to be houses , right now houses are created but won't change HP, color or texture with different materials)

• Raiding system : BE A VIKING ! With the newly added Ramps you too can raid like a Viking ! Free placement ramps can be built for a way into enemy palisades - be ware this is in its infancy stages

• Sieging system : build Battering rams , Manganons , fire arrows , and even trebuchets to destroy enemy fortifications , walls , palisades , really anything that you want to destroy that your neighbor has made ( NOTE : sieging is NOT EASY OR QUICK).

• one of a kind thievery system allows you to pickpocket from others and pick chests ! Be that professional thief / con artist you always wanted to be ! Complete with fall damage , the games physics make it a thieves playground , doing special jumps to get into rooftops and high ground the thief finds hidden treasure chests (some right under the average citizens nose !) and sometimes perfect opportunities to assassinate .

• open world and open ended battles mean you can be fighting one person outside of the capitol city of Tindrem one minute - and then be attacked by two lance wielding horse riders the next - the choice is yours ... and theirs .

• free to play with an optional (but preferred) subscription - unlimited free trial means you can play the game up to 60% power of all players who subscribe each month , this does not mean pay to win obviously, as you cannot buy anything that gives you an advantage , but it does mean as a free trial user you aren't expected to be able to be a master at anything .


This game has SO MUCH TO IT and all of this on 8 years , and one massive server , but yet the world still hasn't caught onto the greatness that is Mortal ONline , most likely due to its rough start (the game was very unbalanced and broken up until about a year ago when the devs furiously started bug fixing and balancing) but now the game is greatly improved and the devs are releasing patch after patch to revitalize it .

However before the few latest updates that where supposed to help, they seemed to have made things worse. On my basic PC that I somehow, at the lowest settings, manged to get it to run the game... until I got done making my character... again. I used to be able to play just fine on this PC without even latency issues but it seems as if with the latest updates they are more focused on giving the few players who can play something to do rather then optimize their game for the majority of players who cannot afford a high end machine to run this game.

Any time I do manage to play however I do enjoy the content to its fullest, its just a shame that they don't do more to optamize more. I'm not saying they don't try, because there is more settings to lower the quality of everything to a lower setting then there was some 3 years ago but it still doesnt do much to help the game.

Honestly I would recommend this game to anyone who has a real quality machine that can run it, if you manage to live through the grind and find a great guild to play the game with its wonderful fun. The landscapes on the higher settings are beautiful for their age and you can only wonder how a game like this can ever be so peaceful... then you get your head cut off by some guy who can run faster then your horse... its happened. a lot. 

but I'd give this game a solid 7/10 overall, even if it has some issues. It has the potential to be a great game! it's just not quite there yet though, and I can only hope that the Dev team on this will make this game as great for everyone as it has been for me throughout the years. 

Ps. THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!

Simple content is still unfinished from the start of the game, GameMasters dont help you and are corrupt, unfinished content is being added which can be abused and isnt fixed for months.

Mountedcombat, mountedarcher, mountedmage and slaghaller all on one account.
Footfighter, hybridfighter, dexmage and engineer all on one account.
Extractor, necromancermage, dominatormage and tamer all on one account.
You only get one free character slot per account, to unlock the other 3 its $10usd per slot so you're looking at $120usd once you unlock the other character slots you need, then you'll be paying a subscription fee of $13usd per month per account = $52usd per month.

Takes 15 minutes to make character with no explaination of any stats
Spawns in game
Fixes resolution
Mouse wont go away and cant look around
2 minutes later game gives tip saying 'z' turns it off
Goes to do Pig quest
Better player talks to me and asks if I need food
Proceeds to give me poisonus mushrooms and tells me to eat them
I eat one to make it look like I fall for it
I vomit everywhere
Guy is disapointed I didnt die from it
Takes 9 minutes to figure out how to get hide from pig bodies.
Walks for another 3 minutes and figures out doesn't have enough

Few tips before you try it for the first time, don't expect it to be a free to play its more of an unlimited free trial and being free to play will have its draw backs such as having your armor weights limited, and for those of you who like to tame things the level your pets will be able to level to, but by no means will it make it impossible for you to kill a pay to play player or make money.

We knew this so in the store we wrote the following:

""Unlimited free trial!
Mortal Online offers a free-to-play mode with a skill cap at skill level 60. In order to unlock the maximum skill levels and fully master your Mortal destiny, a paid monthly subscription is needed, but unlike many other games there are no microtransactions. Unsubscribing will re-apply the skill cap, but your skills will be maxed again when you re-subscribe. Every player gets one free character slot, and you can purchase additional slots up to a maximum of four.""

Trying to clarify it but ya I do understand if folks don't read that far down.
Sad you didn't give it more time, tons of stuff has changed in the last years.

Take care!"

Mortal Online has A LOT of potential, that being said, it's also hindered by some strange features, aspects, and requirements. Mortal Online is a sandbox, survival, mmo, that let's you do, just about, whatever you want. You can be a merchant, a hunter, a crafter, a warrior/knight, a carpenter (builder), a tamer (horses and such), the possibilities are nearly endless! The graphics look good, but this game requires the best of computers to play efficiently. Also, it is VERY realistic, but sadly, that can be a downfall sometimes. This game has no casual elements, and requires A LOT of time and investment. 

Pro's:
Very Rewarding
VERY Realistic
Unique Setting for an MMO
So much to do!

Con's:
-Performance is not optimized and requires a top end machine to play on even the lowest settings. 
-Very difficult (not normally a Con, but in this case, it takes SEVERAL hours, just to prepare to journey out, then, it takes SEVERAL hours to make it anywhere, and there is a very high possibility that you'll die on the way, losing all of the things you gathered before leaving..resetting your progress. It is VERY possible for someone to be fully armored, and have a full load out of weapons and tools and materials and foods, only to be killed, and lose it all, and suddenly, you're starting all over..
-REALLY spotty community, in MORTAL Online, you can be killed by any player, anywhere, and any time. This is somewhat prevented by guards and bounties, but even still, the players seem hell bent on ruining the experience for new players at times. You'll be pick pocketed in towns, you'll likely be murdered in towns, you're almost guarenteed to be murdered by players met out in the world, and there is little to no way to avoid it..
-Strange controls and commands..Some things (like taming) require some VERY strange commands, like running around for 30 minutes attempting to pet a hopping bunny with your hands, in order to tame it. It's not very noob friendly, and there is a tutorial, but the tutorial leaves a lot out..

For now, I wouldn't recommend this game, however, I am intrigued by what it COULD offer, so I always come back and check up on it, and if it changes, I'll gladly update my review!

You might enjoy playing it for awhile but there's not much to do. Most of the gameplay is horribly designed. A lot of the textures look like they just paid for stock images. The combat is very clunky and attack telegraphing is ridiculously bad. Bugs bugs bugs everywhere, including hair textures that still, after 6 years, haven't been fixed. Movement is so slow that it's more fun to run around when you're dead. I'm not joking, when you're dead it's so much easier to move around that being alive feels like wading through quicksand in comparison. Generally speaking, this game is a chore and it's even worse if you play solo. If you decide to play, I highly suggest you join a guild so you actually have a community to interact with outside of the temporary help chat. This game is very much a sandbox when it comes to the question of 'wtf do I do'. Guilds help a lot with giving you a clear goal and providing a motivation for pvping.

   To be fair, the main draw is the pvp. I haven't voluntarily participated in that much yet...by which I mean I've just been randomly murdered a bunch. Oh, by the by, there is no real penalty for murder until you've reached the lvl of a serial killer which to me makes no sense whatsoever, but hey, I'm sure the murderers enjoy it. If you want to seriously get into pvp, I highly recommend a guild. In fact guilds are one of the game's few saving graces, though there are plenty of bugs and other problems going on in that respect too. Outside of pvp however, there's the crafting.

   The crafting system is passable and has some interesting aspects to it with how materials affect the appearance and stats of crafted items. However, you have to dedicate a character to crafting for it to really be worth your time. You CAN make a hybrid sure, but, because this game DOES have traditional lvling in the sense that the more you do what you do the higher your stats go, up to a cap, you will be gimped compared to a min/maxing player.

   Stats are very important. Do not let people tell you that it's skill based and your stats don\'t matter. Stat differences determine your health, stamina, and mana as well as your movement speed, attack speed, damage, combat move speed, move speed while using armor, swimming speed, mount speed, etc etc. See a trend? Your skill as a player is limited by what your character is actually capable of. AKA it doesn't matter how good the player is when your character moves like a slug in comparison and does a fraction of the damage.

   Ultimately it's your equipment that's most important in determining how much damage you actually do, but you CAN win with skill using crappier gear if your stats are comparible. Blocking/parrying is important but your gear and stats also affect how well you can do those too, so they won't save you against a character with better gear and stats. Damage potential is not nearly as important as movement ability. If your movement speed was determined soley by gear instead of stats maybe combat could be properly balanced, as of right now though, whoever's stats are higher and has better gear is usually going to win over skill. In that respect, this game is very much an RPG. There's nothing wrong with games that put character skill over player skill. The problem is that this game is not presented that way so you go in expecting something very different from what you actually get.

   All this talk of stats brings up one of this game's main issues.  MO is guilty of one of the problems F2P games are most criticized for. It is P2W. You could argue that the free to play option is actually just a trial, but that doesn't change that there is a 40% stat difference between a free and subbed player. This game is not listed as a demo on steam, it is listed as a free to play game. Unless that suddenly changes, to say it's just a 'trial' version is a fallacy. It's true that the game is free of the cash shop aspect, techinically. Instead, players receive special items and perks if they donate enough. Sounds a little sketchy right?

TL;DR
   Basically, this a fun game to dick around in if you like exploring and hardcore rping pvp, but in the long run it's not worth your time. If you join up with a guild you could definitely spend hundreds of hours pvping, rping, and exploring, but it can feel more like a job than fun times with friends. I do not recommend this game for the average gamer. It is for hardcore pvp players only. I don't mean that as a compliment. I mean that only hardcore players will be wiling to put up with all the game's crushing flaws out of desperation to find a game that provides an immersive sandbox rp/pvp environment.",1464783010,1464783351,False,7,1,0.493453949689865112,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game is the best game that ive ever played in my life, and im not joking.
Before i discovered mortal online, I was searcheing for an open World, free to play midevil time based game, I had no luck for about 3months of searching. then my friend told me about mortal online. I instantly fell i n love with it. Its everything I was looking for. Open world Massivley Multiplayer open World Full loot PvP and etc. You can pratiucally do whatever you wan't in the game. When I tell people about mortal I normally tell them ""It's like Skyrim, but 10more content, no quests and WAY more fun, oh... and all multilplayer."" You can do so much in this game and its really astonishing. But the fact that it came out in 2010 doesnt phase me, it just makes me sad that until not, the community is just stating to grow, and getting more recognishion. I feel like this game has so much potential that it will become the ""best selling game of 2016"". And im not joking. I love this game so much that I used to play about 6hrs every day, and me being me, not wanting to pay a dime, created not one, not two, but three Free-2-Play accounts, and for those of you that dont understand what a big deal that is, well, you can only log into one F2P account a day. But since I have 3computers its fine. If I were a new player looking for some information on how to get started in game, i'd say making a footfighter/mage first or a hybrid. That is definately the most fun way to play as a F2P. Now back to the praising, If your descision on buying a game is based on reading reviews, then get this, If you look at the reviews that have been written, just notice, just notice the amount of time they have played the game, almost everyone that has written a review on this game has probably played over 300 hrs! And if you look at the ones that are positive to be exact, some (like me) Has played over 1000hrs!!! Now why would someone play a game that sucks for 1000hrs ?? Ask yourself that question.

You can progress in anyway you want to gain fortune and fame, from fishing, to crafting, cooking or becoming a PVP monster or PVE God for soloing a Ratzar Queen.

You level your character's skills in a classless way that determines how you want to play rather than simply getting stronger through grinding. This allows PVE and PVP to be geared towards skill and grouping with others to achieve success.

This game is first person only but it works to its advantage, to bring a game that's more immersive than any other MMORPG since Ultimate Online.

The community is small but this works to its advantage because everyone is in the same world, on the same server and your actions WILL be remembered by other players. If you start pickpocketing, players will remember your name and try to avoid you in the future. This also means interactions are more personal and political alliances in this game actually make an impact in the way you play, down to what towns you should avoid and who you feel you can trust to talk to.

This game has managed to implement concepts (player-created items only and a balanced player-driven marketplace for example) and take them to a level that other MMORPGs can only dream of achieving. This is impressive since the development team are only 3-4 man strong.

If you're a fan of Ultima Online, Runescape or other hardcore MMORPGs for their full loot-drop and criminal systems then Mortal Online is the king of them at the moment. Only time will tell if other games on the horizon will knock MO off its pedestal, such as Life is Feudal, Gloria Victis or Chronicles of Elyria.

The game isn't without its flaws though. The dev team is small so major improvements take a long time. There are bugs and exploits that you will discover once you really get into the game. Fortunately they're not quite enough to stop me from playing.

My biggest bugbears with the game at the moment are:

* Lag spikes while crossing node lines
* Mobs sitting on node lines being invincible
* Blue text exploiting (Members of another guild that you're warred against can leave their guild and attack you without you knowing they're an enemy because their name text is blue instead of orange).
* Characters or pets getting stuck in the environment. Most of the time the /stuck command will get you out though.
* Most of the GMs are unhelpful. For example, report someone for blue text exploiting and they won't get punished.",1464170634,1464178720,True,12,0,0.562034189701080322,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I have been having an absolute blast playing Mortal Online! I love the game and I like how your FREE to choose what you want to do.

 The reason why there as many negative reviews as there are is because those players have been trapped in a bubble created by the other game makers. They don't know how to play these kinds of games where it takes thinking and they get frustrated and cry.

 I give this game the highest rating not because of graphics or how smooth it is or any of that stuff but because the game is a hidden gem and get to be creative and if I die in a harsh world then I get to LEARN from my mistakes and CREATE a new plan. Just the Theme of this game alone gets the highest rating.

 You want a great game with lots of choices to do? Then you will like this game. Want a game where the developers care about their game? This game has awesome developers who communicate with the players and are always trying to make it run as smooth as possible all while continuing to grow and expand not just in game size but in features and fun!

But there are not many games like this, with open PVP, and full-loot with no levels. There is a skill system where you need to specialize your character into a certain build with about 1100 possible skill points. Some skills are secondary and do not use this pool.

The game has a steep-learning curve, and the ability to be killed outside any major towns (and even within, but the person usually does not get away with it) may put new players off. But everybody dies. Money is as easy as farming NPC mobs which can be dull, but its not difficult. 

Combat is rewarding and also hard to learn, but this is not a casual's game.

If you have the majority of reviews of this game, most are written by either users who:

1. Played for 10 minutes.
2. Played for maybe a week.
3. Complain because others are better at the game.
4. Don't understand all games have bugs (Yes this one has quite a few, however this game is so good it doesn't matter since they are not game breaking, just irritating.)
5. (Probably the worst... ) Can't handle the player community of this game.. Yes, it's probably the worst community, not going to try and ignore this.  It's a Full loot PVP hardcore sandbox... its going to bring out the worst.

Me, I've played for several years, before mortal came to steam. With steam its getting alot better, and at a much faster rate. But it's brings COD fans, idiots, and immature user's who do not understand, or even like these sort of hardcore games.  I've dealt with countless bugs, the horrific community, and sadly, terrible customer support. 
But none of this, would ever weigh heavily enough to stop me from playing this game.  

I've always wanted a game like this, and this is exactly it. No other game offers what mortal online does. 

The combat: 

Melee: You have directional attacks, directional blocking, different damage types (Blunt, peircing, slashing) And armor/resisting the same (Blunt, peircing, slashing). So not only do you have a variety of how you attack, you have a variety of damage types. Once you learn the game enough you can look at another player and seeing their armor type, and materials it's made of, knowing what its weak/strong against. The combat in this game is the MOST fun I've experienced.  And the absolute best part, It's not super gear reliant. Myself and many others have defeated players with higher end gear, while being naked with a started sword known as ""worn shortsword"". So your not 100% screwed if they out gear you. This combat system is skill and knowledge based, not gear reliance based.  

What is there to do in mortal? Plenty. 

You can be a crafter, weaponsmith, armorsmith, cook, alchemist, tamer/breeder, miner, woodcutter, extractor, refiner, butcher, bowcrafter, engineer, and more. 

You can be a Footfighter with swords, axes, daggers, clubs, poleswords, fistfighter, mounted combat, mounted archery, a mage, a dominator who utilizes pets to fight with/for them. 

You can build your character to be however, and whatever you want. There are no restriction besides the total skillpoint usage. 

As far as the F2P, P2P, P2Win, etc. This game is NOT F2P. It is P2P with an infinite trial. However, you can play this game as F2P.. Just not as efficiently, and with crafting no one would not recommend it since you cannot make very good items without having max skills/lores.  PVE though, you can do everything a P2P player could do, if you have the combat skill,
To experience this game the way it is designed, and meant, then purchase a subscription, it is most definitely worth it.

If you do choose to give this game a try, don't be like the majority of others and just hang out in the starter zone. You will get angry, you will be dissapointed, and you will most likely quit playing the game. I think the starter town and how you start this game should be completely redone and reworked. But in the meantime, if you hang in there, ignore the idiots around you, then you will experience the game as it really is, and when looking at these reviews feel the same way I do which lead me to write my first game review. 

No matter how bad it pisses you off, no matter how angry people make you, you will always come back to mortal online, because its just that damn good.",1462554107,1463598717,True,93,9,0.800801396369934082,10,False,False,False,False,,,

ACT I

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.

It is not. It is simply p2p. Consider f2p as a kind of demo. You get to play the game and do almost everything there is in it, just nothing very well. Can you create the uber solo pvp warrior as an f2p? No, but that would be weird wouldn't it?
This game does not keep afloat offerin cosmetic micro-transactions like real f2p games but also not through micro-transactions giving real advantage like a p2w. In fact, there are no micro-transactions at all. This game makes it's money with player subscriptions and among those everyone is equal and nobody can buy an advantage.

This game is certainly unpolished, experiences lag, bugs and glitches but they are all while numerous, rather minor.

It makes up for it with the same aspects that are difficult to grasp for many new players, including me:
The players have to explore the world themselves. There is no in game map. Equiptment stats are never explicitely revealed. Players are given an approximaton of their different gear items' stats the accuracy of which depends on their skills with the various item types.
All of this plus the lack of quests telling you what to do next is frustrating to many expecting another game similar to what they have played before. You simply have to keep going and find a purpose for yourself in this world.
Join a guild and carve out your piece of it. Don't expect you and your 2 other f2p friends can just start the game and after 5 hours walk into an established guild's territory and take their stuff. If you could, something would be very wrong.

Give it a try. If you find something really wrong, write a bad review but please, don't do it simply because you'd prefer this game to be less free.",1461623979,1461919416,True,11,1,0.555060863494873047,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Игра с фуллутом, но в игре куча мест, где если персонажа убивают, лут остается на нем или по нему не проходит урон. К сожалению эти места статичны и все старички о них знают и активно их используют, более того построенную на этом месте крепость нельзя будет разрушить. Это только самый злобный баг. С чем еще встретился я : заклинило боевой режим( умер, не смог убежать от игрока), застрял в текстурах( многократно ), убегающий маунт через текстуры в никуда( да-да с вашим лутом), бегающие и бьющие через текстуры мобы, невидимые мобы,  прохождение через текстуры. Это только на вскидку + ознакомился с читвидео с ютубами, да-да, тут есть читаки, подкручивающие себе характеристики. Так что не удивляйтесь людям с не бесконечной стаминой. 
Как еще один минус игры - боевка, потрясающе отзывчивая, словно сердце вашей бывшей( направить удар и выставить блок нормально мышкой, практически не реально). Чаще всего вы будете бить пустое место, а противник будет лупить вас с растояния в 10 метров, вот такая вот система попаданий в этой игре. Весь бой больше похож на шоу бенни хила, все носятся туда-сюда в тяжелых доспехах, словно это тряпки. Проигрываешь - беги. Беги Форест ,через всю карту за подкреплением, а потом беги обратно, уже пытаясь догнать противника. А бой верхом - просто треш, лошадь разворачивается на 90 градусов на месте и проносится мимо вас на скорости сравнимой с ламборджини, если вы пеший, а против вас не имбецил, то можно просто остановится и стоять, пытясь блочить, один хрен он вас убьет. 

В целом игра не стоит потраченного на нее времени и денег( а без денег в нее играть НЕЛЬЗЯ, иначе вы будете слабее всех, умения персонажа будут работать только на 60%). Если вы не фанат извращений, проходите мимо.

And if you wander too far from the city guards you can be a victim of cold blooded murderers.

But within this hard world there is also unity and friendship. When the world is harsh you need to rely on friends and mates. Strenght comes from numbers. You can form guilds with your new or old friends or join any of the existing ones. There are guilds that do PvP battles, Crafting and trading, and even Thiefs have their own player guild for you to join. 

So you can choose any path that you want. Be it hero or villain. Mortal online offers you the chance to play as you like.

But be warned. Be prepared to lose all your har earned loot if you are not smart enough. This game definetly brings out emotions. Good and Bad.

I came into the game knowing if you die with things on you, you will likely never see those things again and I was fine with that. Then I found out after playing a couple hours that a single hit from a player will kill you and that was the end of that for me. This game is not skill based in the slightest simply because of that reason and it kills the fun. Hey just spent hours farming a certain area and are now overloaded so going to drop some things in your inventory and head back? Dead, without even knowing how. Going to look inside your bank to get some things out? Dead, oh but the guards killed your killer so don't mind that you lose everything on you still.

Archery gameplay is horrible, they tried to add in arrow drop to make it more ""realistic' my arrow can fly a foot before it will hit the ground not to mention it doesn't even come out where the aim marker is. Taming is a really cool idea, your pets die the moment you get them so now thats gone. The world looks like shit, people can say all they want ""games don't need good graphics"" but hell ya mmorpg really really really do. It's not enjoyable when half of your play time is spend wandering around twiddling your thumbs looking at shit untill you get to the destination. I still don't know how to revive could look it up but the fact that they don't tell me in game just tells me they don't want me to play. Why its not automatic the world will never know.

If only these survival games would stop doing the crap you lose everything if you die and just implement a player bounty system these games would be played more often, be more enjoyable, be a lot better. Anyone that bothers to tell me ""you got hit in the head"" I really don't care this is a game not real life you can't sacrifice mandatory game mechanics just because you want to make it more realistic.

It really is large for a game, though I have my doubts on it being THE game I hoped it would be..

Firstly to those who hate, this is my voice of experience; so go ahead and criticise me all you like, it won't do anything, feel free to express yourselves in comments if need be.

Now then, this world is vast; yes. It holds many adventures and as well as many issues to get your adventure going. We have a large assortment of beginning stats and such; but there is a cap unless you PAY for the game stuff. (Casual P2W scenario.). Another thing to notice is there is a time limit of protection, no matter where you are, even in the safest town; there WILL be PVP, so once you run out; you're screwed basically. Don't get me started on how bad the community is as well half the time..As well it's PERMA-DEATH; which means, you died? well lose all your stuff and give it to the enemy! HARDCORE MODE does not cope well with PVP.

Next, we have common gameplay; At first, you have no idea what you are in for, firstly, you have no idea what to do, or who to trust. So if you get stuck on something you gotta look up on how it works, though there is a help menu around there. Nxt, you gotta do a LOT of running back and forth for a measly tutorial. The keys are all a mess to get control of on the top hotbar, the abilities and such are confusing at times, and well...It can be fluent if you learn to control it. As for getting out of the city; you can't simply leave if you let your timer run out; you gotta go out there with basically pimped armor and everything. So you're outta luck if you can get out at all. If you have troubles as well with some deadbeat loser assaulting you you literally have to type ""Guards!"" in the chat for them to help at all which is a bit of a bad feature.

Finally; Building. We all been waiting for this open world stuff right? Well this one does not really fail on it's {SANDBOX} feature. You firstly have to get a Muel, which costs a lot itself, nextly we need the materials and tools. These are what are the biggest pains to get, the tools themselves either cost a lot, or are hard to get the materials for. It can be annoying yes; but it is all worth it in the end. Once you have the proper tools, you can start building, and crafting the landscape to your needs. Though the issue is having to travel far and wide to even find the needed supplies for the most part, overall, the building feature is unique and a nice touch!


Final result?: This game is unique, and have mixed feelings, but over all, leaning towards a no, sorry to the devs.",1458347551,1458347551,False,2,1,0.424926042556762695,1,False,False,False,False,,,

This game takes alot of time and money to become powerful. Unless you have a group to play with, or plan on finding a good group (not many out there but they can be found), you may want to keep searching. 


PS. If you are thinking about building a house in a sweet ass spot on the map, this is also not the game for you.

PPS. After many hours I have come to find that the game is no longer what it was intended to be. the game is designed to have you pay for it, then get your friends to pay for it. After that, they will start banning your guildmates for nothing less then a shot at another subscription. Dont buy into this garbage. it looks good at the first sight but they are constantly trying to find ways to make you waste your time so that the next month with come around before you can get anything done.

The  banking system is town based and the only real safe place to store any loot as the game is complete loot drop upon death for every player making the PvP not only interesting but a reason for bandits to hunt other players However the guild based system makes regions of land in the game player owned and can be ruled with an iron fist or a laxed bandit mentality depending on the players.

I recently got back into the game, to see how it was doing out of curiosity. Honestly? It much better then it was. The devs have stepped up, putting forth some much needed effort towards updating, general playability, and perhaps most importantly, there moderation staff since I last played. the improvment is noticable in many many MANY areas. I actually found myself enjoying things.

I won't go into details on all the good as I'm not exactly experianced, but I will say, I am one for improvment and improvment has not only happened, but it's continuing to happen.
I will say I still have some issues, but things that I can look past. I write this after having several days of work ruined by having some hard earned savings pickpocketed as I was in the middle of spending it towards a loadout, and seeing as I don't have much time to play anything anymore, learning that you can just turn right around and bank it without any reprecussions or need for fear certanly had me fuming. Feels like a bit of an advantage P2Ps have that you really can't counter if your poor. Don't get me wrong, I get that playing this F2P is more akin to playing a demo then anything else in this game, but dividing your playerbase in this manner has always rubbed me the wrong way.

Those are the only positives. 

When originally released in 2010 this game had potential, unfortunatley this potential has been squandered by poor development prioritization and an inability to bring the game's stability and playability up to a satisfactory state. 6 years on new players will notice that mortal online feels like any other game's alpha test, riddled with critical world breaking bugs that are created almost as fast as they are solved, leaving the game in a state of perpetual brokenness. 

The developers will say, ""its better than it was on release!"" and while that is true in some aspects, now there is far more in-game to be broken and the same percentage of content is broken as was on release. Ultimatley the current state of the game speaks for itself, to illustrate: nearly a year on from the second continent, sarducca's, release, guilds on the other side of the world are assigned ownership of towns on the wrong continent, due to a simple oversight to add a new coordinate system for the new continent. Countless similar problems in the game's foundations sit well documented yet the developers press on with adding trivial scribing minigames that will likely be broken within a year and not be fixed for another two.

The excuse for this is always that their (contracted) artists cant fix bugs in their game, or that only some of their programmers can fix bugs, and yet here we are 6 years on and those artists sit bored diluting the game's original gritty swedish art style with ugly capes, cartoony spike armor, rams with spikes intersecting player models, lizard mounts, halloween helmets, and phallic player houses. It's long past time when they should have fixed their priotoriazation, for artists to be fired and programmers to be hired for the express purpose of fixing all the game's issues, yet this has not been done, 6 years on. Instead, excuses are proffered where applicable and otherwise only silence is heard. 

You would think in a harsh full loot game measures would be taken to ensure when you lose everything, the game intended for you to die. Instead you will find yourself dying more often to client crashes, buggy ai, and hackers than other players(hackers who are often let back into the game by starvault only to be banned twice more). There is one area of the game that is polished enough to be enjoyed, and that is foot pvp, which is currently one of the only reasons large groups play the game. Even here, balance issues, node-wide crashes that leave dozens of people's clients crashed, and various other issues are rampant. The developers of this game rarely listen to community feedback, even when there was a dedicated balance testing team, they were largely ignored and it took teeth pulling for tiny numbers changes. The rare instances where Starvault makes changes suggested by the community, they shout it from the rooftops as if to try to paint a very different picture from the reality, ""We listen sometimes!"" Yeah, great.

Newbies will find that their first character will likely need to be deleted and remade unless they followed a guide, as of the tens of thousands of potential race, size, and age combinations, only about 6 are viable for combat, with a bit more room given to crafting characters whos attributes simply don't matter outside of int. Most crafting characters in MO are dull to play, taking up a whole character slot just for you to sit in town yellspamming your wares, assuming you don't take the sane route and simply keep that character logged off the majority of the time until you need him. 6 is an improvement from the 2 combat races that were viable on release, but when such a huge depth of customization is available, so few choices means the race system feels arbitrary and poorly balanced. Ultimatley the game's character system does not give the flexability to players that it claims to, in fact limiting it more and more as changes such as dex tiering are made, which causes dex to only matter at arbitrary milestones (110, 93, 119, 85 etc)

To top it off, Starvault maintains immense disrespect for the small playerbase by running their official forums poorly, advising moderators to ban anyone who is negative about the game. For example, ""its not worth promoting the game in it's current state"" will net you a ban. The game's forums are considered extremely toxic due to moderation that shuts down legitimate discussion while allowing trolling to thrive. Website ticket support answers only once every two emails you send, and in-game support is a mixture of unhelpfulness and complete incompetence. Expect to be lied to by game masters ingame, who despite their status don't understand basic gameplay mechanics and are a nightmare to deal with. Expect to be temporarily jailed by a game master if one of their buddies complains that you must have used cheats to kill their naked character. Expect policies as amazingly stupid as asking you to ""contact a gm before you kill a boss mob"" just to ensure the loot your entire group worked for appears at all. 

Client performance is poor, settings menus are often nonfunctional, and keybinding is a nightmare unless you edit the .ini text files which also happens to carry the penalty of an in-game permenant ban, if you are caught. Why they think editing a text file on your computer should be bannable speaks to their incompetence, and also the lack of functioning anticheat, demonstrated (there is no information or guides on how to cheat, exploit, or hack in my link or linked from my link, just a demonstration of the hacking issues that plague the game) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuS_UhTdKY

First of all its F2P so players who pay obviously get the advantage. Also the combat system is a little wacky, and the tutorial is little to none. The world is vast and amazing, but only players who pay are allowed to explore it, since F2P players cant even get strong enough to kill the things outside the castle. Overall the game was a fun experience, i LOVE the concept of no levels and being able to get as strong as you want to be, but i just dont think the game is worth the subscription price.

well... not exactly... it had been a few months, as i had read the reviews and alot of them were negative, and cried wolf alot...
Such as issues with hackers and etc.
So anyways, here is the viewpoint of a fresh player, whom wanted the ""good old days"" of MMoRPG's back but could not find it...

Seemingly, this game is all about PVP, anyone can kill you, anywhere, besides guarded zones. (they can still kill you just they will call forth the wrath of the GAURDS!)
Though, if you actually get past the beginning phase, (you are very low level, so your movement and various other skills are low so things take ages. though, you level up very rapidly just by walking/sprinting etc) you will notice, that outside of the towns is very sparse, there are player made castles scattered throughout the landscape, and most players you meet in the wild are just there to do their business, and avoid you....

This game brings back how MMO's used to feel, killing a mob was an accomplishment, getting that new skill to max level excited you, as you could now focus on more cool stuffs, and exploring the game didn't auto level you to the current zones levels automatically...
If you go too far too fast, a wolf will kill you, a spider queen will eat you, etc.
Also, just as with MMo's of the past, if you were skilled enough, you could do things that were insane.... 
Such as parrying every blow to previous spider queen, and manage to get some good stuffs instead of with a party etc.

This game emphasizes stats and skills, but it also promotes personal player skill aswell, if you suck, no weapon in the game will help you agains that newb in rags that can parry your attacks. 

Yes, its a challenge, Yes its painful, But why would you want to play if it was easy?",1454572936,1454573078,True,14,0,0.551060736179351807,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Good Game.
Shittier Community than most internets.
---------
That being said, the base game and idea behind it are quite good, if buggy at times. However, in the few years I have played and been a part of this community (Pre-Steam) I have yet to see any guild or players with good intentions last long. Combining exploitable mechanics such as ""Blue-Blocking"" to kill players without repercussion and, at least for awhile, corrupt moderators that would largely help their guild with said powers, and some donation bias, it is easy to see why this general attitude could have sprung up in the community. However, if you can find a solid group of people and deal with the sometimes....rather incompitent developers, this is one unique MMO I would suggest to anyone. It's PvP is fun, and over the patches can be either well balanced to entertainingly broken. (I'm looking at you mounted archery) The crafting system and player driven economy have the potential to be amazing, with flexibility in the materials and styles allowing players to make the epic items most other MMO's have premade. Again, the biggest thing inhibiting all this is the community, though. It is quite popular to keep the best weapon recipes a secert from the general public, and much of the robbery and attacks on the guilds in the game happen when the guild is largey offline. (In the style of Ark: Survival Evolved, Rust, etc.) Overall, it is worth a try, but you need a strong resiliance to bullshit to make it anywhere.",1454561771,1454561771,True,4,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game elements are easily identifieble and like any other MMORPG this one is 'pay to win' with the free accounts serving as a permanant trial, being unable to progress into a situation where your character has any chance against: guilded players marauding the countryside, lone horsemen murdurers, pick pockets, 'low level' griefers, fatigue free hostile animals and many more, I find it difficult to find the positive in a 'full loot' environment where 4+ hours of grinding can be erased with a stroke of another player's hand (or a mouse click rather)

The combat system is clunky. The animations are delayed on both attacking and defending making the victor 'he who has a lower ping' combined with 'he who has managed to attain a powerful weapon'. Stamina is easily depleted and forces the player to stop and stand in place, or submit to a static animation (sleep or sit) and 'ranking' it up requires well thrice more investment in time spent training one specific skill. (or multiple skills) and similar goes for the majority of the other 'skills' that I've learned about. Certain portion of the 'skill tree' seem redundant- for example, the multiple different kinds of anatomy studies acquired when skinning different animals, or the variation of wood type lore which all feel like a weighted shackle on the road to adventure.

This MMO failed to deliver me with a unique immersion and like other similar (LIFYO for example) it funnels down to a grinding game, which completely beats the notion of Role Playing to me and leaves me questioning the purpose of an anarchy situation. Are they hoping that the players create the story? And if so, how could they if they are always busy killing each other? - With guilds involved I was speculating this might be the answer but to my disappointment the guild scene is a closed clique party with most guild towns being locked under passowrd or a sassy toll.

If you are expecting an immersive story where you might create your character and bring it into a story based adventure, this is not your stop. - If you are, however, just looking for a grinding & power building game, this is it!

As far as the technicalities go;
The game world is detailed compared to other MMOs i've seen recently. It is however not as large as I've hoped it would be. (in 7 hours i've explored most of the main continent) The tutorial which grants you some basic items and skill knowledge is very to the point and fluid making it easy for everyone to understand. The time divisiion is quite fair, with night time not being too dark and day time not being too bright and the over-all scenery is very nice with how the moon is possibly the planet and the game world being the moon in this setup (speculation only). 

In short, I feel that this game focuses too much on statistics, attirbutes and other red tape rather than the immersion of adventure and discovery which is why I feel it's less RPG and more MMO and I would not recommend it at this point of writing.",1454213861,1454213861,False,5,2,0.543189346790313721,0,False,False,False,False,,,

          4. All 400 of the active community have aids. Greedy pricks.
          5. Some GM's abuse their huge e-peen. Much violation, such gape.
          6. Back to point 1, most of my hours logged were spent mining. Manual mining, getting my donks greifed.
          7. Broken Blue/Red murder system. Not enough consequence so everyone is KoS.
          8. ""What m8, I Hit your head but combat log says I hit you in the foot?"" <----point number 2.
          9. Travelling in this game is a joke. you need to spend primary points to be able to ride a horse quickly. lowering your combat build should you choose to NOT be a mounted combat char. Thus leaving you to walk around like a peasant.
          10. DISMOUNT AXES? really. not..like.....spears????.....halberds? axes.double axes dismount calvary.MUCH CLARITY. But dismount axes some flatline bullshit chance to dismount based on how expensive the weapon is.Recently MAGES can now 100% auto dismount with earthquake (earthquake is an AoE) 
          11. Community is aids so you need to make 4 accounts just to get any sort of production going.1 char to be a butcher, 1 to be a foot soldier, 1 to be a mage, 1 to be a fatmage,1 to be an armorcrafter, 1 to be a weaponcrafter, 1 to be a cook...its actually genius how they force you to create so many ugly characters.
          12. Personal oppinion, but the Roman theme is ugly as sin. Horribly implimented, ugly ugly ugly.
          13. AI is dumb as shit. Sh*t is smarter than this AI. I apologize to sh*t.

Pro`s
           1. They spent way too much time on the sky, its amazing.. weather system is in too..but its broken and extremely lacking in organic performance. You see no clouds but its raining...FOG and clouds but no rain...silly. lots of stars.
           2. At least they let you AFK macro to level up skills. Unfortunately alot of people have trainers and hacks too...Mostly  the russian players...scrubs hack with infinite stamina and abuse lag switching.


Even the pro`s have con`s, Basically... to get anywhere in this game I gave up my personal life, my gym time, brushing my teeth, eating, all so i could get more time to bang rocks to turn into metals to make armor and weapons. Then find out there is like no more fights. When there is a fight its a fucking zerg fest. 1 month later i realize they are full of false promiises and gave up. Fanboys have been playing since release and wont let this bowl of d1cks die. NOT WORTH AAA SUBSCRIPTION PRICE. honestly... i focking hate world of warcraft, i would rather play world of warcraft.

     While the Game itself has one of the best concepts and a decent excution of a full loot sandbox many players will find it to frustrating to  really enjoy. The community is aweful, the worst i have ever experienced in any game i have ever played. Just look at the forumns and youll get an idea of what im talking about. Thats not to say everyone playing mortal is aweful, but 60%of players will kill you just to kill you and 85% will kill you if they think it will get them good loot. 
   I have come to enjoy the game over all for the momments when that player that attacked you bit of more then they can chew or when you stumble on a robbery in progress just in time to turn the battle into a win for the innocent. This game isnt for everyone. Heck, its not going to be for most but few hardcore games are. 
PROS
*Combat system is both fun and ""skill"" really can help.
*Every interaction with a player is exciting.
*Player driven economy/world
*Really cool and refreshing skills gaining mechanic( you have to use it to get better)
*Havent done much crafting myself but there is really awesome depth to it.
CONS
*Full loot means a death can set you back hours..
*The Community is aweful
*There are still exploits
*Blue blocking ( This is when a player jumps infront of your attack so you hit them, now they can kill you with out being a murder.)

Упор боевой системы делается не на то какое у вас оружие либо броня, хотя тоже играет роль, и не на то на сколько прокачан ваш персонаж, прокачать которого может любой за 1-2 недели, а главным образом на вашу личную тактику ведения боя. Как вы двигаетесь, когда бежите, когда прыгаете, куда бьете и как. 
Очень глубоко проработанная система крафта: оружие, броня, зелья, еда. Громадный выбор материалов. И только найдя баланс между вложением ресурсов и рецептом, который нужно самому вывести – есть счастье. 
Из сложностей, из-за которых за годы моей игры люди уходили из игры могу выделить:
- Песочница, нет квестов, нет заданий ты сам ищешь себе занятие, если не можешь и не хочешь играть в месте скоро наскучит.
- необходимость покупки подписки для любителей пвп, очень серьезный перевес между проплаченным аккаунтом и не проплаченным в пвп и крафте. 60% эффективности всех скилов.
- фул лут. При вашей смерти с вас выпадает абсолютно все: броня, оружие все содержание карманов, деньги и даже ваша голова и тело =) И врагу достается все 100% что у вас было.
- отсутствие безопасной зоны, вас могут убить где угодно.
- отсутствие в игре карты, из навигации есть только компас.
- чат работает только на английском языке. Локальный в паре метров вокруг вас, гильдейский и чат помощи в котором можно писать только по-английски никакого русского английскими буквами – бан в чате.

1) The confusing skill/interface system. I was supposed to gather leather from skinned pigs, right? Well, clicking the skill icon in the skills pane and trying to drag them to my hotbar worked half the time. Sometimes it would just drop the icon. It just wasn't clear on what I was supposed to do with it.

2) Walking and running are SLOW. Even though you're supposed to train yourself over time, you walk at the same pace you'd crouchwalk in other games. Running is not even noticeably faster and drains your stamina. It's useless.

3) The arrow that tells you where to go for quests misleads you. It pointed me in a zig zag pattern. One moment, it said go to this area. I'd go there, then it'd jerk to the left and say go that way. Then again to a different area.

Why there is a house spot on a node line? it is not my fault please move bank because we didnt know. They said no you have to deal with that problem we dont give a shit. 

So i built another town in another continent name sarducca. Again a node line. Can not build any shit in our territory because they say they blocked it. wasted like 3000 gold. they say they wont help. So why put house spots just near the node lines?

Just dont waste your time with that game. They dont give a shit about their customers.

Thieves are amazing, but once people learn your username it's time to move out of that town. In this game there is no honor among thieves, they will push you hoping you're hidden grey. I believe shortly before I quit they revamped the stolen item system though. People camping Tindrem gates for new players is moreso a myth, unless it's picked up the past few months. I didn't kill anyone unless they became a threat, our alliances were at war, or they'd personally wronged a friend/ally. However people typically attacked my Mounted Archer on sight because he was a sp00ky red character.

This map to my knowledge still needs exploring. A high ranking member of my alliance had found a hidden dungeon which we had never encountered anyone else at. I believe only around 9 players in our alliance had stepped foot in it by the time I'd quit. The boss room took all 9 of us to do and due to the large number of spellcasters we'd still suffered 2 casualties our first few times through.

I will return when I have the money to subscribe again, as I've begun to miss one of the few games which doesn't baby its players.

In comparison to TERA and Planetside 2, I can run both at 50 fps with Medium / Low Settings when surrounded by numerous players. MO just simply won't run without stuttering on Awful settings. Its just not playable for some people.

Developers say that blueblocking is a mechanic that can be avoided, but what happens when a group of griefers surrounds you and the mob you are attacking? If you push too much against other players, you get flagged as a criminal, if you hit any of the players surounding you , you get flagged as a criminal.

So much unused potential.

One only has to go as far as check the reviews and steamcharts of this game to see the sucess of the steam release.

http://steamcharts.com/app/287920

For the past one to two years they've been progressing backwards in development effectively removing features from the game.

The game lacks sufficient funding and competent developers in order for the game to be developed at an acceptable phase. A certain stubborn CEO made sure the steam release wouldn't succeed.

There's so many placeholders in the game of content that hasn't been released yet being added into the game over three years ago.

A proper magic system,Tailoring,Fletching,Sarduccan papyrus,pottery and the list goes on.

A toxic and stubborn community. Granted the game was released back in 2010 and a big portion of the people that still play the game have been since release.

Anything negative posted about the game on the forums will end in a swift locked thread and anything too critical will be terminated. The Mortal Online Forums has a no tolerance policy for negative criticism. The Forums are regulated in a similar fashion of an oppressive regime.

Are you willing to play a game which is basically in a pre-alpha stage with various bugs such as items in your inventory becoming invisible same for your bank, pets getting stuck,enemies being invulnerable to damage and mind you all of these issues exist in a full loot pvp game. And getting help usually takes a very long time.Aswell as having to deal with a support team that's terrible.

Overall the game suffers from lack of funding,incompetent develeopment,support team and the CEO has personally interfered with the game disregarding what's best for the game in order to fulfill his ''vision''.

Also.. The game's lore is supposedly written in 'Advanced Swedish' a language unknown to myself and being a swede myself that's rather odd. Appearently they haven't been able to find a person to translate it for the past 5 years.

The game lost roughly 81% of the steam population during the first 4 months of it being released.
The population of the game is not large enough to support the ingame economy that it is designed to have forcing everyone to be self sufficient, subscribe 1-2 accounts and have 4 character slots each and you have to pay.

A couple of my major gripes..

1) Graphics look like they are from the Everquest days. However, the inexusable part is the terrible modeling done by the designers. The textures/models  are so heavily reused.. they need some variety and stop painting the world with the same generic rock terrains. 

A simple example was the frill grass poking up from the starting towns fountain.. just raise the base height to hide the frill. That's just lazy modeling by the developers. It looks terrible to have the grass poking out of the middle of a stone fountain.. (Which used the same stone texture without any shaders.. Very ugly to look at - Ingame is far uglier than the screenshots)

2) Combat was ok.. The fact that archery hits are calculated client side on the archer's machine is a bit annoying. It doesn't account for leading or latency. 

I admit that I didn't give it much time to get into deeper aspects of combat, but I can't get past how ugly the game is.. 

3) Min/Max builds only - It seems the game has only a few viable builds, though it offers numerous skills. So, this leaves most people with a cookie cutter planner for maxing their toon.. It seems you end up with a minimum of three characters to experience the full gameplay  - One PvP, and two crafters.  

This was off putting for me.. I have a full schedule, so leveling / managing three characters is not appealing. I prefer to have one character that I can spend building up.. I really don't want to waste time switching characters just to keep the cash flowing - that seems like just a time sink to avoid creating content. 

If you enjoy hardcore pain.. (Such as drowning in a fountain, lol) You might like this one, but if you are like me and want to play a game that is less work and more entertainment, then stay away. The full loot and heavy PvP lured me in to give it a try.. but ultimately, it was just too ugly to give it much of a chance.",1451373735,1451373735,False,4,1,0.473557919263839722,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game's concept of doing what you want with massive freedom sounds great.

The game does a good idea of being harsh on the player, and that's okay. but when it nullifys 30 hours of gameplay, that's when it starts to become total bullshit.

Don't get me wrong, I love combat system, it requires skill and timing, punishes you for trying to spam attacks or not blocking properly, but honestly when it comes to kill monsters most of them have animations that don't match the hits, you get hit and then the attack animation shows up, or the opposite, you see the animation is coming so you try to block and you get hit right after.

Everything else looks great tho, exploring is amazing, the game actually looks good (do not trust youtube videos, it looks better than that), skill system is amazing, crafting is great.

É sandbox, mundo aberto e hardcore.

Uma característica marcante do jogo é a liberdade, não há necessariamente uma escolha de classes. Ao terminar o tutorial, você pode escolher uma "" profissão "" como Domador, com foco no controle dos animais, que vão desde cavalo até montarias impressionantes, Ferreiro que tem foco no crafiting, entre outras. Não significa que você passará o resto do jogo com elas, é apenas uma ajuda no início pra facilitar um pouco sua vida. O que vai definir o quão bom você será em tal profissão é o nível da suas skills, que aumentam conforme você pratica elas ou lê livros em segundo plano com assuntos relacionados as skills em foco. Por isso, não ache que vai começar o jogo domando uma montaria de guerra ou fabricando espadas com alto dano, é necessário tempo e prática para tal.  

Ao terminar o tutorial e escolher a "" profissão "" o jogo é livre e você pode fazer o que você quiser. Normalmente, você vai querer matar alguns zombies no cemitério de Tindrem, colher o loot deles e fazer algum dinheiro com isso, comprar uma armadura simples, uma boa arma e até uma montaria. Quando se cansar disso, sinta-se livre para sair de Tindrem. Eistem várias cidades, como Meduli e Vadda, que apresentam mais variedade de recursos que Tindrem. Você pode ainda ir para Sarducca, um deserto com alguns cidades e, segundo os jogadores, com bastante oportunidades para fazer dinheiro. Juntar-se a uma guild e participar de guerras e disputas por territórios também é uma opção. Se quiser ganhar a vida matando outros players, mesmo que inocentes, tem total liberdade para isso. Existem várias formas de se jogar Mortal Online, basta explorar o jogo e elas apareceram. 

Vou deixar algumas dicas que podem ajudar caso esteja começando a jogar:

Cuidado com os jogadores de nome vermelho, são chamados de Reds e costumam matar com frequência pessoas inocentes.
Deixe tudo de valor no banco da cidade. Você pode morrer com facilidade e perder tudo que produziu.

I recommend it for these reasons as a newbie who has no idea what he is doing after spending a fair few hours into the game.

+ You can tame a horse,
+ You can run around naked
+ You can go where ever you please,
+ You can kill any player you like in town center but then you have to suffer the consequences of all the guards attacking you,
+ Being Dead is kinda cool,
+ VOIP in an mmorpg? Awesome
+ Combat is decent,
+ It is like skyrim gameplay but more hardcore
+ It is very hardcore and may be a bit too hard for some as there is few basic tutorial but no hand holding and nothing to really guide you or anything this is good for people who are sick of games that are like only tell you what to do and basically you end up playing the game following what the game wants you to do rather than what you want to do. In this game you do what you want to do
+ You feel so free in this game, you dont feel held back
+ Graphics are pretty nice when turned up (if you can run it)
+ This game feels truly massive, as in you feel like you need a horse just to get any where it feels like your off on an adventure
+ Soundboards in town is fun you can make a party with other players happen
+ So much crafting and learning
So much to do. 
You can eat yourself
+ Swords, Magic, bow.. 
+ Its sorta like lord of the rings esque type of game in a way like open world and swords and magic and stuff..
+ Feels so free, you don't feel held back freedom is nice

Cons: Stuff you may not like
- Graphics do look a bit dated
- It is a resource hog this game, requires lots of rams and gpu memory
- Its a little too hardcore and i dont understand quests or anything
- You need to pay subscription if you play a lot so you dont feel held back when it comes to some parts of the game such as the building thing and erm levels
- It is a little too easy to get lost even in town
- Game is maybe a bit too big in some ways it feels overwhelming when you starting to realize how much you do in this game and how much you need to do just to get started.
-After a few basic tutorials game is like.. kk hav fun m8.. No guidance or anything.
-Lack of tutorials and walkthrough on youtube its so hard to get going in this game
- Maybe a bit too time consuming and your like oh shizwak i gotta go to bed because im working soon and i havent slept
- Solo is overwhelming, best off with a friend
- Lack of enterable places like in town your pretty much always outside. Apart from the bank but thats pretty much it
- Even cutting trees down for logs in this game can be a tough thing to figure out
- Help chat doesn't give you enough time - usage for getting going in this game you have so many questions to ask but yet this game refuses to really give you help with that
- How the hell does magic work in this game?

I installed in initially and found out my computer was not capable of playing with good FPS but I tried.  After dying once, it took my 30 minutes to make it to the resurrection priest due to the video lag.  Once I upgraded my computer, I had great FPS, not that the graphics are that good, but I wanted to love this game so I overlooked it.

I was invited to a guild/clan whatever and was given basic instructions on how to get to their town.  I was killed so many times that I decided to walk for hours as a ghost so that I wouldn't die so much.  I walked in the world for 2 days, real days, about 4 hours each day searching for this town and got so lost, I deleted the character and started over again. 

This time I was determined to like this game by not leaving the town I started in and level up going into the graveyard.  This is where the irritation set in.  You need to kill zombies and skeletons and then hurry as fast as possible to collect your loot because people just stand around you waiting and then steal it.  When they are not doing that, they purposely jump in from of you trying to make you hit them so you become wanted and the town guards kill you.  Once you die in the graveyard, good luck walking around finding the closest resurrection priest, there isn't one very close, then you have to go back.

Free to play accounts or ""unlimited trial accounts"" are a gimped feature. If you aren't going to pay for the game don't bother playing it you won't be strong enough to kill most mobs, and you definitely won't be able to kill most players.

Griefing is incredibly serious, the only hardcore part of it is blue blocking. If you plan on trying to grind up gold as a noob you'll be in the tindrem graveyard, if you're there there are always players trying to grief you. They will run at max pay2win speed and stand in front of you or attempt to sprint into your swing from the side so they can then kill you, steal all your shit and receive no penalty for doing this. I realize it says it's a hardcore game but this isn't something that should be allowed, gm's should ban for this but they refuse to take any kind of action for it and instead the community just says ""STOP CRYING GET GOOD."" This isn't how you bring players into a game that is clearly dying, this isn't how you introduce new gamers into a great genre of games. If the admins/gm's don't wise up and start banning people for blue blocking this game is dead in 1-2 years tops.

I thought, ""Well these people have made a game that some speak highly of, it seems to be riddled with awesome features and I love the freedom described.  Maybe they actually made something good out of UE!""

...  Nope.  At first it wasn't bad... although running felt like walking, and sprinting felt like... walking.  According to the built-in ""GPS"" arrow navigation... ""thing"", I calculated my full-on sprint speed at about 1.3m/s.  Iunno about you guys, but my 5 year old can sprint faster than that.  

But I got over the twelve minutes to get to the first ""quest"" giver and was finally able to draw my sword and try my hand at the combat.  Wasn't bad, I gotta say.  Killed a few piggies.  Actually put a little faith back in me... so I did another 12 minute ""sprint"" to the town gates and was given a bow for returning captain whats-his-name's dagger. (Actually wanted the dagger, damnit...).

I equipped the bow and 25 nub arrows, thought to myself ""Awhhhhh this is gonna be sweet!"", took aim at a tree about 25 meters in front of me for a nice practice shot, and as I held the LMB to draw the bow, my characters arm did some wierd bending backwards thing like he was trying to grab his elbow.  Just looked downright goofy.  I thought, ""Oh god, really?""...  I released the LMB to fire my arrow at full draw...  It went about 10 meteres and hit the dirt at a 90 degree angle..  That's right...  Either gravity is excessive in this midieval world, or the bow and arrow I was given as my starting weapon is basically a twig with a rubber band drawstring.

What can I say? The first impressions were less than great, especially when I couldn't log in the game for any apparent reason for months.
Oddly enough, the next day after posting that review, suddenly I'm able to log on. Coincidence? 



So, after actually getting to play and experience the game, here's what I have to say:

First, I'm sincerely glad I gave it another try. The experience of this game is like none other, that's the truth.

The world of Nave is a bittersweet landscape, a twist of beauty and terror. You can explore EVERYTHING, you can FIGHT everything. However, EVERYTHING is DANGEROUS.

Swimming is dangerous, pvp is hell, standing in a desert or blizzard is deadly, your friends are deadly, the city guards are out to get you if you aren't careful.      This game should be titled:  50000 ways to die in an MMO.

The enivronment is gorgeous.  The land is huge, the water is breath-taking (literally), the sky is awespiring, the cities are quite regal (Though I wish we could enter more buildings than a bank.) The Music is very attractive and helps you connect to the game.

The combat system is an amazement. Some people say it's basic and boring,  I say it's quite tactical.  In WoW you can macro everything you want to do to a single key-press and spam it.   In Mortal Online, you have to AIM for weak spots with your weapon.   The combat of this game is more engaging than ANY I have encountered, even in console single-player games.

The major downside of this game is that the community is very, very toxic. I recommend finding a guild as soon as possible to help remedy this. (Shout out to my HERO friends!) After joining the HERO guild, they immediately took me under-wing, taught me more about the game and have been very patient with me. 


There are some limitations to the game for free to play players.  However with enough skill, know-how, and knowledge of the game itself and what gear it has to offer, a F2p can go toe-to-toe with a P2p any day. It's all about reaction time and accuracy. 

Soon I will begin toying around with construction, we'll see how that goes.

Still negitive but not as much...
Mortal is going ""In Opinion"" is going downhill yet again...
with mortal royal and seb working on his cat game theres no time put in to updates..
so the community's pvp side is stuck waiting for royal release and a good amount of th community's pve side is stuck playing a game that may or maynot continue updating let alone being kept a-float.

theres definitly a great number of things that can save the community.
I truely doubt that the staff will take into consideration my ideals.

1. A full wikipidia page with all possible information on the game. (For New Players, because i for a fact know Veteran Players I being one with-hold alot of information)
2. more pve content, dungeons, craftables, ect... (Potions for example Mana/stamina) (Different styles of fishing) (More Creatures, hoping some sub humanoids Dom/tameables...)
3. Adding spells that being the placeholders in the game! (this one ive been waiting for... at this point idk if ill ever see that...)
4. Things new players can do! (Alot of new players come into the game and have issues building up due to lack of being in a guild or even them wanting to play solo... not alot of early game content... tons of endgame content...)

I truely dont wanna see this game die and i also want to see how this royal game plays out...
but i also think hynrech needs to reach out for help at this point cause this game could take a leap into a spikepit at a blink of an eye.
2 actual programmers atleast from what I've heard from people that know the staff... is not enough, atleast to dish out content for your current playerbase as small as it is...

real quick i dont mind being in bits in peices because the game is equal to my review bahaha but jokes aside putting a ""Tutorial Island"" isnt adding content for new players... its updating a perfictly fine tutorial and defeats the purpose of yellow flagging!

90% factual

You guys are losing the vision trying to keep new players but looking streight threw them.
that being said 80% of the time the staff are pretty down to earth i am speaking of Farmer Joe (Seb) and Discord (not the app) reasonable guys respond quickly on discord ""the app this time"" and through email.
Henriech not so much have yet to have a convorsation and ive been playing early alpha release (Sad life for me)

There's no point in playing this game.

Because at any point in time, my pet can die with thousands of gold worth of mats on it due to a bug, and if I don't record it, ALL mytime. All my gains are lost.

And when I contact YOUR GM's, to get assistance, their response is:

""I cannot resurrect dead pets.""

'Can you at least check the logs to see what happened to it? I'm telling u it was stuck on a nodeline, and I was down the hill when it got killed by mobs due to being stuck.'

""I cannot check what happened. I cannot resurrect dead pets.""

This is UN-FAIR. I shouldn't have to deal w/ this. What are you charging me 13 bucks a month for? What kind of customer service, is this?

It's not the lack of content that drives your players away.

It's your complete lack of understanding that the QUALITY of your game, is more important than the amount of CONTENT you put into the game. You release another continent, but completely forget about the fact that your game is plagued with more bugs than Egypt during Exodus.

:rolleyes:


You got pets in MoKi spider cave, they BOUNCE up into another room. Aggro the mobs up there, and then bounce down, and start getting killed by mobs THROUGH the walls, and you can't even attack them because - IN THE WALLS.

Like... What is this?!

This isn't some ""steam noob"", either Henrik / Seb.

This is a player that's been subbing 10 accounts for over 3 years. I've played this game extensively and this isn't some player that quits when the population is low. I've played almost consecutively beside breaks for up to a month.

From a player that actually LIKES the game?

Fix your game. I rarely get mad at your bugs, but this one REALLY got to me. How do I lose all my stuff, and I can't get it back, due to GM's not having the proper tools to know what went down in the damned game.

After spending all this time saying the same stuff over and over again, when, oh WHEN are you gonna pull your heads out of your butts and start polishing the damn game, and not leaving us in the dark like you're not providing a PRODUCT?!

unlimited trial need to sub for competitive playin... what can i say about MO?? well... its a certain type of mmo that caters to those that like to work for their own gear and have the freedom to become a ""good"" or ""badguy"". there are alot of negative reviews because to go from noob ----> pro or atleast average is a giant leap. the learning curve is steep and unless you seek help from a guild will be a long journey of being ganked/robbed/eaten/zerged and my all favourite blueblocked. i myself am currently a solo player that gets mercyless killed at the drop of a hat from many players but that is to be expected from being solo. Ive met some other solo players that join longstanding guilds to quitting and making a tempory new guild. This game has very intense moment to some very dull moments. atm the population from steam release has dropped to a sweet spot of 300 to 500 and all the problems from server restarts and long queue join times is nonexistant. there are many bugs that need addressing from random character animations (on horse mainly) and npcs being able to walk through walls and shoot you from inside of them.
Pros: hard and gritty
great community(with a couple of griefers)
full loot drop
many variations character classes(build to your playstyle)
playerskilled based
roleplay friendly
can eat own head

Cons:needs some rebalancing 
steep learning curve(though i liked it)
old engine
glitches
the random and occasional griefers(when i say griefers i mean priest spawn killers or vets prerying in GY)

i give this game 7/10 
its my type of game but many wont/cant appreciate the hard and grittyness of this game.
TLDR; darksouls mmo but with glitches and a economy system

It is a hardcore game with a strong focus on player skill and pvp. Were you good at pvp is WoW? Well, almost none of those skills will transfer over.

This game's is best described as the old ultima online but in 3d (before the felucia tram split). You can be attacked ANYWHERE!!!! In towns you do have guards that will save/avenge you but it is always a risk. There is a thieving system so getting you pockets picked is a real risk. There are tamers, mages, dominators, warriors and any combination thereof. You get to decide what skills you train and what you dont.

Pro's
Very hard gameplay
Very in depth mechanics
visually on par with most games out now,
Does not take massive ammounts of hours to do anything fun,
Excellent combat system 

Con's
Bugs. Some of which have been around for a while from what i understand
Very Hard Gameplay (belonged in both because it limits who joins the game)

Игру создавали кучка вдохновленных людей. Получилось с душой и огромной тучей багов, которые медленно но фиксят. 

Это настоящая песочница. Никто вас за руку водить не будет. Никто не скажет, что делать. Это жестокий мир, в котором вас может убить всё и все. И везде. Тут нет безопасных зон. Ты вытащил оружие и сломал кому-нибудь лицо. Или тебе. А потом можно взять голову врага и СОЖРАТЬ СЫРОЙ или сварить с солью... А потом ты берешь тело павшего врага и содрав с него кожу делаешь себе обмотку на меч. Или плащик. 

Свободная экономика. Никаких телепортов. Почти сто киломертов квадратных площади. Строить можно везде и что угодно. Рушить так же. 

Все персонажи стремные. Смиритесь. 

Дизайна локиций нет и не могло быть. Хотя когда ты забираешься на возвышенность и видишь огромную степь с озером по середине это захватывает. 

Делать в игре можно что угодно. Но в вашим основным занятием станет мордобой. Это однозначно. Это игра про кровь и убийства. Целиком и полностью. 

При попадании меча по доспехам отлетают искорки. 

Все войны между гильдиями начинаются с того, что кто-то не лицеприятно высказался про чью-то мамку.

(not saying this game is anything like WoW mind you)
Now here is what i have to say about the game.

This game is not for casual gaming, this game is very time consuming lots of grinding, to be efficient/competitive you need to have a subscription and possibly multiple characters. Ya i know ""free to play"" The free to play aspect of the game lets you play but with limited skills. Which its meant that you play the game to see if you like it or not. 

I give this game a Positive review because its what I want out of an MMO. Its hardcore takes time but is rewarding when you do accomplish your goals (much like how Vanilla WoW was.) There isnt handholding from the game its a steep learning curve. On my list the Cons do out number the Pros but the Cons are very rewarding. 



Pros:
Hardcore game/loot (If you die you drop all your loot on the ground)
Open world
PvP
Guilds
Territory control
Resource control


Cons:
Slow updates (The development team is really small so updates are far and few between but they do happen)
Small player base (steam release helped game a little but lack of handholding for new players made a lot quit)
Guild politics (most major guilds are allied and at stand stills so it limits guild PvP)
Greifing new players
Low skill point system (you wont be able to do multiple classes on one character to maximum efficiency forcing you to have multiple character slots)
Known bugs not being fixed
Not new user friendly (took me a couple days to figure it out)

It's all about the learning curve, as soon you have this done, you are good to go.

There can be very hard times in this game, but none that cant be worked out in a better way. It is easy to say bad things about this game, but think about the freedom you have to do whatever you want in Mortal Online. Not many other games has what this can give you.

Love this game and I would give this a thumbs up if it weren't for the pay model.
Max skill lvl for skills is 100 unless you pay the monthly.(Roughly 12$ a month, weird price because it's in euros.)
But if you cancel your subscription you go back down to 60!!  So you have to perpetually pay just to play the game you already paid for last month.  These kinds of pay models goes against my gamer code of ethics.  It's a scammy way to run your business, you don't really get to keep what you pay for.  But if you don't mind supporting dev's who keep supporting these pay models, then by all means perpetuate the problem. There is one other thing that made me wary of this game is that the experienced players will literally tell you not to talk about bans, or the banning of your friend or really anything to do with banning, because if you do you will get banned yourself.  Just thought it was really weird and got the feeling the dev's have mistreated players.  But it really is a great game and I was really enjoying it but after finding out the pay model I decided against it, due to principle.

It breaks the game economy making this a pointless game to spend money on. The game is far from balanced, even though it tries to suggest it is. Archery attacks are crap at best and not accurate at all for damage, speed, or accuracy. their version of mages must be bogged down with having to carry all these encumbering items, so that you fall easy pray to melee characters, and magics must be charged like a Dragonball z  where everyone is annoyed it took 2 epsiodes to charge a attack. The game, due to players and mechanics, revolves around stealing and killing each other, and considering it takes most 30 minutes to a hour to make 1-5 gold, even though there is alot of pve to earn said gold, ( pay players, and only pay players have the ability to steal), steal it from you waiting in droves around the banks so you can not save it,  and bank it, and if you don't bank it, they kill you and run off the moment your not visible to a guard. Making it so players are too scared to leave cities, and keep them in a eternal loop of being robbed, and killed over and over, to generate money for subscribers, bascially if your not paying, it's not worth playing, and it's not worth paying for, cause they can just take what you pay for too. horriable player community. IF you attack them, the guards will kill you, and then the vultures descend on your items. Every crime is punished by death. Without having a paid account your skills will never get high enough to defend against them and run away in time. The only part I liked was the melee combat which is much like Chivilary. Too bad you can't keep gold to get decent items, like melee weapons, armor etc, and if you get lucky enough to keep it, they do soemthing that occurs so much it has it's on nick name, dubbed blue blocking, where they run infront of your attacks on pve to make you hit them, to get the guards to kill you so they can legally steal your stuff. No other language other then english is allowed in their so called help chat either, which isn't even Gm's its the players I just mentioned, help chat is only 48 hours long, and there is a ednless amount of long time players who create alternate characters just to ploy new players into being gulliable so they can take your stuff as well.

this game is one of the most accurate first person combat games i have ever found, combat can be extremely difficult against another player, it is based on skill above all else, your survivability is increased due to armour and weapons but it wont make you powerful if you suck. thank god. there seems to be an unlimited amount of things to do from fishing to bounty hunting other players, you can make an empire without ever lifting a blade or you can stand atop a heap of corpses with your battleaxe in hand and faithful donkey by your side. 

if you die you lose all the stuff you are holding, also clans can be destroyed and you are never safe, like it should be. 
this is one of the harder games so if you arent a little girl you should love it. 

be aware of guild spies

every skill you use in the world needs to be advanced, at first you can hardly even walk, jump, run or swim, if you make a character that uses axes, you wont be able to kill another player with a sword unless you have trained with one. also the direction of your swing is important, as well as hitting armour, sheilds, weapon hilts or even other weapons. for e.g. if you hit a piece of armour that protrudes from someones shoulder you are hitting their armour and will do massivley reduced damage, it is very accurate.

all in all an extremely enjoyable first person combat game with indepth clans, trading, crafting, hitboxes and armourments

It's truly a 'sandbox' experience unlike any other. Skills work like they do in Oblivion, and it's incredibly satisfying watching yourself progress. 

Game looks beautiful, it plays (mostly) well except combat which is a little touch and go. I wish there was a 'neutral' review as after conversing with a Dev. on the forums they seem very reasonable; so I have no choice but to sway slightly positive. What started off as a giant rant by myself about the game, turned around to a civil conversation which I assume neither of us imagined. Overall the game would be much more positive with a different community.

The game has potential, unfortunately I've been saying that for well over 6 years now. Some things need to be changed drastically to improve gameplay, and the primary reason the game is failing is due to the community.

It is plagued by elitists and trolls. People who believe because they can dupe, exploit, and min/max whatever mechanic is broken at the time that they have the right to treat people however they want. Wander somewhere a clan deems as 'theirs' and try to gather? Have fun getting spawn killed for hours at a time until you give up and log out.

The crafting system is absolutely stunning, but again the elitists have full control over the market. There are no 'recipes' so everything is trial and error unless someone else tells you what is required. This leads to game breaking potions and other items only a select few know about and will hold onto their secret like it's ""the one ring"".

People are so scared of challenge, so terrified of someone being on their level they will do everything they can to prevent you from accomplishing anything in the game.

You will be 'blue blocked' and killed by guards, I imagine more times than you can count in your first days in the game.

It's free, so it can't hurt to try. It's the only full loot, FPS combat MMO worth playing.",1446826459,1446829704,True,6,0,0.525862038135528564,0,False,False,False,False,,,

1. There is nothing to do. PvE is a Joke, NPC's are completely boinked. To counter this they gave them the ability to knock you down and render you unable to defend yourself for a few seconds. Unless of course you drop 100 points into a skill that has no use to you besides defending against those knockdowns.

2. Obtaining gear is a huge grind. You need 3 characters to support 1 combat character of your own. Characters that a new player doesn't even know how to build without help from others or extensive research through the forums.

3. Gathering the resources needed to make those characters is mindblowingly tedious for a new player. You will be killed on site by the majority of other players who will also kill your mount(required for gathering) and delete your haul because they themselves probably can't carry it.

4. Min/Max builds, nearly everyone aside from roleplayers are the exact same race/skill build. This varies from month to month as they change aspects of how skills affect things like damage bonus and combat speed. So If you want to stay truely competitive prepare to reroll that character you spent hundreds of gold & hours on every couple of months.

5. Two vastly empty continents, aside from the rediculousness that is Terrority Control. Ride across a wasteland of randomly placed AI that yield nothing of value to you, unless of course you dedicated an entire character to butchering their carcass. Wow look at that huge palisade a player has built, lets see if they are inside, nope! No incentive to login for these players at this point, they are gathering safely while offline thanks to Territory Control.

6. How is your ping? 100, no that will never do. Connect through your phone's wifi or start some torrent downloads as some packetloss and 400 ping will serve you better(Yes people really do this). Watch as your opponent seemingly stands in place attempting to hit you, while you run circles about him with your polesword dispatching him and his friends.

7. Broken weapons, better be packing a polesword(reinging champ) or flanged mace or you are about to get your shit pushed in.

8. In-Game staff & forum moderation. These ""helpful"" fellows are pulled directly from the sesspool that is the Mortal Online community itself. Be careful who you decide to interact with, because chances are they have a friend in high places.

9. Henrik, the CEO. For years we have pleaded with this guy. The entire community is up in arms about the above listed issues, yet he acts on none of them. He is either blind deaf or dumb. Maybe all three.

i tried my first ""go to"" names. the ones i really want...all taken. no problem, surely one of my obscure names will be available....nope. ok how about really odd names? in other languages? misspelled? taken, taken, and taken. so i went the comical route with ""Allnames Aretaken"" and ""Isthis Nametaken""...both were...guess what....taken. at this point i thought there was something wrong, there was a glitch...surely...right? again, nope. to test this glitch theory i basically could have thrown cats at my keyboard to come up with the name...and of course that worked. my name is now ""cfjoladfedolxc Nametaken""...cool, huh?

This is not a traditional MMO. If you want quest bubbles and some hermit telling you to gather 100 carrots so you can feed a donkey, and then expect to do this a thousand more times, in a thousand different ways until you level to 60, please don't download this game. Mortal Online is not for children nor is it for the faint of heart. This game feels like an RPG with a devoted community. If you loved Morrowind: The Elder Scrolls, then you will remember what a game like that feels like. If you want epic challenge, free romaing adventure, gore, crafting, hunting, taming, PVP, cooking, combat mastery and uniqueness in character; and might I mention some of the deepest lore ever written, then you must try this game. The lore in MO is on the level of the Elder Scrolls; in fact I wish ESO did their game sandbox style like this; if they did maybe people would have stayed.

The game is older so the graphics are not in today's standard, yet the world is beautifully crafted. The combat system works, it is intriguing and while it is challenging it is also fun. Even riding a mount takes skill, so you can't just hop on a horse or donkey and go; you need to learn how to ride, make sure you are not too fat or you will fall on your face in front of everyone. The economy in this system is unique in a sense, that even though you can see everything in the realm at the broker, you can only buy stuff in the city you are in, so it makes things challenging: if you want that armor or weapon you need to travel to the desert lands to retrieve it, from that particular broker, if you can survive the bandit players.

I think open world PVP in 1rst person, is the most feared, yet realistc experience in fantasy gaming.

Many of us got spoiled with 3rd person and I was one of them. At first, I was not sure I wanted to play a game in 1rst person, but as I got into it, I found myself 36 hours in. Then there are those who are afraid of getting killed and losing everything. I will say this, fear is good sometimes, it keeps you on the edge. Once you get killed and lose everything you will be smarter, wiser and learn to only carry the things you really need. And if you need to gather more things, keep a good relationship in the local cities so you can visit your bank; and always have back up resources so you can be prepared for the monster/creatures, theives and red players who have nothing better to do but make your life miserable.  All we need now is more Roleplayers to stop fearing PVP and come to this world. The opportunity to do what you want, go where you please and build a house, village or city, anywhere is well worth the risk. Or you can play ESO and waste your life in a tavern. I rather be rping with friends who want that edge, knowing that they can die in this dangerous world, but gaining strength, will, intelligence, dexterity, constitution and valor; to defend ourselves and the weak. We need more good players in this game. 

WE need more Roleplayers, who are up to facing this challenge.

My ingame name was Lexorn , I have played mortal for 4.5 years and am one of the most recognisable Names in the game after starting many wars , being the leader of FATE and AIM and building the largest player city ever seen called Magna Astu.

My advice is this: DO NOT PLAY MORTAL ONLINE EVER

Mortal online has alway had a charm about it and many of us have played for a long time living on the promise that ""things will get fixed"" or ""it will be ready soon"" but unfortunatly none of these things ever materialise. Mortal online as a game had great potential and many of us have done our best to support it over the years by subbing accounts for friends , donating etc etc but again all of this has been taken and nothing given back.

They had/have a policy where if you dontate enough you can name an npc, or get an armour set made or some other rubbish infact some people have donated $1000 and 2 years later have still not seen the results of their donation....

Also they have unbanned several prominant hackers/dupers AFTER the donated which is a really bad way to manage a game.

Mortal online is a game full of empty promises , corruption and lies. Hell they even had/have GM's activly playing in guilds and giving unfair advantages to certain players.

Recently we discovered a bug with the extracting system completly legitimate and nothing but in game mecanics however because of a few high status players we had attached to our guild and the overwhelming corruption of the Starvault GM team they Instabanned over a dozen players, destroyed our keep and destroyed the largest open player city ever built cause not only us to lose everything but also causing over 60 new steam release players who used the city to lose everything and a large number have now quit.


Mortal Online Is a waste of your money and time, they have lost over 50% of their steam release playerbase since it launched here and the reasons for that are:

CORRUPTION
LACK OF VALUE FOR MONEY
BROKEN MECANICS
BIAS
LYING TO THEIR PLAYERBASE

My advice to anyone thinking of playing this game is to avoid it like the plague and spend you money elsewhere and I would also like for STEAM to look inot the way this game is run and consider removing it from their system.

I hope anyone thinking of playing this game heeds my warning

Thanks

Out of a group of four that entered the game I was the only one left that may have subbed I probably wont now after learning more about the game

I knew full well I was getting into a hardcore full loot game , I expected to die alot granted but the community was dreadfully toxic , on mentioning the high level moutned guys preventing new players from leaving the starter towns could be negative for the game I was told ""uninstall leave the game"" . Most of these guys have macros to don full armour and mount up before one shotting you , its un realistick and the ganking and griefing not to mention blue blocking is counter productive.

This is the only mmo I know of that has no group mode , if you accidentally hit your mate you become a criminal for all to gank kill and loot with no repurcussions , dumb just dumb.

The jungle area is jsut a horror story you can get trapped for hours becuase guilds have walled it off , some rivers do not work many areas are empty and the game just looks dreary , its not all about looks right? well sounds glitch and feel like your in the old ultima underworld if your old enough to remember that.

Sub price 14 euros ?  sorry guys too much for a game thats years old but feels early access.

In my mind due to the toxic community this game will fizzle out and die , steam F2P model was the last twitch of a headless chicken before it dies , good idea for a game jsut too many flaws and a horrible communiity , well 95% of them",1445476413,1445476413,False,11,1,0.511885881423950195,2,False,False,False,False,,,

I generally don't write reviews on steam, but this one I just had to take the time to write one out even if no one cares to read my review or doesn't agree, I don't really care.  

Somehow I hadn't heard of this game till the steam release came out and was told just a little bit about the game, downloaded and started playing. I must admit I was one of those people at the beginning that was like ""Hey, how do you form a party?"" ""Where's the map?"" and then it dawned on me, this is not your typical game that's out now which is all just a carbon copy of itself with slightly differing graphics, plots and systems. 

After WoW ruined gaming for those of us that were around for the beginning of console gaming, MUDs, etc, I remember for years I searched for a game that let you do what you wanted to, be who you wanted to be... a game that actually deserved the ""RPG"" behind the ""MMO"" genre, but I gave up. I long awaited, searched, tried everything that looked promising and then got used to all these games that came out that held your hand through every process of your adventure and forced you take paths you yourself did not want your character to take.

Mortal Online does not have quests. There is the beginning tutorial quests if you start off in the city of Tindrem, but that is all. It's a few quests and then you are dropped off into the world and left on your own to figure things out. Some say you need to be in a guild to experience this game or to even like it, but I disagree. Sure, I see the pros and the cons of joining one, but so far I have not joined a guild and I have figured things out myself with a bit of help by asking in help chat when I'm really stuck or lurking the forums a bit, but mostly I ventured out on my own and discovered new areas, mobs, guild keeps, etc. To me that is half the fun. I don't know that I want people that have been playing for years to tell me exactly where to go and give me all the items I could possibly want.  Discovery to me is the most fun part of this game. I end up getting killed more than I probably should because of the play style I choose, but it doesn't upset me as that's what I choose to do right now.

Beauty of this game is that it's not beautiful in any aspect. And though that sounds like an insult, it's not. There are thieves trying to pickpocket you while you're trying to buy new armor after you lost your gear and mounts to murderers coming back from a taming journey. Then you gear up, go back out to go on an adventure, look away for a second and oops you ran into a pack of cougars and they just put you down to 10% life. Now you have to rest for a while to get your HP back and then you hear the clopping of horses nearing you and oh no, murderers again. But you know what? To most of gamers these days, that might sound like a nightmare, but this is what I missed through the years. The danger, the excitement, the unknown. 

People complain about the graphics, but I don't understand why. For this game, I think it is hugely fitting. I don't want to see a bunch of pretty girly blonde elf men riding on unicorns fighting with some translucent sword that has some spinning hieroglyphics on it and all wearing the same high end purple gear head to toe. No thanks. 

The crafting system is something that is really unique in this game compared to many in games these days and some of those recipes are a secret kept to themselves. Not everything is just out in the open even after so many years and I like that about this game that there may be things I may never discover. You can't just get to an point where you know it all in a week. But do not expect people to share their secrets with you that have played this game for years prior to the steam release. 

I think older gamers like me will definitely appreciate this game. People that want their hand held, all the guides you ever want on the forums, an in-game map, a cursor to let you know where you want to go at the top of your screen, this is probably not the game for you, but I can hope that maybe even among those players, there might be some that want to experience something different. If you do, try this game out for sure.",1445384234,1445385723,True,68,9,0.641371250152587891,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Es gracioso que realmente haya fracasado en steam y poca gente lo juegue, porque aunque han pasado los años y no ha envejecido especialmente bien sigue siendo el útlimo y autentico sandbox que queda (a parte del minecraft xd)
la gente llama sandbox a todo. Sandbox significa libertad total, sin historia (no significa que no pueda haber lore) la gente hace la historia. En el MO es asi, tiene una rica historia de reyes, señores de la guerra grandes batallas y mil cosas mas. 
Lo mejor:

- EXTREMADAMENTE ADICTIVO (cuidado si te haces jugador del MO aprovisionate de porno suficiente porque jamas volveras a tener sexo. es una droga)
- Autentico espíritu Sandbox. Full loot, sin reglas. Solo mata o murre, roba o se robado, el fuerte mata al debil. Bienvenido al medievo.
- trabajo en equipo. Este juego se basa en el trabajo en equipo, puedes jugarlo solo pero estaras muy limitado, estar en una guild tener tu ciudad, luchar en guerras, es una experiencia inolvidable.
- PVP. Quien ha vivido una gran guerra en el MO y ha luchadno en una gran batalla jamas lo olvida, es una locura, armas por todos lados, brillo de armaduras, caballos, muy epico.
- Economia. La economica es extremadamente compleja. la extracion de metales el tradeo, todo es complejo y muy rico.
LO PEOR
- La comunidad del MO esta formada por megalómanos y sociopatas xd
- El lore, (su ausencia) el lore del juego es pesimo y los jugadores tampoco han ayudado a mejorarlo, el foro es territorio comanche y la senccion de ROL una patata.
- El estado social de Myrland es casi de la baja edad media, no hay reinos, jerarquia nada, toda organizacion social compleja es imposible. Todos los jugadores queiren ser emperadores.
- Las polladas de starvault. No lo hacen mal pero a veces pueden cagarla mucho con sus ideas o su inactividad.

-Leave the main cities,  if you die leave again. 
-Plan your charecter 
-Be nice to people, through this you meet many simular people
-Get the riding skill and buy a mount
-Join a guild
-Roam in a team if you can 
-Find the mortal online map 
-Stop an attack with Ctrl (you will know why soon)
-Get to know which guilds have what agenda
-Make use of the buy orders on the broker this will make farming a lot easier.
-If you think you going to die just fight and let them know it.

YES. there are going to be players who will kill you, take your stuff and kill your mount. there are going to be things you wont know at first and lose out on. BUT thats not all there is to this game. its not all about pvp, even if many people feels that way. i personally love crafting. i still havent gone into the dungeons but i want to, there are special monsters around that are uncommon, boss monsters even. i was actually suprised to know that there are actually equipment that you can only get from drops (previously thought everything was only crafted) 

you dont get everything handed to you in the beginnning. there are ALOT to learn. but go into the forums and search abit. there are guides for new players, for crafting, for building certain builds. there are people that just feels like sharing what they learned that day. there are alot of nice people playing as well. many people who have faced the problems with red and grew to be able to fight them. they know some tricks and they have resources to help. find some guilds to join, there are a quite a bit of players willing to help. because it will benefit them if there are more players too. more people to play with, adventure with. slay monsters and hunt bosses with.

the hardest thing i found in this game is the fact that it really is up to you to learn, grown and develop your character and play style. you cant stay ignorant in this game, that is what kills you.  

im no vet, but im up to help new players. because its a nice dream of mine to lead a hunting group around, fight off some reds, go dungeoneering. bring a nice fresh air to this game that has staled because people keeps getting scared off.

The game is sandbox, and it tries to be as realistic as possible, including that there will be hunger, no starting maps, no global banks(town banks doesn't connect with other town's banks), stealing, securities, housing, etc etc etc.

Combat is pretty much skyrim, you have your stamina, you adjust your distance at your enemy, you strike with either swinging or thrusting, and of course they will have durabilities, you can parry and block, and there are also magics, and Full looting system.
There is no level system in this game, so you have full skill points and attribute points ready to be allocated by doing stuffs(reading skill books, activities that corresponds said skill, etc).
Skill points are limited, there are 2 types of skill, primary and secondary, primary spends skill points, secondary spends none.
You can hit people in towns and even killing them, but hitting innocents will cause you to be a criminal and be chased by op guards capable of 360 noscoping you with magics and arrows

--EDIT--
After putting in few more dozens of hour into the game, i want to add something new here, the game suffers from crashing issues, and it doesn't tolerate disconnection, you got disconnected? your characters will have to wait either 10 or 40 seconds before logging out following you, will the same thing happen if you crashed? well... yeah.

Anyways, my experience with the game has been both good and bad, i found new way to make money, got excited, got to live in a man made guild base, seeing my tamed mounts sell, killing and finding new monsters, realizing that the monster's loot is a fortune to sell, etc.
being a f2p dude, i decided to make my character a hybrid to spend those unused skill points, i decided to become a hybrid fighter and a tamer, and it worked well, i might not fight as good as my other guild mates, but i still had fun coordinating with my good teammates.

The starting town(mainly Tindrem) is but a one's place to suffer and grow before finally deciding to venture outside for an adventure, as i've said before, this game got no map, but they gave you compass, a working one, you should hone your pathfinding and exploration skill, or you could roleplay as a hireable bodyguard, there are people actually people looking for an escort from one town to the other.

Pros and Cons

---Pros---

-Combat is not typical.
-Great crafting system.
-Broad selection of creatures to be tamed.
-Broad skills and career selections.
-Open world, vast areas to be explored.
-Guilds.
-etc.
---Cons---
-Not newbie friendly(Punishing deaths, blueblocking, returning alive is a bit troublesome, Sandbox Confusions, etc), most newbies decided to stop playing this game after experiencing that the game is too punishing and confusing for them.
-Stucks, jumping to some location might result on you getting stuck forever.
-Cooldown on /stuck, a command which helps stuck players.
-f2p limitations, the max points to be allocated on one skill for f2p players are 60, subscriptions players have no limitations
-f2p tamers can't tame dem' cool minotaurs ;_;
-f2p players can't steal.

Pros of the game:
-True Sandbox
-Open-World PvP
-Crafting system is very in-depth
-PvP is skill based
-PvE is skill based
-Game is actively being improved by developers

-Trolls trolling new players
-Has some bugs and glitches, but none game-breaking

The game does have a very tought start, especialy if you're new, but if you can get past the first month, you should know enough to be able to work your way up. Your best option is to join a guild right away. The GY farming is 100 useless, it's just something to do, but you need to do a little reseach, and figure out better ways to make you gold. 

The game does take time to learn the mechanics, and the whole system from crafting, extracting, butchering, etc... Almost all the information you need is a simple google search, so if you find yourself stuck, just do a little reading, and then do your own testing, because not everything is 100% accurate, but it will give you an idea and head start.

While I don't normally play PvP games, I do occassionally like to raise my blood pressure a little by playing some.  Was fully prepared to give this a good strong effort, and accepted that I'd get killed quite a bit.   However, what I've come to discover, is that this game seems geared more towards the griefer than the PvPer.  In my 9 hours of play, not once was I killed by a player, but I was guard killed Many Many times by little 'traps' left behind by players, things that use game mechanics or deception to allow players to get other players (expecially newer players who don't KNOW all the little mechanics) killed without penalty to themselves.

While this might be the game for some, the learning curve and ease with which a player can be tricked into dying and losing all their gear, simply puts this game outside of my interest.",1444690942,1444690942,False,9,1,0.539010286331176758,0,False,False,False,False,,,

My bad bro, but no then you find out they actually did that on purpose because now you've just been labeled a criminal and EVERYONE will instantly gank you and take everything on your body, including your body (to butcher, eat, craft, whatever), which is funny the first few times it happens, but the humor doesn't last.  Usually the person blueblocking you doesn't even need your stuff.  They just want to grief low level players for no good reason (makes them feel big I guess).  

Anyway, until the game finds some way to remove the worst form of griefing I've ever seen I'm not playing it and won't recommend anyone else to either.

The Positives: 

Mortal Online has alot of things hardcore players will love to have. Its steep learning curve. unforgiving pvp, Those nerves that tingle when your most precious items and your guilds assets are on the line. 

It has an amazing crafting system that I have yet to see in any other MMO.  The combat system takes some time to get used to it but feels rather clunky at first. Mounted combat was really fun to me.

The taming and breeding systems are pretty decent.

The Negatives:

Some of the systems in the game are broken and incomplete for a title that has been out for 5 years. For example spear stance, the backstab mechanic, the akward hitboxes for certain melee weapons, the ranged combat with bows is very erratic. There are virtually no combat encounters that do not involve hit and run. Unless you include Seige mechanics, that involves players destroying your assets when your peak players are offline. No different then Ark Survival.   

The UI is very simplistic for a game that has been out for so long. So many Inventory bugs happen daily that  doing /droploot to check your gear for invisible items is a thing. Many lores for creatures that are not even in the game are still cluttered in the players skill list, making it even more diffcult for players who already have a hard time learning the game.

The community is so secretive about everything that its hard for new players to even thrive. You can barely even get someone in your guild to tell you the correct recipe for weapons and armor to make them worthwhile. Sadly it is because most of the players in the community are on a huge powertrip. They are afraid to be on an equal level of playing as newcomers. It is also why you find very few guides about the game. The official reddit for MO has less then one thousand registered people. I am sure this pushes players away from the game.

if you ever really want to know how full of themselves these kids are just take a walk over to the offical mortal online forums in the media section and watch the videos and the trash talking that these guys do on a daily basis. Soon after check the guild politics section and just read the constant pe nis wagging that happens.

The last thing I am going to say about this game is the community is downright TOXIC, There are a few players that exist to try and make the game a better place. But overall the game is filled with either present or past hacks / hackers. Undercover gold and asset selling for real cash money.  GM's that abuse power by not hearing out two sides to story or warning you about things before punishing you. Veterans who think that you have to respect them because they have mastered the combat system and therefore will even grief thier own guildmates. (Msg me if you want twitch recordings) and the WORST OF ALL.

A community of players that will use DDOS programs constantly on each others Communications during times of war. Or just for any kind of revenge they deem necessary. Abuse of TS adresses. IP adresses, to anyone in thier own guilds and to other guilds. 

Alot of the functions of the game are client side and can be exploited very easily. Its why duping of items has and more then likely is still is a problem that is reoccuring and hard to track and ban people for.

I think thats about enough. I just unsubscribed and will take another year long break from the game and check once again if they have fixed any of these issues or the community has changed. 

Sad thing is I dont really hold up my hopes. =(

As a side note, the pet pathing is the absolute worst I have ever seen. Three to four tickets to a GM a day just to have them returned to you after they dissapear through the world.

The veterans in this game seem to not have much to do so they've decided to kill their time by making life for new players as difficult as possible.

Other than that, the combat is clunky, it's like Chivalry with none of the polish, mobs can hit you whilst they are facing away from you, animations and movement look very awkward as well, blocking controls are rigid... Generally the combat revolves around ""parrying"" (blocking just before the mob attacks absorbing most of the damage and allowing you to unleash a counter attack) after 10 minutes you are able to easily predict their strike patterns/timings and the combat just becomes a bore. 

Graphics are bad, mostly because of really awful looking textures and the game is very buggy too, it feels like an Early Access and it is 5 years old already. There's a DX11 option for example but it's so unstable it's pretty much unplayable (Constant CTDs, lag etc). DX9 mode is a lot better in that regard but there's still many in-game related bugs that plague the game. Optimization is poor, even with a very good system I cannot run this game at full settings.

Community is annoying (other than griefers), no criticism towards the game is accepted (fanboys), any criticism will be met with ""Go back to WoW"", ""Carebear"" et cetera. 

The game is often described as hardcore but honestly it doesn't take much thought or skill (in fact it takes almost none), the only thing ""hardcore"" thing about the game is the constant hurdling you'll get from griefers/PKers and how much of your time will be wasted because of it, it's just a timesink/grind really. Either way, if you like those kind of games and can overlook many flaws and rough edges, you might like it, I play it and do get some enjoyment out of it but I'm not foolish about what this game is and isn't as well.

That, and the fact it's virtually impossible to level up skills in the starting zones because people will immediately rush up to stand between you and whatever youre trying to hit, causing the guards to come after you and get you killed so they can take all your shit.

I can see soooo much potential in this game, and yet just like a lot of MMOs lately, fails to become what they could be. And it's essentially paywalling you from ever experiencing the full game, especially since free accounts have a maximum skill level of 60, meaning that paying players will always have an advantage over free players...which is the very definition of ""pay 2 win"".

It's worth a try, but I can't recommend this game to somebody who is looking for a time investment.

Задумка шикарна. Жестокий мир, фентези, сиськи и письки (в игре есть режим полной обнаженки когда у голых персов видно органы) полная потеря лута после смерти и т.д. Если описать игру коротко - то это попытка реинкарнировать Ультиму Онлайн (олдфаги поймут) в теле анриаловского трехмерного движка.
К сожаления, по моему мнению попытка провалилась.
Графика, физика, движок и сам мир вызывают отвращение и являются полнейшим зашкваром. Вырвиглазные текстуры, убогие города из 2001 года, абсолютно неудобная боевая система. Все это говно, которое никак не способствует игровому процессу сопровождается полным слизыванием механик Ультимы, вплоть до команды ""guardians"". Уровень дружелюбности и интуитивной понятности в районе нуля. Кроме того, не смотря на то что игра спокойно пошла на моем компе на качестве графики ультра, кроме вырвиглазного мыла и размытия всего изображения, графона там как такового нету. Ужасная цветовая гамма. НЕРЕАЛЬНО ДОЛГАЯ ЗАГРУЗКА. Это реально писец, господа, загрузка в игровой мир идет где-то около 5-7 минут. Разлогинившись, желание перезайти пропадает мгновенно. Открытый мир ужасен и скучен. Со времен Линяги разрабы ничего особо придумать видимо не смогли. Вместо яркого и интересного проекта получилось кислое, цвета говна чудовище, мутант от скрещивания Ультимы и Линейки на зашкварном движке Унриала.

As I watched gigabytes tick away, I dreamed of my homestead. I knew it would be hard, but I was ready for the challenge.

Boy, was I disappointed. I started playing the game as a ""fledgling."" During that time, nobody could attack me and I couldn't attack them. I used the time to gather resources. I found a bank, made some deposits. I was disappointed immediately that the only quests in the game were the tutorials, which were an absolute mess, but I kept going. I bought armor, managed to craft a few things but kept feeling like the work was going to far outweigh the fun had in-game. The graphics were sub-par, the UI was reminiscent of Ultima Online's, terribly outdated, the servers were fairly laggy at times, the controls themselves were less than responsive, the items in-game were somewhat cryptic and disjointed and the help system looked like someone just put some filler text in and moved on.

A messaged popped up, ""You are no longer a fledgling!"" ""Woo-hoo,"" I thought, ""Now it's time to conquer."" No such luck. Within a minute of getting my upgraded status, I was murdered. I figured, ""Oh, well. It's a survival game. I like those."" I shook off the fact that I lost all my inventory and set to respawning. I found the priest, told him to bring my back and was on my way. I grabbed only what I needed this time and decided to flee to a quieter area. Just outside of town, I was murdered again. This happened over and over. I gave up for the day.

I came back to the game the next day and set out, only to accidentally target what was apparently someone's pig. The game punished me and the guard killed me. I set out again. I found a quiet area, it was nice. I was murdered again. I was way out this time, far from a priest. I asked the game to send me to the priest, which takes 60 seconds. I patiently waited, ""20 seconds... 10 seconds."" To my dismay, the game popped up with its message that I had been transported, but, guess what? I hadn't been. I tried again, ""I'm not walking that far."" Same thing happened.

I started hoofing it only to come across priest after priest that would only service their guild, with no distinction between the ones I could use and couldn't. This meant walking endlessly, going to priest after priest, just hoping. I thought, ""I could make a new character. That would be easier."" If it's easier to create a new character in a game, and go through the leveling process again, than to simply respawn, it has problems. That realization brought me full circle and I gladly exited. Of course, it made me wait 10 seconds. I ALT+F4'd just to show them I wasn't going to be their plaything anymore.

The concept of the game is great, but it is poorly executed, poorly supported and lacks direction. This feels like a college project, not a game meant for production. For anyone wanting to proceed, despite these words of warning, I only say to you, ""I bet you're going to be disappointed.""

UPDATE - 10/3/2015
------------------------------

I still wanted to like this game after my review so I popped back in to give it my full effort before I uninstalled it. I was pleased to find that my spawn issue was corrected (probably due to the server reboot occurring when I logged on) and I set off to a new town. I found that town less ""murdery"" and was able to setup a haul near a banker as to quickly deposit my funds. Although the murders came less frequently, they were still of great impact. Unless you want to run back and forth constantly, you need to amass a decent amount of resources to make the time worth the effort. The murders wipe out tens of minutes of work and are really disheartening.

Now, don't get me wrong; I know it's a survival game, but it shouldn't also be work. A murder shouldn't necessarily come with less impact, but should definitely be less frequent. There needs to be a greater penalty for murders, just as is the case in the real world. They provide guards, but that doesn't introduce any real preventive measure, and players are apparently allowed one murder of an innocent before the murdered player can call guards (I'm not sure of the cooldown). I understand what they're going for, but, unless there is some sort of policing when it comes to other players ruining others' experience with the game, these types of reviews will keep coming.

So, unfortunately, I still can't recommend the game. What would it take for me to change my mind? Stricter penalties for murdering other players, such as a jail period that equates to actual time lost in-game. I'm sure the problem would decrease drastically. The survival aspect would still be intact, but players would be able to somewhat comfortably navigate the world. If you want to create a pure survival game, then do that, developers, but if you want to create a game players will come back to and can take pride in what they've accomplished, make the question of their survival one that can be answered, not one led by the whims of a murder bound five-year-old with an itchy finger.

Developers: Make this Moral Online by doing what any responsible government does: protect its citizens. I won't uninstall the game just yet. I'll ensure I continue to check release notes for these types of changes. If I see a similar dynamic has been introduced, I'll come back and give it another go, consider a subscription and, of course, update my review. The game has potential, and I would love to see it all come together, but I must admit, I won't be holding out hope considering how long the game has been in development. Please, consider the value of a wider player base. Simply satisfying the relatively small group of existing subscribers isn't the best route for funding your development.

UPDATE - 5/5/2016
------------------------------

I just realized I hadn't provided another update. The game never got better and, after seeing how the developers responded to the community, I just got rid of it. Don't hitch your wagon to this horse. It's an asshole and will just call you names.

NO REAL CLASSES! Your skills level based on your own actions! Want to be a melee sword fighter? Hit shit with a sword man. Want to also cast some magic? Read a fucking book. If you are tired of how your characters skills are, just hit the minus key and train up something else! It's an ever-evolving character!

I have played this game for a few years now (pre-steam release) and it is simply epic. The politics are insane, the battles are adrenaline filled, and the dungeons are gorgeous! 

It is FREE to play. Yes your skills are capped at 60 (instead of 100) if you do not subscribe, but I played as a free2play for a few weeks before finally deciding to sub. I currently have 3 subscribed accounts with 4 characters on each. This shit gets THAT serious.

The crafting system is great, interesting. Combat is much better than other alternatives to hardcore medieval survival player-made RPGs, like Wurm online. The only problem is the way it brings in new people. The tutorial is okay, but it shows you a very small amount of things to do in the game. It doesn't really go over even a fourth of the basics of the game. There are tutors around the starting city, but you have to seek them out, and they aren't really obvious unless you look around a lot. It has a skill system similar to EVE, where you have to get skill books to actually attain a skill. The biggest problem with it is that after you leave the tutorial area, you're told to go collect some undead heads. You can collect as many as you want, and you'll get paid pretty well for each of them. In the area you kill these undead, there are at most 10 individual undead ""spawns"", but there are about 20 people there, so everyone is competing for their heads. There is no loot protection, so if you kill one, someone can just come up and yank it from the small package that drops onto the floor, for everyone to see. There are no penalties for doing this whatsoever, and nothing to discourage you from doing it. Also, the arena these undead are in is so small, and there are so few of them, it's very easy to hit another player when you are actually trying to kill an undead as that player is walking past. When you do inevitably hit another player, you are ""tagged"", your name turns grey to other people, and they are allowed to attack you, penalty-free. I never intentionally attacked anyone else, I was only trying to kill undead, but at least 5 times i was tagged, and immediately one-hit by the guy with the biggest weapon around. Since this is immediately put on the players when they leave the tutorial, this is the only guidance they are given at the beginning of their play. So they go, kill a couple skeletons, then accidentally hit a player, and get ganked by the first person who notices their name is grey, and lose everything but the starting weapons. Then, because doing that is the best way to make money for a very low level character, they go back, and it happens again. It's a vicious catch-22, and it's super easy to fix. I'm positive that a lot of new players are warded off of this title because they can't get a good start in an area that advertises itself as the safest place in the game.",1443567145,1443567145,False,5,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game is a true sandbox mmo which is very hard to comeby now a days with a skill system similar to the elderscrolls series.
I personally have had a blast with my guild through the highs and lows that this game can bring. 

To adress some of the negative comments i have been reading here are some tips to get the most out of mortal.

1. Get out of the starting cities Morin khur and tindrem as fast as possible. This is where you will find the most thieves and the most griefers who come there to take advantage of your inexperience. Avoid toxai as well since there is a well known guild that gets off at killing newbies there.

2. You are going to die and lose stuff at some point. This can be frustrating but it is a pvp full loot game so become smart about banking stuff you dont need to carry around.

3. This game is meant to be played with a guild. You will have a really hard time without guidance and help from vets in the guilds. This isnt like any other mmo where you can just look up a guide from newbie to vet and be fine. A good place to look for guilds is the mortal online forums guild recruitment section where guilds display their playstyle and tell you a little bit about themselves. Join a helpful guild as soon as possible but do your homework on what kind of an outfit you are getting yourselves into.

Most of all have fun with the group you play with. In any game its the quality people that i laugh in teamspeak with that keep me coming back.
Good luck ingame

Edited review after 20+ hours in game.

I'm a transitioning carebear. I *never* played PVP games because of the fear-mongering of other carebears on various MMO forums and blogs. I didn't want to be 'ganked' or 'camped' and all my precious loot stolen. 

I tried this game and found out that while it is hardcore and you ""will"" die, it is still fun. Join a guild, hunt/gather with friends in a group, bank often. Also, if someone is camping you...just respawn somewhere else. There's tons of places to farm.

I said in my last review that the suspense of the game wasn't fun. Actually, I lied. I was out in the wild scavenging. I completed geared up, plus some, from some dead adventurers. I don't know who killed them or if they were coming back for their gear. I stole their stuff, turned gray and it was odd feeling knowing they or someone else could come back and kill me to take their stuff back.

Later, I had full mount bags and inventory of caresses and other things worth many, many gold (well to me). It was my biggest, most expensive, hunting trip yet and it was a long way back to town.

This is just the tip of the iceburg, but I don't know if my poor carebear heart can handle all this...

Crafting is amazing. I hear that there are several potions and food combos that haven't been discovered my players yet. That was one of the things that drew me to the game. I've read many, many ""Looking For Game"" threads on various MMO forums looking for deep crafting systems and this is it. People want to make a name for themselves for being *the* weaponsmith, chef, etc. You can do that here. There are players who have found really good recipes and guard them fiercely, since they are making a killing on the market or keeping it for their guild's use only.

I really get a kick out of the fact that you kill people hard enough that their carcasses fly out of their skin. Also, I skinned a player, made a robe out of him. Then, fried his head with some mushrooms and rice. I was disturbed for a moment and subbed shortly after.

8/10. Will cannibalize again.

This is the best game i've played in a while. Once you get the just of it, it's really not bad, but it's the complexity of it that makes this game so fun and difficult at the same time. Of course you have the trolls who wait at the newbie spots and try to scare you away from the game, so yes it does require some patience but once you join a guild and learn how to play they won't be a problem. 

i strongly recommend this game and feel the ""mixed"" reviews for this game is unjust

Mortal online is the only true sandbox left. Mortal is your game. If you cant stand hardcore gameplay, dont touch it. 
Combat is verry similar to chivalry and due to no global banking the economy is realistic and alive. 
Graphics are great for the game. 
I reccomend this game to all true sandbox fans, give the game a few days and you'll be addicted ,-,

Came back after 4 months of a break (played before the steam release) and can say the game improved a little. They are still clunky, but at least the DDOS attacks have been sorted out :P

And seriously - I had tons of fun in this game. Due to some problems that made me waste 2 weeks of a paid subscription (had to work, couldn't play, right after paying) I lost interest since it got me really disappointed. I came back solely to recommend this game, since it's scores on steam a soaring. 

It's a clunky, niche, small-team developed mmo, but you're gonna have tons of fun with it if you are already bored with the AAA titles (or - the title :P). Other mmos are more polished, but all of them have the same gameplay. As a former wow raider I cannot bring myself to play the clones or go thru the same (only reskinned) dungeon to see the same set of bosses' moves I saw 2 years before. 

It's just that simple guys - bored with everything else? At least try Mortal - it can be enjoyable! You died? People die in wow too. Look at this exactly the same way. 

Will the game improve further? I sure hope so. If I didn't I wouldn't recommend the game as it is now. There's hope for me because the steam release is still fresh, which means the devs can still reforge this money into more development. 

If you, for some reason, want to visit my blog from the time I played mortal regularly (will hope to be able to do it): https://mortalonlineandme.wordpress.com/ is the web page. Enjoy. I tried to be funny despite my broken english. 

Try the game out with an open mind. What's out there to loose but time? There are countless ♥♥♥♥♥♥, bland games that will take plenty of that from you.",1443545447,1443545447,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Possibly forever (like me). There is nothing out on the market that fills the niche like Mortal. Below are some more details about the game.

PROS AND CONS:

+ Open world action RPG with real-time directional combat.
    + Combat is easy to learn, difficult to master. 
    - Mechanics can be dodgy and frustrating at times.

+ Interesting race system and a sprawling skill tree with multiple branches a la Morrowind on drugs
    + Palpable sense of progression. 
    + Skill up by doing (like in the Elder Scrolls Series) and by reading skill books (like EvE).
    -  Can be slow and grindy.
    -  While you can make very diverse builds, only a few are typically accepted as competent, with the rest being 'gimped.'

+ PvP is exciting.
    + Can give you shivers and make your palms sweat when you enter your first large scale battle.
    + (or -) While there are no traditional 'classes' in the game, there are distinct roles that can be filled such as 'footfighter,' 'mounted combat,' 'mage' or 'hybrid mage.' 
    - There are some issues with balance and lag.

+ Crafting system is neat and intuitive.
    + Combine many different materials and parts to make new and customized armor and weapons. 
    -  Proper crafting requires maxed skills, material lores and a subscription. 
    -  Can take a long time and a lot of gold/materials to become a competent crafter (depending on the profession).

+ PvE can be fun and unique. 
    + Action based combat with timed blocks and aiming. 
     - Timing can be wonky.
     - Can get repetitive quickly if you don't like it. 
    + Some interesting mechanics in the tougher enemies such as Demons, Minos and half the mobs in Sarducca. 
    - (or +) First time you get jumped by a monster in Sarducca, you might poop a little.

+ The game requires extensive  interaction with the community for the full experience.
     - It's an awful community.
     + It's a wonderful awful community.",1443508289,1443508289,True,27,5,0.612644076347351074,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And seriously - I had tons of fun in this game. Due to some problems that made me waste 2 weeks of a paid subscription (had to work, couldn't play, right after paying) I lost interest since it got me really disappointed. I came back solely to recommend this game, since it's scores on steam a soaring. 

It's a clunky, niche, small-team developed mmo, but you're gonna have tons of fun with it if you are already bored with the AAA titles (or - the title :P). Other mmos are more polished, but all of them have the same gameplay. As a former wow raider I cannot bring myself to play the clones or go thru the same (only reskinned) dungeon to see the same set of bosses' moves I saw 2 years before. 

It's just that simple guys - bored with everything else? At least try Mortal - it can be enjoyable! You died? People die in wow too. Look at this exactly the same way. 

Will the game improve further? I sure hope so. If I didn't I wouldn't recommend the game as it is now. There's hope for me because the steam release is still fresh, which means the devs can still reforge this money into more development. 

If you, for some reason, want to visit my blog from the time I played mortal regularly (will hope to be able to do it): https://mortalonlineandme.wordpress.com/ is the web page. Enjoy. I tried to be funny despite my broken english.

i am still f2p, but i will be subbing very soon, ive been playing 3 DAYS, and have killed p2p players. 
IT IS SKILL BASED, the only advantage p2p has is skill cap is up too 100 as opposed to 60,
attributes are the same for both. 
Heavy armor training is not available for f2p, but you can still wear the same armor (you will move slower) only because your skills are capped at 60 (though trainable to 100 still) and you need 100 armor training to learn heavy armor (but not to wear it)

REDS will try to kill you, but if you cant dodge them, its really your fault unless its a full blown zerg (rareish)
I have only died by a red once in three days.... dont keep touching the hot pan and expect it to not burn you..
this game is a pvp game, its open, its everywhere, stop crying about it please. 

GEAR HELPS ALOT
ATTRIBUTES HELP ALOT
SKILLS POINTS HELP
BUT ACTUAL SKILL WINS EVERYTIME 

if you are similarly geared to a p2p, and you have your skill points at 60, with proper attributes, YOU WILL STAND A CHANCE depending on your actual level of skill irl. 
TRUST ME. 
Im going p2p JUST SO I CAN CRAFT and because i know that when i get my skills unlocked to 100 (im at cap for f2p), ill be a monster. 

THIS GAME IS NOT FOR WEAK MINDS, you will be killed, you will have to think and learn, but it IS worth it. You will be helped, but not handheld and guided through repetitive quests. 
You can do whatever you want in this game. Seriously. 

Think of it as midevil DayZ or Wasteland mod, you can have better gear, but you can still die to someone. You will eventually lose your shit. 

THERE IS NO MAP, but that adds to the fun and value of knowledge. 
THERE ARE NO QUESTS, but that adds to your own adventure and you lose the restrictions of the linear progression type of mmo. 

Stick with it, trust noone (at first), and be smart and know what your getting into.
this is the most fun i have had in a game, regardless of graphics or trolls. its fun. 
Its risky, and its not a calculator tab target mindless mmo yall seem to be used too. 

if you were content with the cookie cutter grindy mmo, go for those and dont spam help chat with your QQ. We dont care. We all have died and lost FAR more than you will ever have gotten in the game, and loved it. 
if you want your skill and knowledge to matter, to feel like your actually in a player driven world (its completely player driven and awesome), if you want insane crafting and combat that gives you a rush like no other, this is for you.

this game is fun i have over 400 hours off record before the game was released to steam.

there are plenty of ways to make money and for a fact you choose to do combat, and at that SOLO Combat to attempt to make money, there are so many ways to make money.

this game is based off what you choose to do. if you want to tame animals then that will become your proffession. you cannot have multiple proffessions on one charactor, i mean this isnt runescape or world of warcraft. 

i love the fact that the game has been out for years and i can say ive been looking for a game to the exact specifics for years..... and for the fact i have never found it before this past year is beyond me but i can truly say it is the only AND I MEAN ONLY AUTHENTIC GAME of its kind.

if you are going to build a town then expect it to be as hard as real life your going to have to work your lazy fat a$$ off to achive that goal.

if you want a kingdom then you want to recruit those who would be loyal to your cause. you will need to gain followers and learn to work togeather.

all i can say is add the wiki page to your fav's or desktop aswell as any proffessional guidesman on youtube if your going to try to solo play.

I'm a transitioning carebear.  I *never* played PVP games because of the fear-mongering of other carebears on various MMO forums and blogs. I didn't want to be 'ganked' or 'camped'  and all my precious loot stolen.  

I tried this game and found out that while it is hardcore and you ""will"" die, it is still fun.  Join a guild, hunt/gather with friends in a group, bank often. Also, if someone is camping you...just respawn somewhere else. There's tons of places to farm.

I said in my last review that the suspense of the game wasn't fun.  Actually, I lied. I was out in the wild scavenging. I completed geared up, plus some, from some dead adventurers. I don't know who killed them or if they were coming back for their gear. I stole their stuff, turned gray and it was odd feeling knowing they or someone else could come back and kill me to take their stuff back.

Later, I had full mount bags and inventory of caresses and other things worth many, many gold (well to me). It was my biggest, most expensive, hunting trip yet and it was a long way back to town.

This is just the tip of the iceburg, but I don't know if my poor carebear heart can handle all this...

Crafting is amazing. I hear that there are several potions and food combos that haven't been discovered my players yet. That was one of the things that drew me to the game.  I've read many, many ""Looking For Game"" threads on various MMO forums looking for deep crafting systems and this is it.  People want to make a name for themselves for being *the* weaponsmith, chef, etc.  You can do that here. There are players who have found really good recipes and guard them fiercely, since they are making a killing on the market or keeping it for their guild's use only.

I really get a kick out of the fact that you kill people hard enough that their carcasses fly out of their skin. Also, I skinned a player, made a robe out of him. Then, fried his head with some mushrooms and rice. I was disturbed for a moment and subbed shortly after.

This game is a true sandbox mmo which is very hard to comeby now a days with a skill system similar to the elderscrolls series.
I personally have had a blast with my guild through the highs and lows that this game can bring. 

To adress some of the negative comments i have been reading here are some tips to get the most out of mortal.

1. Get out of the starting cities Morin khur and tindrem as fast as possible. This is where you will find the most thieves and the most griefers who come there to take advantage of your inexperience. Avoid toxai as well since there is a well known guild that gets off at killing newbies there.

2. You are going to die and lose stuff at some point. This can be frustrating but it is a pvp full loot game so become smart about banking stuff you dont need to carry around.

3. This game is meant to be played with a guild. You will have a really hard time without guidance and help from vets in the guilds. This isnt like any other mmo where you can just look up a guide from newbie to vet and be fine. A good place to look for guilds is the mortal online forums guild recruitment section where guilds  display their playstyle and tell you a little bit about themselves. Join a helpful guild as soon as possible but do your homework on what kind of an outfit you are getting yourselves into.

Most of all have fun with the group you play with. In any game its the quality people that i laugh in teamspeak with that keep me coming back.

Steps.
1.Get a guild before even trying to leave a safe city(thats not safe either hrhrhr)
2.Farm the graveyard get skulls
3.Dont play unless u ghonna sub or are unable to do so after a bit(this will be a killjoy)
4.Try to be friendly even to the asshats, why? well there is always a brother to a brother with a much bigger stick(Meaning the person being an asshat is prolly 14 and have a bigger brother somewhere lurking)

Read everything online, get a good 3'd party map(Developers for heavens sake add a ingame map allready)

It is no suprise to me that this game has around a 50% approval rating because that is exactly what it endeavors itself to receive. Really it is the perfect score. Not because its bad but because of the world of Mortal Online it self. The world is full of freedom, oprtunities and most of all merciless DEATH. With a full loot system so it is very taxing and difficult to get into at first. But if you stay strong and realize the freedom, fun and adventure this game has got to offer that possibly no other game does, you may find what you were looking for. But it can definately be to much to take for alot of people. So 50% approval is 100% of what the game and its community is intending to recieve and they got what they were after.

Now for my review.

(I played the game for about 6 months straight in 2014)
 
Well first off I love that the world and the quests and the storys are not told by NPC's but by the players them selves. If you think moral decisions really mean alot in games like Fable or Fallout then you have not tasted Mortal Online. Everything you do matters to someone else. Every good thing you do for someone and every nasty wicked thing you do means ALOT to another person. When you get into a guild, make friends, get involved in the politics of the world it self; you are fighting for what ever you are for, evil or good, money or power and everything you do matters and effects someone else. And passions and tensions definately rise all of the time. Theres really no other game that i have ever played before that really felt like a 2nd life like the experience that Mortal Online gives you. So I absolutely love that.

The combat system is pretty good. Not the best ive ever seen and but definately not the worst. It is skill based and you can not target your oppenent like in other mmo's. Im not a big fan of the way you fire off magic spells in this game but eh, alot of people make it work for them and I suppose if you can you may enjoy that too. But the combat is more like Chivalry.

The crafting system and the skill leveling system really shine the brightest. There is so much depth and originality in both of these 2 systems that Mortal Online really made it their own and no other game has before or sense done anything like it and I really admire them alot. So epic. Quite possibly the best part.

The bad. The bugs and glitches can be a real pain in the a$$ sometimes. I mean really. I know the community told the dev's they should have focused on fixing the bugs and glitchs before they focused on saraducaa but they did not listen. Honostly as much as I love the game it self for what it is the bugs and glitchs kill it for actually making it on the list of my most favorite games of all time. But it is still top 10.

Overall I would give this game and 8.4 out of 10. It loses .2 points for the community being alittle to a-holey to noobs but at the same time Mortal Needs those a-holes in endgame to make the world go round so hard to balance the a-holeness and it loses the other -1.2 because of the bugs and glitches. The dev team needs to stop focusing on growth and expansion and focus on pest control. The bugs need a fix for real. But other then that I ABSOLUTELY recomend this game. It is as if Ultima Online and The Elder Scrolls (not online) series had a baby with its own sense of identity and flare. And those 2 games are my favorite of all time. So for that I love Mortal Online.

One of the long-time players has contacted me and mentioned that there are player cities that exist that are much safer than the starting cities.  Their guild would be happy to move me to a safe city if I recreate a character.   The game mechanics and abilities were fun so I'm going to give it another shot and see if it works better.  More to come in a few weeks.....

-------------------------

The mechanics are a nod back to traditional skill based mmos, graphics are nice and I had a decent time in the tutorial zone.

However, it has the typical toxic player base that prefers to grief using PvP mechancis and exploits to actually playing the PvE portion of the game.  

In fact, the rules that are in place to stop player killing in towns actually raises griefing to an artform in Mortal Online.  

My first experience with a griefer was when they charmed an animal then then left it standing alone in a field of other animals of the same type.  Waiting until a newbie player like me attacks it (not knowing that it counts as an attack on a player if you attack their pets).  And thus I was KOS by the guards, quickly murdered and then taunted for my ""newb"" mistake.

My second experience with griefing came when I left the newbie zone.   There's always a ""welcoming committee"" of PKers waiting just a little ways outside the zone entrance to make sure you get welcome-murdered.  From talking to higher level players, it doesn't get better, just make sure you travel in groups if you want to explore the countryside OR you are exceptionally powerful.

If you want a similar game but without the PvP / Grief aspect, I recommend checking out Project Gorgon.   Won't be free-to-play, but frankly I'm tired of the model that allows a rotating door of toxic players to get banned and then just recreate accounts to come back in again.",1442769379,1443231303,False,55,7,0.550439417362213135,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Charaktermodelle sehen teilweise so schlimm aus wie bei Gothic 1 (damals gut , heute nicht mehr) .

Pros
Be anything you want
Awesome combat
Hugely diverse playstyles
Full loot PvP
Meainingful alignment system
Territorial control
World building
Creature control via taming/domination
Tons of things to discover

Cons
Sub is an absolute requirement to play the game effectively
Extremely steep learning curve
Very difficult barrier of entry
Small amounts of information available(is a pro if you enjoy learning things yourself)
Creating a gimped character can affect how effective you are in which role you choose(google templates for whatever you plan to play)
Lots of griefing in main cities(blue blocking etc to make you flag criminal)

Viele Fähigkeiten sind so total nutzlos da sie erst ab Skillstufe 60+ sinnvoll/effektiv werden. das hat zur folge dass man in den leichten Gegenden mit dutzenden anderen ""free2playern"" rumgammelt und sich entweder um die paar vorhandenen gegner prügelt oder von abonnenten zur schlachtbank geführt wird (respawnen in so einem fall meistens sinnlos da der/die am nächsten liegenden Wiederbelebungspunkte durch spawncamping blockiert wird). bewegt man sich von besagten ""leichten"" Zonen weg, erwartet einen oft schnell der Tot durch deutlich stärkere NPC-gegner, meistens wird man jedoch spätestens an einem der viel zu engen übergänge in eine andere Zone von anderen Spielern (i.d.R. abonnenten, welchen man als f2p´er grundsätzlich nur als besser punchingball dient) weggenatzt.

Hello, Corrupted games,  from support, to ingame staff, and even forums moderators.

Heres a short story, i been baned 7x by a power tripping gm, i ended up duping to ruin their economy 3 yrs ago.
I been pardoned by support team and they allowed me back ingame and on forums, as a new player with no history.
They PROMISED ME, i could be safe, and sub my account, and never have a probleme if i followed the rules, which i did.

Heres a link to one of my conversation with their staff team : http://imgur.com/a/2btYa

On these screenshot, you can see that i am asking, to be unbaned, because they perma banned me, on 1st offense, for spamming, which is clearly not the apropriate consequence.

Then you see this power tripping staff, who totaly says what support decided, doesnt matter to him, and hes the king and he decide.

Then he changes the terms of the deal i had with the support.
He threatens me.
He says if i use another account, than blackmage 111 or this one (cartel666)  i will be banned.
I understand, that i can use both.

blackmage111 account been perma banned, because i posted negative stuff about Mortal online, here, on the steam forums.
The account cartel666, been banned today, for Forum Rules Violations.
The rule i violated, is using an alternate account, to contact them, to see why my first account, been perma banned, for the most dumb reason i ever heard.

Their answer?  ban this account too. and threaten to ban my ingame account, if i ask for a forum unban again.

They have zero respect for their own rules and policies.

Other than that, The game is very unique. You'll never find as much bugs on 1 game at once. Its unique. This game have this little something other games dont have. Corruption and Bugs.

This is just a little bit, or all the coruption i been victim of, But i decided to show this one, cus this is post steam release.For anyone who state there is no more corruption since steam release.

my favorite sentence from Lead GM Discord ever :  im starvault, im mortal online, im the law, (your account has been banned for 24.000 hours)

Open  support tickets. get deleted.
go on forums and pm a staff to talk. Account banned.
Log 2nd account to talk to staff. Get banned, for ban evading.
Contact henrik. he got no time.
Contact sebastian, He dont care.


I dream of a game that has people that could look at the logs, (correctly)  and answer support ticket questions,   But ingame staff, should have no power, beside  Res, and un-stuck

I paged a gm 4 days ago, cus i fell down a hill, and my lootbag was stuck on the side *unreachable*  and  i tell the gm  my loot cant be looted.  and he refuse to help me,   someone jump down the cliff and close his client to dodge the fall dmg (exploit)  and the gm do nothing, i tell him about it, he says nothing, *i cant help you*
i get friends to come chase the guy and kill him. he ran to a nodeline, and no loot appear. the gm goes and  *this is a very very rare bug, unfortunatly nothing can be done to retrieve the lootbag, im sorry.
im like wtf, this guy exploit to loot my shit u do nothing, now he exploit to not lose his shit u do nothing?  am i supose to camp nodelines with my buddy so if i get zerg i can never lose my loot?
gm answer : fine.
GG  
so my question now is,  why do a gm i page for help, refuse to help, ignore someone who is exploiting in his face,  and then i make a joke about ima go exploit that bug too, he goes fine,  

why are we paying for this?
Game should be 100% free to play up to 100% skill & stats.  no one should be paying for this.
unless they fix the bugs, and give a training to the gm  to explain them, whats logical and whats not, whats legal and whats not, whats an exploit and whats not.


PS : i keep reading the rules over and over and over, and i cant find where it says if i post negative review and trash talk about the game ON STEAM FORUMS, ill be perma ban from MO forums.
anyone got a link for that specefic rule please?",1442724056,1442724056,False,16,2,0.623430967330932617,2,False,False,False,False,,,

I have over the 6 years played Mortal Periodically for around 2 years in total. I will to the best of my ability express why you should or shouldnt Play this game. 

 First I'm going to adress the Cons

- Buggy Glitchy and  still Unpolished ( Not nearly as bad as it used to be.)
- Community is a mixed bag, sadly with more rotten candy than I'd like.
-It can be frustrating, especially when losing your stuff due to cons 1 or 2.
-Slow Developement
- Despite the plethora of available options, there are only a few tried and true methods that fit the ""flavor of the month"" meta/late game.
- Difficult to play solo, group orriented
- Sizable Learning Curve
- Can suck away your life.
- PvP focused ( There is lot's of PvE content, however in the end it all fuels the endless PvP war machine.) 
- One server means latency issues. ( To a degree)

 This is a sizable and honest List, many people will get hung up on these issues and I don't blame you, though before you cast your hammer down in judgement, just hear me out.

The Pros:
-Sandbox - Freedom is Nice
-Crafting Is incredibly complex ( Some Professions more than others)
-The PvP is intense and a blast. ( Full loot adds that adrenaline, you really feel that risk of losing your hard work during the fight)
- No Levels, just skills that are trained through use or passively by reading.
-Interesting politcal scene. (Large groups of people, limited resources, open PvP, all makes Server wars a common thing.)
-One server ( Diverse fun playerbase despite the bad fruit, I havent met a more interesting smathering of players. Does -playing with Aussies, Germans, Swedes, Brits, Spaniards, Brazilians, Irishmen, and Canadians all in the same Team speak sound fun. Does to me)
-A dedicated developer who keeps chugging away ( The little Starvault that could)
- Being a trader and crafter is completely viable (Though you'd be missing a sizable portion of the game)
- No other game quite like it. (It's why I keep returning)
- In the end the Games world is shaped by the players. 
- Game lore is pretty decent.

 Despite the games shortcomings, I've had some of my fondest gaming memories on here and have met some of the coolest people too. Sure being a new player is harsh and I reccomend you find a good honest group of people to help you learn. There are many people in the game who will make your life hell, you will cuss and scream but in the end if you work hard enough,  play smart  and make quality friends, you can accomplish some pretty neat things.

TL;DR
Games is mediocre, The expereinces you'll have playing it, Priceless.

Osoby wychowane na WoW i innych cukierkowych, casualowych MMORPG nie mają tu czego szukać.
W przeciwieństwie do wyżej wymienionych gier, tutaj nie jesteś cudownym wybrańcem (jak wszyscy inni gracze, lol), na którego czekają setki epickich questów. Tutaj mamy do czynienia z sandboxem pełną gębą. Twórcy dają nam do dyspozycji zabawki, a to jak będziemy się nimi bawili zależy tylko od nas.

Teraz co nieco o samej rozgrywce- mamy tu grę z otwartym światem, widokiem z pierwszej osoby, walką podobną do serii The Elder Scrolls, pełnym PvP (ograniczanym tylko w miastach obecnością strażników, którzy za przewinienia nie zawahają się ubić delikwenta), z pełnym lootowaniem ekwipunku. TAK! Jak zginiesz, wszystko ci miałeś przy sobie zostaje przy twoich zwłokach, podatne na kradzież przez innych ludzi (dlatego cenne przedmioty, walutę trzeba zostawiać w banku). A gracze znaleźli wiele sposobów na uprzykrzanie życia innym, nawet w zdawałoby się bezpiecznych miastach (np. niesławne „blueblocking” czyli celowe wskakiwanie komuś pod miecz, żeby ten w chwili trafienia został oznaczony jako rozbójnik i mógł zostać bezkarnie zabity). Nie ma taryfy ulgowej, trzeba pilnować własnych pleców.

Jednak poza próbami przetrwania w tym bezwzględnym świecie jest masa innych rzeczy do roboty. Od rozwiniętego craftingu, gotowania, oswajania zwierząt, budowania domostw i innych budowli, przez ekonomię napędzaną przez graczy (u vendorów kupimy tylko podstawowe, najsłabsze przedmioty- wszystko lepsze musi zostać wytworzone przez graczy), po karierę złodziejską i wiele innych rzeczy.

Ogólnie jest to najbliższa rzecz kultowej Ultimie Online z jaką się spotkałem w chwili pisania tej recenzji. Również system płatności jest niczym z tamtej epoki, gdyż… darmowość gry to tak naprawdę wersja próbna. Nasze skille ograniczone są do 60 poziomu, nie możemy bawić się w złodziejstwo czy stawiać bardziej złożonych budynków. Te ograniczenia ściąga z nas abonament. Mnie pasuje, bo dzięki temu nie ma w grze głupot typowych dla gier free-to-play, czyli bzdetnych mikrotransakcji na każdym kroku.

Czy polecam? Na liczniku mam 63h, a gra wciąż mi się nie znudziła. Choć daleko jej do doskonałości, to jednak wytrwałym graczom potrafi dostarczyć naprawdę świetnej rozrywki. W końcu MMORPG, gdzie interakcje z innymi graczami (te pozytywne i negatywne) są kluczowym aspektem gry, gdyż w dzisiejszych tytułach ten element jest strasznie wykastrowany i z powodzeniem można by z nich wyciąć elementy multiplayerowe.",1442709060,1442757754,True,17,0,0.681785523891448975,1,False,False,False,False,,,

To be honest, the majority of negative reviews about this game should be ignored. Not because they are wrong as much as because most (even some of the valid complaints) stem from the words of those who simply just cannot handle playing Mortal Online. I have played (at the time of writeing this) nearly 15 hours and so far I love it. I will even go as far as to say that this game is what ""Elder Scrolls: Online"" should have been...

Before I go on with my moderately lengthy review, lemme be honest as far as where my complaints are concerned. The things I feel could be better are as follows: 

1. Buildings we can actually enter that aren't just there for show.
2. Better guard A.I.
3. A little more lore.
4. Some minor bug fixes, mostly collision.

And that is litterally the extent of my complaints... Minor aren't they? I mean, even if the DEV ignores those four things, I will still play because they aren't really so important as to stop me from enjoying myself. So now that I have made my complaints, lemme go into what it is I enjoy about it:

1. Total open world.
2. Absolute freedom.
3. No fetch quests or quests of any sort, except the 5-10 minute tutorial.
4. Nudity.
5. Descent graphics. Deffinately not bad, better than WOW.
6. No ""Level-Up"" system, as you improve your skills you also improve your attributes.
7. PvP servers only.
8. When you die, you lose your loot, like in real life.
9. The game doesn't hold your hand.
10. No world map.
11. You must eat/drink/sleep to survive.
12. You can build your own home.
13. The difference between Subscribing and Free-To-Play is minor compared to other MMOs.
14. Very, VERY large world.
15. In first person mode only.
16. The fact you can write a book and freakin' sell it for coin.

With all that said, the game is for the extremist, if you want anything other than an extreme game that will give you a fun experience and yet remain as close to real life realism as possible then this is not the game for you. This game is crazy realistic in many ways and I am willing to bet that nine out of every ten people who complain about this game only do so because of that very fact. My advice, try it.... Its free. If you don't like it, be honest, don't make up crap while using steam as a catalyst for your nonsensical bull crap. Enjoy.

EDIT: After getting booted off the server due to an admin Blue Blocking (that is standing in front of a player as they attack something causing the attacking player to get attacked by everyone as a result) I can no longer reccomend this game. It is a cheap tactic and something that should be fixed but isn't. It corrupts the game, considering everone does it so they can get your s**t.

This game is filled with nothing but griefers that will pray on new players making sure they wont leave their starting cities by killing them and taking their stuff. I had to keep on starting from scratch and back up to where I was just to be killed by a vet on horses who armor are almost indestructible and whose weapons can cut right through your armor and kill you with one blow. Even 2 AI guards has a hard time killing them and the guards are powerful. Thats how strong these players are. They even camp the graveyards in the cities where noobs go to make money.

Also other players will keep on killing your horse/donkey, the ones you bought with your gold that takes you a couple of days to make, just for the heck of it anywhere even infront of guards just to watch you rant. Most vets in this game are murderers which are worst than criminals. They prey on noobs and gets a kick out of killing them while they're trying to learn the game. They do this because they know they have years and years exp in this game before it came out on steam. You will barely get to explore the world alive because they are also patrolling the lands outside the city to track and kill you. The only way to explore the lands is as a ghost. Be warn, when you revive at a priest, there will be a vet with their name in bold red letters which signals they are murders and they will kill you. Do not download this game because this game is made to support griefers. Im ending my subscription and hanging this game up. I was so excited to see a game like this but once you exp it, you will be let down. Nothing but bad community and too many criminal RP. Today was my last day. What did it was, I bought a horse which cost 4 gold and 50 silver. Went to go buy equipment for it. Had a large bag equiped on my horse so I can carry items to trade. Bought a 1000 food for the horse which cost 1 gold for the journey. I put on my armor and equiped myself with my shield and weapon. got on the horse and was ready to explore. Soon as I stepped out the city gates i made it 100 yards away from the gate. All the sudden POW get hit by a powerful mace and my guy feel off the horse and died. Then I watched my horse fall from one blow. 

A screen popped up with the murderer name saying report murderer. For what? He is already red and enjoys killing! So far I died more than 30 times in within 16.6 hrs from blue blockers, murderers, and criminals. I lost 4 donkeys and 2 horses from criminals. 10 of those deaths was me trying to leave the city and 2 of those 10 deaths was from me reviving at a priest in a town i traveled to as a ghost just to die from a murderer patrolling the town buildings. For those that dont know what blueblockers are, they are players jumping infront of you while you are swinging your weapon to kill a animal or the dead just for you to accidentally hit them so you can turn grey which grants everybody to kill you and take all your stuff because your now a criminal.

You start by getting a mission to skin and kill pigs. But no information about HOW to do it. After a while you find out that you should right click to get carcass after killing the pig. Ok fine. But then? You kill 8 of them and you cant walk. First you think it is a bug. But then you realize that everything has a weight. Ok.. They did not inform me about that. You want to trow them away but happens to eat some raw pig by mistake (oh, fine there you discovered the eating function in the game) You throw them all away and start collecting anew.

And then?

What?

Well in the chat you find out you should skin them with the skinning knife. But ok, fine. You click inventory and find no such knife in inventory.

You ask again. And after asking 5 minutes in chat without anyone caring about you, you find out that you should use L and the butchers buttom. The knife is a skill. Ah, ok, fine... I did not know that I am a butcher. But there is still NO information in the tutorial whatsoever about how to do it. You scroll the help and find nothing useful there.

In the chat one person says drag the carcass into the box that pops up when you click the buttom. What box? You cant see any box popping up.

Then suddenly you cant do more than look in the ground. You wonder if it is a bug. Until you try pressing Z and are able to do it walk normal again.Ok nice feature. It was really fun staring down on the ground for some minutes.

you still try to collect skin for some minutes while asking in the chat how to do it?

After 4 minutes without an answer you freak out and consider ragequitting. You are all stuffed because you have eaten so much pig by mistake. 

You see a knight killing some freshspawns so you quit. Uninstall.

------------------

That is my story. Wasted a lot of time. With proper information about what to do I could have killed the pigs easily.

And who came up with he brilliant idea to let 20 freshspawns kill pigs at the same time while allowing other players to kill the freshspawns?

So... How did the company think when they creaed a game without ANY information about how to even start playing the game and accomplish the first mission?

I cant recommend it as of now. There is NO way one can learn ingame how to even start playing.",1442469505,1442473170,False,2,1,0.498098880052566528,1,False,False,False,False,,,

It belongs to a very niche genre that will NOT appeal to all (or even many) gamers. But you'll find some neat and UNIQUE elements.

In what other (current, 3D) MMORPG can you pickpocket other players?

What other online games have mystery left in the world, with yet unexplored areas (Sarducca), and rare, powerful potions with recipes that nobody knows, a whole five years after release?

In Mortal Online, with enough work, you can build a CITY with NPC guards that follow the laws that you set, even where new players spawn.

In Mortal Online, you can tame GIANT, fierce, exotic animals.

You want to run around and solo everything? Not the game for you. You'll have to team up with other players and work together if you want to take out the strongest creatures and delve the deepest dungeons.

You want to be able to be completely self-sufficient, mastering all crafts? Too bad. Mortal Online encourages players to specialize in specific areas (Fighter, Tamer, Mage, Archer, Architect, Armor crafter, Weapon craft...) and then work together.

Mortal Online a realistic fantasy game. First-person locked, with no in-game map with GPS functionality. The far majority of the game is not explained to you, and you are forced to (shock!) interact with other players to figure out things.

It's a little bit EVE Online, a little bit Elder Scrolls, and a little bit Mount and Blade Warband.

С одной стороны - это отличная песочница с полнейшей свободой действий, а с другой - это что-то ужасное, слепленое словно на коленке, несмотря на годы разработки (реально, мне кажется, что первые арты  видел лет эдак 10 назад, а в википедию лезть лень).

Что же получилось у разрабов? Ну... замороченный и навороченный крафт, удобная, простая в начальном освоении боевая система. Хардкор, свободное ПВЕ и фулл-лут. Все круто и в стиле УО, НО, тут вылезает большое НО. Про ультиму до сих пор шутят, что ""из таверны вышел голый мужик и убил меня"". Тут то же самое. Прокачанный персонаж бегает голышом, ибо на броню денег жалко (фулл-лут помним). Это вызывает стойкое отторжение, тем более, что голозадых персонажей уйма (а если в клиенте разрешить полную обнаженку, то это вообще превращается в сюр - даже пенисы прорисовыаны, выглядит довольно мерзко). Но пойдем дальше. Дальше у нас крафт. Он прекрасен и ужасен одновременно. 
Прекрасен, поскольку каждый предмет можно скрафтить из различных сочетаний материалов - это круто. Но вот узнать что получится заранее, невозможно даже приблизительно. Даже если это сочетание вы уже крафтили, хотя и можно записать рецепт на бумажку (не знаю что это даст, но можно, факт). Далее, если вы решите добывать руду и выплавлять из нее металлы, то вам останется только закрыться в келье и познавать дзен. Ибо рецептов нет, и даже найденные вами не сохраняются. К слову, логично, что для выплавки руды нужна руда и катализаторы (уголь там и тому подобное), но здесь еще нужно подбирать соотношение руда:катализатор1:катализатор2. И получиться могут самые разные вещи. В общем крафт кожаной брони - это великолепно, а крафт металлической брони и оружия натыкается на вот такие приколы. И да, на рынке готовых металлов я так и не увидел, а так купил бы за любую сумму.

Засем тут нужны деньги вообще непонятно. Ну то есть кое-что продается у торговцев NPC, но это кое-что стоит копейки и большей частью элементарно добывается с мобов за каких-то пол-часа в любых количествах. Экономика тут в состоянии противозачаточном, как и интерфейс.

Отсутствие карты я могу понять - хардкор же, спасибо хоть компас оставили. Но хотя бы возможность купить карту, без указания места персонажа на ней, стоило бы сделать (это даже в майнкрафте есть).

Итого:
Плюсы:
Хардкор.
Фулллут.
Куча возможностей, просто огроменная куча.
Невероятное количество навыков (серьезно, вы не сможете даже ходить, не прокачав какой-то скилл).
Крафт, навороченный и крутой.
Боевая система, скучноватая но реалистичная и неплохая.
Реализм во всем и везде.

Минусы:
Голые ПК. Тысячи их.
Интерфейс.
Интерфейс.
Интерфейс. Он просто ужасен.
Экономика в глубокой заднице.
Слишком быстрая прокачка (за неделю можно свой ""класс"" раскачать на максимум по, играя по 2 часа в день).
Ограничение максимума скиллов (учитывая их количество - это ужасно). Вы не можете быть крафтером оружия и щитов сразу. 2 разных перса нужны на это. И майнером и крафтером не можете - в ограничение упретесь.
Интерфейс.
Куча голых персов, которым жалко своего лута.

Итог: взглянуть на игру стоит. И даже возможно вам понравится, если вам не влом питаться камнями и спать одним глазом, опасаясь и за себя и за петов и за лут. И даже когда-нибудь она сможет стать ИГРОЙ, а не перфомансом, странным и малоиграбельным. Но взглянуть стоит.",1442347072,1442347072,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I did a review a few years back and the main issues i had then have been addressed and have gone on to play the game alot since then.  Found a nice large guild to play with.Doing PVP and PVE content. 

PROS:
Hours of diverse gameplay
Guilds are very tight knit groups and helpful
Large range of character builds to try/master
Rare/Difficult skills to master/obtain
Excellent crafting system
Viable being a non combat character
Guild town/keep system is well done
Guild sieges/wars
Large world  


CONS:
No pve zones
Some large troll/ganking guilds
Sub paywall limits casuals from learning some skills
Dated graphics
Starter towns aren't new player friendly (tutorialwise & playerwise)

In the end playing this solo can be tough since there is a high chance of being killed by guilds if your not in one. Form your own guild or join one. Most guilds have a keep which is your home away from home surrounded by friendlies. Be wary of unknown people passing you by in the world.

1:
The guard system is handy for protection , but i died twice attacking accidentally a guard because he was in my way it would be a good idea to allow them to use ONLY ranged attacks
2:
The fact that F2P'ers cant own a house is a little irritating for me because i was looking forward to making my little hut and starting a shop. Guess i have to be a traveling merchant.



You can pretty much do anything in this game to make money.
Mining , weapon crafting , trading , cooking , even being a bounty hunter (Bounty hunting is known as 'Advanced pvp' so i recommend it mostly to P2P'ers).

No place is safe.    You are accountable for your actions within the game too.

There is much to learn in MO.  This game is hard!     You have to explore and figure out for yourself how you want your character to be.   Which is not easy as there are so many choices.    Note:  One character can NOT be all things.   You have to decide what best suits you.   Not an easy task.

There are problems, it does have glitches.  But nothing that game stopping to me.   The GM's are friendly and helpful and have had no problems with long ques waiting for help.   I find it refreshing to play a game that does not bore me with in a short time.   Most games do cause they are just too easy.

When you fight, you have to aim.  No just clicking a button and the game taking over.   You must be sure the foe is in your range and sight.    Learn how to handle the weapon, fighting stance, parry, blocking, etc..  Again, this game is difficult.   

If you are looking for an easy game.  This is not for you.   

If you are looking for a challenge.  Want to explore.  Want to feel like every little goal is a great accomplishment when you succeed, then this is the game for you.

there are A LOT of negative posts on reviews but do not let that put you off, it is a game that does have a harsh learning curve, full of scoundrels that will pick on the weak and will leave you scratching you head for more then a few hours, because of this it is not for the weak willed or non adventurous type.

this game literally has me hooked, i spent the first 5 hours running around the starter city picking flowers and selling them, browsing the forums for guilds and finally found one that suited me, i will admit due to my carefulness and knowing what people are like in full loot drop games i managed to stay alive the whole time without many issues whilst i saw post after post of people being murdered in the help chat or complaining that they hit someone and the guards blew them up.

it quickly became apparent people had no clue or are unused to the game, warnings are there on the screen but people do not see them or ignore them and complain after.

i joint a guild, left whatever i had there and went to Moh ki, i died on the way by slipping down a mountain, it was bound to happen, i was a ghost and continued to make my way to Moh ki where i spawned at the priest, joined up with my fellow comrades and have been farming the area to amass my fortune.

this game is really fun, can be a grind but there are ways around it, you can be anything you want but have to create characters specific to what you want to be any good, it takes some time to get used to the skill system but reading up on things is essential unless you have a group of people to fire questions at.

not everyone is a murderer, there are traders and the such also and friendly people you just need to get away from the starter towns that is a must you cant stop morons hanging around Noob areas praying on the weak but can be avoided if you think on your feet.

there are definitely still a few bugs, but can be worked around and not too annoying or game breaking that i can see.

there is a ton to do and i can bet if you get into it you will not stick to one character or if you do you will have to specialize even for pay to play as you have a limit of 1100 skill point and a max soft limit of 100 for each primary skill so choose wisely.

overall, its a good mix, lots to do, good community when you get past the initial stages and the game has plenty to offer and is unlike any other MMORPG i have personally played.

give it a go even on free to play like i am now, play past the initial stages, join a group that suites you and give it a proper go, it takes longer then 2 hours to get past this stage i would say.

All the best.

Das Spiel ist auch ganz nett, will man weiter kommen, muss man aber die Stargebiete schon bald verlassen, um an höherwertige Resourcen zu kommen und da fängt der Ärger an. Zuerst stößt man auf massig Gildenfestungen, die scheinbar wahllos in der Gegend stehen, gefühlte Quadrakilometer groß sind und viele wichtige Rohstoffe blockieren. Hat man dann mal einen Spot gefunden, wird man ständig von PKs gegankt, die einem scheinbar die sauer verienten Silberlinge nicht gönnen und solche Spots regelrecht abklappern um harmlose Arbeiter zu killen. Ich kann schon nicht mehr zählen, wie oft ich gekillt wurde und wie viele Esel ich verloren habe (Pets kann man auch töten und sind permanent tot).
Auch ist DER Server (ja nur ein Server für alle) seit dem Steamrelease vollkommen überlaufen, selbst mit einem Premiumaccount muss man während der Hauptzeiten mit Wartescheifen rechnen. 
Die Community ist bunt gemischt, von den letzten Deppen, die denken mit Capslock kriegt man eher eine Antwort, bis hin zu absolut netten Leuten, alles da.
Skills gibt es wirklich massig und zu tun hat man auch genug, daran solls nicht liegen, aber insgesamt wirkt das Spiel sehr unprofessionell.
Gestern hatte ich ein Problem und habe den Support angeschrieben, der GM war zwar hilfreich, aber auf formelle Sachen muss man dabei verzichten.
Das Spiel hat viel Potential, welches teilweise auch genutzt wird, aber es ist einfach schlecht umgesetzt.
Für jemand, der gute Nerven hat und über das eine oder andere hinweg sehen kann, ist das Spiel sicher OK, sonst sollte man es lieber lassen.",1442209427,1442210002,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I really do.  It has semi-retro graphics which I actually like, the progression of skills isn't handed out easily, and it really makes you figure things out (which can be a little annoying at times).  For me the game really captured the feeling of open world exploration as danger is around every single blade of grass and tree however it has been spoiled by the, in my opinion, overly amount of PKing going on.  I know it is a Hardcore PK type game.  I get that entirely and I tried to embrace it.  But the amount of blue blocking and zerg mentality in the game make it hard to believe that this is a truly believeable breathing world.  It's hard enough to time your attacks with the way enemies seem to move through your character and sometimes possess the same space, making it extremely difficult to even get a kill in without having to run and rest.  I witnessed a group of people enter a crypt only to have them get jumped by several undead (which was truly cool to witness in the retro way it is delivered).  Instead of rallying together two fought side by side while the third attempted to kill the other two in an attempt to fully loot them, while the forth ran past me outside.  And it is contagious, even I would jump on a helpless player due to the extreme lifestyle the game provides.  I even bought a second character slot for a crafting type toon to support my warrior.  So your option is to buy skill books and wait several days of real life time to pass (which does pass while logged off as well).  But I want to PLAY the game not log in, click a book, log off and wait.  It's almost like you need to wait a month offline until your toon is done reading an entire library of crap in order to stand a chance.  Guess it's back to waiting for me.



TLDR version:  Awesome game, challenging and fun.  Wish the game had a PvE server for players who wished to explore the game without having to fear of high end players running them down on horseback.  The only real option to level up your skills is to purchase books and log off while your character reads them.  Really takes the ""skill"" out of skilling up. Combat needs improvement.

Take into account this is a ""first hour"" review. I havent spent 400 hours in the game, explored hlvl content, etc..
I just created a toon, and tested the game a bit...
And already, I can feel it wont be on my HDD much longer.

1) Its ugly. Graphics are dated, thats a given. But thats just ""technical"". Here, its dated, but its also not very appealing. Art direction is just... Well... Meh. I guess it was all the ""Medieval is supposed to look dirty and ragged"" trend. But it fails at that.
2) Its unstable. Crashed already 3 times. Lags, freezes.
3) Two minutes in game and I already have a moron stealing my loot repeatedly (dont worry, I'll follow you too and steal your loot... well I would have if the game hadnt crashed :p ).
4) Gameplay... Well, it feels clunky. I'm just swinging a sword at pigs, and it feels like... Well, like my character doesnt know the pointy end from the other, for one (but that would actually be nice if it was a feature... except I fear its not). And like I'm clicking a mouse. Charging a hit doesnt feel like anything. It all feels hollow and clunky.

There's some good too.
I like the idea of raising stats by doing things (run and your stamina increases, hit and your strength goes up, etc.). I liked it in Dungeon Siege too.
I like the character creation and how ascendance and things like age affect your stats. Even if its not always very clear.

Basically... I'll try again, to see if its just the first hour that feels like that... If the city looks better... etc.. But I still feel like theres much better in the F2P world...

If you liked Ultima Online before the facet split - this might be for you. :)

-People can murder you at any time and take everything you have on you

-They can steal your things (from your inventory)

-They can make armor out of your skin


To a lot of people that might be frustrating and at times it can be but at other times it turns such occurances into epic tales of survival and triumph when you live through an attack despite overwhelming odds or recovering your belongings from your corpse before other people get their greedy mits on them.

Plus points:

-Very interesting crafting system with no (very few) fixed item recipes

-Taming, magic, archery, mount breeding, the works

-Incredible degree of freedom with according penalties (you can eat leather but dont complain if it gives you problems :P)

-Interesting weight system if you work out a lot like running or fighting or whatever and only eat shitty food with low sustenance values you will waste away to a skinny twig (with penalties to your strength etc) - the opposite is also true if you only eat fatty food all the time and rarely move because you stay in town all the time crafting you will get fat ^^

-Be what you want to be, a thief, a feared murderer, trader, crafter, adventurer, tamer you name it

This game is not for you if you like:

-brainafk farming in the same spot without any awareness of your surroundings (you WILL die if you don't stay vigilant)

-keeping everything on your character or at least way more things than you are prepared to lose

-the idea that people can pickpocket you and steal stuff from your inventory

-questing sprees or any type of themepark-like game experience - you make your own adventure 


If you give this a go never keep anything on you you're not prepared to lose - even in town.

A lot of the negative comments mention Blueblocking which is annoying but this mainly happens in the starting town and the graveyard but this once again comes down to situational awareness, always keep track of your surroundings if people lurk around you behaving suspiciously without actually doing something themselves they ARE probably out to get you in some way or another.
Keep enough distance from others so that if you swing your weapon they wont have enough time to run in front of your swing and generally don't swing your weapon around like a madman especially in the graveyard where lots of players are in a small space trying to get the spawning mobs.
Or leave town altogether and try to find your luck there where blueblocking is generally not an issue (but player killers are more prevalent so watch out)

Long story short I love this game so far it is strongly influenced by ultima online and the degree of freedom is fairly unparalleled. And while that of course opens the door to thieves and spawn killers and other things like that, it also enables you to have a very rewarding experience if you can weather the storm.
I enjoy the rush of knowing that training a skill outside of town or gathering things or whatever can turn into a fierce battle at any time - the risk is what makes things that happen in this game memorable, death has an impact.
Also beheading someone who killed you before and then making soup from their head or feeding it to your dog is incredibly satisfying :P

TLDR; Very rewarding experience if you don't let deaths and loss of items get to you. It is a hostile environment but that just increases the impact random acts of kindness have when a stranger passing by saves your life or hands you a suit of armor because you seem to have lost it all. (Dont beg for things it's unbecoming and everybody hates it ^^)

Strongly recommended but don't say I didn't warn you ;)

I'd like to address two of your points:

Mortal Online is a subscription based game that offers an unlimited free trial, or a ""free to play mode"", which is essentially the same model as World of Warcraft but with much less restrictions for free accounts. This does not mean ""pay to win"".

Our servers are deliberately restarted once daily at 14:00 CEST to keep the database fresh. We are constantly working to improve the server queue system and it is a lot easier to get into the server at peak hours now than it was a week or two ago."

was still like that 2 and 3 years after release.
It is still like this now, after steam release.  About 6 years after their Official Mortal online launch.

In reality, i been a fan and a subscriber of this game since its release.  But i think its time now, after they confirmed that arent abble to update anything properly, even with MONTHS of preparation, if not Year, for the steam release.

I spent over 400 dollards, subing different account, since Mo official release.   I wish i never heard about this game.

with 400 dollards, i would have so many and so better games.

I recently bought few ALPHA and Beta games, that are under production.  6 of them, and i promise, tfuckhat all 6 are WAYYY better, have WAYYYY more content, have WAYYYYY less bug, and zero gm corruption.


If you want to spend a 15-20 bucks well. Instead of this crappy piece of shit MO game, you should buy ANY alpha/beta that comes out, and i promise you itll be better, than Mortal online. 





Thanks for reading my review, i know its very negative and maybe sound like hater... but i never hated this game,  I quited it a year ago cus i was bored of spending money on it. and with the steam release, i had hope for it again, and after 2 days playing it, and encountering about 50 different bug, even a duplicate one. I hate it now.


Even if u take a shit game like Darkfall, or a beta/alpha like reign of king, or ARK.
There is like 400x more content, on the loading screen of those game, than in whole MO game.
and whats surprising, compared to MO, is that when i use the word content, im talking about stuff that actually works, as intented.
which you'll never find in MO.

Also, for anyone interested, If you swap stuff from your horse, to your inventory, while crossing a node line,  your stuff will duplicate.  Because this game sucks, and after 6 years + , they still bring OLD duplicate bugs back, with every patch.
There are some bugs, that are ingame since release. 

and no, instead of fixing the already existing bugs, thats been fucking their game up, and making their subscriber quit, they keep trying to make it bigger bigger more content more stuff more continent  more animals  more monsters......more bugs.  without fixing the previous ones.

Everywhere you will walk, you will encounter a bug,
Everythiing you touch will end up buging,
anyways, games released on steam 2 weeks ago, theres what?  400 negative review for 100-150 positive ones...

This review here, is from a player, who played, spent time, money, since Alpha one test, and played thru release, till, 1 year ago when i quited cus game was total bullshit.I just came back for steam release, and i see no difference, beside fact they addded that shitty buggy continent that everyone avoid going on.",1442032084,1442032769,False,102,10,0.642469942569732666,17,False,False,False,False,,1442405772.0,"Thank you for your feedback, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your time in Mortal Online.

Just to be clear, though:

- We do not have GM corruption in our game. That accusation is based on the fact that we had some bad experiences with volunteer GMs at one point, but that was over two years ago and we do not have any more volunteer GMs precisely because we do absolutely not tolerate anyone abusing their priviliges.

- There are no duplicate bugs like you describe in the game. We take duplication and reports of duplication very seriously. Sometimes server lag might appear like temporary duplication, but I assure you that we keep track of this and we do absolutely not allow any actual duplication."

Other things you'll find in this discussion?

Mods ignoring users attacking those with criticism because they are defending their game.(many people flinging mud and insults)
The person giving criticism being offered a job. (really damn suspicious to offer someone a job who is speaking out about your games problems)

Over all, the forums are kind of a shit show, and the mods and devs do not carry themselves like professionals.

This game has been out for 5 years now, and is currently on steam as a Free Trial.
Free trial in the sense that this game only allows free to play players to get slightly over half as strong as those who pay a monthly fee.

It runs like shit, on even the lowest settings for an average PC like mine which can run most other mmos (star trek online, Tera, Guild Wars 2. Champions online, Stardrive, Defiance. ect ect) on mid to high settings.
But this one runs terribly, and doesn't even look that fantastic whilst doing so.
Even people with high end systems in the forums can attest to log, stuttering, frame rate drops, and other issues.

The game is 10 gigs, it is not huge, but it's not small either.

If you love the sandbox, complexity, and attention to detail then this game is for you. 

Last night I ran away from skeletons and griefers. Looted my friends body. Gave him half his coin back (finders fee). Made a nice garment from his corpse (eww). Watched someone get blueblocked and his friends defend him as they backed away. Took cat naps in the graveyard. Terrifying! You can't see anything... and the sounds. Made a wooden war hammer because I had no ore. It broke. Killed a zombie, accidentally looted its corpse, which was heavy, and I nearly died because I was encumbered and couldn't get away. I had so much fun!

Besides open PvP there are some crucial sandbox points that StarVault  slam dunks with this game.
- No global bank
- Eve style auction house
- Gear needs to be continually replaced driving a real economy!
- No levels
- Craft anything from any reasonable material! Brilliant!

The list really goes on with some really bold divergences from your standard MMO, like no party system (when was it declared that adventurers shall number five?), friendly fire, no levels, and build anywhere.

I can't believe I didn't know about this game. I'm smitten. I'm posting here because the other commenters made hesitant to even install. Luckily the GMs are replying and unwavering unapologetic. ""Sorry your experience was bad. This game may not be for everyone."" So many games, seeking mass appeal, become more accessible and less interesting the longer you play.

In my experience as an EVE player full-loot-pvp-everywhere creates an environment that really necessitates the social aspects of an MMO. So make friends! Don't carry too much. Your losses will never be irrecoverable, and you will learn something from every death.

As to the griefers, They were there, but also vets healing and protecting newbies. This kind of emergent game play is what you can expect from a sandbox.

I played it again half a year later and then again and then again(it was ever improving mind you). I always played a month and took a break, mainly because of the subscription that is needed to not be handicapped compared to other players(at least now that it is free to play).

Give it a try and remember: It is HARDCORE, it truly is. you will be punished for every little mistake you make, like for example wandering out in the wild without the proper equipment or knowledge of your position. There are many players who will kill you just for the fun of it. It happened to me(not that often, but I am pretty cautious), it has been this way when it was released and it always will be. There are people like me, who will protect you from criminal scum, but they are few.

Now I have to point out, you CAN make it alone, you know. I did. I have a butcher, a armor crafter, a weapon crafter and a hunter/warrior. I did that all by my lonesome(I gathered intel from the forums and a few other guys tho), so I still got coin and can make all the equipment I need and buy mounts too. Many will tell you, you can not make it to anything alone in this game. It's not true you can, but it takes much time, much caution and even more planning and organization. To know when and where to hunt safely and when and where to travel to another hub to trade. Get the proper crafting experience, how to build your characters and so on and so forth. It is soooo damn hard. But it is possible.

Where this game probably most shines is guilds. Being in a guild that holds territory is quite fun and kewl. I haven't been in a big one, just minor ones. But I have been in a big battle about 3-4 years ago. A siege. It was amazing.

You gotta pay for a monthly subscription to even access what some say is endgame, but in reality half the skills are locked because of it, players kill on sight, making you drop your inventory, which they could care less about, and the GMs aren't even helpful most of the time. The servers are still under stress testing, the hit boxes on weaponry are poorly made (I had to get right on top of anything I wanted to hit, leaving no room for jesus if you get my meaning), and you die from practically anything and everything. I mean, even the magic needs resources you can't gather from the city, so that's no alternative to melee. I know, it's meant to be hardcore, but I refuse to pay money to increase skills so I can stand a bit of a chance against people who keep players from exiting the city.

bad hitboxes
still stress testing servers

Why? Not because it's hardcore, or because it forces you to compete against other players. I take it back because the system itself tries to screw you over, more so than the players.

An example: I went to the graveyard, avoiding the red players (the ones that murder players on purpose), and farmed the walkers. After a while, I got a lot of money from walker heads alone and got myself good gear. I decided to keep going back and forth between graveyard and head vendor to make cash; good idea, right? Well, that ended abruptly when a swarm of guards were lead into the graveyard and they proceeded to kill all the walkers. Once one respawned, I hurried to jump on it and secure the loot, but one guard walked through me from behind and my attack hit the guard instead.

The guard then killed me and all my loot was permanently gone, all because the guard was able to walk right through me and absorb my attack that wasn't meant for the guard.

So, the players did much less damage than the system did and ruined the game for me. Just FYI, once you die, you respawn 100% naked and have to restart from the beginning (yes, that means going all the way to the starter area and killing pigs, except this time with fists and not weapons).

P.S. Asked the GM about this problem and they said it's 100% my fault, even though guards aren't supposed to be in the graveyard.",1441901137,1441901215,False,4,4,0.491081267595291138,6,False,False,False,False,,,

I've quit and came back to this game at least 10 times. I hate it but I also love it, it is a strange relationship i have with this piece of software to be honest. Now that I do not have a proper internet connection service, I can't really play but I'm trying to solve that problem and jump right back in.

Now this game is full of bugs, unstable server issues, a griefing population in cities, unfair flagging system and many other issues but let me explain what this game is offering, why is it different from other games?

-The most important thing is the players' influence over the world. This is not a semi-mmo with 100s of servers with only 40 people in it. This is a real breathing world with people who have different goals. There are political conflicts, rpk guilds playing the role of bandits, hire swords, trading guilds, player made cities for new players and sometimes even world wars that changes the whole game for everyone.
This being said MO is not a very solo friendly game. Even if you have all the characters you need, sustaining yourself while having fun turns into a job more than a game. You might follow this path, dont get me wrong it is entirely possible however I would not recommend it especially to a newbie.

-Exploration is a great aspect of this game. You have a wast land to wonder around and experience. You do not have a map in game so learning the terrain is important. Learning the safe routes, hidden places and farming areas would give you an advantage. Also there are different things that you can explore than the terrain and the world. There are tons of combinations that you can try in alchemy, crafting, cooking.. etc. There is no stamina or mana potion still in the game as far as I know, you could be the first one to invent them and make a fortune out of it!

-Combat is different than you would find in other mmos. First person view changes everything, I might be biased in this are because I love FPS it gives the most realistic feeling, forces you to be more careful about your surroundings and to me FPS helps me bond with the game by putting me right inside of the world. 

-Mortal Online might not be the first game with the open world combat, without battlegrounds or instances but this game has a more tactical fight or flee type of combat once you get into it. For example having the high ground might change everything or herding your enemy to an open area with mounted fighters can change the course of battle. So the terrain is an important aspect in combat, knowing your way around it might save your life. This is not much of a difference you to other games you might think but with the full loot, knowing that you will lose something and hurt your/your guilds reputation if you die makes a whole a lot difference.

I'd say try it for yourself. As most of the people say here, it is not a game for everyone. But if you like it chances are you will not be able to quit it entirely as long as there is no other game like MO.",1441901132,1441901132,True,11,0,0.544487118721008301,0,False,False,False,False,,,

но чтобы открыть слот на аккаунте (Второго персонажа) надо купить его. все бы ничего если бы 1 сраный слот не стоил 9баксов. вот в этом печаль. было бы дешевле я бы с радостью и премиум проплатил и слоты пооткрывал. Жх рублик рублик чтож ты такой деревянный 

НО игру советую попробовать на F2P хотя бы для ознакомления, очень хардкорно.

The world outside of the main cities is pretty lifeless.  You can run for 20 minutes and come across the same trees and rocks you find in the city, which the city is in theory safer.  In reality you are more likely to be murdered in the PvE graveyard within the city than out in the wild.  Most likely this is because the murderers are so bored in the open, empty world the only place to kill is the starter zone.

The combat is clunky, and feels extremely out of date.  Movement is horrid.  Eventually developers may realize that only making sprint feel like a decent speed to move at, and then adding a stamina bar to limit sprint, is not very fun.  I found myself sprinting until out of stamina, resting for 5 seconds to refill the stamina, and then running again.  Overall it would probably be just as fast to go at walking speed, but that just feels too slow.

The skill system at first seemed interesting and deep.  Then you realize how pointlessly deep it is.  I'm not sure much is added to the game by having a skill for each of the following Zoology>Arthropoda>Chelicerata>Arachnida>Scorpiones, just to know about scorpions.

+ Открытое пвп, смерть с полной потерей лута. Одним словом - настоящий хардкор!

+ Песочница. Строй где хочешь и что хочешь.

+ Атмосфера здесь просто волшебная! Прямо за душу берет и не отпускает.

+ Огромный мир.

+ Уникальная система боссов. Она заключается в том что каждый босс - уникален в своём роде! Если его убить, он больше не появится. Но за то в мире появляются новые уникальные боссы.

+ Реалистичность. Я говорю не про физику и графику, я говорю про механику. Приведу пару примеров:

1) Пытаясь плыть в тяжелых доспехах, если вы недостаточно сильны - доспехи потянут вас ко дну. Если ваш инвентарь весит 15 кг - он также потянет вас ко дну. 

2) Вы не можете спрятать вашего питомца или маунта в рюкзак, он не исчезнит волшебным образом. Все ваши прирученые животные будут всегда бегать с вами, их нужно кормить, они могут отстать от вас и потеряться.  
Кстати о маунтах. Ваше ездовое животное сможет помогать вам нести ваш груз, для этого на него надо навешать кучу мешков и заполнить их вещами. Выглядит это прикольно. =)

 3) Нет волшебного общего чата. Новичкам в начале дают доступ в Help чат на несколько суток, и всё.

+ 4) Система боя. Вы не сможете ударить врага своим мечом если приблизитесь к нему в плотную. Максимум что у вас получится - это ударить его рукояткой. Вам нужно расчитывать расстояние с которого бить. Также вы должны целиться по слабым местам: если у врага доспех на правой руке слабее чем на левой - попав по правой  руке, вы нанесете больше урона. Также нужно стараться целиться в голову. Систему боя можно отдельно вынести в +.

+ Система крафта. Здесь можно скрафтить всё что угодно и из чего угодно. Вы можете скрафтить уникальный предмет, который не крафтил ещё ни кто. 


- Без знания английского в игре придется туго. 

- Без подписки особо не поиграешь, в игре есть ограничения. Но я не думаю что 300р в месяц - это много.


Игра с самого начала может показаться деревянной, после запуска её сразу хочется закрыть. Но не спешите этого делать. Пройдите цепочку начальных квестов, потратив на это ~ пол часа/час, После этого идите на кладбище, и встретьте там своих первых врагов - зомби и игроков. Только тогда вы сможете прочувствовать боевую систему и атмосферу!

В игре существует система пвп флагов. Суть её проста: 
Есть бомжи (их ник подсвечивается желтым цветом), граждане (голубой), преступники (серый), серийные убийцы (красный).  
Изначально вы бомж, затем после прохождения начальных квестов становитесь гражданином. Разницы почти нет.
Если вы ударите, убьете или залутаете труп желтого/синего игрока, то вы временно (2мин) становитесь серым - тогда вас может безнаказанно убить и залутать любой игрок, и цвет его ника не изменится.

3) Убогая стартовая локация. Я, лично, не являюсь любителем всяческих ММОРПГ онлайн игр и играю в них довольно редко. И в каждой из этих игр была интересная стартовая локация, которая могла зацепить игрока теми или иными аспектами. А тут всё очень плоско и некрасиво. 
4) Убогий, пизданутый интерфейс, который делал даун австралопитек долбя по клавиатуре булыжником.
5) Графон, кудаж без него, родимого?! Графон тут, мягко говоря, - шлак, если сравнивать его с тремя братьями, то графон тут, который был ""И так и сяк"". Единственное, что мне в нём понравилось, дак это лица персонажей, над лицами они хорошо поработали, но на всё остальное смотреть отвратительно.
6) БАГИ!
7) Нудные квесты. Ты появляешься и видишь какого-то нпс, который что-то там тебе рассказывает и отправляет побить свинюшек, потом, когда ты побьёшь свинюшек, он отправит тебя к другому нпс, который отправит тебя, внимание, побить свинюшек! Но, на этот раз тебе нужно выбить с этих свинюшек 16 кожи, каким хером ты это сделаешь - разбирайся сам. Потом нас отправили делать броню. Далее, нас отправили к какому-то другому нпс, который заставил нас, внимание, убивать кроликов -_- 
8) Подписка. Подписка тут осуществляется таким образом: когда игра вышла в стим, её сделали Free 2 Play, но, не всё так радужно, как кажется. В F2P версии игры перед нами закрыта возможность подбирания особо редких вещей, на которые я, кстати говоря, натыкался на стартовой локации. Как минимум, это огорчает, но и платить за ЭТО 300 рублей в месяц - нет, спасибо, обойдуся!
9) Боёвка и вид от первого лица уровень Reign of Kings. Короче говоря, всё очень деревянно.  

Перейдём к плюсам данной игры: 
1)Невъебенный, мать его, хардкор.
2) Пиздецки огроменный в мир, в которым можно потеряться нахуй и невернуться, и никакая мамка вас не найдёт, и не поможет вам песенка про Мамонтёнка. 
3) Интересная реализация городских фракций. Типа стражников и т.п. Когда нас конкретно эта игра заебала мы решили пиздить всё живое, в конце концов прибежали два стражника с мечами-гладунцами и насадили нас на них по самое не хочу. Также и с ворвством, но, воровство есть, опять же, в платной версии игры. Спалили - пизда. Не спалили - ноги в руки и в перёд, ну или наоборот, хуй знает, я заебался уже эту поеботу писать. 
4) Постройка своего города, которую ввели совсем недавно. 
Ну и больше плюсов я не нашёл. Вполне возможно, что это всё из-за того, что я очень мало поиграл в эту игру, но и тратить на неё время я не собираюсь.

The game is hard, it is not a game for the new generation of gamers. There is some bugs and glitches, and plenty of people will take advantage of you if you make a mistake. All in all, it is unforgiving, complex and rough... and I am loving it.

I dont know how to describe the game itself, it is like a weird mix of games such as UO, EQ, Eve Online and Mount and Blade. The community is fairly kind and helpful, although as with all games you have bad apples.

So to make a long story short, if you enjoy games that are challenging, I would strongly advice you to try this one out.
If you belong to the ""WoW""- generation, that expect everything to be handed to you on a silverplatter and instructions ala-follow-the-red-line, you will probably become frustrated and not enjoy it.

So this is a really good realistic game, where you can be evrything..:) A murder a bounty hunter a thief a tamer a blacksmith a miner an empire, whatever what you like..

I saw many negative comment because mostly players dosent wanna undarstanding the gamemechanics...and leave the game after 3-4 hour game time...dont..this is awesome game...I got 1 favorite game before: thats eve online, now i got one more..:)

I love that there's no true safety. I love the reward for the hardwork. I don't mind having to repeat 15 minutes of labor because I was murdered. BECAUSE I WAS FUCKING MURDERED. I was cutting wood in a populated area, went to make some tea, came back; DEAD. Boom, wake up call. This isn't a game you can walk away from. This isn't a game you can mindlessly farm. There are penalties for inattention and they're player enforced. Your first death will enrage you because you'll think you've come so far. But it's literally 15 minutes tops to replace everything you lost. And then what do you do? You throw it in the bank and fearlessly venture forth until you run into something bigger and badder than you.  If you're foolish enough to roll around with a full inventory with 2 hours worth of farming mats... 

And the community is wonderful once you finally get away from the help chat which is laden with angry children hellbent on refusing to figure any portion of this game out for themselves(even when a volunteer spends hours answering questions). 

I was so stoked when I was pickpocketed for the first time, it was hilarious chasing the guy down as the gaurds filled him with arrows and I promptly took my 2silver back. 

I can't wait to find a guild.

This is what MMORPG's should have been all along. 

Mortal Online inspires a true sense of adventure in a thrilling and engaging world. (WITHOUT A STORY/DIALOGUE(Outside of the tutorial of course))

You make your own story, you carve your own path, you create your own sanctuary.
This is a gem of a game and I cannot wait to see what else Star Vault has in store for us.

Leggete bene e stampatevelo in testa: Questo è HARDCORE
Non ci sono livelli ma una lunghissima serie di statistiche e abilità che vanno sviluppate attraverso l'uso delle suddette compiendo le relative azioni. Esempio: Tagliare legna per aumentare la forza. Picchiare per aumentare l'uso delle armi, eccetera.

La morte è HARDCORE, se crepi rinasci alla shrine piu vicina nudo come un verme e tutto quello che avevi ora è in un fagotto nel punto in cui sei morto e chiunque lo trovi se lo porterà via. Non vuoi perdere mesi di lavoro? Portati solo l'essenziale e non crepare. 

Chi scrive che il gioco è P2W non ha capito cosa significhi. L'unica differenza tra un account Free e uno abbonato è il cap delle skill. Ovvero mentre il punteggio massimo di ogni abilità è normalmente 100 gli account gratuiti sono limitati a sfruttare solo un massimo di 60 punti per skill, questo significa che anche giocando gratuitamente le vostre abilità saliranno fino a 100 ma finché non pagherete sarà come se fossero a 60. Dal momento che l'uso gratuito è inteso come PROVA del gioco questo metodo è perfetto e non concede critiche. In questo gioco NON è presente alcuna forma di shop e non esistono quindi privilegi speciali per chi sborsa piu soldi.

Per quanto riguarda i bug questo gioco è nato come progetto amatoriale indipendente finanziato prima di tutto dai suoi creatori e poi dai guadagni degli abbonamenti mensili dei giocatori, inoltre viene portato avanti da un pugno di persone che si impegnano da anni a migliorarlo e a creare ciò che i grandi publisher non hanno il coraggio di fare: Un gioco LIBERO dove puoi fare quel cavolo che ti pare e dove paghi realisticamente le conseguenze delle tue azioni. Perciò qualche bug ogni tanto e un minimo di lagg si puo perdonare.

In Mortal Online ogni cosa che avrai dovrai guadagnartela col sudore. Pertanto è da sempre un ambiente estremamente selettivo, da astenersi casual gamers e chiunque cerchi un gioco dove puo rapidamente diventare forte e sentirsi un super eroe. Qui morirete tanto, vi incazzerete un macello e sputerete sangue. Ma se siete giocatori seri e saprete imparare dai vostri errori riceverete soddisfazioni che nessun altro gioco sa dare. 

Vitale anche il sociale, da soli siete carne da macello, con una gilda potete combattere guerre e assedi EPICI. Potete essere grandi guerrieri come commercianti, artigiani o allevatori e potete stare certi che verrete riconosciuti a vista dagli altri giocatori.

Insomma, fatevi avanti se ne avete il coraggio e astenetevi dal dare giudizi penosi se non siete all'altezza della sfida.

It's free so fuck it. I was unfortunate enought to try on a day that the 1 server they have was shit. Then my friend unfortunately ran into every bug you can experience in the first 5 minutes of the game. Hopefully it was just for us.

*Queue Time Kinda Fixed, Skip This Part & Read The 2nd Attempt*

Installed and registered.

Game started running and I'll admit, it was beautiful from the second it launched.

Logging in required me to wait a full 15 minutes, which I assumed was a queue of players. A little annoying but when I enter a game, I'm on for a solid streak. 15 minutes is nothing compared to the grinding session I'm about to begin.

I begin creating my character. While the customization isn't very extensive, it still offers a few unique mechanics that you won't find anywhere else.

While struggling to find a worthy name for my champion, the game suddenly sends me back to the Log In screen, informing me that I've lost connection. I check my internet and find nothing wrong. I had a stream running at the same time which was not interrupting, reassuring me that the error was not on my end.

I log back in.

15 minute Queue.

I'm a bit frusturated at this point.

This time I fly through the character creation. I no longer care about the toon because I just want to play the game after this unproductive 45 minute session.

I enter the the tutorial.

The game is running great. My movement feels smooth. A little different but smooth. I run through the first couple tasks and I'm about to make my first set of armor when I see a notification in chat that the server will be resetting. This is instantly followed by the complaints of other players.

Server goes down. I lose connection. 

15 minute queue.

I have now spent 45 minutes of my 1st hour ingame WAITING to play a tutorial.

Game looks great. But somehow as someone who loves to grind hours away with stupid ingame tasks, I've lost patience.



*UPDATE* 

Watched my friend play. He logged in after a 13 minute queue and experienced no server issues. He then experienced a few glitches I did not. 

The tutorial mission stalled on him. When you're supposed to butcher the animal parts for its leather/hide, you drag the parts over to the butcher skill. He did this and received nothing but ""Work Bench is not available"" or something along those lines. Don't quote me on that.

I knew this wasn't supposed to happen because I personally had passed this part of the tutorial before being disconnected. 

Before he could log out and endure another queue just to complete the first step of the tutorial, he found that he was rooted to the ground. Unable to move, jump, or rest. We sat there laughing about it until he lost his ""fledgling"" status. At this point another player approached him and started attacking him.

I watched as he calmly exited and uninstalled the game.


MORAL OF THE STORY? 

Gave the game a second try, and the queue time was a bit shorter... But then the game glitched out.

4/10 still can't play through the tutorial without having to relog whether it be because of glitches or server restarts.",1441742886,1441836914,False,9,2,0.524399638175964355,4,False,False,False,False,,,

Crafting is really ????. Collected wood and stone and can't do anything with it in any of the working places. They all just disappear cause you can't use it there.

Du glaubst ein Spiel ist dann toll wenn es dir das Gefühl gibt, du bist mächtig und stark und die Welt liegt dir zu Füßen.
Dann suchst du dir besser ein anderes, ein einfaches Spiel.

Ein sehr schönen Spiel, kaum startet man, stirbt man auch schon auf die ein oder andere Weise. Aber sobald man einmal vertraut ist mit dem System. Dann gibt es kein Spiel wo man so viel Freiheit, Risiko und Spaß hat. Das auch nicht nur wenn man raus in die Welt zieht. Man kann jederzeit alles verlieren was man am Leibe trägt, oder ausgeraubt werden wenn man mal kurz nicht aufpasst. 

Man kann alles und jeden Angreifen. Jedoch wird man, wenn man Unschuldige (das gilt auch für Haustiere von anderen Spielern) angreift zum Verbrecher (nach 5 Morden auch zum Mörder). Und als solcher ist man innerhalb der Stadt innerhalb sekunden Tot! (Sofern man nicht extrem gute Ausrüstung und entsprechende Kampfskills hat) Außerhalb der Städte trachten NPC oder andere Spieler nach deinen Leben und Ausrüstung.

Beginnt man erstmal zu begreifen wie komplex das Crafting System ist. Und wie gefährlich es ist in der Wildnis Ressourcen zu sammeln. Dann ist klar, man sollte sich Freunde machen. Alleine spielen macht zwar auch sehr viel Spaß, jedoch wird man als Solo Spieler noch häufiger sterben als andere. Doch auch eine Gruppe schützt dich nicht, REDs (Spieler die andere Spieler töten und meist darin erfolg haben) machen auch vor größeren Gruppen nicht halt, wenn sie sich im Vorteil sehen.",1441726582,1441726582,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game is hard, really hard.
Its unforgiving and brutal, the crafting is complex and in depth, with multiple ways to gather some of the necesary resources.

Combatively it is skill and equipment based, someone with better armour and weapons has a large advantage but is not necesarily unbeatable.

Though there is one place where the game falls down, but at the same time this is the games greatest strength.
The world. There is no quest system, the game will not tell you where to go or what to do.
It is up to the players to create the content, to start the wars and build great cities to set quests for newer players to help  kingdoms grow.
The world is populated with NPC animals and monsters, and in the town's and cities there are guards and merchants, but they sell only the most basic equipment and provide only so much protection.
Should you need a sword, you must find a player to make you one.
A helmet? find a friendly armour smith.

This game does not hold your hand, and it expects a certain amount of intelect from its players, you cannot come into this game and expect to be taken on a tour of the world and to see all the coolest parts just because you followed a line of exclimation marks on your minimap that has an arrow pointing to the next destination.

In this game you decide who you are.
Are you a brave adventurer? traveling between towns and seeking out the most fearsome beasts and the darkest caverns.
Are you a reclusive smith? only emerging from your work to gather more crafting supplies.
Are you a great mage? honing your mind into the weapon it is.
Perhaps you bandit? demanding payment for the lives of those you meet and taking both should they resist.

Or are you simply a poor pleb? stalking a graveyard full of the mindless dead who you almost seem to disopear amongst.

Primeiro, aqui você precisa aprender a não se apegar aos bens materiais pois você provavelmente perderá com freqüência.

O mais importante são as habilidades que você adquiri treinando ou lendo livros. Lembra daquela frase que vivem dizendo: ""Estude pois conhecimento ninguém tira de você"". Pois é....aqui o que conta é isso.

O jogo dá total liberdade para você e qualquer outra pessoa, o que garante sérios riscos em sua aventura e isso apesar de um fardo, pode ser uma boa recompensa.

Quando você cometer um crime, seu nome (e escudo perto do nome) fica cinza e todo mundo pode te matar a vontade para pegar suas coisas. Por isso tome cuidado ao tentar matar algum monstro pois alguns engraçadinhos entram na frente de sua arma para você atingi-los e tornar-se fora-da-lei por 2 minutos....dois longos minutos.

No jogo você precisa comer para sobreviver. Se não comer perde peso. E se perder muito peso perde força...comendo muito fica obeso e perde a velocidade para correr, andar etc...Uma mecânica no mínimo incomum. 

Infelizmente para muitas pessoas da nova geração o jogo não agrada (e é por isso que você tantas análises negativas...realmente é um jogo para poucos...normalmente o pessoal que joga tem idade superior à 18 anos).

O jogo não tem mapa...apenas uma bússola e NPCs que dão breves informações sobre locais. A Exploração solitária pode ser bem perigosa!

Sistema de montarias e pets: Você pode adestrar ou dominar (se for mago) qualquer criatura no jogo se tiver habilidade alta o suficiente.

There are many valid points being made below for and against this game, and a few of them are actually true.  The main problem with this title is that it is so difficult to log into the game. Whether you are a p2p or f2p player, you will not be able to play whenever you want, Period. Every session is a gamble. One day you can log on and the next day you can't.

All of this boils down to an amateur dev team and amateur leadership directing them. I just can't believe some people are actually paying subscriptions to this. I would never pay for a game that only lets me log in 3-4 times a week. 

I didn't even go into bugs and issues with the game itself yet, of which there are PLENTY. Mortal Online is literally, the first clear example of a game concept so good that it didn't matter if the execution missed every single develpment target.

Skyrim Online.  You can be a warrior, a thief, a mage, a do-gooder, or a murderous prick.  You can also be a crafter and make armor, weapons, potions, food, and tame animals and rideable mounts.  You can build houses, castles, entire towns and cities.  The game is first person only.  The combat is a hit based detection system, the melee has directional attacks and blocks that must be correctly timed.  

Now remove the NPC quests.  Also toss in some resurrection priests for when you die.  Now make the game online only, with one server for the entire community to play on.
   
That's pretty much it.  What to do?  Kill eachother!  Imagine running around in Skyrim trying to kill mobs for loot, then having another dude sneak up on you and murder you.  Just like in Skyrim, you would lose everything you had on you.  You're in a town, and a thief steals your money--same as in Skyrim, but now its another player doing it to you.  The entire drama and story of this game is player created, which means it doesn't end, and everything you do can have real consequences in the form of alliances, wars, etc.

It's made by a small developer, and therefore can be quite buggy at times (they still haven't fixed many spots where you can become stuck to the point only a GM can help you, and if you get killed in the meantime, tough luck), and slow to update.

So, although in some ways it's just a polished 8 year-old beta, in other ways its the best that a persistent full loot fantasy MMO offers.

Given it's contrasting excellence and face-palming problems, I rate it a:

7.5/10


THE LONGER REVIEW OF THE GAME:

Ok, so here's a much more detailed review.  I've played this game subscribed on and off for close to 2 years (since fall 2013).  I have multiple accounts, am in one of the larger guilds in the game, but busy life/work schedule keep me from playing much these days.  With that said, here's a non-rage, experienced review by someone who has tried just about every profession, and tried much of what can be done in this game.

This first person MMO is the closest thing to ultima online out there, and for being committed to that level of freedom, full loot, sandbox experience, in itself separates this game from everything else out there.  

Those same things that make this game great also make it difficult to learn, and often frustrating.  The learning curve is steep, and level of time required to become proficient and competitive (in the PvP sense) is high.  I honestly would say it takes a couple months just to really figure the game out.  But I appreciate a challenge, and the combat system is more skill based than most other MMO I've played, which I find far more exciting and rewarding when you win (especially when you nab a kill on someone with good gear or transporting gold--no farming needed today!).  There are very detailed crafting systems, in which discovery and experimentation is incredibly important.  For example, there are NO pre-set recipes for alchemy or food, you just start extracting and refining ingredients from foods (or crazy materials you would never imagine putting into a potion or food) and start mixing and mashing things together and see what happens.   The best weapons, armors, potions, etc, are all tested and figured out by the player community.  There are some things which people have kept secret and even I don't know how something is made / done after playing for years.  The creativity from the game community is impressive.  The politics in this game are also incredible (and sometimes hilarious) to witness, as there is no active PvE story or questline.  Instead, the conflict and story of this game is constantly created due to nothing other than the butting heads of the egos and personalities of the players--sometimes leading to an entire server war lasting weeks or months long.

My only advice -- group up, get in a guild, or play with a group of friends.  In my experience, this game is not for those who like to go solo.  You will become bored, usually get chased down by roaming bands of veterans looking for easy kills if wandering on your own, or just be outnumbered in most cases.  Even though it's a harsh game, being friendly and meeting others is how this game is best played.  I warn you though, with a full loot sandbox like this, there is a strong troll presence.

I would only recommend this game to those who are patient, mature (can handle murderous griefers trying to ruin your day) and want a challenge - this game will not hold your hand, and neither will I. If you enjoy a complex, full loot persistent world that can be incredibly rewarding.  Whether you want to rush into battles involving dozens (or even hundreds) of actual players trying to bash each others skulls, or discover new alchemy potions that no one else in the world knows, or set up as a merchant and crafter trying to obtain wealth, you get the complete freedom to choose how you want to play the game.  The game mostly revolves around fighting, which is fine by me, but those looking for a deep PvE experience should head elsewhere.  

Also, I would recommend subscribing to the game.  I think the only viable free to play characters would be foot warriors or foot mages, you will be gimped on mounts, and crafting is crap on free to play accounts due to the skill cap.

As for bugs, over my time in this game they seem to be improving, but you can still have the the occasional glitch that drops you through the world, only to kill your mount and lose your gear, or your mount will suddenly stop following you and run off into the game world.  Or you will be riding along and get stuck on a cactus and someone sees you and kills you, and you can't do anything but watch.  At least they have a very active admin system that can respawn you and your gear and mount for most instances where the game screw you.  Post-steam launch the admins almost always respond to me within 5 minutes or less, which is far better than other MMOs I've played.  Remember, this is an independently developed game comprising a small team.

So I think this game deserves high praise for everything it has done right, especially given the small team and the limited resources.  They also deserve praise for not selling out and becoming another boring, safe MMO for the sake of trying to bring in more revenue.  I would recommend Mortal Online to anyone who enjoyes a challenging and persistant world MMO.   But, if you just want to jump into some action, and the full loot system just causes you more stress than enjoyment, I would move on to something that provides more immediate action and entertainment.",1441661317,1545606447,True,5,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The game mechanics are great, just crippled by everything else. The F2P is nerfed pretty badly and the community is largely against new players. Veterans will literally go to new zones and kill new players out of sheer boredom I would assume. Combine that with the full loot system means they will kill you, destroy what you've spent hours obtaining for no reason at all until they run out of newbs and finally move on. Just so another one can come in. And all that is yours to experience IF you can get logged on in the first place.

The first problem is this game is not a real free2play but more like a mmo with subscription with a trial edition which end when you reach the 60 level skillcap (just like WoW with the max level 20 but easier in MO).
Second thing, the level design of the world is very cheap, buildings are like big cube even at max graphical settings.
Third thing, informations are hard to reach, for example, the servers were unaccessible yesterday night and there was nowhere to check their status.
Here come the worst part of the game, the griefers. Before I explain what happened, I have to say how the criminal system works, if someone attacks another player, he will be targeted as a criminal, if a guard is near the area, the guard will kill the criminal. Other players will be able to attack the criminal without being flaged as criminal. Of course some people will abuse of this system.
While I was killing some skeletons at the 'safest' capital to buy the last part of my armor set from the auction house (which were sold by players), a random player put himself between me and the skeleton (which was dealing a lot of damages). So to not be targeted as a criminal, I had to aim to nothing which was successful. Funny thing is, npc are not attacking with skillshot like players but simply deal damage when in range to its target. So while this griefer was standing between me and the skeleton, the skeleton was continuing to attack me. Of course as expected, I tried to kill fast enough the skeleton to don't have to deal with the griefer, but I touched the other player when he was beside the skeleton and the attack touched the player when I wasn't even seeing him. To be short, I was then killed by the player. Ironny here you come, when I checked the auction house after, my items which I bought from the same auction house were in store.

The main counter-argument is ""yeah but it's a hardcore pvp mmo, blabla"", problem is, the mechanics of the game encourage griefing, and bad manners. Just look at this post on the official forums which is tolerated: http://www.mortalonline.com/forums/threads/rpk-vs-noobs.123362/

I AM ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT!!!
This game is amazing in so many ways... It's basically SAO / Morrowind / Rust. It's the game I've always wanted.

Everyone who is being deterred by the negative reviews, please take some things into consideration before making your decision at face value.

1 - have a look at the hours played by most of the negative reviewers. This is a hardcore sandbox game, can you really have any right to post a negative review after only playing a few hours? They've probably seen 0.001% of the game...

2 - To the negative reviewers who have played it a bit more, please notice that they are complaining primarily about the freedom allowed to the ""toxic"" players. Let's think about that for a moment. They decided to play a open world sandbox mmo... and they want less freedom... Logic?

3 - You control your experience in this game, in true sandbox fashion.

Now, let's talk about number 3 for a moment. 

My MO experience has been a rollercoaster of emotions. From developing PTSD brought about by the presence of possibly murderous surrounding players, to being given a full kit of armour by a kindly knight, this game is always smacking me in the face with surprises. 

I once partied with a fellow in the crypts underneath the Tindrum graveyard, and spent the entire time wondering if he was going to turn around and stab me in the back. Lo and behold, he actually saved me numerous times, and protected my loot when I had a clumsy death. I felt like I made a real connection with this dude. In a sea of murderers and vagabonds, I found a buddy to help weather the storm. This wasn't some random idiot who I had been forced to party with for some dumb dungeon quest for some dumb storyline that I don't give a crap about, this was a mateship bonded in a need to survive, and forged with our skills as players. There are plenty of other great experiences I've had, and the good ones far outweigh the bad.


TLDR:
YOU CONTROL YOUR EXPERIENCE. This game is your opportunity to play the way you've always wanted. The best part is, the game doesn't just give it to you... You must earn your right to thrive, and damn, it's satisfying when you do.",1441602971,1441602971,True,45,2,0.510621607303619385,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Могу ли я её рекомендовать всем? Конечно нет. Игра рассчитана прежде всего на старых поклонников Ultima Online, Darkfall и схожими по концепции хардкорных ММОРПГ, где присутствует полный лут (когда при смерти с игрока падает вся экипировка и вещи из рюкзака), где есть свободное ПвП, где есть большая социальная составляющая, которая подталкивает как отдельные формирования игроков, так и одиночек к взаимодействию друг с другом.

Уникальные отличия от остальных ММО еще заключаются и в том, что это пожалуй одна из немногих игр, где нет инстансов и зеркал, а мир игры располагается на одном шарде, без разделений на сервера. То есть все игроки находятся в едином мире и могут свободно взаимодействовать друг с другом без каких либо технических ограничений.

Сеттинг Mortal Online выдержан в мрачных тонах средневекового фентези, поэтому здесь вы не увидите радужных единорогов и красочных фей. Мир игры расположился на двух больших континентах - Nave, где преобладает умеренный климат и Sarduuca, которая представляет собой огромную и беспощадную пустыню. Путешествовать по миру вам предстоит как на своих двоих, так и с помощью приручаемых животных, которых сейчас большое разнообразие. Телепортов и мгновенного перемещения в игре нет. Так же как и нет карты, поэтому вам придётся ориентироваться в этом суровом мире исключительно с помощью компаса и ориентиров. Это добавляет в игру еще больше приключений и интересных воспоминаний о путешествиях по миру игры.

Запомните одно, в мире Mortal Online нет безопасных зон. Даже в городе, который патрулируют стражи, вас могут либо убить, либо просто обокрасть.
Боевая система в игре представляет собой честный нон-таргет с системой хит боксов. Закликать врага здесь не выйдет лишь потому, что в бою вам нужно постоянно поддерживать определенную дистанцию, зависящего от оружия, выбирать моменты для атаки и зоны поражения противника. Если вы будете слишком близко к цели, то вы можете ударить не лезвием меча, а рукоятью к примеру. Стрельба из лука так же требует определённых навыков и спамить одну кнопку, как в других ММОРПГ, здесь не выйдет.

Помимо ПвП, в игре есть множество других занятий, таких как интересный и проработанный крафт, строительство, приручение и разведение животных, торговля и множество различных профессий, таких как мясник, рудокоп, повар, алхимик, архитектор, вор... Кстати о воровстве, Mortal Online пожалуй единственная на сегодняшний день ММОРПГ, где реализована полноценная система воровства. Вы можете не просто вскрывать сундуки, которые разбросаны в различных местах по миру, но и в буквальном смысле воровать вещи у других игроков, прямо из рюкзаков.

Система развития персонажа напоминает аналогичную систему из Ultima Online, где навыки прокачиваются по мере их использования. В игре есть скилл кап, по достижению которого, вы больше не сможете ни чего изучить, поэтому следует продумать свой билд наперёд. Но даже если вы захотели что то изменить в билде, то достаточно отнять необходимое значение очков и распределить их повторно на своё усмотрение. Характеристики персонажа и скиллы можно запросто заминусить и перераспределить в любой момент.
На бесплатном аккаунте, скиллы ограничены в 60 очков, вместо 100 у платных и так же нет возможности выучить определенные навыки, такие как воровство. Помимо прочего у бесплатных аккаунтов есть ограничения на торговлю.

Подведём итог.
Плюсы:
1. Старый, добрый хардкор по которому думаю многие успели соскучиться.
2. Песочница, где разработчики стараются по минимуму вмешиваться в происходящее.
3. Интересный крафт.
4. Реалистичная система боя.
5. Строительство.
6. Множество различных занятий.
7. Неплохая графика.
8. Хорошие возможности для ролеплееров.
9. Нет инстансов, зеркал и других шардов.
10. Отличное погружение в игру, благодаря виду от первого лица.
11. Интересная система магии.

А теперь пожалуй о минусах:
1. Игра просто изобилует багами.
2. Высокий порог вхождения.
3. Слабая техническая поддержка игры.
4. Слабый левел и гейм дизайн.

Но даже не смотря на эти минусы, Mortal Online занял уже давно свою нишу и пережил не одну современную  MMO.

Game does look a bit... Choppy from time to time, Lag exists and you will face some issues logging in and such...

As for gameplay, It's fun, Once you know what you're doing and have an idea of what you are doing, you will be fine! Granted Grinding resources isn't for everyone, I admit that but it is an... Interesting game to play, I'd like to learn more about this world, it's history, it's culture and so on!

In closing, Yes, this game is not that good, BUT it needs love, not just from normal people but also from the developers, If this game made them a decent amount of cash, and they invest it in this game, then we'd get a great game in future.

An example of this is my first Life (first death) so to speak. 

Keep in mind that when you die you lose everything so you MUST put your items into the bank.

So after some research into builds i decided to play as a mage as i thought it would be fun casting spells in first person.
So i comnplete the tutorial and purchase my books and go to the graveyard to make some money and get some experience playing as a mage.

So i am healing all of these different people fighting the undead and i also cast a few spells to hit the walkers, but then a player decides to run infront of my spell on purpose and due to that everyone is able to kill me without consequence and loot all my stuff (which is called blue blocking) which happens quite a lot in the graveyard.

I should also mention that mages need reagents to cast their spells and you get a few of them from the starter pack you get from the captain. So after i died i had no money, no reagents and all i could do was scavenge from the undead corpses. 

One thing that made the best experience of the game so far was that i joined a group of people traveling to a city (one of them was streaming the journey) and then i got mauled by a dog and then the dog mauled everyone else.

So yes it can be a lot of fun but it can be one of the most frustrating and annoying games that you might ever play, but with a game like this its all a part of the experience and it is free after all so i would reccomend getting a few of your friends to download it with you and start playing as a group. :D Because it can be one of the best games you will play and will be a memorable experience


Pros:

+Freeform sandbox gameplay - The game is what you make of it

+Wide variety of skills to train (Up to 60 for free to play players)

+Player driven Economy

+Ability to craft a unique weapon out of so many different materials

+Requires dedication to learning how to play the game

Cons:

-May be confusing for new players at first

First person only can be a little bit of an issue for some people especially when it comes to trying to hit with the proper part of your weapon - if you have a hard time with this use swords and you will be fine, axes and spears can be more difficult to strike with their heads. If anyone's ever played Mount & Blade in first person before, you can expect about the same experience here.

However the Steam launch has been a little bit much for their server and during peak hours there have been several crashes and periods of downtime.

First one has 10.0 hours in game time and is still able to talk only about starting city graveyard or has 0,4 hours in game time and complains that the game is bad becouse there is apparently no way to press esc and check your keybindings. While the second one either spent max 2 hours at the graveyard or actually never saw it, as they left the starting city and are experiencing the real game right now.

Sadly its that first group of players who have filled the steam review page, with some salty ex-players. 

The world of Mortal Online is harsh and brutal, theres no denying that as you will die, and I mean alot. But why would anyone try to deny it? Its the beauty of the game. Alot of people exaggerate things in their reviews. Like ""The whole community is toxic, they all hate you and kill people at the tutorial areas all the time"", while reality is pretty much the opposite. Theres one, yes I mean ONE, guild in the entire community that openly kills only new players around the starting cities. Rest of this ""toxic"" community has teamed up together to protect the areas. Some people cant handle the crashing which is happening few times a day right now, and while I can see how it irritates, I dont see how it does any real damage. You dont need to sub to play the game, and with each crash they get more information about the cause which then makes it easier to fix it and further increase the amount of players they can let in, making the queue even shorter. 

I have played the game on and off since beta. I have lived through the most horrible bugs and the game breaking issues. Yet I have stayed. Why? There is simply no other game that make me feel like Mortal Online does. To expect the unexpected. Is that person in the horizon trying to kill you or not? Or are you planning to kill him but is he alone? Is the keep owner in this area friendly or not? Can you survive this transport or not? Will you survive this dungeon? You fell into a hole and find yourself in almost pitch black dungeon, how can you make it out alive? No matter what you do in this game, gather, pve, explore... theres always danger around. To tell you about the politics would require a whole article alone. Wth new blood its just going to get more interesting, as new blood is what the politics have needed for a while now.

Make a favor for youself and join a guild as soon as you get past the starting tutorial gates. Theres plenty of guilds advertising on the official forums, in game chat and in game boards, so you can surely find one to fit in. If you have a group of players who instead want to create a guild, then make a post to the forums that you are looking for temporary mentor/teacher. Theres also alot of people willing to guide new players in the official IRC channel and the (un)official teamspeak server.

In MO you learn by trial and error, and this is something many people do not seem to accept, they want everything handed to them.

It says I played this game for 40 minutes, but it was actually closer to 10. Why? Because I spent the first 5 minutes making my character, and the next 20 or so minutes rebooting the client until I was able to -log in- to my character. Forum posts seemed to indicate that this has been going on for about 5 years, and the most recent thread I found also warned me of two things: there is no free-to-play model for this game, just an unlimited ""free trial"", and the game has suffered for years from an awful starting experience chasing new players away (""I don't know why they didn't fix that before launching to Steam"", one player wrote. Uh oh.)

When I finally got in, I was presented with instructions to run 120m and talk to an NPC (standard stuff). My character's ""sprint"" speed, however, was scarcely faster than his ""walk"" speed, and I'd have to stop every 20 paces to let his stamina recover. I am given to understand that run speed and stamina both increase with use, like in an Elder Scrolls game. That's fine, but it started out a little extreme. Strike two against MO.

The NPC told me to kill pigs for leather, and the game taught me to equip and brandish my sword. Cool beans.

After [strike]slogging[/strike] running over to the pigs, I did a big ol' Elder Scrolls-style wind-up, swung... and missed, even though the pig was standing motionless in the center of my screen, with the reticle right on its back.

I decided to settle for chopping away, and after it took 6 hits (10 swings) to kill a pig, I was done. Strike three.

Here's the thing: I'm sure this game is -great-, if you can get past the oppressive introduction. However, if the game is going to -require- a monthly subscription for the full experience (and not even present a way for other players to sell me my subscription for in-game currency), I should not need to ""bear with"" the game to start enjoying the experience. In 40 short minutes, only a few of which were even proper game time, this title has managed to chase me away for good.",1441497126,1441497173,False,6,1,0.497835516929626465,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Yes it is hardcore and many people don't like that, they are more into farmville and such but if you are ready for a challenge with actual reprocutions if you fail and fame, fortune, and power if you suceed.

I would describe this game as elderscrolls but more emersive and without quests, maybe a little rust and minecraft mixed in there as well. This game to me is the epitimy of emmersion as you cannot get out of first person view, there are no quests or hand holding. This goes down even to the dungeons which are awseome by the way, but no npc tells you where they are or what to do with what you find in them. For example there is a hidden cave up in the mountains if you fight your way down to the bottom of it there is a nice chest and loot but the boss also dropps a key to another dungeon and there are jewles that drop randomly that an npc across the map will trade for a book of unique armor that you can craft after you trade him.... that's right you unlock new crafting and armors and such for your guild by exploring to find hidden dungeons.

The pvp is amazing! there was a 200 man vs 200 man battle on the last server war and the game is set up so it can be way more especially with it's release on steam! The melee is very skill based as it is instant react directional parrying combined with stam managment and character combinations make everyone able to fight their way. Magic is planning to expand to 17 circles of different unique spells but right now it is still epic as if you miss a heal you may heal the enemy and if you miss lightning or fire you may hit a friend. Arrows are simular as it lands in friend or foe or dirt all depending on your accuracy! This isn't even including mounted which is a whole new itricate fighting system. Above all though there is that these battles matter, if you die you lose all your gear not banked and if your fighting to defend the castel you built and you die.... not good. But in the same note if some jerks start stuff (there is actual politics in this game) you can go and blow up everything they built and take all they own.

Now to how customizable your character is. you have 1100 points to spend and so you can end up having 12 different skills not inclusing secondary skills and there is no limit to how you customize them. Thief mage, full fighter with multiple weapons including a bow, mage beastmaster, the sky is the limit. This can be further customized by the amazing crafting system, wana be a quick fighter, have someone craft you a really light weapon out of a light metal and wood want to be a heavy fighter make heavy armor out of some secret metal with wolf fur for the backing. You can combine anything in any way you want, may not work but you can do it. In fact one of the most common bows is spider leg and rare wood combined to a sweet bow. you can have a maul on the tip of a lance if you so please!

To expand on what I was saying before your fighting actually matters. There is politics in this game, everyone uses teamspeak and you can go hop in the teamspeak of the guild next to you and talk over if your going to share the wolf spawn or fight over it! Sometimes the game makers hop in teamspeak and hang out and see how we think the game should be improved. People become well known, for good or bad. For instance there is a thief, greyfox known by all for how skilled he is at thieving, there is a politician lexorn known for his silky words and for starting a war with them, there is a crafter galgotha known for being the best and most knowledgable for all his crafting, and there are many fighters known for their unique skills, the list goes on. So not only are you fighting for whatever you have built or are wearing and worked hard to make you are fighting for legit honor that everyone acknoledges in game.

This game is so deep and there is so much to explore I could never explain it all so I will just cut myself off there but I will finish to say the community of the game is very connected. You cannot fight or hang out every day and be able to hop in the other guilds teamspeak and say good fight or whatever and not get connected. I hope you try it out and if you need help join a guild they will help you and teach you and usually gear you up as well, good luck on your travels!",1441480622,1441480622,True,6,0,0.497942358255386353,0,False,False,False,False,,,

WHY I WOULD RECOMMEND MORTAL ONLINE AND TO WHOM?

Simply, because it is the only MMO on the market that effectively delivers next features without making compromises: true sandbox, realtime FPV The Elder Scrolls style combat, non-instanced open-world, full-loot, complex crafting system, taming and pet owning, true player driven economy and finally a true free to place guild asset building like castles, own army of NPCs, walls etc. On the other side, Mortal Online has many downsides, it lacks a lot of polishing and more bugfixing, which I cower later in text. I would recommend this game exclusively to players who seek before mentioned features and are ready to master its mechanics with minimum of handholding. Its gameplay shall make much greater challenge than in any other MMO and accepting great chance of being killed by other players or mobs and losing some of the belongings in the process, but with much greater reward at the end when one masters the play. I note that to be competitive one must be ready to buy a subscription. 

WHY KEEP ON PLAYING MORTAL ONLINE?

Despite all the flaws and issues, all the sandbox features creates vast choice for overall fun gameplay. One can choose to participate in PvP where combat system is truly skillbased and fun most of the time. During group fights, teamwork and personal skill plays a keyrole, outweighting gear quality, unllike in other MMOs. On the other side, personally I enjoy being a crafter, since crafting system gives great variety of item types to be crafted and competing with other crafters in selling weapons to players is fun personal challenge. I could not find any other MMO that offers so many crafting and trading possibilities. Other activities like refining materials, alchemy, taming and trading the vast choice of items is fun to do since player can devise different strategies to get rich out of it. Finally, to explore huge open non-instanced seamless game open world brings its own kind of excitement and immersive experience unlike any MMO that I played, since there are no loading screens or artificial limitations. Game features various environment types like forests, planes, mountains, deserts, jungles etc. Across the world goodies are distributed in form of locked chests and free to loot urns/crates. 

GENERAL PLAYING EXPERIENCE

Player can choose to start playing through Tutorial which will make introduction to basic game mechanics like basic combat, taming creatures and crafting armor. When finished, player can choose a starting item kit for desired class archetype. Character does not have classes, instead player just levels skills where the total limitation is 1100 for primary skills which can be redistributed any time freely. For mid-game, Mortal Online has no quests, but the main goal is to advance your personal and character skills, make your own material wealth (gain best items, build a house etc.) and participate in community (in guild or solo).

Pickpocketing other players is possible, but there is a way to counter it easily. Game forces first person view, which creates strong sense of immersion. Player can try to attack anyone anywhere, but most of the NPC towns have NPC guards that can kill any criminal really fast, but a strong group of players can kill these guards. To regulate criminal activity, there is a flagging system. Outside of towns any player can attack any other player, especially if there are no guards to help. When a player dies, all the stuff that one currently carries is dropped on a ground, being lootable by anyone, friends, foes or by returning to own corps. Still, all the valuable stuff can be banked for free in NPC or Guild towns for 100% safe keeping.

Player can engage in PvP and PvE. Combat system is realtime where player has to aim a swing or an arrow to hit other player with realtime blocking also. This system is a true aim based realtime system without autotargeting, same as in The Elderscroolls serial. Practically, players personal skill really matters and often happens that unleveled skilled player can defeat fully leveled players that lacks PvP skills. Still, combat system is not without flaws where network lag can lead to undesired unfair outcomes, but overall the system works well. As for PvE, there are dozens of dungeons to explore which all are uninstanced. World AI still could get some improvement, so PvE is one of the worst aspects of Mortal Online. On the ground level, many challenging mobs exist, but dungeons are more rewarding and challenging.

Crafting and trading is one of Mortal's strongest points, where players can craft almost all the items in Mortal's world, all except skillbooks and mount equipment. On the other side, 90% of available viable weapons and armor are player made. Variety of possible versions of item type to craft is vast, but in practice a few are viable, a few but enough for a rich market. Besides direct player to player trade, all the items and resources can be sold through the trade broker NPC which serves as a stock market, only locally with buyout and buyorder sections. To get required resources for crafting players can mine and refine materials to get metals or other minerals. To get animal materials, there is a butchery skill (one of most boring trade in Mortal), to get potions there is alchemy and to get food there is cooking skill. To get pets and mounts, there is taming skill, but animals can also be bred at NPCs to get better offspring of already tamed animals.

Finally, building territory structure is one of most impressive features of Mortal. A single player can build their own various type of houses in predefined spots. But guilds can build other structures wherever they like. They can build many types of structures, like keeps, barracks, banks, market stands, mines, taverns, libraries... and walls to protect themselves. Overall, guilds can create their own fully functional town wherever the like in the world.


DOWNSIDES

Mortal Online features serious issue experienced from the start of playing. UI is overall a bit clunky and design is lagging behind modern MMO titles. Handling core game mechanics like extracting and crafting can be clunky and quite time consuming to work with, with some minor irritating bugs like items are not placed into slots, or item stacks won't split as expected. Game overall lacks ingame guidance, so the learning curve for new players is just too steep. Due to thievery feature and free to hit combat, starting experience can be just too harsh for new players, leading to many griefing attempts. Further, trade broker user interface features huge technical lag which adds to frustration (screen freezes when loading item entries). Pet and mob AI is not good enough to avoid really strange behaviour during PvE (mobs hit and shoot through walls. Even when traversing the world with pets carrying mined materials following, they could just disappear with valuables due to a bug. Crossing server areas on the world (nodelines), can lead to unfair situation during combats due to a lag or just a bug. Considering crafitng, overall mechanics are not designed to be fluent and lead to many time consuming actions e.g. to butcher a full stack of carcass it takes 45 seconds of just standing at the butcher table. Similar is for extracting rocks, refining etc. Weapon and Armor Crafting UI is also impractical. List of these small but frustrating issues goes on. At last, there is no mid-game and even end-game content that can drive a player to keep playing. There are no ingame challenges to beat, besides personal challenge of getting overall better ingame.

CONCLUSION

Unique and truly functional vast sandbox featuers of Mortal Online that are unique on market barely outweight the vast issues. For a player seeking a true open-world sandbox MMO, Mortal Online is more than good enough to enjoy.

After this time, you no longer get a free pass on bugs for being indie so quit with the excuses.

I’ve been along the ride from the start till about half a year ago, when I quit even playing casually because of the blatant GM corruption and forum censorship. So let’s get this going. On paper, the concept sounds amazing. Open world, free PvP, full loot, skill based progression. What is there not to like? The implementation of all those grand ideas, apparently. MO puts you into a car with a broken steering wheel, no dashboard, gear in reverse by default and then smirks at you saying ""lol what, you can't figure it out?! I'm not holding your hand, how cool is that!"".

It feels like the devs equal ""annoying"" and ""time consuming"" to ""challenging"", something that is seen throughout most of the game's mechanics. In their strive for realism they made the crafting system vast and imho unnecessarily complicated, but ended up with only a few dozen viable recipes out of thousands combinations. This approach of adding unnecessary complexity (or depth, as some may argue) in an attempt to simulate realism goes through the entire game and all its mechanics, making every task more difficult than it really needs to be. Not more challenging, mind you, as many players would argue, but simply more awkward and time consuming. Every UI interaction is awkward. Every other mechanic feels awkward. This is a small company and indie company, but again, after 6 years.. I expected more. 

This quote from another player sums up the problematic dev attitude that doesn't differentiate between challenging and annoying imho: ""It's a VERY annoying start, and someone in /h suggested that I just go afk chopping wood to raise my attributes. I did just that and it helped.""

Then there are GMs. Being on limited budget, devs recruited some players as volunteers to act as GMs in the game. Some of them were underage and most of them had ties to guilds. That went pretty much as expected – favoritism and corruptions ran rampant and any discussion about GMs’ actions such as choosing to restore a destroyed asset, or spawn assets, were censored from the forums. And that is in a PvP game. Devs showed little interest in addressing the situation, but instead, according to many, had a hand in it. According to some it got a bit better, but it already made many including me quit and I would still hold devs accountable that it even got that bad in the first place.

That being said, the concept itself is interesting. The open world and almost free building, aim based combat, rather complex skill trees. I really enjoyed the first months in the game until the novelty wore off, and my time with others. The combat is probably the only thing that is as complex as it should be, and is actually skill based (bugs aside). But the rest just feels so.. clumsy and unnecessarily complex, instead of actually challenging your skill as a player. The majority of the challenge in MO comes from how awkward everything is, rather than player skill.  

You will find fans defending the game as being too ""hardcore"" for critics, but it's not hardcore, it's simply badly designed, unbalanced and buggy. Dark Souls is hardcore. DayZ is hardcore. People love those, but for some reason not MO. 

Even after six years, the game is not ready for Steam release.. The launcher options did not apply to my game, I had to rescale from within game settings. I couldn’t even log in, after seeing queue ticking down to 0 it just vanished and I was left staring at the login screen once again. After two days of trying, I finally got in, only to realize the node lag is still an issue, after six years of development, and the server can’t even handle 1k players currently playing (according to steamcharts). It’s ridiculous.

The concept itself, again, sounds very promising. But its implementation falls short and I honestly can’t recommend it. It’s just awkward and annoying instead of challenging. But if you are desperate for a full loot PvP game and love the challenge of trying to navigate the UI – go ahead and give it a try. It’s free after all, although capped at a skill limit. You’ll make a nice cannon fodder for the players camping newbie areas.",1441393853,1465037116,False,138,12,0.753951430320739746,10,False,False,False,False,,1441907827.0,"Thank you for your review, we really do appreciate your honest and calmly argued feedback and critiques!

Opinions and tastes aside, I would just like to adress two important things:

- Our GMs are most assuredly not corrupt.
We have not had volunteer GMs in our game for the past two years, and it is very important to us that we do not get involved in player politics or play favorites.

- Our server is now much more stable and it is much easier to log in!
Seb has been working tirelessly to improve our server software and has solved the major issues we experienced due to all of the new Steam players coming into the game.

I was so overloaded with dead animals that my run speed was comparable to a fast ant. I needed to get to a vendor, who's entrance was over a hill, far along the wall to the city I had to circumvent. I was going to be rich.

Yet at the same time, I knew it would look suspicious to be seen moving at such a slow speed while running. Enter my adorable deer like pet I called NotaBear who I would stop and turn to whenever another person was in sight.

As I neared the arena I had to pass before closing in on the city gates, I knew encounters would become more frequent. By this time my daughter was cheering me on! 

I made it past the arena, only stopping to socialize with NotaBear 3 times, the end was in sight! And then it happened. 

Enter a man in silver robes covering his body. Blinding me and filling me with fear, he asked what I was doing. How much gold I had. What I was carrying. He told me the command to type that would drop all the loot in my bags, and he would let me live if I dumped my gear. 

I told him I only had meat. He told me to dump my gear. My daughter told me to dump my gear. I continue to back up with my shield out, hoping to stall for 20 minutes as I walk backwards to the city. You have no idea how slow going this is... 

I am losing all hope. He is telling me he going to kill me. The end is near. 

Behind him I see a man on a horse with the largest bow I have seen in the game. I yell out that I am being robbed. He stops. My robber turns and greets the man by name with humility and fear!!

My Savior asks what is transpiring, and I repeat that he is trying to steal all my meat. My Savior retorts with a funny meat joke and we all laugh. 

However my robber still attempts to get me to drop my gear. My crawling backpeddle to the gates looks more hopeful, as my Savior tells me to continue into the city and that this man will leave me alone. I offer my thanks. 

And then the robbers horse attacks me! Shield up I quickly learn to parry this magnificent creatures attacks. Life is dropping, at 60% life my Savior notices what is happening and runs to the rescue. 

The robber runs. The horse runs. The Savior gives chase. Moments later, my robber lays dead, and I am free to head into the city, proudly displaying the wounds I earned to keep my treasure!

Meager Proof: http://i.imgur.com/SyuxQpd.png 

Key Overview of Mortal Online:

- Firstly, Mortal Online was released OVER FIVE YEARS ago. So anyone trying to call out a negative review based off of the playtime shown on Steam is completely misguided.

-The fact that it was created five years ago also stands as a testimony to how horribly, horribly directed the game has been this entire time. 

- It began under the development of a small group of Swedish guys who created their little independent company Star Vault, and because I have not been following it that closely, I'm not entirely sure how much they've grown since then. I'm relatively positive that the dev team is still quite diminutive especially given the scope of the game and its current state. Again, that is speculation. 

This game was a project loaded with potential, but got corrupted by a small, dedicated playerbase who refused to acknowledge the actual problems with the game and kept feeding the egos of blind, prideful developers. Five years into this virulent cycle, the independent company gets to release their game on Steam to a wave of people who are unfamiliar with the long standing unhealthy cycle that has been going on for ages.

So, in good conscience, I cannot recommend this game. They need to learn a lesson. This type of independent company behavior is not okay and should not be encouraged.

------THIS IS THE END OF THE CORE OVERVIEW STOP HERE BEFORE TL;DR REVIEW BELOW------

I'm going to do a LOOSE FORM of a pros and cons list to come off as unbiased as I can towards this game, because, as mentioned above, I really did have the highest of hopes for it fulfilling my wildest MMO fantasies. It, unfortunately, clearly has no intentions of ever rising up to meet its potential or making the required changes to fulfill said fantasies.

That being said, expect a more descriptive list of cons as this is still a NEGATIVE review.

This WILL NOT be comprehensive at the time of writing, because I simply don't have the time and I could go on endlessly about the good ideas and the horrible implementations that this game suffers from.

Pros:

- The world's big, fascinating, and a mystery for every new player to discover with minimal guidance. 

- The game's mechanics are hardcore and there is no hand-holding going on here. It's really an amazing design philosophy that I love to embrace.

- The idea of a true open sandbox where you can literally be whatever you want to be is there. Trader by day, highwayman by night. Valiant defender of justice, or rapscallion rogue pickpocketing in the streets. You decide.

- The concept of real time combat with responsive and individual body-part hitboxes in an MMO is astounding.

Cons:

- Several of the systems, the mechanics, are still as severely flawed as they were five years ago at release. For instance, the flagging system. (Which indicates whether you've been a good or naughty person in the game world recently. Blue flag means innocent, grey flag means you've done something bad and you're free game, red flag means you're murderous scum and can be killed on sight) It was never refined to a logical point and I'll give the roughest example for people who haven't played the game yet. Let's say I'm killing some NPC creatures and I'm flagged blue. A person can, literally, run like a madman in between the monster and me so that I accidentally hit them. When I accidentally hit them, the game flags me grey and I become free game for that person and anyone else around to attack me since I'm now considered a criminal. I don't know the timer on it, which brings me to my next point.

- There is no consistent, well documented data for... Anything really. Monsters, towns, maps, items, basic functionality. In game, it's almost nonexistent except for some vague descriptions here and some weak tutorials that are pretty much only presented within the first thirty minutes of the game. The playerbase is so small and tight-knit that you can't even find reliable, recent online documentation for things. The TWO Wiki resources have blank pages or pages that haven't been updated in years. This ties into the next point. 

- The game's mechanics are hardcore and there is no hand-holding going on here. While it's a really amazing design philosophy, it's not an excuse to justify lazy, badly executed design. That seems to be a go-to argument for the game's supporters. What they fail to realize is that peoples' qualms lie less so in the game being ""hardcore"" and moreso in it feeling unpolished or just... lazy. An example in my next point.

- This is supposed to be an established fantasy world with a lore and history, but... You don't even have access to ANY in-game map? You're telling me that the inhabitants of this massive world, these people who built countless intricate cities... Never drew up maps? I'm not even asking for a marker on the map of where I'm at. I'm asking for just a simple map alone for reference. Even a map that fills in as you explore it would make more sense than this. The lack of systems, the lack of designs for these systems. It's blatant and people who defend it using the, ""You just can't handle how hardcore the game is"" allow the developers to get away with bad design choices.

- The idea of ""Free To Play"" is extremely misguiding here. All the skills in the game have a cap of 100. If you're a FTP player, however, you can only level up any skill to 60. Explaining this in the simplest of math, it makes you effectively 40% less efficient than any subscriber and bars you off from doing a great many things in the game or reaching high level content. That should be absolutely all I need to say about this. 

- 14 dollars for a month's subscription? That's ludicrous. World of Warcraft/Blizzard earned the right to charge people 15 bucks a month. Absolutely ludicrous, especially when Star Vault's idea of ""Free To Play"" really means ""Unlimited Trial period"".

- The bugs and glitches this far along... Are unforgivable. Items jumping back from your bank to your inventory when you log off. Items disappearing from the bank altogether. Cumbersome rubberbanding when fighting NPC monsters. The list goes on infinitely.",1441380904,1441380992,False,17,2,0.521366417407989502,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I feel that the developers rushed the game and it was not ready for steam.  They have only one server and if they have problems with it then no one plays. Right now it is overloaded and they cannot handle all the new players and I feel that they will in the long run ruin this game. I hope that I am wrong and that they can turn this around.

 I stupidly subscribed a day before I found out that it was released on steam still thinking it was going to still be a while. I now find myself at a login screen that puts me in a queue and when it finally attempts to connect it say lost connection leaving me attempting to connect again. 

I do know  I am in this for a month(since i paid a month, thank goodness only a month) and if things do not drastically change in that month then starvault can be assured that I will not be paying to play a game that I cannot login.

The monetisation on this game is far too steep, and the game becomes essentially unplayable without subscribing, AND buying an additional character slot.

You do NOT get an additional slot when you subscribe.
You have to pay more to do so.

To play the game effectively, virtually every class requires resources in the form of reagents and materials, usually metals.

There is a cap on your OVERALL skill distribution, so you can be a good miner, or a good fighter, but NOT BOTH. This means that, to play effectively, you need a seperate character to gather resources, then a seperate character to use those resources.

Effectively, this is a demo, because it's 100% impossible to engage in PvP properly in this game without having those additional sources of resources.

Additionally, to play a mage, you need a constant source of metals, so mages spells just WILL NOT CAST without a consistent source of metals.

All this wouldn't be so bad if they charged a reasonable price for things like slots and sub time, but it's 15EUR for a single month!

Long story short, the game is not only inferior and more grindy than most MMOs, but also considerably more expensive to play.

Don't waste your time, it took hours for the veil to be lifted and for it to be made clear the time and money you need to invest in this game to function.



(OLD REVIEW)
This game does not have a learning curve.
This game does not have a learning cliff.
This game has a learning mobius strip.

It will punish, and tease, and grind you to the bone, but if you invest the time and effort to explore and learn, even for a small period, you'll find a game with depth beyond depth. Think Skyrim meets Dwarf Fortress.

Sadly, this has hurt it's review score, but I honestly think that the learning curve is the only real reason for negative reviews, as on the whole this game has great production values and quite frankly, an awesome development team. Having worked with Unreal Engine, I have some inkling of the effort they've gone to to make this work.

If you think you've got the patience and control, I beg you to give this a go. It's as close to Sword Art Online as we're ever going to get.",1441331730,1441392342,False,8,1,0.488242298364639282,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I played a while ago and am very happy to see it on steam. Although some of the negative reviews are true it does not change that the game is still at least worth you trying it out. I'll give you the TLDR: First.

Pros:
   Nearly infinite freedom
   Can play however you want to play
   Lots of nice players willing to help new players
   The trailer doesn't portray anything that the game is not
   Extremely complex pvp system
   Payment is optional

Cons:
   Extremely complex pvp system
   Not a jump in and run style game
   Everything takes lots of time to do and train
   High system spec requirements
   Payment allows user to train skills from 60 to 100 (only viable f2p build is hybrid)
   You find yourself very lost as soon as you leave the city

To play the game to its fullest you must have a good computer and a subscription. Being solo is very difficult unless you have an extensive knowlege of the combat system and great timing. That being said with a small group or a lot of training this game can be among the best you have played since (for many of you) UO. Same skill type system, you can do everything yourself. Nearly everything is player made. Trial and error will be your friend when crafting.

I never take the time to write reviews, but I feel like this game was unjustly charged a ""mixed"" rating. If you like the feel of the elder scrolls and the openness of a sandbox game. Give this a shot (computer allowing). Most issues players report for negative reviews are because they play on toasters that cannot support anything beyond the dated requirements World of Warcraft still supports. To those people (I appologize in advance) WoW is not a standard for MMO's anymore, it is time for an upgrade.",1441327401,1441327401,True,47,0,0.609020531177520752,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Now lets get into the game play its a real time action based combat system MMO in third person view it's Ultima Onlines Successor It has pretty decent graphics depending on what setting your playing on even on the lowest setting it still is pretty decent.The characters/ environment and mounts buildings and terrain all look amazing for being 4-5 years old.

Combat System 10/10*
-----------------
Real time action based
*WARNING* There is no carebear mechanics in combat meaning noones there to hold your hand.

The combat system is ""REALISTIC"" you actually have to ""AIM"" and ""CHARGE"" your attacks the longer your attacks are charged the more damage youll deal or lets say your a archer you have your bow and arrows and you see a enemy you actually have to aim your target cursor to where your enemy is and charge it depending on how far or how much damage you want to deal.
-----------------


Crafting  9/10*
---------
Similar to Ultima onlines crafting

The crafting is pretty cool sorta similar to Ultima online you have a forge and crafting tables theres various ores or marterials to be collected to be crafted into something unusual and unique.I havnt tested the crafting out fully so i cant really say much else.

----------

PVE
---------
Various Npc's to be farmed and harvested for materials or for trade to other players wish there were dragons though been wanting to see them in game for quit some time.

---------

PVP
---------
In my honest opinion one of the best PVP mechanics ive seen in a while it takes skill and tactical plans to defeat someone not for hand holding.

Overall i rate Mortal online 10/10 for for its diverse unique third person MMO combat/skilling/crafting/pve/and pvp

in this review ill talk about the different aspects of the game and the positives and negatives of these aspects. Keep in mind that as a F2P player this is my experience. I cant discuss every aspect but here are some that really got to me and made my impression of the game.

PvP: lets start with PvP since its at the core of the game. If you dont like PvP, dont even bother. you cant avoid it.

+ you can kill anyone and anyone can kill you. Its exciting to murder someone and take all their stuff and then hide so other players dont kill you. There is a criminal system in the game. if you hit somebody you are flagged as a criminal and the guards will kill you. The players are encouraged to kill the criminals for their loot as looting an innocent makes you a criminal. Killing criminals is fun.

i havent experience group fights so i dont know how that works.

- as a F2P player, its GG. P2P murderers come around kill you instantly and there is nothing you can do about it. As a F2P, your skills are capped at 60/100 which is incredibly weak.

- The game claims the combat is skill based. Its not true AT ALL. The game lags so much people hit you from 10 meters away with their back turned. Timing your blocks is almost impossible as the lag makes it so you always block too late.

- Exploitable. Everyone is ""blueblocking"" which is to run in front of somebody as he is swinging his weapon to be hit by accident, turning the victim into a criminal. the blueblocker can now freely kill the victim and take all his stuff. This is a really easy way to get gear early on. i found that almost everyone is doing it.

- The rich players are some of the most rotten people ive ever met in-game, especially subscribers that you find in the beginner areas. These hypocrites will gladly defend victims of blueblocking yet the same people turn around and kill you for no reason. Avoid the geared players like the plague. Leave the beginner town as soon as you can. These asshole ruin all the fun.

PvE: the pvp is bad, surely the PvE is better right?... right?

+ You can train your skills by killing pigs.

- The PvE is so bad. So so bad. Monsters will hit you from 10 meters away, follow you to the other side of the map and will even swim through a river to get you. You cannot evade attacks. Monsters will always hit you no matter what you do. All you can do is attack and block the best you can. Boring and difficult. No skill involved.

Open World:

+ This game has an epic open world. No loading screen, nothing. While dated, the graphics look really good and you can spend alot of time just admiring the landscape and the environment. Creatures are scattered around the world for you to discover. The world is also filled with player made cities which is really cool since it makes the world feel alive. I didnt get to explore the new desert continent, but ive heard its cool too.

- i cant really think of anything bad about the game world really other that it has no map. it has that old feel to it like those weird games where you never knew where you were going because you were too young to understand how a compass works. Im kind of mixed on this one.

Crafting:

+ its really cool. I love that everything is player made. The beginner gear can be bought at the merchant but its kind of crap anyways. For those who like the hardcore experience, the crafting system is very complicated. just to make an armor, you need a few materials and its not clear how to obtain them.

+ while getting the materials you need to craft good gear is really hard judging by the amount of campers and killers around, it really gives you a goal, something to do in the game. You want to go get your epic armor and brag about it. maybe kill a few people you know.

- Good luck getting the good materials on your own. you have to find the materials which are not close to town and come back with it hoping you dont get killed.

General experience: 

This game has a great potential. Its actually fun when you meet a bunch of people and go on an adventure. I went with a group to a different town and some guy gave all of us some really cool armor. We rode horses and overall was really fun. But these experiences are limited. you wont always find friends to do stuff. And the items you get, youll lose them to a pker or a random dude will jump in front of your sword.

While the idea and the mechanics are really cool, this game is one of the most unpolished mmos ive ever played. The UI is awkward and buggy. The server disconnects you often and you die. People often walk through walls or walk on water. you can hit people offscreen due to lag or weird animations.

I know this is a really small dev team, but this is no excuse for having a game so buggy and unpolished as this.

Final verdict: TL;DR dont subscribe.

i like this game. it really has alot of potential. I tried my best to have fun and do stuff, but its really had and the F2P limitations and overall gameplay and quality this game offers is bad. Even if i were a subscribed player, the game is a mess and there is nothing to do other than kill F2P noobs.

Overall this game feels like its in Beta. It was released 5 years ago and the state the game is does not warrant a 15$ monthly subscription.",1441301339,1441576853,False,6,1,0.5,0,False,False,False,False,,,

After about an hour of connecting i finally played the game. The tutorial is very short and you quickly get thrust into questing. The running at low levels seems a bit far and stamina drains very quickly(you need this to sprint). As a scout you are given 25 arrows, these arrows do not seem to be retrievable after you shoot them and do not do much damage. After killing maybe 3 ""walkers"" which were the first true enemy (excluding pigs) i was already out of arrows and had to revert back to the sword i was given. I might try to go back into the game with a new character and reset and not go scout. but atm the game is very difficult and didnt seem to be that much fun.

Os sistemas de craft são completos e complexos, assim como os pets/montarias que além de ser possível domesticar ou dominar também tem como cruzar espécies a fim de gerar uma montaria melhor.

O combate usa um sistema ótimo de Action Combat, onde você tem que mirar em alguma parte do corpo de seu adversário. Mirar na cabeça da mais dano, armaduras também são variaveis importantes durante o combate, se você perceber que seu inimigo está usando calças ruins então mire nas pernas.

O jogo possui um time pequeno mas que está sempre trabalhando pra melhorar o jogo. Diferente de jogos de empresas gigantes esses desenvolvedores são bem mais acessíveis e ativos na comunidade.

There is a subscription element, which increased skill maxes to 60/100, but even premium accounts only get the same 1100 skills as free players, so free players end up having more skills, than premium players, being a jack of all trades- Able to wear decent armor, do decent damage, ride a decent horse- But if you want to breed horses, make armor, etc, you will HAVE to subscribe- Its pretty damn ethical, there is no item shop, and I don't see the subscription as pay to win, I see it as playing for free is really an unlimited demo, if you enjoy the game and actually want to play it, then subscribe, but like I said before, its totally possible to play without subscribing, as long as you dont want to craft/breed/be uber.

Not for the faint of heart.. Its like in 300 when that guy makes love with that guys wife.. ""your not going to enjoy this"".. But if you can get past that, it still counts heyooo, no I take that back, that's rude, too soon.

First off, I'd like to start off by saying this is my first review.

This game has some of the most intersting content I have ever seen in a MMORPG. Mortal Online is the most true to genre hard-core, sandbox MMORPG's I have ever played. 

Now I have played many RPG's, you could probably name any game and I have played it. This is a first in what I hope to be more games like this. 
 
Now to start listing qualities:
MUSIC:
The music in Mortal Online is really inriguing. As a musician myself I always like to listen to the music in a game and think of the time and effort put in to making it. Now I don't know if they hired an orchestra or simply used midi files but it sounds pretty good.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics aren't too shabby. Although not comparable to a game like GW2, or Skyrim, they are more comparable to RoK. Although the graphics are not the best of the best, they do their job and show the in game content and crafting system, (which is the strongest part of the game).

CONTENT:
The most exciting part about this game is its content. The publishers really mean this game has a great crafting system. Since there are no real questing in this game, you the player has to create all of your gear from scratch. This truly sets everyone at the same level from start to finish. This also makes the game more based on skill and amount of time spent creating your character. Mortal Online also supports a subscribing system, since the game doesn't have 2 types of in game currencies, the only way to support the game financially is to have a sub system. This DOES NOT BREAK THE GAME. No one subscriber gets insanely amazing benefits from subbing. Subscribers get a few more skills they can enhance and a few other things. This makes it fun and playable for f2p gamers.
BONUS CONTENT: They have a nude setting which I find to be hilarious...

GAMEPLAY:
The overall game play isn't too bad. The mouse settings though are either TOO sensitive or TOO slow, there just doesn't seem to be an in between. Movement is alright and everything seems timed just right. Draw back, there is only first person viewing while playing the game. This goes hand-in-hand with the ""hard-core"" aspect of game play. 

Overall I give this game a 12/10 for nude setting",1441291956,1441291956,True,5,1,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

No luck.

Edit: I did evantually get the game to load. A little tip for anybody who tries to play this game. The first thing you should do when this game loads is turn off the sound. You spend the first hour or so listening screaming pigs. You're supposed to collect up some skins or something, I dont know, I never could get it to work.

To be honest, after reading the description, getting me to like this game was going to be an uphill battle anyway. I've never understood the movement MMO's have made away from classes and races. Its all skill trees now, so the world is always full of healer-knights. The game only has four races... light-skinned humans with or without pointy ears & dark-skinned humans with or without pointy ears. Theres a couple of paragraphs about each one, but they all looked the same to me. The game attempts to make up for this by letting you cover your toon in tattoos. bleh.

The game does give you a ton of options about the background of your tattooed healer-knight though. You can choose which countries your grandparents came from & this somehow affects your stats in ways that will probably be hugely important later on. The free account only includes one character slot though, so as soon as you figure out which stats are important you'll be deleting your character & starting a new one.

The descriptions for this game go on & on about how important crafting is... indeed the tutorial zone seems to offer little else except an explanation of their crafting system... which makes it all the more puzzling when the in-game tips remind you of how important it is to buy a -campfire- from the local NPC vendor before you go off into the wilderness.

Maybe its a great game once you get into it... i got tired of chasing pigs & uninstalled it.",1441285838,1441389959,False,20,2,0.398691296577453613,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
- Full loot PvP/PvE system with no items that stay on death (Hardcore)
- Diverse crafting systems.
- Large world to pillage and explore
- Communicative and friendly Dev and Moderation Staff
- Localised Banking/Mailing
- Client Side Combat
- Skill Based Progression
- First Person ONLY
- Territory Control Asset Based System
- Diverse character creation
- Infinite Free Trial
- One persistent server (8 years and counting)

Cons:
- Some minor bugs here and there (OPEN MIND PEOPLE)
- Graphics are not Triple A, but get over it kids, this game is not all about glits and glammor, its about blood and gore.
(And IMO they're pretty bloody good graphics.)

I've played the game for 2 years now on and off and every time i come back its been for longer and its always a blast every time, i discover new things i didn't know before and go through a new path every time. Hell i havent even explored half of the world yet and still have so many places and things i want to do and discover about the game that there is endless content to be had.

My first peice of advice for anyone coming to play the game is to have an open mind, and dont shut it when you come across something you dont really understand, get some help and ask around, youll find an answer somewhere wether it be ingame of from forums which by the way are found at www.mortalonline.com/forums. (most useful place for information while getting started).

One other thing is that nothing is really handed to you which is really what drives the games discovery factor and sandbox nature, but as i said previously dont give up on it, you will find an answer, you just have to look for it, ask around or experiment yourself.

Oh and this game is not ""Free to play"" persay, its more ""Free to try"" infinitely, But even then, you can still do fine on a free account and ive seen many a player do so with flying colors, so dont listen to all the people who say its a bad model blah blah blah, because they just dont understand it.",1441283112,1441283153,True,8,0,0.54356849193572998,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Now hear me out. I gave this game a good hour and a half. I like the concept of the game. That being said, that is all I like about the game. Where to begin.

GM's, you would think they would be helpful, but they are not. I asked for help on how to craft a robe (because the tut is total garbage) After the 4th time of asking in help I was banned from help chat, for asking for help (GM said I was spamming) But I only re asked the question because no one would answer in help, they were all too busy fighting over weather or not the game was worth 15 dollars a month (Its not)...... 

Gameplay, well, once you've tried to run around for 10 minutes, you will quickly recognize something is amiss.. You feel like you are running through a field of molases weighed down by 100lbs... FPS is good, but it feels like you are lagging when you really arent.

Community, toxic to say the least. And thats putting it nicely. And GM's do try to stem the tide of complaints and fights, but they arent effective in the least. 

Basically, this is a game from 2010, that they are asking 15 dollars a month for. Yea you can play for free, but lets be realistic here, the perks you get form subbing make this very close to a p2w game if not completely.

Graphics 6/10. It's better than Half Life but not as good as Half Life 2 graphics.
Gameplay 9/10. It plays alot like Mount & Blade and there is just so much freedom.
Community 8/10. Only thing that annoys me about the community are the people who bitch about it, Like I said it doesn't suit everyone, if you don't like it don't bitch about it to everyone who likes it just log off and go play something else.
Crafting 7/10. I like the crafting but I think it can look a little hard when you first start.

While I was in game I talked to some players familiar with the game:

Benefits of F2P

- None, it's just a trial, steer clear of this game.

Benefits of P2P

- Well as usual, you unlock everything. No skill caps, house creation, etc,.

It doesn't seem like much, but for a first person sandbox mmo, to declare itself as free2play, it should have all features unlocked, with some features limited in what they do.

Example - House creation should be unlocked for EVERYONE. HOWEVER, you can't be allowed to put up banners or paintings, or make fireplaces. AND you should also have a limit on how big your house can be and the materials used in it.

As it stands right now, they want you to pay to try out a feature, which you really shouldn't have to do if its saying free2play, if something big(and for a sandbox mmo, housing is a BIG feature cause it adds immersion.)

Just too expensive per month, and can't get too far without paying really..
And a number of ppl will steal from you, or try to kill you, even something called blue blocking.
On the other hand, u can play in any way, and most skills and stats directly or indirectly help others, making it easy to get the type of character you want. Can easily play it safe too, mine, or just hunt, train animals, and crafting etc. Most things you can do in the safety of the guards too..  
Anyone can steal any money off you any time, and if you leave the town, anyone can kill you and take your stuff. 
Doesn't mean this will happen often or at all if you play smart, read up on the game and watch youtube, it's not an easy game, no quick way to get better anf no easy large ammounts of money right away..
Makes it the perfect game, if it was cheaper and more people had the chance fo fully play it.
Can still spend a few days making a character specifically the way you want, the fighting is fun, scenery is nice, and a range of few annoying people amongst many friendly and helpull people.

REAL REVIEW:

Another reason to not believe Steam reviews. This game is unlike other MMOs in that it DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND AT ALL. You wanna learn how to craft armor and weaponry? Well, go do it then! You don't know how? Well find the trainers! You don't know where the trainers are because the game doesn't have a map? Well look around then!

People are getting massively butthurt because the game is not supposed to be easy and simplified for idiots. It's meant as a spiritual successor to Ultima Online, and so far it is in the sandbox elements at least. The game almost entirely lacks quests, too, and that is also pissing people off.

It's a sandbox MMO. I thought people like sandbox games? Oh wait, they do if they're simplified to the point that children can pick them up and play them like a master. This is not that kind of game.",1441253672,1441413344,True,278,63,0.693222701549530029,5,False,False,False,False,,,

This gem of a game is pretty much the only MMO worth playing these days.  Sure, it has bugs... nothing game breaking, but little irritants... and it does take a little time to set it up properly.  The learning curve isn't horribly bad, but it's there.  That's where all the bad reviews come from.

In reality though, the game is one of a kind.  A well-designed world focused on allowing strategic aquisition of resources by guilds.  These resources are fought over.  Once you gain access to them, you will defend them.  The amount of freedom and different ways to play the game is it's biggest strength.

It's not just a game focused on PvP... It's a game that allows for MEANINGFUL PvP.  The game has a deep crafting system... and this system requires resources which are not always easy to aquire.   Good armor is easy for most anyone to make, but great armor?  Great armor will require you to work for it.  Most likely, you or your friends will have to fight to get you the things you need.  Towns will be built around important areas within the world, and people will attack them.

I can't think of another MMO I'd recomend right now.  Not one.  In a time of stale MMOs where I endlessly wander through virtual landscapes only to find day after day that I am bored... it's really nice to run into a game like MO.

Alas, there are far too many problems with the game, the hardware backing the game, the devs, and the community for any of those good ideas to shine through. 
 
Here are a few of those good ideas and why they don't work. 
 
+[b]Mortal is now on Steam [/b] with all the benefits that come with it. For the game and the playerbase, I think this is sorely needed, but I'll get back to that. 
 
-Unfortunately, [b]the servers simply cannot handle the influx of new players[/b]. Multiple tries are required to log in and gameplay in general is laggy and unresponsive compared to how the game used to run. Especially with Mortal's dynamic combat system, this can make the game almost unplayable. 
 
+[b]The character customization is very unique.[/b] Your character is generated by choosing your heritage. The not often seen feature of having your age and height affect your stats is an interesting addition as well.  
 
-However, [b]the distribution of stats can be rather confusing[/b], as there are no tooltips that tell you exactly how each stat point affects your character, forcing you to just guess which stats will match your playstyle. 
 
+[b]The game has open survival-esque PvP in all areas[/b], only limited to how long you think you can last without getting killed yourself. 
 
-[b]This is poorly implemented,[/b] however. You will find yourself accidentally taking swings at players, especially in the densely populated starting zones, labeling you a criminal and being killed shortly after. The combat itself is very clunky and slow compared to the speed people can move. Most PvP battles consist of bouncing at your opponent, hoping your attack will connect first or being assaulted from behind while your attacker flees. 
 
+[b]The game has a rewarding loot and crafting system [/b] and you can even loot the items of dead players. 
 
-[b]The latter being inappropriate for this type of game.[/b] Mortal is supposed to play like an RPG, not a survival game. You can spend hours amassing materials and crafting items as a simple craftsman with no intent of combat, only to be slain and lose all of your items rather unceremoniously.  
 
+[b]The economy is entirely player run.[/b] Most items are made for players, by players. This game may be the only MMORPG I've seen that actually has honest to goodness crafting guilds that function like a real business. 
 
-[b]The economy is broken as hell.[/b] Unlike games that have a player run economy that is gently shifted by the judgment of the developers for maximum fun, this one was just left to its own devices. Low level gear is oversaturated and difficult to sell, making the early game merchant completely implausible without first having a high level beefstick to harvest better materials.  
Just as well, high level market is cornered to the point of it being cheaper simply to spend the time and effort to make it yourself. Since there is such a high risk of losing all of your items upon death, it makes you question why you'd want to put in the effort at all. 
 
Now that I've covered most of the 'good' aspects of the game, here are some of the purely negative ones. 
 
-[b]The playerbase is horrible.[/b] As I hinted at before, I'm hoping Steam will make this game's community a bit more bearable. Almost all high level characters will kill lower levels to grief them. Most are unhelpful and others are downright caustic. Of course that doesn't go for every player, but the sheer number of simply mean spirited people are scarily high. 
 
-[b]The developers don't care[/b] about the game at all. I must admit that it has improved a small amount since the last time I played. Unfortunately the game still seems to be in a constant state of neglect. Bugs and issues are everywhere and some are still present since I last played [i]in 2011[/i]. 
 
-[b]Most of the GMs are unhelpful.[/b] Again, this doesn't go for every mod, but there have been recorded cases of GMs repeatedly scamming players for real world money. On a smaller scale, GMs will constantly 'play' with their privileges in ways that actively disrupt the game, such as spawning bosses in low level areas or even verbally attacking specific players in global chats. 
 
-The game has some [b]very seedy business practices[/b]. Not limited to: Capping player skills at a ridiculously low value unless they have a subscription, asking for weirdly personal information such as your address and full name unless you are a subscriber, and lifting any ban if you donate. 
 
-If you are a subscriber, [b]you are allowed to take items from other player's inventories.[/b] Plain and simple. You just... take stuff. Like... What the hell, right? 
 
That about wraps up what's wrong with this game. In this state, I absolutely cannot recommend it. The game has some great potential and fun gameplay, but a hardcore reorganization is in order before this game becomes anything that's worth your time. 
 
+++[b]You can also see some top notch elf dick.[/b]",1441244136,1441245201,False,264,13,0.803983747959136963,8,False,False,False,False,,1441891131.0,"Thank you for your honest review of pros and cons with our game.

I would like to address a few of the points you make:

- Our server performance has been improved greatly since the Steam launch, and it is now much easier to log in than it was just a few days ago.

- We have changed the registering process so that private information is no longer needed to create a free account.

- We DO NOT ""lift any ban if you donate"". I can't emphasize this enough.

- We developers absolutely care about our game! We work hard every single day to fix bugs, make improvements, and add new content and features, but since we are a very tiny team of indie developers we simply don't always have the resources to do all the things we want to do as quickly as we would like to do them.

- Sure there are griefers, but there are also plenty of very friendly and helpful people in our community who help newbies with questions, give them free starter gear, show them around the world, and even protect them from griefers near the starter areas.

- Regarding GMs: A few years ago we had a program for volunteer GMs which didn't turn out so well, and therefore we do not use volunteer GMs anymore since a couple of years back. If our GMs are ever ""unhelpful"" nowadays, it is only because we have a very small team and we don't always have time to help everyone as quickly as we would like.

- Regarding ""seedy business practices"": Mortal Online is a subscription based game, but we also offer an unlimited free trial where players can play as much as they want with a skill cap at 60 (out of 100). On top of that, all updates and content expansions are all free and availible to both subscribers and non-subscribers.

- Regarding taking items from other players' inventories: Yes, we do have a thievery mechanic in this game, and access to this mechanic is limited to subscribers. This however does NOT mean that subscribers simply ""are allowed to take items from other players"". It takes training, skill, patience and finesse to be an effective thief in our game, and if a thief is not careful he/she will be prompty and justly killed by NPC guards. Thievery is a very risky but potentially rewarding profession."

The comments were no longer relevant.)

Alright. I reinstalled the game after the dev modified the account creation.
Your information is only needed if you're getting the subscription outside of Steam.

Now, onto the game itself.

First loading it up, and the game...looked rather poor, despite my World and Character settings being as high as they go. There is a horrible head-bob that I did not see a way to turn off.

I did the tutorial (unlike 50% of the people in help chat), and found it lacking. It told you the BARE essentials to playing the game. Walk, kill stuff, craft basic thing, tame little animal. After the tutorial, you are left on your own devices to wander around wherever you started. And when I say wander, I mean wander aimlessly, lost, as there is no map system, and very few landmarks to use as orientation.

Skills require you to learn them from tutors, but good luck actually finding them. They have no indicators showing you can learn from them.

Now, the combat. While trying to kill the pigs in the tutorial, I felt rather motion sick. The camera swings wildly when you attack. It didn't help that I was experiencing mouse and input lag (I would press a key, and about 1/2 second later the game accepts the input.)

Also, if you don't want to die, don't jump off ledges, don't kill things with blue names...and after one hour of play, avoid all players. The game is focused around PvP, so strong players can murder anyone they so feel like, and when they do, you lose ALL of your items and hard work.

My gameplay experience in a nutshell:

- waited over 2 hours to create a character.
- played a bit.
- accidently hit another player while I tried to kill a pig.
- got killed by guards.
- twice.
- respawned where somewhere, couldn't return to the tutorial area.
- deleted my character.
- 4 times in a row.
- created a new one.
- completed his tutorial and that's it.
- game throws you into open water and says ""swim""
- you have no idea where to go.
- you have no idea how to do.
- the fighting feels like I am an old fart with hurting bones.
- ""sprinting"" feels like a slow stroll.
- I died out of nothing.
- I'm done.

The game works not like it should do...

All that worked was the uninstall button.

Technical Aspects!

First you have to create a account / the buttons are not responsive so it can be that the game itself doesnt notice that you pressed the button. A browser pops up and you type it in manually.
After youve done that, you log in your account. The serverstructure is unknown,you join a server after you created a character.
As i mentioned before, the buttons are not responsive. I created the character and pressed the button to finalize, but it didnt let me.
Going back,i found my character suddenly standing there.
After 3 attempts of login-errors, the game started. It loaded very slowly,took about 5 minutes.
The game wasnt taking any graphic-settings that i set in the settings of it before starting the game.
Ingame the framerate dropped after a few seconds to 1 picture in 5 seconds. I put everything on the lowest settings, still nothing (and this game is old unreal engine)
I exited the settings, and suddenly my mousepointer of the menu was still in the game. I was disabled to look left and right.

Gameplay Aspects!

While creating the looks of your character (a few hairs, a few colours, nothing adjustable, all preset)
you can also select your race beforehand. (they all have the same player model, one is a little thiner, one got a beard, one has some more skin details, one got a scar over his eye).
4 Races total.
Then you pick what your grandfather and grandmother were, to get some additional stats. Theres huge lore about it, but not really straight up what it does in the game.

Nice for a f2p. but only as a fun-mod i suppose. Some people create that for other games in their freetime.

NOT only that starting out you have ZERO means of making money because it's a ""player driven economy"" and not a SINGLE GODDAMN NPC will buy ANYTHING you try to sell to them. You could spend HOURS crafting gear that the ONLY thing it'll do is raise your skill and have 0 means of making money for yourself but have to spend money to get materials. Sure you can sell materials you gather, but their worth is miniscule and this is a 100 copper = 100 silver = 100 gold, ergo it takes 1,000 copper to equal 1 gold. Which you you'll have to keep in a bank unless you don't mind getting pick-pocketed by thieves in rags. Combat is also awkward with a clumsy version of Mount and Blade's directional based combat(it doesn't work half the time) and no option for a 3rd person view(but at least it has an FoV slider...to bad it's set at 90 degrees and you have VERY limited peripheal vision). And to be honest there are actually TOO many skills, your character doesn't even know how to throw a chunk of Pig Meat over a fire to make roasted meat, probably one of the most basic things possible. Oh and the basic Mafioso tactic of strongarming players into Guilds for ""protection"". 

This game's character creation and wealth of skills is REALLY impressive but it's execution basically spits in the face of everything any gamer has ever seen in a game.

Pros:
-Huge skill list and more ""life-like"" world compared to other worlds, involved character creation and the ability to make a character you want.

Cons:
-Graphics are lackluster and stutter.
-Controls for combat are slow and clunky.
-Making items early in the game serves no purpose beyond grinding it's related crafting skill as it can only be sold to players. And no player is going to buy low tier gear.
-Good chance of getting griefed at all times once you're outside the safety of the cities.
-Skills are capped at barely above 50% proficiency unless you pay money, giving subbers an innate advantage in a game that is VERY MUCH about player versus player.
-Game supports toxic, non-social behaviour in the ""elite"" towards new players.
-Game is VERY vague about values such as how much armor protects you, how many items you're using in crafting something and the damage you do/take.
-The amount of skills is actually overwhelming as it seems like EVERYTHING is tied to a skill from gathering plants to RESTING. Yes, you can get better at resting, by resting a lot.",1441230608,1441241635,False,30,5,0.478284716606140137,2,False,False,False,False,,,

+ sometimes friendly players, that dont kill you as soon as they see you, despite the full PvP loot system (if You get killed they can they everything You had, only the items in the bank are safe)
+ no global bank, well this seems realistic

CONS:
- the world is BIG and often appears to be empty
- game has severe performance issues (low FPS, stuttering or even freezing), and the problem is not on my end, my computer runs games with higher system requirements than this game flawlessly
- bad bussiness model, at least for my taste, with monthly subscription fees in the range of 14 - 12 euros per month, it is too much even for an AAA title (take a look at how Elder Scrolls Online went from subscribtions to a Buy to Play model), if that monthly fee, they want, would be a one time payment I might reconsider it
- severely limited F2P, skill cap for free players for all skills at 60 / 100 skillpoints is almost halving the skills of the free players, THAT is really not what a F2P game does (I am okay with the guild stuff and the land owning being only for premiums)

VERDICT:
I dont care about the graphics, I would gladly play it with completely crappy graphics like if it was 15 years old, But the technical state of the game (severe performance issues) and the current bussiness model (14 - 12 euros per month subscribtion, or play for free with all skills capped at 60/100) is killing it.

Mortal Online is a dark and masochistic world where other players can greatly impact your life, they can siege every building you make, they can try to kill you anywhere you are and they can steal anything you have. It's bleak, frustrating and difficult, the same way life in a medieval era would have been.

Where you know nearly all the members of it's community and what they have accomplished, you know the land, you know the flaws and you know you love it all anyways.

When starting your journey in Mortal it will be very rough and mundane until you are strong and educated enough to explore the world and decide what interests you, just like when you first started minecraft. There is little to guide you but your own imagination.

this game really isnt for the faint hearted 

as for f2p its an unlimited trial to show you the game before purchasing a subscription, a good fighter can easily kill p2p players if you are skilled enough.

f2p cant wear heavy armors but can wear upto 14 weight and can still have a chance of dealing max damage when fighting, the skill level only caps your lowest you can hit for.

here is a guide for f2p an easy build/ and money maker

Its only as grindy as you make it.
Playing as a f2p is possible but you rely more on a group than someone who is subscribed.

Now I don't have any quests at all and I love it!

I started playing Mortal years ago and it still hasn't lost any of it's feeling. You can even make a break and when you start again, you only realise you've been gone a while because the territory map doesn't show any familiar guild names anymore.

What I especially love about this game:
* The broad possibilities of character configuration. 
I have a fighter, a cook, a tamer/breeder, a fatmage (my favourite :3), my friend has a butcher, an armor crafter, a dexmage (that's a fast footed mage while the fat mage can't really move without a horse under his feet)
and then there are a few experimental characters, too, where we try different skillsets, weapon specializations
* The thin spezializations. 
You have 1100 skillpoints with means you can max 11 primary skills to 100. 
11 sounds like a lot at first. But a fighter for example needs like 3 primaries in movement, 2 in defensive skills, another 3 in offensive skills, every weapon type is a primary, riding is a primary, armor training so you can wear heavier armor, mounted combat is a primary and handling weapons on a horse as well.
The skills include primaries and secondaries. You can have as many secondaries as you like but to get to most of them, you need a primary. Like you can know anything you want about weasels, horses, molvas, rabbits, wisents, camals, and all the endless different kinds of mammals there are, you need to invest points into mammalia first.
* The diversity of the world.
There is jungle, desert, snowy mountains. And the creatures are endless, from cute little rabbits to monstrous minotaurs! You can find very different materials, different woods, metals, minerals, flowers. There even is honey :D
* The payment system.
Free-to-play chars have a skill maximum of 60 instead of 100. Man, they can't do anything right, you might think. Yeah, somehow. Fighting in Mortal is heavily player-skill based. If you can't hit the enemy right, it doesn't matter what fat armor you have or how high your weapon skill is. You still lose!
F2P-Fighter even have an advantage: They can max 1100/60=18,3 primaries! 

Uhh, let's... move on...

What I don't like about Mortal:
* Bugs, bugs everywhere! 
Everywhere you go, everywhere you look, there are these little things that just aren't right. Flying plants, items vanishing from your inventory, getting stuck, pet movement (Letting your pet follow you along player made structures can lead to spontanous death to lil ol' pony T-T (okay, it wasn't the structures but the aggressive mobs behind the walls my pony felt running into) )
I got used to most of the bugs. I know which ways to avoid or how I can make my items appear again or on which spots I shouldn't kill mobs because the lootbag spawns underground.
* The very, VERY big bugs!
There was/is this bug, where the client crashes when I get hit on a horse. No fun with my fatmage! Hasn't occured when I left the new continent Sarducaa. Don't know if the bug still exists but I don't dare going there anymore. 
* The very thin possibilities for f2p.
F2P crafter are useless. Completely useless. If you don't pay, you have to fight.
* A certain uncomfortable part of the community.
The ones complaining about every little change and about how overpowered a certain weapon is, which is not true most of the time, or that this or that race is useless, which isn't true either or that there are cheater or star vault prefers a certain guild or bla bla blaaah.
And the ones saying ""we don't want new players"" camping in the starting cities ruining every new players start.

A lot of text. But, please, one final thing.

What others might not like:
* You can lose everything.
Full pvp, free loot. You leave the safety of the guards in town: you have to expect being killed and robbed. Say goodbye to your horsie. Bye to your new sparkling armor set. Bye to the 100 gold you wanted to transport to another town because banks are not linked and the only postal service you have is you. Or hiring another player. Which I maybe wouldn't do because... trust noone! 
But i can ensure you: Making a save delivery under this circumstances is even more rewarding! Everthing you do successfully makes you happy as hell.
* No questies. Nothing to do?!
I, myself, back in the days when I first started MO, I found it hard to set myself goals to reach, to find things to do. 
Today I don't think I'm really over this, but when I don't know what to do, I don't just quit the game anymore but say ""Eh, could kill some more megnatons"" and with this jouney new unforseen adventures begin :)",1441194734,1441194734,True,11,0,0.50295335054397583,0,False,False,False,False,,,

以下、特色
・フルルート、町の外では常に死が待っているスリルある世界
プレイヤは町の外ならいつでも相手を攻撃可能。死ねばアイテムを全て奪われる。死ぬのが嫌？死の意味が重いからこそ生が際立ち、戦闘も必然的に白熱したものになる。死が重いからこそ生きているのが楽しいゲーム。

・スキル制による自由なキャラクタービルド
歩兵、騎兵、騎上メイジ、魔法戦士、テイマーメイジなど自分にあったスキルビルドによるプレイが可能。それぞれのビルドは一長一短であり、非常によくバランスがとれるようになっている。どれが最強という事はなく、状況に応じて適切に操作する事で活躍が可能。

・中世の戦闘を疑似体験できるアクションコンバットシステム
ターゲット制でもFPSでもなく、実際に武器を振り回し、敵の頭や胴体、足などを狙って斬るリアルな戦闘システム。クラウドコントロール？そんな意味不明のものは存在しない。また相手の攻撃を受け流したりする事も可能で、そこに熱い攻防が生まれる。戦闘では剣技と立ち位置、攻め際、引き際などを見極めて戦い、スキル制ゲームのように回避不能なダメージを受け、理不尽に死を迎えるような事もない。すべては君の技術にかかっている！

・自由に建築可能なプレイヤーの砦
Naveの世界では自由にプレイヤーシティを建築可能。そこには城壁や商人、生産器具、農場、ブリーディング場などを配置でき、プレイヤはそこで生活する事が可能。ギルドメンバーと協力して砦を守りぬけ！

・斬新なクラフターシステム
定番の武器職人、鎧職人、アルケミスト、弓職人など様々な生産スキルが存在し、全てのアイテムは動物からとれる素材や鉱石から性能が決定する。例えば振りは速いがダメージが低い、ダメージはあるが振りが遅い武器など、プレイヤの用途に応じた様々な武器が生成可能。最高のレシピを自ら探しだせ！また生産したアイテムに自由に名前をつける事が可能。

・交配システム
馬などの動物は交配が可能。交配により様々な動物を生み出せる。交配した動物を売ってブリーダーとして生活も可能。自分だけの最強の動物を作り出せ！

・ギルド戦争システム
ギルド間では戦争が可能。戦争中は町の中でもガードを無視して相手ギルドと戦闘ができる。相手ギルドの砦を壊したりも可能。倒した相手からはもちろんアイテムを奪うことが可能。

以上、システム的にもこれほど色々できるMMORPGゲームは他にないのだが、全てはプレイヤ任せ、プレイヤの同意無しに殺され全てのアイテムを奪われるなどネガティブな面もあり、いまいち知名度が少ないゲーム。しかしながらポテンシャルのある商品であり筆者は１年以上プレイしておりハマっている。

既存のMMORPGに飽きた方におすすめ。Free to playだし、一度プレイしてみては？ 人は少ないけど日本人コミュニティもあるよ。",1441183369,1441225293,True,17,5,0.654547393321990967,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Politica entre jugadores genial y muy interesante, crafting muy bueno con miles de variaciones, combate apasionante y has de tener manos manos, aunque sea full pvp full loot no tardas nada en volver a equiparte y salir a matar jeje, comercio excepcional, obtención de recursos... me encanta jeje estuve mucho tiempo ganandome la vida vendiendo recursos, refinandolos, etc. Ahhh exploración!!

You won't be trying to skill up your character for long. It only takes a few days to reach maximum potential. So you'll always be able to help your guild out of even if you want to be a solo rogue who lives off loot. The limits of this game is based on the skills you have. This is no point and click type game. It's a game which actually takes skill, not as in skillpoints or levels, but actual know how of the game. It's great actually feeling equal to the opposing force even if you are out numbered. This game is not quantity over quality like every other MMO you play now-a-days. It's more of the quality of the player. PVE doesn't feel like a grind. PVE is actually something trivial.
 Overall, this game doesn't lack complexity. Actually not having to worry about catching up to the best in your guild is no issue. You can actually take part in the big wars within an hour or two of gameplay rather than playing for months in order to be the best. I'd give this game an 8/10

Pros:

Has some cool idea that I had really wanted to check out.
Guild run territories
housing
a lot of freedome
varied skills

Cons:

Gameplay feels sluggish and dated
Total pay-to-win
Skills cannot be increased past 60 on a free account
sub based
Many areas are over-camped by higher level players killing off new characters (with what I read in chat)
Older Graphics

Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game until the sub-based premium is dropped and they adopt a GW2 style payment method. 

Increase in area size for the tutorial zones would help alleviate the horde of players swinging like freaks at the same 2 pigs. 

Finally the graphics could be overlooked but the game still feels sluggish.

So it has potential but the starter zone was full of people killing the same 2-3 pigs that actually spawned. After mentioning in ""help chat"" that i wasn't sure i was keen on the pay-to-win model, i get lagged out. Check the forums to find i've been IP banned. So that was neat.

The usual out-of-the-gate hiccups for an unprepared development/server management team are prevalent.  Likely 2-3 weeks before stability issues are resolved - an average estimate for this increasingly common problem with games nowadays.  Early Access, I can understand, but this game has been available for some time even prior to the Steam Release

In its current state:

Pros:

1) Some veteran players are genuinely helpful (kudos to those who are answering the seemingly endless requests for help on the very first newbie quest.)  Admittedly, it took me a few minutes to figure out what to do, This is one game where reading the quest text as it is given is crucial.

2) Decent graphics.  Unreal Engine always offers a good bang for the buck in graphics capabilities.

3) Free to Play - although, skill levels are capped at 60 (out of 100) and there are skills that are not accessible to F2P players (Thievery)

Cons:

1) Getting connected successfully is (at best) random; might be better late at night when player base decreases

2) Widespread reports on logging out, then attempting to login only to receive a message stating ""you are already logged in""; research on the game's forums indicate this issue only goes away after a server restart - lovely

3) Murdering is pretty rampant - higher level players are genuinely bored enough to travel all the way to the cities where the new influx of players are spawing just to kill low level characters just outside the city limits (that's actually a pretty good indication of how boring end-game must be, as there's absolutely no material benefit in doing this other than to just be a PK'er)

4) Latency issues; again, indicative of poor initial scalability on the server-end of things, but will iron itself out over time (in the short term, because of player loss; new players are very likely to lose interest from not being able to advance their characters without getting murdered constantly by high level players)

I will update this review once I re-test after a couple of weeks to see if the server issues have been ironed out.  If you want to check it out to see for youself, go for it.  It has some interesting concepts.  There's no way I'd recommend it right now - there's some things they need to get under control fast before this influx of Steam players makes their decision on whether or not to invest time (and perhaps a subscription) to this game.

One of the great things is the customer relation with the few devs that work on this game, I think you can count them on one hand. Its an Open world Sandbox with Full Loot, Indepth crafting systems, Awesome Teritory Control system (building houses and empires and stuff). My personal Favorite thing, is you can be whatever you want to be. So when you come and play, remember the shadows are always watching.

This game does have bugs, this game is not perfect, it's an indie game with a limited crew, but they work really really hard. The newest dev Jonas, has brought with him an increase in the communication, and effectiveness of each and every patch, So if you come on the forums make sure to say hi to him if you see him.

In game staff is very helpful thats a bonus too.

So if you want a game where you can do and be just about any thing you want to be, give mortal a try 

I've enjoyed the game for almost three years now, and even though i have left multiple times, i always find a reason and a want to return and keep playing, theres not really any other MMORPG full loot Sandbox games that bring it together like mortal does.

The combat is really nice and the crafting is very unique.
I like the idea of no classes or level to push players to get better by loot.

My first impression was already great because of the caracter creation menu.

I'm a Libertarian, so don't get me started on the fact that I bought a game on Steam and now I have to create an account with my phone number and address on it, and they are required. You don't need that. This is 2015. The glory of Steam is to buy a game and play it, not jump through hoops (and scary ones at that). These guys can't even get their email or server systems working, you mean to tell me I don't have to worry about a hack when they want all my personal information?

Took 12 hours to get verified to play their game via email. To their credit, they finally fixed it, however, today it took an hour to get on the server and once I finally created a character, it kicked me and said it would be another 15 minutes.

I will update my review once I can actually play the game, but right now the review is based on technical issues because you CAN'T play the game.

I understand a metric @*%@$ ton of people are playing right now, but if the servers weren't ready for Stream or that kind of load, it shouldn't have been released yet. And I can say that, because I actually DO work in the gaming industry on shipped titles.

Thus far, this has been my experience:

1. Can't get email verified
2. Verified 12 hours later
3. Can't log in for an hour
4. Finally am told server will be up in 15 minutes
5. 17 minutes later server still doesn't want to let people on
6. Finally get on, create a character
7. Server crashes
8. Get back on get a quest
9. Turn in Quest
10. Server crashes

Graphics may seem dated to some. 
Still a few bugs but the devs are working through these

Other thoughts
The free to play can be misleading. Its more like a free trial as skills are capped. It's definatly a subscription game. IT'S not pay to WIN. It's just in order to have full access to skills you will need sub


I say, try the game. I did at launch and hated. I played again a week ago and fell in love. It reminds me of so many of my favorite games of the past, EQ1, SWG to name a couple.

now if you whant to not get your head shoved up your butt when you leave the starter place you are yellow for a hour use that hour to run out of tindrem and vind a other town there is much less people that will do that just dont try and fight any thing out side of the gate with that sword of yours that you dont know it will rip you a new one if you do

$15.00/month.....

WAY TOO MUCH. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. W

Wurm Online is much more worth it than this game. Much more fun, very friendly community(pve) and it's ""subscription"" can easily be paid for through in-game trading. People are very willing to give up $30 for a huge shipment of bricks in Wurm. 

I could not believe how unorganized and trashy the game felt. The devs are working in Social Communications....helping new players with stupid questions and keeping people ""in check""  This is something they could of easily avoided, if they had more servers and better tutorials. There are NO NORTH AMERICAN servers at all right now. 

the mechanics are anything but flawless, combat is strictly based on a person's connection to the server...... flat out bullshit if you ask me. 


To those who love this game, I say...enjoy wasting money on this.

It's attracting a lot of US players.  But all I see so far is them saying they hate it. So.....

I have played Mortal for several years before Steam release so ignore my low hours played, it's more like a few hundred or more. Subscribing to this game is worth every penny!

What about Mortal do I love? Why you might like this game!

-Forced first person skill based MMO (When you swing you can hit the arms, legs, head etc.) Combat is not simple like most other games, there is no aim assist or TAB and button mash. A skilled player with less player attributes and worse gear can truly destroy a lesser skilled player with better attributes and gear.

-Sandbox. There IS a brief intro quest and that's it. You are free to explore, hunt, craft, learn. You are not bound by a quest system. There is no need to grind quests.

-The crafting! Never have I seen a game with more in depth crafting. You don't just go out and find iron, bring it to a bench and craft a weapon. You must go mine rocks, (they are everywhere) bring them to an extractor (crusher etc) which gives some basic parts, burn them in a forge, and refine them with other parts, this is the most realistic type of crafting I have seen in a game, ever. I could go on and on about the complexity and how rewarding it is but you get what I'm saying hopefully.

-FULL LOOT and NOWHERE IS SAFE! This is awesome. Are you the ""good"" guy that strives to kill only red (murderer) players and defend the peace? Are you a ""bad"" guy that wishes to kill everyone they see and take what they have on them? Either way this game caters to it. Yea there are blue cities that the guards kill red players but even so anyone can attack, they will turn grey and the guards may kill them but it's not truly safe even in the big cities.

In a nutshell, I love this game.  It's not going to hold your hand, it will test your patience at times. The rewards are great, nothing beats that feeling of knowing you could die, but you made a long trek to the next city with your valuables, ETC. 

The game is not perfect, but for an indie development team they have made a hidden gem of a game. They are not going away and they are always improving the game.

After Mortal Online, other games feel tame and useless. (Other games have little or no penalty for death and therefore are not rewarding to me).

Thumbs up if this review was helpful.",1441120743,1441120743,True,17,0,0.549351871013641357,1,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a game full of unlimited potential, from its elder scrolls-esque combat system to its open world.  Unfortunately, after years of playing, I found myself constantly waiting for it to meet that potential.  From constant bugs, terrible combat balancing, to staff corruption, it is one thing after another with this train-wreck of a game.  

First things first, the CEO, Henrik Nystrom has no clue what goes on in his own game.  Having dealt with the guy in regards to the testing of new mechanics and game bugs, he is clueless.  There are mechanics in the game from years ago that do not work and he still has no idea whether or not they do, requiring him to hear such feedback from the playerbase and sometimes getting quite indignant when faced with the problems of his game resorting to calling those who bring them up trolls even if the feedback is provided in a respectful manner.  When assisting on the test team, he would blatantly ignore feedback regarding bugs, pvp mechanics, etc and simply to whatever he liked.  He does give the appearance of interacting with the community, though this isn't hard when they remove any type of criticism from the public view.  

He is also blind to the corruption of the game, allowing players (of low moral character) to perform GM duties for his game.  One of the previous counselors is actually well known for monetarily scamming money from other players multiple times via various schemes.  This player-based GM system ends up being a major issue in a full-loot game where assets and the element of surprise actually matter.  GMs scout locations for other players, spawn demons and other monsters on top of other players in an attempt to soften them up for their personal friends and major game decisions in terms of cheating, hacking, etc are made by players who have and hold obvious bias.  This is greatly apparent after the donation system where some of the largest backers have experienced some of the greatest success by having relics (items that provide guild specific buffs) dropped in their backyard the day after losing them to other guilds.  I've also seen players with high donations who were banned from their forums for breaking the rules immediately unbanned afterward.  It is pretty safe to say this occurs in game as well.  

But that aside, let us get to the game.  The game's graphics look like something from 2010.  Textures are recycled unreal engine 3 type fluff.  It was excusable for a time, but not for a game attempting to make it big on steam.  I'd give them a six out of ten as the game can look beautiful at times, lighting-wise, but any close look is a mess.  It isn't unheard of to get stuck in the mesh as the whole thing is a mess and you can get stuck on something in the middle of a fight and end up losing the equipment you worked hard to get.  Thankfully, they did some work a year or so ago and this improved it in some areas, but made it worst in others.  UI is your typical fare and is reminiscent of an elder scrolls game/clone.  

I won't even go into mechanics deeply as it is a very touchy subject.  The game favors large numbers and zergs as they call it.  There was a long period when skill mattered and it was possible to consistently go against the odds, but those days are gone after large donators constantly complained as well as week old players.  If you play now, then combat is simple enough with directional swings and blocks, but you're best finding a guild with a decent amount of players as you'll just end up getting zerged.  If you have grand aspirations as a new group, be prepared to merge or ally into another as that seems to be the norm for newer players.  Once again, this is a full-loot pvp game.  

Murder system is iffy.  Five kills and you turn red which means you can't go into a town.  Some feel that is harsh, some feel it isn't harsh enough.  You burn murder counts every 8 hours.  Get under 5 and you're back to blue.  Taken from another review to give you a newer player's idea of the game, ""A thief can steal from you and if you attack him he is able to kill you without getting a murder score.  There are some people on this game with over 1000 murders that have been free from murder score and they walk around in the cities all day.  This is hardly justice at all and any new player will see this as a troll game and quit once educated to this process.""  Take from that what you will.  

The community...Well this game features one of the most toxic and destructive communities that I've ever seen.  It is very small and includes those who would lie, cheat, and blackmail using out of game information.  Many will grief you, attempt to badtalk or insult you or even accuse you of cheating while having a recorded history of using cheatengine within the game.  Of course these players still play, which brings me to another point; bans.  Bans do not matter in this game, players who have used cheatengine, players who have duped items/gold, and players who lagswitch still play this game.  They may get caught and receive a short ban, but you usually see them again, typically after making hefty donations.  Some just because they have close associations with the higher ups.  Very sad state of affairs.  Most of these guys are so nasty, I'm sure I will be attacked by name in their reviews for posting mine.  This is the worst part of mortal online.  If you're prepared for all of this then enjoy.  

The game is worth a try, but I just can't recommend it.  Even worst, these players, most of who I know, agree that they hate this game, and that if a decent replacement released, they would leave in a minute, but due to some weird stockholm syndrome type deal, they just keep putting up with it.

Quick update for those attacking me in the comments (which I expected).  This game has been out for years (standalone) before being released to steam, this is why my playtime is so low.

UPDATE - EDIT

Wow...  What a learning curve this game will have.  As a player who has played hardcore MMO's like Asheron's Call, I welcome this type of game.  The sky is the limit and there are enough time sink's for people to lose their grip on real life.  One thing I recommend if anyone is serious about playing this game, is to find a group or guild that can help you with learning the basics.  This game can feel pretty lonely if you are left to figure out yourself.  This also helps create a mystical feel to this game.  I am extremely excited to learn and grow my character.  This game DOES look good despite what people say.  Some amazing views and scenery as I have explored.

TIPS if you cannot get the game to run smoothly (this helped for me).
Open mortal online -> open settings in launcher -> take everything off epic and knock down the settings until they fit your needs...

Pros
-Amazing views/scenery
-Sounds are captivating and strike your senses when you experience new things
-Combat is exactly what I am looking for (dodging arrows, melee swings can miss if you do not do it right, can break LOS against casters.)
-Seiging/raiding
-HUGE and INTRICATE player built/owned cities/structures/territories
-Insane amount of things to put time/effort in to.  If you don't like a TON of options, this game may not be for your.
-Mounted riding!?  They did a really good job on this from what I have experienced so far.

Cons
-Overwhelming at first
-Be prepared to be killed on site!  (Found a group of 3 yesterday, I was chatting with them and checking out their armor/mounts, tell them goodbye and i'll see them around.  Next thing you know 3-4 minutes later as I travel down the beaten path, one runs up and starts swinging wildly while on his mount and kills me.)  I don't mind these encounters but some might.
-Not having a group is do-able but might not be enjoyable for most (solo players beware).
-Can easily gimp yourself depending on how you create your character (apparently this has gotten better since the last big update).
-No hand holding (some could see this as a con, not me)
-Servers have been unstable since released on steam (I expect this to be ironed out sooner than later, this is pretty normal for most MMO releases anyways).

1. You need to be social (for guilds, friends ,foes etc.)
2. If u are a ragequitter, this game is NOT for you. 
You will die, you will lose stuff. But you will also kill and loot from others.

3. It has a steep learning curve. But dont let that fear you, give it some time and you will get it. 
4. Start by seeking up someone to play with from the beginning.

Bisher das langweiligste Spiel, dass es auf meine Festplatte geschafft hat. Der Start ist so unfassbar zäh, langweilig und pure Zeitververschwendung, dass ich es gar nicht einordnen kann. Zuvor hatte ich viel darüber gelesen, welche Gefahren auf einen Neuling warten. Playerkills, Itemdiebstahl etc. Nichts dergleichen ist passiert und auch sonst nix. Die meiste Zeit geht man von A nach B. Dabei hat man das Gefühl einen Rollator mit drei anderen Omas vor sich herzuschieben. Man bewegt sich laaaaaangsam. Und selbst das Sprinten ist nur wenig weniger laaaangsam. Das Aufregendste war ein Schwein zu töten. Das sich nicht wehrt... *Gähn* Nach dem Tutorial wurde ich nochmals vor den schlimmen Gefahren gewarnt und danach bin ich *laaaangsaaam* durch die Stadt geschlichen auf der Suche nach Abenteuern und Aufregung. Gefunden habe ich leere Straßen, leere Straßen, einen eingefrorenen Angler und keine Möglichkeit diese Stadt wieder zu verlassen. Dazu einen Sound, der irgendwie nach leerer Lagerhalle klingt, nur das leise Radio der einsamen Putzfrau im Ohr... Meine Klassenwahl fiel auf den Tamer, der allerdings bereits zu schwach ist, um wenigstens einen Hund zu zähmen. Soll mein erstes Pet ein Kaninchen sein und weitere Schweine anfallen? 

Fazit: Mortale Langeweile und Entschleunigung pur. Wem Angelsimulationen und Landwirtschaftsimulatoren zu nervenaufreibend sind, sollte sofort hier anfangen.",1441115544,1441115591,False,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A game with no rails to guide you. No world-saving/destroying/modifying plot to spur you on to the next set of increasingly harder goals to clear. 

An interesting concept that falls flat pretty much right out the gate. The tutorial section is a poorly designed mess. Reading and following the instructions scratches at a surface that promises fascinating depths, but penetrating the UI to find the specific thing you're looking for is an exercise in frustration. 

Learning new skills requires your character reading a book... the very first book I got had an 18 hour timer, and the act of standing there, watching that timer tick down improved my skill in 'reading' and after half an hour brought it down to fifteen hours. Whoop-dee-doo. 

I'm never one to rail on a game's graphics, for their own sake. But as dated as this game looks, it should at least boast a more stable frame rate. Instead, I had to tone the options down, and get used to the idea that ""playable"" would have to suffice. 

Finally, wandering the lands on a quest to do whatever thing you wanted to go set out to do might have been enjoyable... if you could move at a speed other than ""shamble"".

무슨 말인가 하면 이 게임은 17년전 나온 게임보다 게임성이 비교불가능 할 만큼 썩어 빠졌고 그래픽은 인류의 발전을 똥구멍으로 거슬러 쳐먹은듯한 수준이며 인터페이스는 조악하고 편의성과 직관성 따윈 개나 줘버리라고 자신있게 외치는듯한 형태로 구성되어있다. 특히나 전체적인 시스템은 멍청하고 게임은 지루한데다가 아무짝에도 쓸모없는 불편함을 강요하고있기 까지 하다.

상인과 아이템을 거래하는 과정을 예로들자면 물건을 고르고 구매버튼을 누르면 거래가 이루어지는게 아니라 내가 구매한 물건의 값을 지불하기위해 자신의 아이템 창을 열어서 그에 맞는 금액을 거래창에다 올려놓고 오케이를 눌러도 동일한 물건을 한번에 2개 이상 못 구매한다는 에러 메시지를 보게한다는 뜻이다.

게다가 가장 중요한 MMO 적인 요소는 거의 제로에 불과하며 양키들조차 제일 첫 튜토리얼인 돼지잡고 가죽 벗기는걸 하지못해서 이리저리 헤맨덕분에 수많은 병신들이 똑같은 내용의 질문들을 반복적으로 올리고있고 이 때문에 똑같은 내용을 끊임없이 반복해서 대답해주는 친절하고 불쌍한 플레이어들의 help 메시지가 모든 채팅창을 가득 메우고 있을 뿐이다.

Yes, I know the game kinda has a high system requirerment but that shouldn't know you from trying. If you really wanna get a feel for the game you need to first find a guild that has played for a while to help you get a better grip of the game. This is a sandbox type of game so there is no sense of direction cause you make your own quests and adventures. There are bugs but if you can get around it, It is a great game with awesome potential to be the best game. They are little to no games like mortal cause it is a First person only MMO that takes skill to get anywhere. People who are sub have an advantage but I have seen F2P that have beat pay to plays to the ground cause they have more skill than others. It has good graphics and amazing places if you step out of town you can find, For example the sator dungeoun or Mino, demon circle and risar dungeoun it is all one of a kind. The small dev team has done an outstanding job at this game.
So Remember or things to know:
-Find a guild to get a good stand point from the game and get expereince to build your own guild one day.
-There are grifers at all towns so don't be discouraged if you do get ganked, Its mortal guys xD
-Grind is hard but satisfactory when you reach your goal.
-Everyday will always be new.
-Last is a hardcore full loot PvP open game, You can be killed anywhere and I mean anywhere.

Now when you start there will be deaths and griefers will hunt you mercilessly at the starting towns because they find ruining your experience amusing.

UPDATE:  I loved this game and put thousands of hours into it before it was ever on steam but I have to say at this point just stay away.  The community is toxic, it's turned into one clan running over anyone who tries to do something productive.  Star Vault itself caters to the complainers and drastically shifts the game for no apparent reason.  Constantly making whatever you are working towards obsolete.  Their customer support is horrible and their security even worse.  On June 17th, 2018, the entire game was hacked and every single account was compromised.  If this was first or second time this happened but major hacks have occurred on multiple occasions and they obviously don't care as they continue to happen. 

Save yourself the heartache and just pass on this game.  I feel cheated out of my time and this game ruined MMO's for me.

[list]
[*]+ Completely Open World (you can explore everything in the game)
[*]+ High level of customization (construct your own house, high resolution character skins, seasonal gear, etc.)
[*]+ First-person action combat (you get up close and personal in most of your fights)
[*]+ Skill and attributes system (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Health, Mana, Stamina, Movement, etc.)
[*]+ Nudity, gore and brutality...Oh My!!! (Expect to see boobies and dongs, Yes, yes there is a lot of blood, there are cannibalistic instances in the game, your flesh can be used to craft clothes and if you're a well-known player then you might see your head forsale on the forums)

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]- Slow progression (everything in the game is super slow unless you have a Premium Account or are a Donator)
[*]- Players can loot your items (if you die from PvP you're fucked, you can loose anything in the games PvP system)
[*]- No sense of direction (the game lacks purpose unless you're in a guild, you can get lost)
[*]- Free players are capped on skills at 60 and must Walk (players that have a Premium Account get +40 to All Skills a total of 100 and can Run)
[*]- PvP is Pay to Win (it's a simple statement, if you plan to PvP you need to have a Premium Account)
[*]- Expensive Objects are Restricted (You can't loot or trade anything over 5g to a vendor unless you have a Premium Account)

The stability of the connection is mediocre it does ahve some lag sometimes but it isnt too terrible.
The graphics arent the best but they are far from the worst. 
Gameplay has a shit ton of content to learn, however it is pretty straight forward.

I'd honestly reccommend this to anyone looking for a good open-world sandbox type mmo that is F2P and Sub to master :) It is a very social oriented game imho. Enjoy!

It has everything you can build your own city and empire and go destroy someone elses.Epic battles that consist from 5v5 to 50v50(Even more with steam).Anything a person builds can be destroyed by another person.

Or you can go chill out route and focus on crafting and PvE which is possible now with brand new Continent.Anything possible to fit all playstyles.

You can be mage,warrior,Mounted combat,Mounted archer,Beastmaster,Thief and more .

The game is 100% better when you find a guild you fit in and highly recommend going to mortal online forums :http://www.mortalonline.com/forums/categories/guild-section.144/

[b]TL;DR;[/b]
I have been playing Mortal Online for over a week before it came out on Steam. The short version: If you're into MMOs, this game is definitely something you should give a go, if only for its uniqueness. It plays like an Elder Scrolls game with a feudal Eve Online twist. As objectively as I can, I'd rate this game 85/100.

[b]The Game-play[/b]
This is where Mortal Online shines.  The best Genre Tag to describe the game would be Hardcore MMO RPG. You can be killed anywhere by anyone. You'll drop everything you have on you when you die. And the best part? There is almost no hand holding for the entire experience. Mortal forces players to learn everything by trial and error. And I'm not only talking about game mechanics like how to fight or gather resources. I'm talking about things like crafting recipes and interaction with the game world. For one thing, there [i]are no crafting recipes like you would expect in other games.[/i] There is no giant icon that tells you what item you will get for what resources. Not only can you craft the same thing with different materials, but you can use different amounts of those materials. And both of those things affect the final item stats and looks. That is to say of course, if your character even has the ability to tell the quality of your craft goods... Which brings me to my next point.

[b]Character Progression[/b]
There are no set classes or character levels in Mortal Online. The experience of your character is defined by the skills that he has learned. There are several hundred skills in the game. Skills are generally graded anywhere from 0 to 100 and they're also classified as primary and secondary. Every character has a maximum of 1100 skill points to use for primary skills. Secondary skills don't cost any points. Now the skills themselves influence everything you do. Your ability to run, to fight, to block and jump. Your ability to comprehend how good some armor or sword is. What the affects of a potion are. What nutrition a food item has. How much you can carry while swimming and still not drown. What animal you can manage to keep under control. The list goes on. There are literally HUNDREDS of skills. Your character even has a skill for breathing. No joke. And you can train all of them! If you can find a combination of skills that works for you, congratulations, you have your own ""class"".

[b]World and Game Content[/b]
Mortal Online has been out and available for several years. Its only had one expansion in that time. And yet its had a consistent and solid player-base the whole time. Do you want to know why? I think one of the main reasons is because nobody has ""finished"" it. That's right. In the years that the game has been out, not one person has gone through all the content the game has to offer. That's a very refreshing thing to hear, considering [i]that other MMO that shall not be named[/i] has to keep releasing expansions every year just so its players have things to do. I can guess what you're thinking. ""Oh, its probably a horrible grind-fest"". No. Almost any one skill can be leveled to max in a day or so. The secret is that Mortal Online relies heavily on player knowledge and skill. Your own skill, not your characters. Did you ever read or watch a show about some magician or alchemist, that spends years locked away somewhere researching potent new potions that the world has never seen? Well, now is your chance to do exactly that. And please please, if you figure out how to get mana potions that don't kill the mages, I'll pay you everything I own for the recipe.

[b]The negatives[/b]
[list]
[*] Outdated payment method. The game runs on an ""forever trial"" with a possible monthly subscription fee. F2P is only good to check the game out. The limitation is that skills are capped at 60 instead of 100. This is a [b]huge[/b] limitation. You hit the ceiling after about a single day, and this prevents you from playing the game competitively. Otherwise, you are completely free to see and do anything you want. Skills caps don't stop you from doing anything, it's just that other players will be better at it.
[*] Bugs. The game is too complex for its own good. The sheer amount of intricacy makes it near impossible to not have issues pop up here and there. Fear not, the bug report forums are quite active and the developers are, in general, responding to player issues.
[*]Steep learning curve. This is an enjoyable part of the game for me personally. There is something nostalgic about the game telling you very little and you having to figure stuff out by trial and error. However, the ""modern player"" might not see it this way, and thus the lack of things like minimaps and directional arrows on the screen will be seen as a negative for people.
[*]Slightly dated graphics. Once again, this is only from the perspective of your average current day player. Many people don't realize that when you can literally [i]look around for miles[/i], you can't expect to have photo realism. Having said that, the game doesn't look ugly. Its retro. Embrace it.
[/list]

Not to finish on a low note, I'd just like to make it perfectly clear for everyone: given the chance, Mortal Online will raise your bar for all MMO's you play after it. It's completely unsurprising that there are people who haven't played anything else since.

Супер песочница. Убивай людей, грабь караваны. Игра под лозунгом - воруй убивай. Кроме ПВП контента в последних патчах было добавленно море ПВЕ контента. Пещеры, пустыни, джунгли.

Если бы каждая игра была бы рыцарем и герб на щите, который этот благородный воин понесет в бой, отражал бы ее сущность, то на щите Мортала Онлайн яркими огненными росчерками выгравировался герб дома багов. Багов, с большой буквы. Могу вас уверить, что не было бы более преданного, честного и самоотверженного подданного этого дома, чем Мортал. Мортал это квинтэссенция бага, чистая незамутненная энергия говнокодинга и разгильдяйства. В Мортале забагано абсолютно все, начиная от интерфейса и кончая балансом.

Поговорим о багах:  
NPC персонажи.  Забаганы от и до. Как союзные NPC, так и агрессивные. Если в больших городах они ведут себя более-менее вменяемо, то в других местах у них могут меняться точки спауна, они зацикливаются, пропадают, проваливаются, улетают в потолки, ходят сквозь вас.  К примеру, не удивляйтесь, если вас атакует невидимый моб, скрывающийся под текстурами земли. Разработчики уже, который год не могут, настроить интеллект NPC, в результате бой с агрессивным мобом превращается в пляску со скачущем по кругу  противником, который периодически, то заходит в вас, то проваливается под землю.

Сразу говорю я фанат MO и этот обзор не является объективным.

Про все особенности вы можете узнать в официальном описании и других рецензиях и обзорах, я же расскажу как реально обстоят дела с моей конечно же точки зрения.
Во-первых вам нужно осознать, что игра имеет очень высокий порог вхождения и после того как вы насмотрелись трейлеров, скачали клиент и с трепетом запускаете игру, уже готовитесь отправиться в путешетвие по этому открытому и свободному миру, при запуске вы будете Г...думали Героем? Нет! Вы будете Гavnom! Вы появляетесь в совершенно диком и жестоком мире, в котором на вас всем nasratь. Дальше калитки нубского сада тебя никто не поведет, тут нет практически подсказок, нормального введения в игру, интерфейс очень грубо сделан, где что посмотреть не понятно, есть хелп чат, но и им можно пользоваться только 48 часов, затем он пропадает, да да, в игре нет глобал или трейд чата и всех подобных удобств из других ммо, здесь даже нет карты! Есть только компас и твоя башка, в которой надо запоминать места, в которых ты побывал и как туда забрался, люди просто теряются уходя за ворота в непонятной глуши и там же подыхают! Ты не знаешь, что где купить, как туда добраться, привыкай! С тобой тут никто не будет нянчиться, а вот снести тебе башку за милую душу! Тебя не спросят есть ли у тебя золото для оплаты чего-либо, его просто заберут с твоего трупа или украдут когда будешь разглядывать достопримечательности. После смерти тебе нужно будет добраться до священника, который тебя воскресит, при чем их бывает не так просто найти и ты, не зная карты, будешь блуждать во мраке часами, очнувшись в новом теле, тебе захочется жрать, но у тебя нет ни крошки в инвентаре, кроме дефолтного меча, на тебе не будет ничего и ты голожопый нуб бегающий по лесу начнешь понимать, что ты попал в ад! Многие на этом этапе и бросают игру. Но вот те кто так просто не сдаются, начинают заниматься мазахизмом, прежде чем вы сможете хоть кому-нибудь дать сдачи, даже самой захудалой дворняге или бомжу вроде вас, не говоря уже о прокачанных игроках в плейтовых доспехах и на бронированных булхорсах наперевес, вы умрете десятки раз и все потеряете. Вас будут убивать, насиловать, грабить, оскорблять, заставлять вас нюхать задницу в режиме мёрси, когда вы в полуживом состоянии стоите на коленях перед побившим вас. Вы будете ругаться на интерфейс и кучи багов, страшную графику и анимацию, но все продолжать разбираться, когда вы начнете понимать, что это просто ужас какой то, за которой вам еще предлагают заплатить, тут отсеивается вторая волна игроков. После нескольких месяцев игры отсеиваются еще люди, которые наивно посчитали, что будут грабить кОрОваны и строить империи как только прокачают персонажа и оплатят подписку. Но вот те единицы, которые все же остаются в МО несмотря ни на что ощущают всю грандиозность, хардкорность и свободу, которую предлагает игра, эти ребята из мазохистской части игры переходят в садистскую. Начинают десятками вырезать несчастных нубов, при этом издавая дьявольский смех, начинают развязывать межклановые войны, вплоть до тотальных, в них просыпаются амбиции, которые готовы нисвергнуть самих богов и залезть в красный топ PKшеров (player killers). Уахахаххаха!!! Мне нужны еще головы маленьких детей!!! 

P.S. Фух...вообщем ребята не упускайте свой шанс, такого больше не предлагает, ни один проект на просторах интернета, даже ЕВА тут рядом не стояла, только великая Ультима может пойти в сравнение, но она уже технически совсем мертва. Игра настолько уникальна и специфична, что даже в таком убогом виде и низком техническом состоянии, стоит затраченных на нее часов и денег.

The PvP is aim-based and even tho gear plays its part, a skilled veteran will outplay a group of beginners, not because of superior gear or higher level, but from pure skill.

I love how there are no levels or classes. You choose what skills to learn by actually doing them or by reading books and you can choose between hundreds of skills to build a unique character.

The crafting system is absolutly huge. You can combine almost any weaponhead on any handletype and craft it out of any material you find. Players constantly discover new weapons and armors to counter whatever is the currently most popular gear. You just might find a way to craft a better armor or weapon then anyone else has found yet.

The Full loot aspect can be frustrating if you die transporting valuables, but that means you can also find good loot from killing other players. As a veteran player I have learned a few tricks to stay safe when I want to.

Mortal Online is by far the best MMO Ive ever played and I recommend it to everyone. Just remember that its a hardcore game and you will need to stay on your toes every second of it.

This is an 8/10 game. If you liked Ultima Online before trammel, if you like Eve Online,  and if you like and could handle darktide Ac, then you will love this game.  

It is an old school mmo, which I have missed so much. Actions have consequences, death hurts, player politics impacts the world and you! You can be more or less anything you want, BUT you cannot be everything you want. You must choose what paths to follow. You want to be a great swordsmen? You can do that, you want to be a master smith? Sure thing, but you wont be both on the same character.

The game offers tons of freedom, and with such there will be childish griefers that camp the noob spawns and pick the pockets of the unaware in main cities etc, but the freedom to do so is what makes this great. You can be a total tool, OR you can walk a more noble path and help defend the innocent from the griefers of the land. Join a guild or form one, build a house, or a tower, or a town. Change the face of Nave!... yes you can do this if you work at it.

I have now been playing for several weeks and as a mmo vet of most that have been released, I find this game so refreshing.

Why then is it not a 10?..... Bugs. The game is still not 100%. There are mesh holes across the map. Getting stuck or losing a pet into such is not uncommon, though the gms are quick and helpful in fixing this. Pathing issuse occur, some of the features are not fully enabled ( like dynamic weather).   There is also a painful lack of knowledge available where I feel it should be readily available. Guild interactions, wars, Housing placement etc are all far more difficult than they should be. 

I also think the newb experience is very painful. Enough so that it likely scares off a lot more than it should. Players are given a short grace period of peace, but they often find themselves targets as soon as this runs out. They are given the impression that THIS is the game, and sadly quit before they can get out into the world and realize what a wealth of adventure awaits them.

These issues aside it is a fantastic game with enormous potential. If you are new, Stick with it!  Start in Tindrem as advised, it is a safer city.. and DO not let the morons that seek to scare you away suceed.
Learn what you can, bank often, and seek friends. There are many villains out there but there are also tons of very nice and helpful players.

Last thing. I was shocked and pleased to find out that there is a very decent role-play community out there. Good luck all and have fun!

All the best gear and items are player-crafted, resulting in a player-run economy. The Crafting is incredibly dynamic, with countless options. The world is harsh and unforgiving, where you always need to watch your back, and any other player coming across you could be your doom...

No other game has scratched the itch that Mortal does, and I'm glad to see it finally release on Steam. 

The free-trial is never ending, so if you'd like to get a taste of the game, download and try it!

Since i found Mortal Online i havent realy played any other Online games, maybe tryed them out for a bit but nothing held my attention as long as this game.

What is Mortal Online?
its an mmorpg full loot true real open world sandbox game. you can do whatever you want. you have no classes you make your own class with the skill points that are provided. 
think of it as Ultima Online but in 3d (Henrik the CEO is acctualy a real fan of Ultima Online and you will see alot of similarities towrds Ultima Online)

you are nowhere safe even in town with guards its possible if your smart to kill you, or yes steal stuff from people what they have in there inventory. you got free house placement in the world. no instances just one huge world!!!!

this is not your typical theme-world game where you point click bash your keyboard and hit nrs to win. your skill truly matters, you need to block, and acctualy hit the person with your weapon. 

so kinda like skyrim if ultima online doesnt ring a bell.

i want to point out they are a indie company, so it does have bugs but trust me since iv played it alot of people who might have quiet came back because there is truly no other game out there like this. 

another thing is please do not say its pay to win, this is a game where you have to have an subscription, but it gives you the option to TRY THE GAME OUT FOR FREE FOR AN UNLIMITED TIME!!!!! 

you are a bit restricted when it comes to skilling your toon so instead getting 100 in a skill you can only get 60, while once your pay to play it will go up to 100. if you decide to take a break its no problem, once you resub all your skills go back to 100. 

if you want a true skill game where you can do whatever you want, acctualy aim and fight like in skyrim and dont mind full loot (whatever you have on you when the person kills you its theres) than this is the game for you.

i also want to point out to people who might think ehhhhhhhhh what?!!! i will loose everything i have one me?!!!!?!? nooooooo, never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

stuff to get in this game is not as hard like in other games for example World of Warcraft where you have to grind hrs just to get 1 certain armor part. once you have your gold its no big deal if you loose stuff, just remember take with you only what you need.

its really a game you havent seen before try it!!!!",1441078800,1441078800,True,25,1,0.522752463817596436,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Mortal Online is a sandbox MMO that requires a subscription fee, it's hardly F2P as you only have a trial account basically. This game allows for a lot of actions, and is great for people heavy into roleplaying.

The type of MMO that this game is, has HUGE pros, and HUGE cons because of it. I have to say just try the game yourself with the trial account for a few weeks and then decide, because this game is a love or hate thing, I highly doubt many people will be in the middleground on that.

The only real complaint I have, beyond small things, that is not really to do with the game desing and such- is the graphics are incredibly outdated. This can really mess with immersion for me personally. While the nostalgia value is great, having it rain indoors because ceilings don't stop rain, or your head clipping through your body, or objects being so pixelated you cannot tell what they are, these things can be distracting.

All that being said, give it a try and decide for yourself.

Used mostly to gain popularity, most people don't really understand what true freedom is in a sandbox game. Mortal Online is one of the few examples of what a Sandbox is suppose to be.

-The Entire Economy is player based. Everything in the game, is run by the players, from the crafting of armor, to the price of cotton, the player determines everything. It is a rare concept in a video game, as, if players so chose, they could easily ruin the entire game economy, but Mortal Online throws caution to the wind and allows players to run the entire economy alone. This has been an amazing feature in the game, and has developed entire proffessions and guilds in the game, dedicated to selling and crafting items to keep the economy solid. There is even a player owned bank in the game that manages players money in return for them being able to use that money on ""Credit"".

-Towns are local. Be scared, if you go to Tindrem, the games largest town, and wish to trasnsport your items to another town...you are dead out of luck with the mailbox. The mailbox/postman only sends the mail to other players inside the SAME town. This is a unique feature as it forces players who wish to trade to actively grab the items they want to trade, and transport them to the town of their choice.

-Full Loot...Yes, that's right, the entire game is open world, hardcore, PvP with full loot. That transporter bring items from Tindrem to the next town is fair game to kill and take everything he owns...however, all of your gear and items/hardwork are also at stake.

Unique Game Features:
-Housing
-Fishing
-Pet Taming
-Mounted Combat
-Full Loot
-Free Placement Housing
-Keeps
-City Building
-Largest Crafting System in any game to date
-Friendly Community (After you dig past the handful of true scum)
-Realism
-Religion
-Player Driven Economy
-90% of in-game items are player crafted
-First Person Warfare

Cons (Yeah, I'm not all gung ho for the game):

-Bugs...Not even game breaking bugs, just silly things every once in a while. Nothing that crashes my game/pc...but floating plants every once in a while...
-Agressive PvP (Players will openly hunt down weaker players for fun)
-Long Term Community Memory (The community will remember the bad actions you took for years to come)
-Lacking City Protection (Guards will do a piss poor job of protecting you, hire/ask players to assist/protect you)
-Sudden Skill Curves (PvP and high tier PvE require advanced teamwork and large amounts of game knowledge, compared to other game features that simply require you have common sense.)
-Griefing...The game has serious griefing issues, and, although it is a small ammount of the community that does indeed grief (around .2%), it is very noticible as they stalk around the starter cities and are relentless in their tactics.

All and all, it is a wonderful game, however, the cons are very restrictive to the player base.",1441076702,1500551272,False,0,0,0.499837338924407959,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Of a politican, traveling town to town ushering people to join guilds, making friends, mending fences or breaking them.
Of a craftsmen, hammering down and creating your very own unique recipes for armor and weapons.
Of a warrior, slaying countless monsters, or people. Defend the weak, or destroy them.
Of a wildsmen, living the land and taming all sorts of wild creatures to accompany you, or to sell.
Of a mage, sending arcs of electricity and balls of flame into your enemies, or healing wounded allies.
Of a chef, a sparse profession, sweating as you struggle to find the perfect amount of salt to season your 14 part dish.
Of a dominator, using magic and intimidation to force great, great beasts under your control.
Of a glassblower, making vials to sell.
Of an alchemist, concocting potions to heal, or kill. Become renown for your potency, or keep humble.
Of a racist human woman who robs and kills all non-humans.
Of a thick, righteous half-breed who protects their home at all costs, otherwise docile.
Of a maniac axe murderer, unable to resist killing all they meet.

Of... just about anything or anyone you can imagine! Create your own builds, take some skills from different tree's and blend, suit your character to your own playstyle, whatever that may be.

If you're content playing alone, you can kill hours on this game, doing your own modest thing.
If you're into grouping up and having fun, you can kill days on this game with a nice guild.
If you're into politics, drama and war, you can kill months on this game with a big guild.

This game has something for everyone.

TL;DR:
Give the game an hour or two to hook you and adjust you to the small bugs and imperfections, and you'll never need another game again. Do what you want, when you want, however you want. I've been doing just that for three years now.

I've been playing Mortal for almost a month now, and I have to say, I'm hooked. Full loot open world HARDCORE game. Not for the feint of heart, or the easily frustrated. So far I've died to random mobs and lost all my stuff, been ganked several times and lost all my stuff, had my mount killed and lost all my stuff, and I attacked someone by accident and got owned by the guards and lost all my stuff. The only thing that's easy in this game is dying, and that's what makes it so much fun to me.  It's like that ex-girlfriend who treats you like crap, sleeps with your friends, and disappears for days, but she's always a blast to be with when she's there.

For those wanting to give it a try, I challenge you to play it for a few hours. Once you get your running skills up, and learn to ride, and get passed the gankers in the graveyards, the game is huge open world with zero safe spots. You can die at any time anywhere and it's EXCITING. Specialization is the key. Join a guild that's helpful to new players, there are vets that like helping new players out. Sure there are douchenozzles in every game, but it really feels to me like there's less of them in Mortal Online than other hardcore full loot pvp games I've played. For every one of the former there are 10 vets who will take time out to help you if you ask.

The free to play aspect of the game makes it really easy for new players to decide what to spend their skill points on with hardly any limiting factors other then effictively capping the skills at 60. Your points still go up to the 100 cap, but need to be unlocked with a subscription plan. 

The combat is feels similar to Mount & Blade to me, but with a little less reliance on being mounted all the time. The creatures are plentiful, and better still, very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. Plenty of adventures abound, and exploring is massive fun.

You are free to do whatever you want, be a thief, a crafter, a butcher, a cook, warrior, hunter, you can be whatever you want and everyone is different from the other, there is no class in this game, you choose what skills you want to level up.
You choose what you are going to do, there is no pre-made quests, people make ""quests"", someone want to buy pig carcass, then if you want, you can go kill some pigs and sell it's carcass to the player. You can put a price in someone head, YOU can do whatever you want to do, be whatever you want to be.
There is some bugs, and things like that, but you get used to some things and its nothing game breaking.
About PVP, is totally Skill based, more than any other medieval game, like chivalry or mount and blade warband. I have seen things like a naked man with only a steel sword beat an heavy armored man (then like 4 guys killed him xD). It is totally skill based, you need to defend in the right direction in the right time, you need to watch your stamina, be careful to not make some friend fire and more...
Crafting (armor, weapons, shields and bows), alchemy, gathering, mining, you will see all these thins in MO and more, in MO world every piece of information is gold, if you want to make steel you need information, if you want to make potions or something like that you need information and this information can be really expensive. All these things where discovered by players during this years of mortal online. The Devs said that there is a lot of things undiscovered yet.
And there is a lot of things that I didn't mention, like house building, base, castles, dungeons, horse breeding, taming, engineering, sieges, beast domination...

If you like to play a true Sandbox MMORPG I recommend you Mortal Online.

To me it seems to include the best from several genres:

1) It's an action game revolving around skill. In order for your character to do something, you as a player must perform an action with sufficient skill. No tab-targeting or anything of the sort. Just you, your knowledge of the game and your skills as a player.

2) It's a role-playing game. Even if you don't like RPGs, Mortal Online has a way of naturally leading you to assume a role. It could be the role of a fledgling player afraid of the seasoned murderers, or the role of the avenger who musters friends and acquaintances to deal with said murderers, or maybe even the role of the thief snooping around other people's pockets and coming up with plans to break into their homes and rob them of their hard-earned currency. From the moment that you start playing, you will also be role-playing, possibly without even realizing it.

3) It's a strategy game. While one well trained person can be a formidable opponent, the combined force of many men who have developed not only their personal fighting skills, but also a common way of conducting themselves during a battle, can be game-changing. Strength lies in numbers. Those who know this and use it to their advantage may very well become the next rulers of the land.

4) This game is about choice. You have an amazing level of freedom regarding your playstyle. You may want to become the best warrior Nave has seen. In that case, one option would be to work on your fighting skills, then work on building up a stock of quality armor and weapons, and finally join a guild renowned for its combat prowess in order to become even better at what you do. On the other hand, you may want to live in the wilderness by yourself, hunting game and exploring the vast expanses of this rich world. If that is the case, you could start by learning how to tame animals and to cook basic dishes, then riding your horse into the unknown until you find the right spot and decide to call it your home.

The game does have its drawbacks. You may feel that certain gear or attribute combinations are too powerful in certain conditions. You may feel that there are a few bugs too many. You may also feel that customer support isn't the fastest around. But you must also consider that this incredibly complex game has been hand-crafted by just a few individuals working in an indie company. You must realize that these devs are constantly browsing the game's forums, sifting through players' feedback and trying to tweak every little detail so that it can work completely as intended.

Having played this game for more than two and a half years, I'm confident that it can be a huge success, should enough people give it a chance. This will also allow the devs to continue with their planned new features and their ongoing mission to polish the player experience as much as possible.

If you value the freedom of making your own choices about every single thing in a game world, then Mortal Online is your ultimate playground. Give it a try and you won't regret it.",1441069337,1441069337,True,15,0,0.503374814987182617,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Concept is cool/interested but the way its implimented is horrible. Dubbed ""Mortal Offline"" for the first year. That should tell you something. Common to joke that its still a beta(even amoungst staff). Prices are way off balance, they charge you as if its a AAA game, when really its not great. Should charge 5$ maybe / month for sub. 

Staff- 99% volunteer, if you have a issue(like being stuck on terrian) while they're not online, you may sit stuck for 3hrs. You needed your character? Welp too bad. ""He who cries loudest gets the most help"" remember this when interacting with them. They dont have strict policies, so if you complain enough you'll get more than your neighbor.(I was a Senior high counselor trust me, I know lol). 

Bugs- Often riddled with bugs, it becomes a thing where you must know the bugs in order to try to make them impact your gameplay less. (example: logging out after war decs, thats been like that for 2 years? ) 

Issues- they sweep issues under the rug until they become a problem. Their speed has a fundemental flaw right now in the way its calculated, as do the hitboxes(hint some settings on your game/computer effect both). They wont address it until it becomes a glaring issue

devolopment- While they try hard, they often care more for what sounds good on paper, than what would meanigfully impact gameplay(lets look at the huge awakening patch that took a year and a half to come out). 

community - trolls mainly. Some gems in the rough, but in general its a lot of 'hey look how much better I am than you!' or 'Get owned' or people who religiously defend SV because they want the game to succeed. The fact is they had money, and lots of devs at one time. They just simply failed, and now are trying to patch up a sunk ship. Instead of patching holes though they sometimes paint the outside a new color to make players feel like the ship is awesome. 

Balance - horrible at balancing. They'll adjust something that is rediciously over powered/wrong a year later. Like great swords, butchery, etc. They simply dont play enough or have the game devolopment experience to properly balance things in a meaniglful way. Its like a construction worker trying to be a ballerina. 

Enforcement  - they let cheaters back in the game all the time. A guy jumped over your keep wall stole the stuff out of your house? Banned for a week. Did it again + showed some friends? Still playing, no problem. (both times with hard evidence, from the perspective of a GM, pm for link if you like). Dupers, and people who accepted obviously duped gold/matterials are still in game. A lot of the materials also are still laying around.

But also one of the games with alot of potential due to the large sandbox character and freedom presented to the people playing it. 

Lets start with the positive things. 

-The game has an large world with no instances where everyone plays together and can also block each other if he wants to. 
- The game has an extensive and very free crafting system which allows crafters to actually distuingish themselves from others by improving their crafted and extracted materials by knowing techniques and recipes other dont know and wont find out. 
- The game uses an realtime, first person combat system. You swing a sword block an enemys sword or take other actions like in an First Person Shooter game.
- Sandbox. You build, you craft, you gather and you steal whatever you can. No campaign and no level limits. If your an veteran of the game you can have yourself usable within 2 days.  Because aside from the skills learning which is very annoying sometimes. Everything else depends on you yourself. 


Now for the Cons. 

- The devs are very stubborn. Opinions from players are pretty much never listened to and they are not welcome either. So if your complaining too much you can be banned pretty fast and pretty long without even being told a reason. 
- The game has alot of bugs. Yes really alot of bugs. From floating objects to falling through the ground or getting stuck in walls which will result in your death and loss of everything you carried with no chance to get it back because support does not reinburse losses from bugs or anything else. 
- The game systems are very easy to circumvent which is not against the rules and thus allowing to kill others and plunder them within the city with the guards not taking any action as well as moving your mounts into safe positions where they cannot be attacked but still be loaded with stuff.  The game offers an list where the systems your not allowed to circumvent are listed. Anything not listed there is allowed. 
- The community is very bad. As the game has been around for several years before it was released on steam. And has done a very poor job on bugfixing and improvements. The most people which stayed are the guys who are used to use these bugs and systems to their advantage. This also leads to them not liking the idea of more people joining the game which results in new players being killed everywhere and anywhere alot. 
- Very very veeery slow patching and bugfixing. Importand patches only come around once or twice a year. And even hotifxes dont come faster than one or two months after an problem occured. Alot of bugs still accurate today have been there even in the closed beta. 
- Not playable with older computers or slow internet connections. While you may still login and play. You will notice very fast that you will lag around alot. Monsters attack you despite being miles away from you. And things you want to gather will tell you they dont exist because your position in the world is different from where your client tells you you should be. 
This can be so bad that your moved back over 1km because you hit an stone or wall somewhere on the server while you client just traveled all the way to another city. 
- Freedom comes at an price. Castles and fortifications are build all around the world. Blocking content of the game or and looking very stupid where they are standing.
- Advertised as Free to Play title. This game is an free trial. And without Premium you are useless as crafter as well as an fighter or whatever because whatever you do will be worth next to nothing. 
- Macros.... Better have some ready, they are legal in the game and the game design is laid out for their use. So if you do not use them you will be highly disadvantaged. (Pls make sure to check the list for prohibited macros first since some macros like automatic healing bots etc are NOT ALLOWED) 

My advice. Get the Game for free. Take a good look for at least 2 weeks. And only after that decide wether its worth investing money or not. Because the game looks very good at start and in videos. But once you get into the actual game and start understanding whats going on around you. The illusions fades very fast and the game becomes very annoying.",1441065325,1441065325,False,197,4,0.724728107452392578,9,False,False,False,False,,,

Mortal Online is an AMAZING Medieval Hardcore Sandbox MMORPG and will show you that not all mmorpgs are WoW-copies.  Great combat system, the greatest crafting system I have EVER seen.  A beautiful open world filled with endless adventures.  Played in first-person mode, it uses a skill-based melee combat system, block left/right/center, attack left/right/center, or use magic or bows.  If you have the attention span of an adult, you will not find a game better than this anywhere.  

Pros: Open World | Best Crafting System Ever | Taming and COUNTLESS other features that will keep you playing for very long periods of time |  Great player economy | Great Pve | Great PvP | Territory control | City/keep building | And so much more.

Cons: Typically bad community.. it's best to play this with friends because many people are assholes on this game (this is what has ruined it for me in the past). | There used to be alot of bugs in this game but they have made absolutely amazing progress in fixing the vast majority of them, however of course some still remain such as the Trade Broker being stuttery which is quite annoying to me | Steep learning curve, but if you look at sandbox survival games like Rust, alot of people enjoy that type of thing | Free to play model disadvantages free players |

What I value in a mmorpg is a combination of 'Sandbox', 'Fantasy-setting' and 'Immersion' and this game meets those demands. It is unique to me because while I'm an altoholic in most other mmorpg's I'm still currently playing the character I created during initial launch. I made a name for myself as a experienced tamer and mount breeder, selling high quality mounts (mount attributes system) and sticked with it since I enjoyed it so much.

In this game you will not become just another ""hero"" wearing the same end-game equipment as the others spamming the same skills. Instead you can become a unique personality known to others whether it's due to your unique fighting skills (think mount & blade style of combat), knowledge (guild politics, secrets and exploration) or professions (creating the highest quality potions or equipment).

Pro's:
- Open sandbox world
- Skill based combat
- Full loot (adding risk)
- Territory control (own keeps, earn taxes)
- Player housing
- First person (adds to immersion - personal opinion)
- Realistic art style
- Breeding system & Mount attributes
- Player Economy (all worthwile armor and weapons made by players)
- In-Depth Crafting systems (Armor/Weapon Crafting, Alchemy, Bowyery, etc.)

Con's:
- The (current) focus on PvP and Territory Control (which is a pro to others)
- Slow development (small dev team)
- Subscription pretty much required if you want to compete with others
- Lack of meaningful PvE
- Bugs and glitches (though declining in numbers)

Overpowered pets, low population, people just sit behind their walls doing nothing or mining the rocks they walled off, sieging is junk theres no way to defend a siege weapon unless the people who are being sieged are offline, fire arrows and invisble guards take down a mang in half a minute. TC guards are too strong and literally replace player skill for a static thunderbolt turret, mounted is a skillless whoever has the better horse and gear wins buttcheese fest.

Devs won't listen to balance suggestions and continue every patch to unbalance the game even further.

The melee PvP is still one of the best I've encountered in any game, it's a shame that foot pvp is so few and far between.",1441059908,1542992598,False,62,13,0.485499709844589233,5,False,False,False,False,,,

Sandbox with full loot? Check.
Detailed crafting system that can encompass an entire character build? Check.
Skill based pvp/pve combat with many many varied builds? Check.
Player on Player looting and thieving? I'll kill you if you steal my gold.
Mounts? Pets? Taming giant 2 ton bears? exploding heads with your fists? 

This is not a game for everyone, that's plain and simple. It is very hardcore, you WILL die MANY times to both the environment and other players. This is how you learn, this is how you flourish. Mortal Online is a game that will not hold your hand and coddle you. It is brutal and unforgiving, and this is why I play it, not many other games will give you an actual thrill for adventuring, or pure excitement when you finally battle down that mob the 2 shotted you. No game but Dark Souls (on launch week for the 360 when no one had any clue what was going on) gave me the same feels as this game.

Imagine Mount and Blade meets Ultima Online, hardcore sandbox MMo fans you have found your home.

Edit: Just to add, this game IS free to play, but I would say the f2p is more of a trial than anything else. Your skills will cap at 60 (albiet they will continue to level regardless so if you do go p2p you will level to those skills automatically to wherever you capped as f2p). The game is not p2w but there is a sub wall. I urge you to try it, and if it's your style you'll see why the people who play this are subbed. No other game, especially an MMo, gives you the freedom that Mortal Online gives you.",1441059664,1441131355,True,123,11,0.610451817512512207,3,False,False,False,False,,,
