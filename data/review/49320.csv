TLDR: Gamepad doesnt work. Very repetitive, wave after waves, combat is arcadey and the whole setting is grating.

Woody Two Legs is superficially charming at first, the 2d cartoons are not great but fit the game's thematic, the whole haloween thing was kind of an excuse to thrown in zombies, and the 3D ocean, ship and central island looks pleasant enough on first impression. There is only one song of a violin playing and it loops too often and grates on the nerves

What kills this game is the gameplay, It is basically a Tower Defense style where enemies rush in to try to get to the middle of the map and leave, and you have to hunt and kill them all down, its very arcadey, you can shoot your cannons unrealistically fast, and you can pick up power ups from dead opponents. Naval combat is not great for twitch arcades though as you need a wider arc to turn around using an actual ship than you would in most shootemup games. 

The AI sends waves after waves, it feels like it never ends, until you fight a boss. Then you get to tally your score based on the damage you took and the gold that was taken from the middle of the map, a little text blurb later to advance the setting of the game and hint at progression you are back doing the same thing against slightly different looking ships. It gets real old, real fast.",1493268070,1509664217,False,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False,False,

Consequently he has two wooden legs, but that's not really important - it's a joke like most of the game's story content.

Woody stole some gold from the mighty pirate captain Davy Jones. Unfortunately for Woody, Jones sends his armada of sea monsters and ships commanded by various undead to bring the gold back. You have to sail and cannon away at the enemy ships, which there are maybe ten different types, most of them seemingly little more than re-skins of the basic type, though their behaviour does vary a bit.

It is really an armada: there are tens or even hundreds of ships sailing against you each level. This is alright (Woody doesn't really care for realism) but for the fact that the waves of enemies come from four different directions and the waves don't wait for the previous ones to die before emerging. Depending on your mindset, this is either challenging or just frustrating.

Some of the ships concentrate on attacking you, while others race for stealing the gold and you have to stop them fast because you lose if you run out of gold. Initially I thought dying would be final but soon I realized I only lost a tiny bit of gold as a punishment and the ships steal way more than that, making life count little in your quest for keeping hold of the gold.

Destroyed ships drop power-ups that either benefit or punish you depending on their colour. They contain various weapons from mines to kamikaze dolphins. The webs can be frustrating as they stay in place for a really long time and all the ships, including yours, get stuck in them.

This brings us to the controls: they are wonky at best. You can steer left or right, go two different speeds or stop. You can also shoot to both sides. Steering and moving is the wonky part, because the ship takes a brief moment to register your steering maneuver. Don't get me wrong: this is actually realistic. It just makes the steering a chore, making it tedious to hit the power-ups. The worse part is the two-tiered speed scheme: you either go quite slowly or a bit too fast. Gaben help you if you grab a speed power-up, because it doubles your speed but it will stay two-tiered. Speed bonus is often useful trying to reach the next wave of ships before they reach the island, but it makes it difficult to avoid your own mines and webs and to maneuver into a decent shooting position, deteriorating your attacks into crazy sail-by-shootings where most cannon balls miss their targets.

Levels consist of a single island with your treasure and maybe a reef or two, making them very bland and repetitive. Hitting a reef or the island makes you and enemy ships bounce off of them harmlessly. The same goes for hitting an enemy ship, so unfortunately there are no ramming maneuvers either. Only real differences between levels are the reskins of the enemy ships: three different behaviours with different outlook. It appears that later levels also have more enemy ships. Every level also has a different boss, making it the only thing to wait for. They will probably kill you numerous times before you win them, but what gives, you just respawn to attack them again, slowly grinding their health down.

By the way, in the story mode the gold you lost will stay lost between levels, so you might lose the whole story if you lost too much gold in the early levels. The game is challenging but unfortunately rather boring after a while. The story is silly and recited between levels by a person who sounds either bored or over-dramatic.

All in all, I completed the game in some 5 hours in easy, medium and hard settings but didn't bother with the nightmare, because I had obtained all the achievements by then. It could have been much more interesting with ship and reef collisions, less numerous but more dangerous enemies and outsmartable but challenging bosses - now kraken was the only one who qualified.

I can't really recommend this game but if you get it for really cheap (e.g. in a bundle like I did) you may waste a couple of hours on it. The only thing I liked a bit was the only slightly annoying, jolly tune you listen to while blasting the undead ships.",1424354187,1424354187,False,3,0,0.564359426498413086,0,False,False,False,False,

Even still I was hopeful that I would be able to find some dumb fun hidden underneath the ridiculous title and obvious low development budget, but alas Woody Two-Legs is nothing of the sort. What we have instead is a poorly designed and repetitive game, with impressively low production values and confusing controls that is above all else very, very boring.

As scoundrel pirate Woody Two-Legs, out pillaging ships on Halloween night, you mistakenly taken the treasure of Davy Jones and raised his scourge of undead minions determined to get it back. As is the case with most pirates Woody isn't about to let go of his loot, and so a desperate back and forth begins that you unfortunately must take part of.

Woody plays like something of a twin-stick shooter, with waves of enemies approaching from all sides attempting to make off with the treasure on the island in the middle and sink your ship in the process. The difference here is that you are controlling a ship, and as such have to account for the time it takes to turn as well as only being able to fire from your side cannons. It almost sounds like an interesting concept, until you actually attempt to play it and realize how unnecessarily confusing it makes everything.

Controlling your ship is very awkward and hard to do with any sort of precision, and shooting enemies is even more frustrating do to having to retrain your brain to remember which way your ship is facing and then choose the right side to shoot out of (when you are constantly turning around, remembering which was is left and right is much more challenging than it sounds like). Even if you manage to get the controls down, the gameplay just isn't fun. Enemies come in three barely indistinct varieties, with the only difference being if their end objective is to kill or steal from you, providing no satisfaction to destroy and disappearing in a puff of white smoke. Each of the five level plays and looks exactly the same with no variation save the boss at the end (which also repeat after a point) and how dark it is, and which take an agonizing 10-20 minutes to complete with no change to enemies patterns or any other means to revitalize the experience (which is already tiring after the first few moments).

There are only a handful of item upgrades, which are all extremely temporary, and some of them are terrible. The wide web is the worst of them all for the fact you can get stuck in it and it lasts what feels like forever. Although, it can be good for the boss fights.

The basic price is ridiculous for what you get. Do not buy, even on a sale. The game is complete garbage at any price.

[b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b]
-Ship collision. The ship collision is the worst thing in the game. When you bump into a ship you spin into a random direction. You can also get stuck between the islands for a good period of time while you are bouncing around between ships and land trying to get free.
-Every stage is essentially the same, enemies are just re-skinned.
-Music. Same song for every stage and it is annoying. Muting music is a must.
-Kraken bosses can get your boat stuck to them if you bump them just right.
-Boat bosses hit-box is much smaller than the art. Only the very middle of the boat registers attacks.
-Always spawn in the exact same place after death. This would not be bad except for the fact the enemy, even bosses, start shooting at the location before you spawn. So you can spawn in already being attacked.
-No onscreen timers or notification to show how long a positive or negative effect has left.
-Kamikaze dolphins will not track after kraken bosses.
-Wide area web's area of effect is larger than the art so you can get stuck in it just being near. Wide area net will end up hurting you more than helping you.
-Online scoreboard does not work.
-No replayability, not even for score since it seems to be broke.
-Game crashed several times during long periods of play.
-Beating story mode does not always unlock the next difficulty mode. I beat medium difficulty several times before it unlocked hard finally. I think this had a lot to do with the OS the game is running on. I originally was playing on WIN 10 and it never progressed. I played it on WIN XP once and it progressed.
