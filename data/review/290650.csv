Nesse jogo totalmente linear você anda por um corredor sem contexto nenhum (o jogo não têm introdução nenhuma) até que o que aparentemente é a filha possuída do seu personagem aparece para tentar jumpscares (e digo tentar porque os modelos e movimentos são tão mal feitos que chegaria a ser cômico senão fosse trágico), inimigos aparecem e você pode atirar neles com uma de sua duas armas, os inimigos nem o fogo do cenário pode te fazer mal algum e no fim de cada ""level"" o jogo simplesmente trava e volta em outro mapa.

My real time in this ""game"" is about 15 or 20 minutes and I was almost done when I decided to give up on this crap. Calling this a game is an affront to serious games and developers, for Valve to allow this game to be on sale in this state is disrespectful to the consumer.
In this totally linear game you walk down a corridor without any context (the game has no introduction whatsoever) until what apparently is your character's possessed daughter appears to try jumpscares (and I say try because the models and movements are so poorly done that it would be comical if it weren't tragic), enemies appear and you can shoot them with one of your two weapons, neither the enemies nor the fire in the scenery can do you any harm and at the end of each ""level"" the game simply crashes and returns to another map.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Wir sind Mark Faroh, ein Wissenschaftler. Und was machen Wissenschaftler so? Richtig: einen Obelisken bauen, der Lebendigem die Energie entzieht. 

Ebenso schwachsinnig wie die Story ist auch das Gameplay. Wir latschen durch ein immer gleich aussehendes Gefängnis mit Zombies und einem kleinen Mädchen mit Halbglatze drin. Sinn macht das wenig, Spaß macht das keinen. 

Die Grafik ist typischer Unity-Asset-Krampf von der Stange. Vieles glänzt unwirklich oder überblendet. Schön ist das Alles nicht, eher langweilig. Auch die Sounds klingen wie aus der Dose. 

Die Shootermechaniken funktionieren mehr schlecht als recht. Die Waffen fühlen sich wenig responsiv und reichlich schwammig an, ein Trefferfeedback ist kaum zu bemerken. Wozu auch, denn eine nennenswerte KI fehlt auch völlig. 

Nicht unerwartet bietet das Spiel auch ein Feature, das man aus dem Genre des Indie-Schrott-Shooters durchaus schon gewohnt ist: man kann durch die Map fallen. Diesesmal allerdings ist es noch dreister als sonst, denn normalerweise ist ja zumindest optisch eine Levelbegrenzung vorhanden. Hier kann man ganz einfach einen dunklen Gang entlang gehen und schwups sind wir ehe wir uns versehen hinter den Kulissen. Ein Schritt weiter und wir können uns die grottig gebaute Map im freien Fall von unten anschauen.

Errungenschaften: Nein

Positiv:
- Das Mädchen mit der Halbglatze hat mich zum lachen gebracht

Negativ:
- Licht- und Schatteneffekte
- schlechtes Leveldesign
- unfertig
- Sound ist unter aller Sau
- Null Story/ Kein Horror
- unsichtbare Wände
- wenig Waffenauswahl
- Levelauswahl direkt zu Beginn?

Fazit:
Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning)... Wo soll ich da anfangen? Beim Positivem? Da gibt es nichts, außer das mich das Mädchen mit der Guildo Horn - Gedächtnisfrisur zum Lachen gebracht hat.
Das Mädchen hat bestimmt etwas mit der Story zu tun. Leider habe ich aufgrund der schlechten Vertonung nicht verstanden worum es ging. Die Musik war am Anfang zu laut, weshalb ich den Ton leiser gemacht habe. Die laute Musik übertönte dann den gesprochenen Text. Optionen zum Ändern? Gibt es nicht...
Allgemein war auch null Horror in diesem Spiel zu spüren.
Gameplay gibt es wenig! Man rennt in langgezogenen Gängen mit schlechtem Leveldesig herum (zu 90%) und knallt sich wiederholende Zombies/ Dämonen/ Monster ab (zu 10%). Weiter fällt auf das zwar mit Licht und Schatten gearbeitet wurde, jedoch so, das man da nur mit dem Kopf schütteln kann.
Das ganze Spiel wirkte auch komplett unfertig. An einigen Stellen fehlten Wände, wodurch man in den ""leeren Raum"" gelangen konnte. An anderen Stellen wiederum, gab es unsichtbare Wände. Ich bin 2 Mal an diesen Wänden gestorben, weil ich dagegen geschossen habe und mich somit selbst traf.
Wenn ich schon mal beim Schießen bin... Es gibt nur 2 Waffen, wovon die eine einem selbst auch Schaden zufügen kann.
Der Übergang zwischen den Leveln ist schlecht gemacht und führte sogar bei mir einmal zum Tod, wodurch ich sofort ins Menü katapultiert wurde. Dort konnte ich dann das nächste Level auswählen, aber warum? Alle Level sind zu Beginn anwählbar. Es gibt sogar Hinweise darauf, das es weitere geben sollte. Jedoch glaube ich nicht das da noch etwas kommt...
Auch wenn ich dafür einen satten Rabatt von 75% bekam, war es die paar Cent wirklich nicht wert! Nicht Empfehlenswert!!!!",1647241824,1647241824,False,2,1,0.550408720970153809,0,True,False,False,False,,,

剧情：
Mark Faroh是一位科学家，他发现了一种从生物身上获取能量的新方法。在他发现一件事后，他近乎完美的生活就被颠覆了：人类的贪婪可以把我们中最优秀的人变成恶魔。这是商店页面上的故事描述，但就我而言，主游戏实际上没有任何故事。
每一个关卡都会把你带到不同的地方，但没有任何剧情说明。两个关卡之间没有切换镜头，也没有对话，所以在玩这个游戏的时候，不要期望有一个充满情感和内容的深度故事。

画质：
画质很烂，尽管这是用虚幻4开发的。纹理通常是低分辨率的，带有大量纹理弹出窗口。敌人的模型很难看，如果你在某些地方杀了他们，他们中的很多人都会患上四肢拉伸综合症。游戏中从关卡到敌人的一切都可能不是原创建模。每个关卡都是一个地图包，可能开发人员买了一堆素材并将它们缝合成一个游戏。

音效：
劣质的音效，游戏中的大多数时候会出现BUG。例如，射击时会发出几声枪响，但过了一段时间，就再也没有射击音效了，但这并不重要，因为音效是不需要版权的那种，听起来很糟糕。不只是枪械，大多数敌人甚至不会发出音效，有时候游戏的BGM也会出现没有声音的情况。

可玩性：
Time Ramesside是个FPS游戏，但是射击手感很差，枪械感觉没有冲击力。我觉得我的枪像是在射豌豆一样，除了射击，每个关卡都是一个迷宫，你必须完成解谜，大多数关卡都是一个完全难以驾驭的迷宫。

总结：
玩这游戏使我浪费了什么里的1小时，最煎熬的1小时，请爱惜生命，远离这个游戏。",1638416631,1638416631,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's accompanied by a video review that can be found [b][url=https://youtu.be/tb8JkRIm-uk]here[/url][/b].[/i]

[b]In summary, I can’t recommend this game to anybody[/b] as it’s completely unfinished and has absolutely no enjoyable features. There’s only two soundtracks in addition to large, empty and meaningless levels that are all poorly designed, enemies that don’t do damage (or have death animations), as well as having no discernible plot or character development. The balding child villain is a nice touch, though.
[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Time Ramesside (subtitle, A New Reckoning) is a basic undead-shooter. You play as this dude named Mark who wakes up in a prison with no memory. Soon, he encounters some dying dudes that are like “your balding child is a demon and is killing everyone, you terrible parent” so I guess the underlying plot is that you’re trying to put your daughter in time-out. This is no easy feat since your daughter spider-crawls on walls like the possessed love-child of Dr. Phil while summoning the undead. The game makes no effort to explain itself, so you’re left to your guesses as to what is actually going on.

This game features typical WASD shooter controls and only two weapons - a pistol and this exploding crossbow. Mark is also an amazing endurance runner since he has no stamina and outruns every enemy in this game. You ever heard the term ‘breaking ankles’? Mark invented that term back in Humboldt College back in ‘96. It might be worth noting that there isn’t any melee options available, but for some reason there’s a summonable textbox if you press “C”, so maybe you can try and guess your daughter’s full name to invoke fear into her.

Once you make it to the end of the level, you’ll be transported into the next until you get to the [i]”last”[/i] level where you’ll be brought back to the main screen, wondering why you spent any time at all trudging through empty sewers. If you want to experience the joys of a level twice -- don’t worry, the game has a level selector. There’s even more [b]”Level In Progress”[/b] lines than actual levels, although they’re more empty-promises than things to look forward to.

For some fun-facting, this game actually has over 300 reviews with only about 15-16% positivity. The reviews you see today are post-relaunch that happened back in 2015. This level of relaunching also is seen on another release of the developer’s, The Sacred Stone. For another fun fact, this game’s last update was in 2015! So, it’s safe to say this game is abandoned.

That’s about all I can explain since this game doesn’t have much going on, so let’s talk about something I did like about this game.
[h2]The Good[/h2]
This game’s most redeeming factor is that it exposed me to a level [i](Called “The City” in the level selector)[/i] that has grass that’s too tall to see past unless you jump. I haven’t seen a game that featured that kind of design and I figure if there’s a fully-functional horror game that can actually carry atmosphere, I’d be interested in playing it.

Unfortunately, that’s about it. Let’s move onto what I didn’t really enjoy.
[h2]The Ungood[/h2]
To start with the lesser of the evils, there’s seemingly only two music tracks in this game. There’s this eerie-like song that [i]tries[/i] to set the atmosphere of a horror shooter, but the only other track is this high-energy orchestral song that you hear in the main menu. In Level 2, the eerie-song is overlaid with this endless dripping sound that doesn’t go away, which is what I’m now calling Ramesside Water Torture.

Next up is the level design - there’s really only two somewhat interesting levels being The Maze and The City. Everything else is oversized and empty with enough space to just run around the enemies to pass them. The Maze breaks away from the poor design, and as I said earlier I thought the concept of The City level was cool, but is still oversized and empty. The Sewer seems to be the last level worked on, since it only has [i]”one enemy”[/i] in the entire level, and it looks like a scorpion… tail? Too many questions about [b]everything[/b].

Next up is the lack of a story — I have no clue what the first iteration of this game was like, but based off of what I’ve seen from other screenshots or gameplay videos, the game made an attempt to explain what was happening. In this iteration, there’s like… 8 lines of dialogue? And only one or two of them actually contribute to the lore. The developer may as well just use X17’s store description and nuke any semblance of story so we don’t have our expectations set any higher than a children’s book. Personally, I like the idea of this villainous child being on their quest for Rogaine, but feel free to invent whatever plot you’d like to numb the pain.

As if this game couldn’t even [i]try[/i] to seem completed, we’ve got one hell of a performance by the game’s enemies. There are a couple of different models, but they all honestly perform the same. They hone in on the player character and follow him forever. If you ever stand around them, you’ll learn that [b]they don’t do damage[/b]. The only way you’ll die is by the splash damage of the exploding crossbow. So not only is the game unfinished, but you don’t even get the thrill of combat since this game is more of a janky shooting range game than a horror shooter. This is on top of the fact that you can just outrun every enemy, reserving your bullets for those blocking a path. The real icing on top of this undercooked cake is that there is [b]no death animation[/b]. Once you kill an enemy, they just disappear.

It’s honestly amazing how unfinished a non-Early Access, $8 USD game can be. This game even had the audacity to sink no lower than $2 USD on sale, although I’m certain no price tag is appropriate for what I’ve experienced.
[h2]The End[/h2]
Well, this is definitely the most unfinished game I’ve played to date. The developer has two other games that I don’t think I’ll be covering since these all seem to follow the same release, relaunch, and development cycle.

For notice I played Version 2 of this game (I'll explain more in the Verdict section)

Story:

Mark Faroh is a Scientist that discovered a new way to harvest energy from Biological beings. Shortly after his discovery his almost perfect life gets flipped upside down. Discover a story were greed of man kind can turn even the best of us into a demon. That is the story description on the store page, but as far as I'm concerned the main game has literally no story whatsoever.  

Each levels send you into different locations, but nothing has any rhyme or reason. There's no cutscenes in between levels and no dialogue whatsoever, so don't expect a in depth story with tons of emotion and stuff while playing this game. 

Graphics:

The graphics suck. Even though this is running on Unreal 4, the developer made the game seem like a late gen 360 game. The textures are often low resolution, with massive texture pop ins. Enemy models are ugly and a lot of them get the stretchy limb syndrome if you kill them in certain locations, but to be honest I didn't expect anything more. 

I also could be wrong about this, but I doubt that I am and I think everything in the game from the levels to the enemies is pretty much an asset flip. Each level is a map pack and that's why the jumping around makes no sense as the dev bought a bunch of map packs and stitched them up to make into a game. 

Audio:

The audio is absolutely horrendous. Often then not the audio cuts out and most of the things in the game don't even have audio queues. For example a gun might let out a couple gunshot sounds, but after sometime the audio will cut out and never come back, but it doesn't matter, cause the audio is all stock free and it sounds awful. 

Guns are not the only things that don't have any audio, most enemies don't even make a squeak and often then not the game is in complete silence with garbage music playing in the background. 

Gameplay:

Time Ramesside is fps shooter and an absolutely horrendous one at that. This is easily the worst shooter I have ever played. The shooting feels weak and the guns feel like they have no impact. Often then not I feel like the gun I have is shooting peas and the enemies just shrug it off like it's nothing, which makes no sense. 

Apart from shooting, each level is a maze that you have to solve and trust me when I say this, most levels are a complete pain to navigate. At one point in the so called 'story mode' I literally started cheesing through the game just so I can get through the game fast.  

Verdict: 

Time Ramesside was the longest hour of my life wasted. This game is so bad that I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. CIA uses this game to torture people, that's how bad this game is. There's used to be two versions of the game and I don't think it's even possible to play the first version anymore, but I doubt you would want to play Version 2 as well.  If I didn't make it clear by now stay away.

Die Screenshots zeigen nicht den tatsächlichen Zustand des Huds an, das ist in der Realität wesentlich häßlicher.

Wie im übrigen das ganze Spiel häßlich ist - häßliche Texturen (zu Beginn jeden Levels schwebt die eigene Pistole erst mal in der Luft, erst wenn man sich bewegt, tauchen die eigenen Hände im Blickfeld auf). Die Levels sind häßlich designt und so langweilig, wie weiland die Umgebungen von Wolfenstein 3D oder Spear of Destiny. Alle Gegner haben ja nach Anzahl der Beine die gleichen Bewegungsanimationen. Kommen mehrere Gegner der gleichen Sorte auf einen zu, bewegen sie sich in absoluter Gleichmäßigkeit - in anderen Spielen nutzen die Entwickler zumindest den Trick, dass nicht alle gleichzeitig die gleichen Bewergungen machen. Nicht so hier, hier bewegen sich die Zombies im absoluten Gleichschritt.

Am lächerlichsten sind noch die Trefferanimationen - nicht nur getroffene Gegner zerplatzen in eine Blutfontaine. Auch leblose Gegenstände wie Fußboden, Wände, Zellengitter etc. spritzen Blut, wenn man darauf schiesst.

Und seid über einem Jahr sind keine neuen Level hinzugekommen. Zwei Drittel der Level sind noch Work in Progress und gar nicht anwählbar.

TLDR: Its trash (6.5GB waste of HDD space)

Review: In my playthrough there were a bunch of issues, walls that bleed when shot, monsters and the scripted little girl clipping through walls. It was always the same prison cell corridor to the point where I got lost, eventually I made it to a chainlink fence area which also lasted too long - until I reached a building - when entered there was a room with a ladder. I tried all conventional buttons and looking into options but there was no way up the ladder and the doors did not seem to allow me to go anywhere so I decided this was the End Game.

The impressions I got were ... you know when you force yourself to go to a fair with your family, and you see those cheap thrills at the house of horror. And you know that you should be entertained, or that at least thats meant to be their official purpose, little spooky skeleton, little props of spiders, but really you just feel hollow inside and really unamused... thats the feeling this game got me, and for that reason it really was horrifying",1493638907,1506594379,False,22,3,0.624375402927398682,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Коридорные уровни с одинаковыми декорациями, непонятно зачем и почему наступающие монстры не вписывающиеся в игровой мир, лысая девочка, баги из-за которых порой игра вылетает, а порой уровень становится непроходимым и надо начинать сначала.

And if all that wasn't enough to put you off buying this garbage, have a read up about the scam artist dev and maybe that will change your minds.

この作品も流行の先駆けそれにのっとり、例のインディーズの典型例の如くUE4で作り始めたのだが、まあそれは良いとして
UE4はやたら重く、GTX590 dual coreで全く動かず（UE3の他のゲームは当然の如くヌルヌル動いた）、やはりスペック不足かと嘆いた経験があり
まあ自分のスペック不足がいけない（戒め）と言い聞かせ文句も言わず黙々とゲームをプレイしたら、FPS1～10の中の雪山でクモをひたすらハンドガンでぱしゅぱしゅ撃って倒すという
ひたすら、ただひたすらに地味でカクカクした重いつまらないゲームだったのを覚えている
我慢しながらカード出しついでに遊んでいたが、まあ苦痛だった覚えがある
もちろん個人的意見です、異論は認める

昔の話はさて、閑話休題

近頃UE4が無償流布され始めて、2年ほど前だったか…にプレイしてから
アーリーアクセスの表記も外れてるようだし、再びどう変わっているか興味が湧いて久々にプレイ
随分時間が経って、今回プレイしたら　ゲ　ー　ム　が　軽　く　な　っ　て　い　る
つまり…自分のGPUがゴミなだけだったんじゃなく…
当時はただ最適化されてなかっただけですねコレは…間違いない…
とりあえずゲームの骨組だけで来たから先に販売だけしときたい！という勢いだけで
先にアーリーで骨組みだけのまま販売して、あとから随時アップデートしてたタイプの奴
そんな事しなくていいから（良心）当時最新のUE4とか使うならちゃんと作って販売してくだちい
量産型クソゲーの典型的な早期販売方法の良い例ですね、いや良くはないんだけどね
こういうのって大抵、手抜きになりがちなんだよね
異論は認めます、ただ経験談なだけです、はい

しかもこれ未だにSLIの挙動死んでるやん…片方のGPUだけしか動いてないやん！どうしてくれんの！
2年経ってるんですよ！おかしいですよ！
まあここらへん（dualcore/SLIとか）は趣味の範囲なんで自分で設定すりゃええ話なんですが、が
コントローラーサポート対応
なんかキーボードで敵ぱしゅぱしゅ撃ってたらコントローラー勝手にぶるぶるしよんのよ
勝手にコントローラーONになる
まあしょうがないからFPSだけどサポートされてるし、折角だからコントローラーで遊んでやるかと思ったら

ダッシュがないのよ

キーボードだとシフトキーで走れるんだけど、箱コンだとYで武器切り替え、XとBが死んでるのか、Aでジャンプだけ出来る
トリガーとかLBRBも押しながらスティック動かしても走らんのよ
おいデバッグしてないやんけ

まるで成長していない…！！

というか良く良く思いだすと当時はメインメニュー無かったし（今はある）
雪山で始まったゲームだった記憶あるのに、さっきプレイした時のゲームのイントロはうってかわって研究所で始まってるようだし謎の幼女出てくるし
色々とカオスな作品ですね…
こういう主体性や目的の無さ加減は、開発者の性格がもろ作品に反映されるんだよなあ…悲しいなあ…

Even the developer don't know what this game suppose to be - it started as a simple shooter, then he re-done all of it adding spells, then again changed it to be third person shooter, to finally revert it back to previous state but with horror vibe to it. Yes what a wild ride. 
Its mind boggling this product, its actually maybe worth 0.99 cents to see how twisted and perverted it is. 
I actually tried to help the developer with some other gamers giving him tips and ideas - as much as I was surprised he went out and tried to apply them. End result was even more mind boggling glitches and bugs.

I don't like having to unrecommend an FPS game with a promising premise, but this game has far too many lazy technical and gameplay problems.

Sure, you have a few graphics settings - but they're clumsy - you can't turn off motion blur, instead, you have to click ""low->medium->high->epic"" on the settings and guess at which one might turn it off.   It does work well enough in 4K, but that's not the problem.

The developer was simply too lazy to ""finish"" the game.  Some scenes in the game look great!  And others look like utter crap - fuzzy textures on incomplete models clashing with highly polished jail cells and nice lighting effects.   What we're seeing here might well be the effect of introducing the developers to crystal meth halfway through the development cycle, which might explain the jekyll & hyde levels of quality and shabbiness.  You even have clipping issues when reloading your gun - jaggy polygons seen through your partially-invisible arm!

Gameplay is equally and inexplicably shoddy - it's the same effectively as 1996's Quake, from iD software (it's 2016 now).   You can run, jump, look up, look down, run over piles of bullets left around on the ground.   You fight some nicely modelled zombie things which disappear as soon as you shoot them!  I guess they spent the ""develop a lying down corpse"" budget on more crystal meth.   For some reason, in the first level, you're in some kind of jail/mental asylum full of zombies.  The cell block is around as big as New York City, which is weird, and not really much fun running around in this endless single path full of the same game assets again and again.

This is a re-review after 2 major updates. I just wanted to do this out of fairness. This review contains spoilers. So here we go:

This game is not even remotely what it used to be. In fact it now looks like it's trying to be a horror game. Everything is different for the most part and the only way to talk about this game is by level.

Level 1 - Introduction
This is basically a level where you fight a bunch of monsters while the credits go by. You're trapped in a prison with a bunch of monsters and a little girl.
Pros
-Great atmosphere.
Cons
-The flashlight is located behind your machine gun causing a ton of glare on the front sight.
-It's confusing as what you're supposed to do.
-Shooting monsters is not fun as they don't hurt you, can trap you, and their death animation restarts every time you shoot them causing you to waste a ton of ammo.
-The little girl has no point and you can clip through her.

Level 2 - Prison Level
Here you start 10 minutes before the introduction. It's like the intro but now you aren't trapped.
Pros
-Great atmosphere again
-There's a story.
-There's decent voice work.
Cons
-There's no reason to shoot anything and you can run past everything.
-Shooting stuff still isn't fun.
-There's a hallway that looks spooky but when you go down it you realize it's actually a missing wall that takes you outside of the map.
-Doors are broken. If you go up to a door and it opens go through it because if it closes you're never opening it up again.
-Nothing is scary as the jump scares are cartoony compared to the rest of the environment, not sudden, and too far away.
-It ends abruptly in a confusing way.

Level 3 - Outside city area
You're now outside on the city streets. I'm assuming because you escaped the prison even though it's not entirely clear.
Pros
-Impressive variety of new monsters that, even though they're stock, fit quite well.
-Lighting is nice and you can see where you're going.
-Ammo is available on the ground.
-There's a cool looking boss at the end.
Cons
-Again there's no point to shooting things and there's no reason to anyway since it's way too open.
-Because of the above this level is extremely boring.
-There's no point to the boss fight as you can run past and end the level.

Level 4 - Condemned building
This time you're in an abandoned building. This is by far the best level in the game.
Pros
-Excellent atmosphere
-The hallway is narrower so you have a reason to shoot things.
-There are open rooms that hold spooky set pieces.
-Far more effort and planning then previous levels.
Cons
-Shooting is still not fun due to animations getting restarted when you shoot as things are dying.
-I didn't want to go into some of the side rooms because I didn't want to accidently break the game again and have to start over.
-The ending is kind of bad and makes no sense at all.

Overall Opinion
Even though this game is now actually playable I still wouldn't recommend paying for it. It's currently at a pre-alpha state and $10 is a huge rip off. It's not what I'd call ""fun"" and still needs a ton of work. It's also really unoptimized so expect slowdowns like crazy in some spots. Level transitions are terrible as well and in some instances I wasn't sure if I was going to the next level or if the game froze on me.

That being said, the dev is going in the right direction with it and I'm really happy to see regular updates. I either died or got to the end of the game (I went down the hallway to the right) so I can't comment on if there's anything past level 4 as of yet. I'm putting it down as recommended only because it looks like Panzer Gaming Studios is trying to turn it into something and because I support indi devs.",1450034488,1450034745,True,4,2,0.382718473672866821,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And if you run out of Ammo it's not that they kill you, no, you simply can't walk forward or backward, they are blocking you and their Melee does nothing, also the Zombies hit you all the Time while you can't move anymore, but it does nothing, they hit and hit and you loose no Health, you simply can't move anymore because they are like Walls blocking you.

The 5GB this Game uses are pure waste, looks ok, controls are ok, but it's no shooter, no survival whatever, not even scary, only fucking annoying and bugged like hell, i even fallen trough the Floor in the first Minute after it started and had to restart.

Pros:
+Graphics can be nice at points.
+Gameplay isn't the best, but it's medium.
+Can be somehow hard.
+The guns look nice. Even though they're assets, let's review the game and forget about that they're assets.
+Potential.
+Soundtrack (Mostly Combat Soundtrack is good enough)
+It's a time killer and very slightly fun
Cons:
-Storyline, Bad Writing
-Glitchy and Buggy gameplay and extremely glitchy moments of A.I, badly placed scenario models, things as such.
-Aiming Down Sights sucks.
-Sound Effects.
-Textures doesn't look nice AT ALL if looked close.
-Awful Gameplay (its medium, but mostly awful)
-Assets. I had to say it. Assets everywhere.

Плюсов в этой игре два: есть отдельные симпатичные графические эффекты, и есть карточки.
Все. Этот шутер, выглядит как пре-альфа в лучшем случае, но подают его как полную игру.

Дальше минусы:
- баги, ТЫСЯЧИ их!!! Игра постоянно вылетает, по поводу и без, если началась кат-сцена, варианта три: Вам повезло, и сцена отыграла, Вам не повезло, и игра вылетела, Вам не повезло и игра зависла. Периодически пропадают текстуры, лежащее оружие обозначается синим прямоугольным контуром, текстура оружия может вообще на высветиться, у снайперки вместо линзы прицела, просто черная деталь. Если понизить графику, все это становится в разы страшнее, так что если Вы все же решите в это играть, играйте на средних настройках минимум. Далее, мобы спавнятся в чистом поле, периодически падая с потолка, или вылезая из под земли. еще они любят застревать в дверных проходах, зависать в воздухе после их убийства, или завиваться ниточками летя через полкомнаты. AI, тоже очень специфичен, враги тупо стоят на месте, и начинают что-то делать только если подойти к ним впритык. Ну а апофеоз всего, главный герой временами может пройти сквозь стену, и зайти в изнанку уровня. Это вкратце, все самые суровые баги.

- управление кривое и несменяемое, к примеру выход в меню это кнопка Q, а не ESC. Поднять оружие T, вместо E, и т.д. Менюшка в игре страшная, кат сцены не очень приятные, сюжет только то что написано в начале игры в виде предисловия, концовки нет вообще. Врагов мало - гигантские пауки, скорпионы, обычные зомби. Оружие - два автомата, пулемет, дробовик, снайперка, арбалет. Анимации отдачи нет. Есть заклинания, анимация у них странная, толку нет, кроме заклинания лечения. 

- дизайн уровней в игре кривой, то надо долго бежать по пустым прямым переходам, то вдруг попадается комната с 20 зомбаками. Проходить это дело проще всего, тупо пробегая мимо всех, до конца уровня, и вынося лишь тех кто мешается  а также насекомых, ибо часто они выступают в виде боссов.

This game has a plot that I can only describe as non existent. It has nothing to do with the afformentioned Mark Faroh being a scientist at all. The game in fact is just you running through different areas killing the enemies which quickly wears on you and becomes a chore with the small choice of weaponry that all seem to be useless in my opinion. So anyway you fight all of the poorly modeled and textured enemies in the poorly modeled and textured world with your crappy guns. Needless to say there really isn't much to say about this abomination. Just save your 3 bucks for something else unless you can get this game for 30 cents or less I couldn't reccomend you touch this game with a 9 and a half foot pole.

后来我有次重装了系统，用小号挂这个游戏的卡的时候，发现又能够打开游戏了。
结果完全是个半成品的游戏，无论是剧情还是地图还是什么，都有显而易见的糊弄的未完成现象。
地图重复无趣，而且还没有完全封好，有的地方能直接走出地图外边。人物建模奇特，从第一个出现的剧情npc来看，只是做了半个人的模型，然后轴对称，人物中间的一根对称线一眼可见。
怪物奇特，完全没存在的必要。追不上你，自己往怪物身上撞，很明显的看到了怪物做了攻击的动作，却没看到自己掉血，我不懂血槽存在的意义。打死了怪物完全没有过渡一下，蹭的一下就消失了。
奇妙的枪，影响视野，甚至连枪标都偷懒，第一把枪的枪标类似突击步枪，第二把枪的枪标直接是第一个的水平翻转。而实际手上的枪模，第一把是手枪，第二把不知道是什么鬼，永远乌漆墨黑的一坨，看不清楚。至于枪打出来的效果，自带鲜血，无论打到怪物还是打到地板，都会冒血。
只能说因为用了虚幻4引擎，得以显得画面光影逼真，但是游戏视野靠近物体时莫名的光晕总是闪瞎人眼。
好在地图大，怪物慢，玩家能无限跑动，所以这个游戏可以尝试一口气跑下去看看。不过，最后跑到了一个需要身份卡的电门前，也就是说必须收集东西才能继续无聊的跑下去。
我虽愿意无聊地不断跑下去，我却不愿意去认真收集元素来玩通这个游戏，因为这个游戏是在太糟糕了，只能不花费精力地看一看才不亏。
总之，这个游戏，连“抢先体验”都算不上，完全是一个残缺品。",1441860112,1449046022,False,5,5,0.597833931446075439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For a game that packs 10gb of data you get a badly designed menu, badly designed weapons, badly designed sound effects, badly designed levels, lot of clipping issues, not to mention the game is laggy as hell. At this stage,Time Ramesside is possibly the worst FPS of its kind to be released on Steam Greenlight.

I thought The Slaughtering Grounds and Devils Share from Digital Homicide Studios were bad... It seems there's a new contender in the market!

Since its release in 2014 and re-release in 2015, Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning) has undergone many changes. The latest build has nothing to do with the first build anymore. In other words, the game just got worse after every updates. Don't expect any improvement, just more glitches.

もっと言うなら、「アマチュアユーザーが初めて触ったアンリアルエンジンのエディタで、なにも決めないまま作っているプロジェクト」だとさえ感じます。

アップデートはこまめにしているようなのですが、そのたびに、ゲームの核の部分は改善されないまま、スキップできないデモムービーが追加されたり、パワーポイントの資料のようなストーリー紹介が追加されたり、そもそもタイトルさえ変わっているわけですから、その無計画さは数ある有料インディーゲームの中でも随一なのではないでしょうか。（ちなみに、そのデモムービーはアンリアルエンジンの公式デモをちょっと改造しただけのものだったりします）

これが、ツイッターで知り合った大学生ぐらいの友人が趣味で作っているフリーゲームなら、ねぎらいの言葉の一つもかけたかもしれませんが、実際にこれをインディーゲームとして、まして定価15ドルで販売してしまっている以上、厳しい評価をせざるを得ません。

After the movie is over the game then loads once again, introducing you to a slow moving camera overview. When first playing I had a hard time seeing around me due to the dense crappy frozen fog effects. Once I ran through the series of doors, I lost control of my player and once again it switched to a slow moving camera of the first mob you will attack. When attacking the mob it takes like 5 minutes to finally kill him with only more mobs being spawned. Until you either run out of ammo and die or get bashed by mobs that seem to spawn behind you.

Unreal 5
Great music
Loved the first movie with the plot unfolding

No tutorials
No help or key information

I have no desire to get personal, but Time Ramesside feels very much like it has been made by someone who doesn't really know what they are doing. It seems as though they are just starting out and learning about both game design and how to use the development software. Now there's nothing wrong with that by itself and there's nothing wrong with releasing your game on the internet. The problem is that someone is actually asking money for this.

After being in early access for a while the game still has many problems, many of which could be forgiven (it's an indie title after all), but it fails in the the most basic areas. A game like this needs good maps and unfortunately this is the game's first major problem. The levels are just long corridors which seem to have no real objective and can sometimes be difficult to navigate.

I gave the developers a looooooooooooooooooooooooot of time before writing my review. Supported them with crash reports on forums and tipping bugs. Actually I waited until the full release before writing this... Nothing changed much. I am so glad I got this on a bundle and not paying the full ridiculous price.

Cons:
-You can pass 95% of the levels running away.
-First of all, FPS GAME WITH NO OPTION TO CHANGE MOUSE SENSIVITY??? REALLY???? ._. 
-Then graphics, just... let's say that Gears of War PC 2007 (using an older unreal engine) has a million times better graphics.
-Animations: from nill to slim. Reloads are so bad that become hilarious. THE SNIPER SCOPE IS A JOKE, LITERALLY. AK-47 RELOADS LIKE A SHOTGUN.
-Story: It has slides, SLIDES with all the story on it at the beginning.
-Performance: Mi PC can run Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes with max graphics and becomes slow with this game... Ha-Ha.
-HUD: 2 health bars LOL.
- No explicit or implicit tutorials of the game mechanics. You just have to guess and review the key bindings screen.
-Default keybindings are so... inappropriate. ""Q"" brings up the menu. Do I need to say more?
-Inconsistent gameplay: sometimes the weapons do lots of damage, sometimes they don't. You can jump like on Halo sometimes... other times you barely jump at all.
-Level design: Incomplete and a guesswork if you want to trigger the level transition.

Pros:
-Best example on how not to make a game with Unreal Engine.
-New record on bad games.

Seriously, I'd rather score a point on ""Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors: Desert Bus"" or play ""Big Rigs"" 8 hours straight. The Angry Videogame Nerd needs to review this ASAP.

Since apparently the new patch invalidates my old review, here's a new one. Note how it is, just like the game, basically identical. See you at full release when I go over it one last time. :)

-Point Négatifs-

- C'est plutot mal optimisé. Ca lague tout le temps alors que ça a pas lieu d'être. J'ai une configuration PC assez convenable. Je peut faire passer de gros jeu comme Batman Arkham Origins, Tomb Raider ou encore Sleeping Dogs assez facilement.

- C'est pas très beau graphiquement. Bon certes, j'ai du baisse les graphisme à fond pour que ca lague moins (mais ca laguai toujours autant) mais au vu des image qui nous propose au dessus, ben ça confirme que c'est pas le top du top niveau graphique.

- Les Animations font pitié. Il a juste a voir la vidéo d'intro pour voir qu'il y a quelque chose qui va pas.

- Il y a beaucoup trop de bug. A peine le jeu commencé (c'est à dire après la cinématique qui laggue), on voit deja que ca bug, car quand on commence le jeu, la caméra est fixe devant un gars qui nous parle mais le truc c'est que jpeut deja commencer me déplacer...mais la camera, elle, ne bouge pas....j'ai beau me barer au loin ben elle me suit pas.

- Je ne sais pas ce que je suis censé faire. Le mec, que j'ai cité au-dessus, à pris 3/4 d'heure à me parler (et dont j'ai absolument rien pigé car c'est en anglais et parce que il parlais pas fort et parce que j'était plus concentré a courir autour de lui) et puis apres qu'il a fini...je suis censé faire quoi? et puis c'est quoi la fuc*in' cohérence dans ce jeu, je commence le jeu en sortant d'un bus en flamme et le mec me parle tout tranquillement, en toute serénité, à côté du bus en flamme et avec des monstre qui sont quelque metres plus loin...Moi je pense qu'à ce stade là, le jeu se fout bien de notre tronche.

- Les Personnages ne bougent pas leurs lèvres. Bon certes, c'est un détails mais bon. le jeu a pas l'air super vieux donc pour un FPS récent, c'est pas envisageable. Encore si c'était un jeux de stratégie ou un Hack'N'Slash, ben j'aurai rien dis car dans ce cas là, les modeles 3D aurai été trop petit et cela n'aurai été qu'un détail alors que là on est dans un FPS, on voit bien le visage du personnage mais on on ne voit ni ses levres bouger et il ne fait aucun mouvement pour indiquer qu'il parle (ce que certains Hack'N'Slash font).

But those days are over now it just means our game sucks still. While beta means our game is cool so suck our dicks so you can make our game popular. And thus the cock sucking commences and a final game is one that probably will get an expansion or part 2 is ready. thats another way of saying hey its time to pay some more to play the rest. But those who suck cock will be too bussy cocksuckering. 

This game looks like it was made stupid on purpose, to say hey our game is still alpha. We need our dicks sucked.

The engine is great Unreal engine 4 sure stick anything in it and its great, And i mean anything any game or just fucking put a youtube video in it and call it alpha fuck it it works and it looks amazing.

But this game is like if you gave some kids 200 bucks a month to put a game out there, you where just like fuck it , here you can do whatever you want and well put it out there.

And then the kids go , fuck yeah lets just go buy a ps4 fuck this work shit. Just put shit in the Unreal 4 tutorial and put that shit in there just copy some skins of google and make everything not work cause next month we can buy call of duty after we get the ps4.

Everything in Unreal 4 is simple so you can just about do anything in a couple of days.

So we establish that the graphics are awesome because the engine is awesome. These people did not make the engine just use it. Anyone can and for 15 bucks a month you can have your very own copyrighted game :D so start sucking my dick , you jolly dick suckers.

The music is awesome, but lets take this into consideration, if your game sucks any type of music will go with your game. It is not my type of music but it is loud and i could see it going with the game.

The story looks cool , it doesnt tell me anything because its alpha so im assuming your a robot prisoner that gets attacked by zombies and you have magical powers and guns. Same shit as any other game. Nothing new sure you use magical powers and get them all in the start and your starting weapon is a knife and you go get guns. but what fucking game doesnt have that oh and zombies or demons same fucking shit to me. so the story gets a big fuck you from me and i know they will end up making it more stupid than what it is.

The character design and overall design of levels is completly craptacular. even the sound effects are craptacular. But they look great thanks to Unreal 4. But you can always look pretty and be a complete douche bag.

This game is like a butterface that looks good from far but is far from good.

Ofcourse anything can become awesome, just add everything that is awesome to it.

The game lacks alot of things because its alpha but thats an excuse, picking up weapons with E is just an easy fix, you are using unreal engine 4, just set it and your done. and the LOD of weapons is easy just take away 1 hand and turn the weapon 90 degrees. simple unless your ... computer challenged for lack of a better way to say your a fucking complete retard. And the story line and pace are crap that just is because you suck , end of story.

I recommend this game to everyone as this will let them know they can change the world, I didnt buy the game and you shouldnt either it just suddenly appeared in my inventory maybe from a bundle or its free for everyone and I said fuck it why not, and then the game looked at me and im guessing it said the same thing. FUCK IT WHY NOT.

But for my final thoughts 

You can say your game is alpha, But that just means you sucked ass since alpha and you sucking ass has nothing to do with alpha because you suck.",1417685411,1627605361,True,2,3,0.484824329614639282,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Right away you get thrown into the game with some weird... weapon?... You have over 9000 ""bullets"" with it... but it's not a ranged weapon. It's a melee weapon... So, that doesn't make any sense.
There's no tutorial. So, I wondered why the game was so dark... Turns out you have a flashlight. 
The only enemy I found was some sort of soldier with red eyes that just repeated ""I will kill you"" over and over again. The enemies can't walk through doors either so you can stand at the entrance to a room and basically hit the enemies without taking damage.
There's a lot of bugs in the game as well. I went into a room and it repidly said ""I will kill you"" over and over again multiple times for no reason. I then ran out of the room and in again to find an enemy. 

I played this for like 15 minutes and then I idled it on the main menu to get trading cards.

Tl;dr:
It's a bad game with a lot of bugs and you shouldn't buy it.

Pros:
It has trading cards
Is a bit spooky. Nothing big though.

Cons:
Bad controls.
No intro or tutorial.
A lot of bugs.
Missing textures.
Doors look the same but you can open some of them and others you can't. (Let's play the ""Find the right door"" game!)
Bad music and sounds.
Bad textures.
Ultra quality textures in the game are called ""Epic"" (As in low, medium, high and epic) ... Yea, no. They're not epic.
Horrible starting weapon with over 9000 bullets even though it's a melee weapon. (And I don't even know what it is)

This has well and truly slipped through the net and the inability to deal with con men is pure garbage. Sort it out STEAM.



First time I have written a review for a game, but here goes...

This game is utter horse manure. I have played some shocking games in my time, but this takes the biscuit. HEED MY WARNING!!! Do not purchase this game, waste of money and it should be removed by steam. I ended up with a promo code for it, how lucky was I. If you don't believe me, read all the other comments that also slate the game.

Sorry for my lack of info about the actual playability of the game, it's just that there wasn't any. Maybe I will make a crap game, pretend update it and call it early access to rip people off and use the steam community to do it to.

I'll give the dev credit where it's due: the game's better. But at the cost of the whole story. Everything has changed. Literally every, last, thing has changed. No powers, no bus in the middle of a winter storm, no guy randomly punching you and walking out; the story changed completely... but the game still isn't worth your money.

Edit:
Since writing this, I have played the game more and my opinion remains the same. The game lacks a lot of animations, there are many bugs regarding AI, the control scheme still needs to be ironed out, and just in its entirety the game needs a ton of improvement before it can be considered market-ready.

- - - - - - - - - - -

First off, I did not play this game for more than 10 minutes. That's because half of the time was spent sitting through a black intro screen that cannot be skipped (which apparently is due to an issue with Unreal Engine), and the rest of the time was spent running around with a knife held as though a rifle was in its place.

The game starts you off, upon launching the game, with a small command prompt box. No complaint there, if it has to be there then it has to be there. Then it opens the actual game menu window. This menu window's ""options"" button did not work, so I couldn't go to full screen from there. No biggie. Press new game and now you wait through the aforementioned intro. When it's finally over, you ""wake up"" (I don't know what led to the protagonist being dropped off there) in a prison/dungeon of some sort with a crossbow at your feet.

Pressing esc gives you one type of game menu. Pressing Q gives you an alternate game menu. Both have different options inside of them, so that's really weird by itself. In neither can you change your keybindings, so whatever the developer has set is what you're stuck with. Speaking of the keybindings, there is no tutorial (to my knowledge) on what the controls are. Instead, you have to awkwardly walk up to the aforementioned crossbow and ask yourself how to pick it up. Only to fail to even accomplish that task, since after pressing all buttons on my keyboard and mouse, I failed to do even that.

I figured maybe it's just a prop and can't actually be used, so instead, I ran with this knife being held oddly like a rifle and for every enemy I ran into, this annoying whispered ""I'm going to kill you"" was sounded. There's more to mention, like how crouching does nothing except change the positioning of your camera so you can see your own character's textures, and how the enemies don't seem to hurt you unless they align themselves perfectly to really get the damage done, and how the animations are minimal at best. However, I think with the other reviews and everything else considered, the point is clear.

Don't release unfinished games. At the very least, get the HUD finished and the basic features ironed out. This game is truly not ready for the market. Fortunately, I only got it in a bundle, so it wasn't much of a bite from my wallet.

Oh, and changing the game's name is definitely suspect.",1416302449,1454647752,False,28,0,0.581415057182312012,5,False,False,False,False,,,

I watched it update a few times a week, so I figured that there was a lot of progress being made.  It used to be called A New Reckoning, but I'm guessing the developer changed the name to Time Ramesside, whatever that means, to try and ditch the bad press that the game had earned.  I hadn't played it until the name was changed, and with all of the updates I saw it download onto my computer, I can't imagine what the game must have been like before all of these updates.  Let me just say that in game, it looks pretty nice, but it has a lot of problems.  The menu system looks like it was something made in flash, pretty dull and basic, often times buttons won't work at all.  When you hit the new game button it brings you to a black screen and you'll hear music playing.  Nothing else happens.  I alt+tabbed to find a solution, and after about 5 minutes of searching I found that the game had finally began.  Just takes 5 minutes to load the first level.  The weapon you start with is a knife, although your character doesn't seem to know that, because his hands are stuck as if he were trying to cradle the invisible barrel of a gun.  The AI is very stupid, the guns feel over powered, or under powered.  The first weapon you get is a crossbow that fires plasma rockets, the second is a pistol that takes 10 shots to kill an enemy.  You have to use P in order to pick up a weapon which I had to look online because theres no way to change or even check keybindings.

Pros: I didn't pay $9.99 for this game, it just happened to be part of a game bundle I got from Indie Gala awhile back (think I paid $4 or less). The only redeeming factor so far from what I see from this game is that it has trading cards (already got 3, 2 more to go). They will make excellent marketplace fodder (hope I hit a foil, will sell it for $10 or more cause money spent on a foil card is probably alot more valueable than this).

Cons: Took awhile to download (over 2 hours of my life to download and install), only to be faced with a weird startup. When it starts up, it doesn't just open the game, it opens up a command prompt window that says ""Launching game, 32-bit"". Okay, I have a 64-bit OS, but whatever. Then the game window pops up. Now I'm on the...title screen? Wait, where's the title? All I see is ""New Game"", ""Load Game"", ""Continue"", ""Options"" and ""Quit"". Oh, I think I'll adjust the options, it's what I always do when I first start-up a game, I like to crank everything to the max since my PC can handle any game that gets thrown at me. *Clicks Options...click...click click* Hm...that's weird, the options button doesn't work? And I'm stuck having to place this game in windowed mode in which the bottom portion of it is going past my start bar? Well, I'll let this slide for now. After all, the game is still in development, so let's start a New Game and see what this game is all about. *Click ""New Game""* *Goes to Black screen...* .....o...kay, I have a black screen....wait, I hear something...it's...a sound? Maybe music? But I'm not seeing anything....what's going on? Is this the game? To figure out why I'm staring at a black screen that after waiting like 5 to 10 minutes I'm still on a...black screen? *Presses random buttons* Um...okay...guess that's that *Exits game, restarts game, and sits on the so-called ""title screen"" as he types his review*

And there you have it folks. Hope I didn't strain anyones eyes with my explicitly detailed typing about this game's cons. I was really looking forward to trying it, really, I was, I wanted to give this game a chance. But sadly, the game didn't want to give me a chance to play with it. 1/10 (it scores a 1 cause I at least am getting trading cards sitting on the title screen as I write this review, and surf, and do other ""productive"" things with my time as I wait for last card drop)",1416041418,1416041418,False,14,0,0.516561329364776611,0,False,False,True,False,,,

A New Reckoning looks and feels like an alpha tech demo from 2001, I don't even know where to start to explain how bad this game is.

First of all; It doesn't matter how fast your machine is, this game will load extremely slow. 

After the intro that makes absolutely no sense at all, you may begin a new game (if you haven't already quit by then).
You start in a bus, for no reason whatsoever (i guess  its suppose to be a jail bus or something). First thing you notice the hideous graphics (if you havent already noticed them in the intro). You try to raise your resolution but to your surprise, nothing changes. 
Well ok, this is still a work in progress, so let's not be too hard on this game. 
Then you'll notice 95% of the sounds are not even in the game (yet). The only sounds that probably work are sounds of shooting and footsteps. 

If you're still 'playing' the game..... well .... sorry i mean; If you're still torturing yourself, you try to checkout the other options in the options menu to find out you can't customise the controlls and have no idea what to press. Somehow the gate opens and behind the gate there's another fence you're suppose to teleport over. I pressed all the keys on my keyboard to figure out what to teleport key was but i couldn't find it. I tried to locate it in the  ""Spells"" menu but still didn't knew how it would work. So eventually i just stop trying. Also there are so many weird things in the game like ... Weird snowbushes or whatever they are suppose to be or Door textures that are simply way too small for an adult to get in...

I have played this game one time before and back then I already knew this game was never going to be any good. But i gave them another chance months after release just so I was sure I could put this game in my 'hidden' list. I could tell you about the enemies but.... do you really want to know ? Ok well... the shooting is unsatisfying and the enemies are the regular bunch you can find in any game like Scorpions...... and they live in the snow somehow. The game is not ""So bad, it's fun"", the game is just extremely bad and it should be banned from Steam. This was most likely some highschool project of two teens wanting to earn a quick buck. 

Luckily the only reason i own this game was because it was in an indie bundle.

リリース以来それなりに精力的にアップデートが続いています。


まずは良いところから。

・使っているゲームエンジンのおかげか、一部のエフェクト、特に炎の表現がなかなか綺麗
インディー系開発者でもここまでできるのかと、ゲームエンジンの偉大さと開発者への追い風吹く世の中の素晴らしさが味わえます。

・Steamトレーディングカードに対応
一部の好事家に人気のカード/バッジに対応していて、現在のSteamの流行にも乗っています。

・設定を下げると意外と動作が軽くなる
初期設定ではそこそこ重めですが、オプションから変更することでなかなか快適動作になります。


……さて、では悪いところを。

・それ以外の全部
いやもうどこも擁護できませんよ。アーリーアクセスだからって許されないくらい酷い。
ゲームとしては文字通りの未完成品。
壁にめり込む、世界の下に落ちる、敵が消える、敵がムーンウォークで自分から離れる、見えない壁で阻まれる階段、当たり判定のない壁、カットシーン中も操作できる自キャラ、初期フォント丸出しのメニュー、狙ったところに飛ばない銃、バランスのおかしい魔法などなど、細かく挙げていけばキリがありません。

そう、魔法、このFPSには魔法(Spell)があり、Qキーで呼び出せるメニューから7、8種類の魔法を選択して使えるのですがこれまた酷い。
魔法を切り替えるのにいちいちゲームが止まるのも相当萎えますが、現時点(おそらく15.0)で使える""Force Wave""がバランスブレイカーとなっており(そもそもバランスなんて存在しないゲームですが)、消費なしで周囲の敵全てに硬直ダメージを与えられるので、Gキーを連打してForce Waveを放つだけで敵が勝手に倒れていきます。
Force Waveを放つ、とは言いましたがWave自体は目に見えないという手抜きっぷりもキてますね。


ストーリー性もゼロ、戦闘もダメ、探索要素と呼べるものすらなし。
プレイ中は絶え間なくやってくるバグにツッコミを入れるのに忙しく、ゲームというよりは間違い探しをしているようでした。
根本から腐りきっているためアップデートで良くなるとは到底思えず、自分が遊ぶ前のバージョンをプレイした人いわく「褒めるトコが一つもない稀有なゲーム」とのことなので期待するのが間違いでしょう。
自分はバンドルによる抱き合わせで入手しましたが、それでも損した気分になりましたし、定価での購入は絶対におすすめしません。
というか買わないほうがあなたの人生のためです。本当に。

それでも買ってしまった人は……フォースの力を信じて、さあ戦って。

I've tried, but something is wrong when the tutorial level has enemies with WAY too much health.  A tutorial level should help the player get adjusted to the game, and, in a sense, I suppose ANR's (A New Reckoning) tutorial level is no different.  You start by phasing through a bus door, the bus is surrounded by police cars, (which are not to appropriate scale to the character), and are greeted by floating text blocks which give you a run down how to select the 'teleport' spell and use it.  As of this writing, the UI is little more than text (I hope they get a rudimentary iconic UI up soon, as the text is dull and quite ugly, maybe a spell selection wheel with spells that are not available grey'd out.)

After learning to teleport, you are invited into a building that opens the way to the rest of the map.  It is largely a walking simulator at this point, where you can marvel at indoor street lamps (the kind you see on the streets, generally not indoors), snow on the floor (though it has no way to get there), and some bushes curiously growing out of the snow.  After teleporting to the other side of a fence, I am attacked by a demon-thingy.  Simple affair, bullets, death, move on.

After destroying the demon dog thingy, I am then accosted by a flaming spider of significant size.  As I fight it, it poops out smaller, not flaming spiders every time it teleports near me.  If you ignore the smaller spiders, they become a life syphon, and eat all your health.  I found myself unloading an entire clip just to get rid of one of the spiders.  Circle strafing and typical FPS skills don't count here, as the baby spiders stick to you like glue.  I died.  Quick.

Trying again, I teleported up to the rafters in the building, so while the baby spiders couldn't reach me, I couldn't get any health pickups, and quickly ran out of ammo and spell juice.  I lobbed a couple fireballs at them, taking down two or three at a time, only to have flaming titan spider pop back next to me and poop out more.  I dropped back to the ground, and picked up the health pickups, and ammo, and was swarmed.  I died.  Again.  On a tutorial level.  No matter HOW GOOd or BAD a player is, they should NEVER fail on a tutorial level.  And if they do fail, they should be allowed to try whatever they are trying to do again, without having to be dropped back to the intro screen, or text, or whatever.

Right now, the game plays like a bare bones Unreal game, without, well, the fun.  If you are thinking about getting this game, I would suggest not, but if you do, at least wait until:

1.)  It's closer to completion
2.)  It's on sale for really, really, really cheap
or
3.)  Know what you are getting yourself into.

It's not good, even for early access, not at this point, anyway.  And believe me, I am a huge Early Access supporter.  I have many Early Access titles.  The congative dissonance I've witnessed from the developer in the forums (like those who do not like the game being called ""trolls"") is another turn off for me, and reminds me of a great quote I once read:

""If one person has a problem with you, it's likely their fault.  If two people have a problem with you, I can still give you the benefit of the doubt.  But if three or more people have a problem with you, the problem probably lies with you.""

A vast majority of the reviews, even for an early access game, seem pretty negative for this title.  Many games that are early access, if their supporters see potential in the game, regardless of the bugs or lack of polish (Look at The Forest, or Dead State, or Dungeon of the Endless, or 7 Days to Die, etc etc) they will still net largely positive reviews.

Another review of this scam. It has come to my attention that the developer is not only running a scam on Valve/Steam but also a scam on Unreal Engine forums. He seems to be scamming other devs to produce assets for his game and then ignores them and doesn't pay them.

***NOTE*  DEVELOPER IS CROWDFUNDING**


This game is the most crappiest game I have ever played. And YES I have played SUPERMAN 64!!
Please note: 16 year old kids that create games do a better job then this guy will ever do! Dont believe me? AT TCU we have programs for the ages 14-18 year old kids to make video games. The program last about a month and most of these kids are really talented. This is what all the ages do: 3D Level Design - Unreal Engine,Game Development - Minecraft, iD Game Studios 101,FPS Game Design - Unreal Engine, 3D Level Design - Portal 2 & Team Fortress 2, Game Modding & Java Coding - Minecraft, Programming in Java and a lot more fn stuff. Some of these kids have already made it in the world such as Unturned, Resident evil men of war mod, army men mod/game, and some others.

Little information about the DEVELOPER Jason: 
1)Does not know the difference between animation and programing. 
2)Has no clue how he wants the game to be like. (level 1 has changed from on a bridge to, in a courtyard,  outside of  a bridge, to now in a ceil)
3) Game name use to be 3 titles. Left To Rot, A New Reckoning, and NOW Time Ramesside.
Game was changed from new reckoning to TIme Ramesside due to a writer has a new vision
4) CANNOT TAKE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK!

Pros:
You GET TRADING CARDS SO YOU CAN GET ATLEST 50 CENTs BACK!!!

Cons:

You might get pissed if you spent 9.99 on this game
grammar and punctuation= Terrible (Once you start the game and play the game you will get a alpha warning, please read and understand the spelling errors.
Voice acting= Terrible
Guns= When aiming your bullets Ricochets and when free aiming your bullets hit but it Ricochets back when firing on an enemy
Sounds= TERRIBLE (Guns sounds like it came from star trek games. THe enemy sounds just gets annoying) EXample of enemy sounds: ARHHHHH ARHHHHH ARHHHH AHHHHHH AHHH AHHHHH AHHHH AHHHH GETS REALLY ANNOYING!!
Controls= Terrible (Developers does not know how to bind keys in the correct way)
Developer= Terrible (Deletes ppls disscussion due to he doesnt like how ""we the people think about the game"")
Level Design: Plain nothing too it literally feels like a early 2000 game on how the rooms were like. Was able to go through a couple of doors and fall through the map! Also while using your flashlight and aiming up you will see a light and a reflection of yourself.
Animation= Are just terrible! After watching the cutscene once you start its just terrible.  monsters you fight and see on cutscenes 90% stand in the default position and do not attack you.

Playing the game my view: Once you move around and start playing you will notice someguy that was sitting on a chair is now standing in their default position, also you were not tied to your chair so why couldnt you have just left the room while the cutscene was taken place? You start off with a knife, and literally 5 seconds you will get a gun. In real life/ terms if i had a knife this whole time, the people i saw would had been dead. Just saying

Irgendwie haben es die Entwickler aber auch weiß Gott wie geschafft, dass das Spiel noch schlechter aussieht.

Zuerst wollte ich eine relativ objektive Review über dieses Spiel schreiben, geht aber nicht. Deswegen hier eine hasserfüllte Review über dieses schreckliche Stück Software.

A New Reckoning kam am 7. Juli 2014 auf Steam raus. Die Entwickler hinter dem Spiel heißen ""Panzer Gaming Studios"". Diese Menschen (oder Mensch ich bin mir nicht sicher) haben offenbar vorher noch nicht ein Spiel entwickelt. 

Aber nun zum Spiel.

A New Reckoning basiert auf der Unreal Engine 4 was nicht unbedingt etwas gutes heißen muss. Die Models der Gegner sehen noch einigermaßen gut aus, dass war es aber auch schon. Die Umgebung ist unglaublich hässlich. Und wird dadurch kaschiert, dass viel zu viel auf dunkle Umgebung gesetzt wird.

Da ich mir diesen Schund nur ca. eine halbe Stunde gegeben habe, kann ich auch nur davon berichten was ich erlebt habe. 
Am Anfang erlebt man eine ziemlich miese Sequenz in der man sich aus einem brennenden Gefangenentransporter (der wie ein Schulbus aussieht) quält. Endlichen draußen steht ein Mann vor euch und erklärt euch, mit schrecklichem Audio und ohne seine Lippen zu bewegen, wie ihr eure Kräfte einsetzt. Ja Kräfte. Diese funktionierten aber nicht. Dann wird euch noch der Grund beigebracht, der dieses Spiel unglaublich einfach macht. Mit der Taste ""x"" ist es möglich die Zeit zu verlangsamen um Gegner zu makieren. Wenn die Zeit wieder normal weiter läuft sind alle makierten Gegner instant tot. Jeden, wirklich jeden Gegner kann man damit töten. Es hat keinerlei Konsequenzen diese Kraft einzusetzen, man verliert kein Mana oder Leben und der Cooldown beträgt ca. 5 Sekunden. Es scheint fast so, als wäre dieses Spiel auf diesem Gimmick aufgebaut. Weil jede Waffe im Spiel eine zu hohe Streuung und zu wenig Schaden machen. Kommen wir zu den Gegnern. Es gibt Zombies, Spinnen, Flammenmagier, Gegner die aussehen als würden sie dem Ku Klux Clan angehören und Minotauren (jedenfalls habe ich diese gesehen, ob es mehr gibt weiß ich nicht).  Die Sounds die diese Gesellen von sich geben sind unglaublich laut und es gibt keinerlei Möglichkeiten die Lautstärke ingame zu ändern.

Das war mein Eindruck zu dem Spiel. (liest das hier überhaupt noch einer ?)
Das Spiel ist schlecht. Richtig schlecht. Vielleicht das schlechteste Spiel, das ich je gespielt habe.
Das wäre vielleicht nicht so schlimm wenn dieses Spiel kostenlos wäre, dem ist aber nicht so. 
10€ sind für ein total unfertiges Spiel viel zu teuer. Dieses Spiel verkörpert das  Problem von Early Acces.
Ich habe mir das Spiel in einem Bundle für Rund 2€ mit 8 anderen Spielen geholt. Mehr ist es auch nicht wert.

The game, as of now, would be comedy gold if the framerate were more stable.

From the unskippable cutscene where the shiny man appears to stop just short of hitting the zombie's head against the wall repeatedly to the smirking ventriloquist who slowly explains the controls which were already shown to the player in the form of a low-resolution splash-screen, everything in this game is pretty funny right now. Also, don't turn on your flashlight and run, as the light will bloom right off the gun model and into the camera, blinding you. And as for combat, well, I tried to kill some hoppy things with horns, but about 6 of them teleported in front of me right off the bat, and the 25 measly bullets I started with weren't enough to kill even one.

    I suggest you watch the first impression I did of this game because it truly has to be seen to be believed--However, I will put in some information on here as well. 

    TL;DR- Typical bad game with typical bad developer. Only thing that makes this case astonishing is the fact that the game is broken beyond repair and the dev is literally deleting forums because he doesn't like negative feedback. 

    My involvement with A New Reckoning came about when I saw Jim Sterling cover it in a Squirty Play. It looked godawful and I had to check the Steam page for more information. After experiencing firsthand how ready the dev is to censor his critics and prevent as much criticism as possible I had enough. He had banned me from the forums for simply saying I was going to review the game. This is my hoorah, my big step against this developer. This game is so bad typical critique conventions don't even come into play. There is no game to critique, it has awful controls, no rebinding, TWO graphics options and literally broken combat(magic currently doesn't work) The FPS is incredibly low for something that looks like its from a bargain 2001 PC game and it crashes constantly(10-15 times during my recording of footage). This game is beyond trash and the fact that it exists on Steam is pure heresy. The developer has shown not only incompetence but also his sad attempts at censoring criticism this awful game gets.",1408140005,1408152117,False,30,4,0.612197637557983398,20,False,False,True,False,,,

Keep in mind I am completely aware that this is an early alpha, and I'm loving every moment of this adventure. 
**not sarcasm...seriously**

1: The first time I played this (back when it first got on steam), there was a cinematic with a bus ride, the bus exploded or something, and the game began. I walked into a city like environment, with a couple different guns, each with pretty descent looking particle effects, and tons of giant spiders coming at me. Clearly early alpha, but seemed like a good start. There was an actual hud, and what seemed like descent horde-like gameplay (reminded me a bit of a poor mans Pain Killer). I'll give it time come back to it a few months later...see how it progressed.

2: I heard that Jim Sterling did a video on this. This was just a couple weeks ago. During Jims video you see a now stationary bus, with a guy on fire. The camera pans out of the bus, as if someone shoved the camera out of the back window of the bus, and the camera fell into the snow on its side. It or you stands back up, and you're in game. this time another snowy area, but with garages, some generic buildings, chain link fences, and some mismatched floors. After some walking, some zombies chased at him, then some spiders, and then a big spider who really liked to hump a rock. That was pretty much about it, no end of level, unless you count falling out of the level. I do not.

3: So after watching Jims video I decide to boot it up again. This Time I'm greeted with something completely different. I'm seemingly inside one of the Bus garages from the Sterling video, but now its more of a super dark train station, with clippable trains. But there's some actual gameplay...sort of. I'm quickly greeted by dozens if not hundreds of zombies, demons, hospital gowned children, all running at me...then running past me. ""OOOKIE"", I thought to myself. Now I'm running and running past these guys, make my way out of the bus station, and meet up with a bunch of soldiers statically shooting handguns..sort of (the hands move, but the guns didn't). That was the end of the level. Next level seems to take me into a subway, which kept would just crash and took me back to the title screen. I hit continue ans I started back at the begginning again. ALT F4...try again later.

4: I see another update for the game hit steam. Let's see if it's a different game this time! YUP! I start off in that Subway like level, the previous cityscape, bus, train station, and soldier all gone. Now I'm in a subway, and the game has a pretty cool opening which matched the design of this level. The HUD is missing though and replaced with just numbers and ugly boxes. But this time it's almost playable. The first level is pretty descent making my way around this subway like area, maybe a basement to a building, I'm not sure, but there's garbage EVERYWHERE! Tons and tons of garbage bags litter the place, but there's stuff to shoot, ammo to pick up, spells to cast, time to slow down, it's almost a functioning game. It was terrible, but I was almost having a good time (but I like bad things)...I even streamed it. The first level had an opening sequence with what seemed to be an actual story attempting to take place. I made my way through the first level, and started the second level. The game had new enemies, and this creepy guy who whispered loudly, ""I WILL KILL YOU"" ...actually kind of creeped me out a bit. 

  By the third level, I exit the the subway like area, and I'm now on top of a building. Demons all over, so I'm making my way through what seems to be an empty waiting line for a six flags ride, and come upon an elevator, that led down. I hop on the elevator, and it takes me to a storage room full of barrels and a giant door, door won't open, nothing to trigger the end of the level. That was that, but hey it was progress with about 45 minutes worth of glitchy but semi fun gameplay. 

5: Tonight, I see ANOTHER UPDATE! I'm like, ""I wonder if it's gonna be different again?"". I boot up the game. Same descent opening cinematic. But then it drops me back into the Sterling version of the game. WTF. All the goodness of the previous build...GONE. The snow field with the bus, fences and spiders back in full effect, only this time, the floors matched up,  there was a guy standing outside telling me how to cast spells and that I'd gain magic by running, which is good because I only got 24 bullets to use on the spiders that attacked me... But guess what...the spells did no damage and niether did the bullets. After some walking forward, a giant spider attacked and then the game just reset me to the title screen. WTF? ROFL!

---After all this, I have to wonder to myself, did this ""game"" get put on steam because the games developer was a Valve employees autistic little cousin? ""Is this ""game"" just a MASSIVE TROLL in disguise? Is this ""game"" a creation of a madman who restarts from scratch on every new build? Is this ""game"" social commentary on the state on Steams greenlight and Early Access? Is this ""game"" just a guy messing around with the Unreal 4 engine with no clear direction?

It has changed tremendously since I first played the game in July, 2014. Have the changes been good? No, not at all. I have played several different versions of this game, not 1 has been worth my time. The lag is terrible, you get stuck on the ground, the zombies slide around rather than walk, the spider warps around and is too hard to kill. If you're lucky enough to kill the first spider you soon find out that there 2 more of the d*mn things! Thats the first level of the released game. The last time I played, you started in the prison, the time before that a bus. Its a clunky, laggy, unenjoyable mess that wishes it was a game. 

The first time I played this there were not any enemies except for some zombies on the other side of a fence that was bulletproof. I walked aimlessly around and finally found some zombies (I think there were around a dozen) that didnt attack just shuffled along bumping into walls. None of them reacted to gun shots, none of them tried to attack, so I shot 'em all, walked around a bit longer, found nothing of interest then quit. I tried this again, crash! crash! crash! very unstable POS. I know that its EA, but come on! Make at least enough of a game (its not a game, not even a decent demo) that the players get a good sense of whats supposed to be going on in the story/game.

I've been playing ANR since the middle of July and the game has gone thru quite a few changes and improvements from when I first picked it up. Yes it is buggy, yes I've fallen thru the floor on more then one occasion but I understand it's in the early stages where the real game gets shaped. If you're looking for a completely polished game then I'd say wait to purchase it but if you're like me & have fun finding the bugs, trying to break the boards, falling thru the floor, etc. then pick up the game. 

The guys at Panzer are working hard on putting the game together with the help of us, the early players. Whenever I've submitted bugs they've been fixed and improved upon without having to wait a few weeks to sometimes months. That alone is a testament to the commitment these guys have made to make the game the best it can be. If you go into the game knowing there's a long road ahead in terms of development then you will have fun helping to shape it.

Quote ""panzergamingstudios  [developer] 4 hours ago 
You are actually correct that was a typo on a very old verison of the game with the X moving backwards. X has never moved you backwards. What you saw was a typo, and in that case with that typo being almost or well over a month old. I see here you have not played the game in the past 2 weeks. If you did you would notice X fires of a Spell from the RPG system. Yes that is correct a RPG system is being developed right now. I strongly suggest you update your review. I normally just leave reviews alone and learn from them however considering these circiumstances I think you did this just out of ignorance. If not that this review never would have been posted because X again has never moved you backwards like ever.""


So.... according to the developer, this was a massive typo, and I should not post reviews / comments unless I have played the game within the last two weeks. The developer has strongly suggested that I update my review.
However, what the developer seems to forget that their videos are an indication of the game as a whole and as such should be quality assured and checked for such errors. Failing to do this will result in some pedantic Steam user (Me) pointing this out.

My comment above was actually questioning the validity of the information shown in the video. Surely Kickstarter and crowd sourcing models should accept questions of this kind, so that the typos / videos / errors can be corrected. Unfortunately, Panzergamingstudios seems to think that this is a just a reason not to leave a review alone and resort to calling me ignorant and suchlike. 

I freely admit to not having played the game for a while, because when I did play it, it bore no resemblance to any of their promotional videos. I posted this comment whilst reviewing the latest updates, to see if it was worth me reinstalling the game to try again. I found an error, so I am being called ignorant as a result.

I sincerely hope that the quality assurance in this game is better than it is for their promotional material.",1407059947,1407432548,False,27,0,0.594692230224609375,17,False,False,True,False,,,

So, I understand this game is ""Early Access"", I really need to stress that point so you know i'm not whining about not receiving a AAA+ title immediately, it's just that I tend to take the term ""Early Access"" as meaning toward the end of development, not the 3rd day after you woke up and said ""Hey here is the game i'm going to make.

But since i've owned this game I have attempted to play it over and over again after big updates and everytime i am met with the same thing, lagging, nonsensical title screens and excuses on why it will be better next week or month or update.

So i paid my $10, I patiently waited for you to provide me with some exciting gameplay, a storyline, even a single playable mission would be fine by me, just one mission that outlines the potential of the finished product, but this is not even approaching that. I really think this game is an abuse of the early access system so you can get some money to develop your game with absolutely no risk of it failing since there are no refunds leaving you to be able to drag your feet and make paid up consumers wait months on end with no end in sight. It's an abuse of an otherwise great idea and I urge that nobody buys this game or any other games the developer has in early access, at the very least until they are released in full.

Original: Indie Gala's Blood Knights Bundle had this 'Early Access' game featured alongside games like Syberia II, Zeno Clash 2, Rock of Ages, Blood Knights, M.U.D. TV, Gearcrack Arena, and Oinken for about $4.99, so - like many others - I really got 'A New Reckoning' by chance and can't honestly evaluate the price point for this in-development, early access game.  My system isn't the beefiest, but it can handle Wolfenstein: The New Order on medium resolution settings without a hitch.  With 'A New Reckoning'  I can't get through the inital cut-scene without my system's resources dwindling down to nothing.  Everything I see stuttes and hiccups on the monitor in front of my eyes.  Upon changing resolution settings, I get more of the same.  To be fair, I'm going to reserve any judgement against this game until I can actually play though it on some level a meatier system or determine if that actually alleviates the issue.

Time Ramesside is a horrible first person shooter first and foremost, but each and every iteration is different. Every update has a new start level and after spending more than twelve hours in the game and making extensive bug reports to the developers, I've still never once completed any of the dozen first levels that I've played.

This version is completely different than the last version I played two months ago. The game has been completed and finished for half a year now, but it continues to be worked on. Time Ramesside has gotten better yes, but for every step forward it takes a huge leap back and breaks its legs. Now that the game is finished its been announced this was only the first episode. I have a feeling that's their way of cutting the game into thirds without finishing it.

The last version I played started me off with an extremely long cut scene after another cut scene and on top of that was another cut scene. My player fell out of a small prison bus and made his way into a prison dodging cameras that would close the doors if he was spotted. Its odd that trying to get into a prison would close giant gates, but whatever. Why question the logic? The structures hovered above ground, but nothing was as bad as the spawning arachnids that could kill the player easy and spawn in right on top of him.

Oh but this current update has you in front of a prison on a bridge, but now its a warmer setting. The ground is covered with shallow pools of water and there is grass overtaking everything. Its abandon except for the flesh less zombies inside.the yard. These zombies spawn in mid air on top of one another so one can be hovering over a cluster of other zombies. This is nothing new. The animations look strange and stiff, but I suppose its better than the T pose they originally had.

That's one of the downfalls of releasing a game too early to the public. We get a chance to remember and sour future reviews. The developers would listen to constructive feedback and act like they'd do something about it, but at the end of the day when they put ""resolved"" on a bug in the forum it was never resolved so much as acknowledged yes this is a bug.

The controls are awful. Rather than typical strafe with the left and right, you're forced to turn with the left and right as if its the mid nineties all over again. Its quite a tease having rebindable keys that save, but you're still stuck with the default control scheme. There are also two different sections to rebind your keys when there only needs to be one. That's how flawed the game is when there are so many problems with the menus.

As you walk on the long bridge from a wrecked semmi into the prison you're greeted with floating text blurbs instructing you how to play. How to pick up weapons, use spells and hop into a wormhole for health. It just looks awkward having the floating prompts light signs rather than on your heads up display. This heads up display I should mention looks a lot better than it did before, which originally was drawn text and ugly simple shapes.

As a game, Time Ramesside is just dull. There are zombies and arachnids to shoot, but the real game here is playing spot the issues. Such as weapons to pick up that have blue boxes around them, but the blue boxes are facing a different way than the weapon. Tires that are in pavement and walls that hover in the air. There are also invisible walls blocking obvious doorways.

One plus is that the needlessly long cut scenes have been removed. Perhaps they were just moved further into the game. I'd much rather have a game to play than get lost in the cut scenes.

Time Ramesside is also a game known for its stock assets and I have no problem with that, but just make a good game to compensate for it. You can make something good, get money for it and then add custom models, textures and everything afterward. All I want is an enjoyable game I can play, but this is at the bottom of the barrel. There is no program icon to the game and its still known as ""shootergame-win-32-shipping."" That alone is a testament to the quality you're getting.

Another thing that makes this game an unyielding beast is the file size compared to what you get with the game. Its just a far too huge game for the low quality of its assets. Even with the highest settings it looks sub par for the large file size. That's the fault of the high quality engine though as is the texture pop in. When larger developers struggle with the same thing its tough to hold that against Time Ramesside.

I've seen this project for far too long and while it has gotten marginally better over the past six months, its still a horrible game. I doubt the developers have the talent to make it any better than it is. However, they do seem determined to keep pressing on, so that's always a positive. The only catch now is they're pressing on with the second episode of a game so bad it should be legendary if only it was better to be legendarily bad. Does that even make sense?

There's no flair, passion or zest here. Even with a completed game it was still dead on arrival to an angry mob. A second episode will only yield the same results. The developers will make a great looking trailer of footage that I'll be unable to find in the game when I play it.",1405441376,1443534611,False,115,0,0.774999141693115234,11,False,False,False,False,,,

So this is going be a tricky review to make since I'm making one on a game that doesn’t really have much more then potential to it at the moment. The game in question in A New Reckoning by a company called Panzer Gaming Studios. 
The game itself is about….well I don’t know cause it does not have a story as of yet, nor any named characters for that matter making it hard for me to find something to talk about in the way of story and characters (obviously). 

So what I'm going to do is talk about the POTENTIAL the game has, and some thing's I can see improvements in. For that I took a closer look at the developers behind the game, Panzer Gaming Studios. And there was not much to tell at all, what I did find out was that the game was a kick starter project and not much else. 
The game itself is as I sad so far without a story to it so I can't tell you what it is about, alien invasion some kind of virus, or maybe just some dude at a Justin Bieber concert, that would explain all the hell demons on earth and why you wake up in prison.  Who knows at this stage, what I can tell you though, is that it is moving forward as far as developing is concerned. When I first got into the game you started in the great outdoors. There appeared to be zombies roaming around (or skateboarding as their legs weren't always moving) some plant monsters and the occasional bug monster. And you had a flashlight…..yes that was it. You where supposed to hold a gun I was sure because of the way one held one’s hands. But no gun was visible and no ammo either. Best I could do was to run around yelling ""bang bang"" in the hopes all my enemies would be very dodgy on the heart. The game was totally broken, my enemies and I would continually fall through the world as the ground broke, waterfalls that ended in nowhere and lakes that were just as hard as the rock around them. 
Since then however it has developed to at least four levels (at the time of writing) maybe more but that’s as far as I could go, less skating zombies, a new enemy type and 3 different weapons and ammo. It's come a long way, and I hope it will continue down this road. But I also see a lot if disinformation around this game. But more about this later, let's start with the game. 
When you start the game you break out from your cell by bashing a zombies head in during a very simple cut scene. Still I liked that it was there. I don’t know if this is the real beginning of the game, but for now, this is what it is. You then get to make your through an almost maze like surroundings as you try to find your way out. You will encounter zombies, and in many cases a lot of them in 3 different forms, as well as a new demon enemy that I really like so far. Even though the animation for it is not yet complete I still think that it is a nice one and it brings the game from the common ""zombie genre"" to something else, maybe a demon invasion, or hell rift at some place. I don’t know the story of the game yet. But the demon is a nice addition to the game at this point. 
Among these enemies are a few bug ones as well, imagine an overgrown face-hugger from Aliens that mated with an ant or a mosquito without wings. I like them (except in level two, but I will leave the ""why"" up to you to find out) they need a bit of work though, especially the big one that serves as a boss in level one as it gets stuck in one place for most of the time, which obviously makes it really easy to kill. In the outdoor levels you also encounter a plant monster that too looked kind of cool. It does not move right but it should be nice when the game is ready for its release. 
Other than that, there are, as of now 3 weapons in the game as well; a normal assault rifle not a bad one but aiming down sights can sometimes cause the bullets to fly off in random directions; a shotgun that is all but good - The first shot from it will look like you shot a big flare and nothing else, It’s a big boom that only serves to blind the shooter himself and the second shot simply goes off with a poof to compensate for the solar flare it just threw in your face. My favourite of the 3 is the crossbow. Now the only way to make one of those better is explosive arrows, and what do you know...it has! Not only that, it also has some glowing mystical stuff that explodes. Not sure what it is, but it definitely explodes when it hits enemies and that’s half the battle right, making stuff explode. 
The levels themselves are so far very simple as far as walls, floors and ceilings go, but they do get better when you get outside. I just wish there were more levels outside as I found them more enjoyable to play (and I did not get lost either). They don’t have much in the way of decorations either, with just a few pipes and wot-nots, as well as a few corpses here and there, but it's not more than that. Still, it’s an alpha and I do see a lot of improvements from its earlier stages. 
Now there is not much else to the game at this point, but I did want to talk about some of the disinformation about the game. First off, the rumour that the game has been cancelled...nope, it was merely renamed as the developers went over to a new engine, now working in the UE4 engine instead of UDK. So the game is still up and running. 
Secondly there were people that thought themselves tricked as the game they bought into was nothing at all like the trailer that was shown on the games Steam page in the store. I can understand this in some ways but on the other hand people should have figured as the trailer was from the supposedly finished game, and not the alpha build we have now. I too was a bit ""What the f**k is This?"" and still, I knew it was an alpha game. As I said though they are moving forward with the game in the right direction and I’d also like to say that many of the things people complain about is mainly of what they believe is false advertisement of the game to come. For example there is a picture of what looks like a huge scorpion on the developer’s Facebook page that I so far have not seen in any of my game plays. I sympathize with the developers though, because it takes times to make a game, however, maybe one should be careful about what one posts and how one does it. Why not label it work in progress, and people will not have to feel fooled or tricked that they did not find it in the game. 
My final words for now about ‘A New Reckoning’, is that it has potential, and I would love to play the final product. And I really hope the developers keep working on this. Even though it's not there today I believe it will be in the future, I just hope it won't be too far in the future.  I will come back to this title at a later stage when it’s closer to release, but until then, happy gaming people.

Then when I press start I'm dropped into the middle of some sort of desert/forest/lake area.  There's a short loop of a wind sound playing.  My character is holding his hand out like he's got a gun, but he doesn't.  There's a flashlight shining magically in front of me from out of nowhere.  As I clumsily climb a nearby hill through an obscene amount of motion blur I see a building in the distance but assume it's part of a flat skybox graphic because the depth of field is horrible and everything is deliberately out of focus.  As I head towards it I realize it is actually real.  I hear a weird noise as I cross a lake, then notice spider arms to the left and right of the screen as my life meter slowly drops.  I turn around but keep running backwards.  I see a giant...thing.  Maybe a spider?  Or a crayfish?  Can't be sure, but eventually it quits trying to softly hug me to death and runs away sideways for no reason at all.  After a long boring walk, I finally make it to the buildings.  I find a gun, and after much frustration realize I can pick it up by pressing E on my keyboard (no button on my Xbox 360 controller will do it).  A moment later everything freezes for a few seconds while the game loads up some music and an army of identical black zombies in orange jumpsuits.  As they slide unnaturally around the stage I shoot them and they begin to flop all over the place, stretching and morphing like blobs of silly putty.  Sometimes another spider-crayfish shows up and tries to hug me some more.  Sometimes one will shoot a fireball the size of a truck at me, and my graphics suddenly choke so bad I beg for the slip-sliding army of incompetent zombie clones and spider-crayfish to end my life.  Finally it happens and I quit.

I don't know what the big deal is. The game is in early access. These developers are using the money for funding. There is a clear warning on the store page what the shape of the game is in. 

Now I am amazed at how well the developers handled Jim Sterlings video's and counter acted on both with his own. I thought it was great, and it really shows especially yesterdays update that this guy or guys or girls or who ever means business. I wasn't to sure at first a few days ago, but with that new update am hooked. I don't care what anyone else thinks you guys have my support. I am recommending this game when I go to ID Tech camp next week which is a bunch of gamers. 

Now let me tell you what I really love. You never know what to expect each time you play this game, and am not saying this in a bad way at all. But one day it could look the same and play the same and the next day BAM major improvement.

I don't like to ""view-bait"" but quite frankly the video coverage I did on the game can explain why this game is so shoddy, better than words can. (videos at the bottom if you are interested - otherwise, I have updated with written summary)

EDIT: I understand some people will want a ""written"" response, so here is a quick summary of why the game is so terrible - again, more information and demonstrations as well as a critical case-study can be found in the videos below.

Summary:
 - FULL of bugs and glitches to near-unplayability.
 - Often crashes on loading or transition screens.
 - Terrible level design with glitchey and misplaced terrain.
 - Monster or 'zombie' AI is beyond stupid, often glitching out, running away and plain not working.
 - NO customisation options for graphics, audio or keybindings. (""high"" and ""low"" is not graphical options, don't even try to kid yourself.)
 - Terrible optimisation throughout. (very high end GPU and CPU user struggling around 20fps... not good.)
 - Large amount of stock assets, those that are original are simply poor in every respect.
 - Awful graphical fidelity, with hugely varying texture resolutions.
 - Blinding use of ridiculous effects.
 - Gunplay mechanics are very poor with no realistic gun handling, just some up-kick and generic cone-of-fire.
 - Zombies often become invincible and glitch out.
This is just a basic run-down... I could go on for days...
