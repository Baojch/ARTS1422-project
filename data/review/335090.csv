A long time ago, I discovered real speed in video games, while playing F-Zero GX on Gamecube. Since I'm more a PC guy now, I don't have it anymore ; so I always pay attention to games which could be my new F-Zero.

I had this in mind somewhere when I bought Goscurry, and definitely, it doesn't fit in the square F-Zero left empty.

But it's a f*ckin' awesome game ! The kind of game which seems to be desperately slow and easy. And then you fall. And then you die. And no more than 8 seconds were necessary to terminate yourself ! Wtf man, wtf.

It's not game-changing, mechanics are well known, jump or dodge, and turn, and then combinations, and then faster.

Graphic style is generic, the ""cities"" you unlock are some random 3D cubes with fog. The variety is... Wait no, it doesn't even exist ! I see the attempts though. The different vehicles feel actually different. Maybe it's only my mind, but when I unlocked the second, it felt more speedy than the default one.

The music is decent, average 8-bit fast-paced beats. More enjoyable than in Velocibox.

So why I love it ?

Challenge, mate. It's painfully difficult. And really well-coded, efficient, clean, fun. You will experience pain (a lot), and you will be rewarded. Same feeling than in F-Zero, when I explode or go off-road because of mixing up the controls (NO I WANTED TO DODGE AND I JUMPED NOOOOO).

First level is training ; you can play without the random obstacles. And even this is difficult, I can't go past 200k points because each time I turn too late or too early.

Second level is harder : same speed with random obstacles and speed boosts. Camera still follows you.

Third made me laugh : it is exactly the same as second but, the - camera - is - FIXED. It means that often, you have to press the ""left"" key when your mind want to go right. It's not something you notice in GTA while escaping the cops, because you've got time to translate what your mind says. But here, it's so fast, you're dead before you had time to think. You have to adapt.

Last levels are not human, until you play for a few dozen of hours and make your Goscurry skill.

And the beauty of all of this ? IT'S PROCEDURAL !

Meaning that it's totally random. There's not patterns like in Super Hexagon, where pattern study and recognition can make the game easier after ten hours of playing. Here it's only about your reflexes. And you can actually dodge the obstacles by making a fast left-right, which is fun and add variety to the gameplay.

Last feature, this one finished to buy me : you can change the audio track while you're playing. Maybe it seems ridiculous, but I like this kind of detail. It's spice. Like everything in this game, it shows that the devs care more about the players than about the fact they develop a game. I like it. There are a lot of details in this game that are useless for the gameplay and quite tiny in the final game weight, but these details are what give to this game its charisma. Great job here.

So, for all of this...

You like skill-based, mind-bending, fast-paces, fun, hard, arcade-type games ? Buy it and suffer.

You don't usually like these games ? Super Hexagon and Velocibox scare you ? Fortunately, this game can be convenient for everybody. The levels begin quite slowly, you have time for adapt. It's not screwing you in the third second like Velocibox. Whoever you are, buy this game, it's an indie arcade gem.

C'est sans compter sur les achievements, ces graals qui nous poussent à cliquer sur ""restart"" à chaque échec, et surtout sur les leaderboards mondiaux. Ceux-ci laissent l'opportunité à quiconque persévère un minimum d'y inscrire son nom. Leaderboards généraux, mensuels, hebdomadaires et quotidiens propres à chaque mode de difficulté tendent à nous faire evenir inlassablement vers Goscurry. Le vrai attrait du jeu réside cependant à mon sens dans l'ambiance, tant visuelle que sonore, qui happe le cerveau et tente -rarement en vain- de le mettre dans une état de transe. Le fameux ""flow state"" où notre cerveau se met en pilote automatique, et que rien d'autre n'existe pour nous que ce qui défile devant nos yeux hypnotisés. Et bien ça, c'est la sensation la plus jouissive et satisfaisante que procure Goscurry.

As hopeless as that may seem the game constantly conveys to you one simple uplifting message; ""Don't Panic"". This is much easier said than done as panic is your worst enemy in Goscurry, the first sign of hesitation being your instant downfall. Flashing texts across the rooftops of a slick retrofuture city of minimalistic neon buildings bearing distracting, sometimes encouraging messages and what seem to be references to The Beatles (""You Are 'Not' the Walrus"") and Pink Floyd (""Crazy Diamond"").

Here you'll find the hypnotizing and maze-like pathway following mechanics of a game like Super Hexagon combined with the obstacle dodging action of titles from the likes of Bit.Trip Runner that all require a serious amount of focus and finger gymnastics. A long stretch of winding and unpredictably twisting road that procedurally builds itself before you, infinitely until your inevitable death. Many hazards litter the abstract urban road ahead forcing you to jump, dash, and dodge your way to a badass highscore you can really be proud of.

Reaching certain target scores in any respective mode unlocks new cities of different flourishing colors to discover and rush through, as well as giving you a higher rank in your overall achievement score. Ranking up earns you slick new rides to drive and fly with. The more insane of players may even earn all 20 ranks giving them the legendary and sought-after Psycho ship, which when used will speed up the game and raise your score no matter what the mode.

As incredibly addictive as Goscurry is, I feel like what really drives your adrenaline here is the catchy as can be electro-beat soundtrack from master musician Isak Martinsson(who is currently working on the wonderfully creepy adventure game, [url=http://www.franbow.com]Fran Bow[/url]), equally as hypnotizing and entrancing as watching the flow of your stylish little rocket ship through each mind-bending stage of twists and turns. An excellent audiovisual combination assaults your senses and is the driving force in your speed and focus as you reach further and further for that final stretch of road.

tl;dr:

Goscurry is a game that gets right to the point, avoiding all of the pre-fun bullshit, all of the fluff and filler of other games and diving right into the fun and mayhem. Just zone out, follow the twisting path of the line ahead, and lose yourself to the beat of the music as it electronically charges your mind and body putting you into that nostalgic state of euphoria needed to find the flow.

Decent visuals overall, colours switch according to progress and new music tracks playing, city rooftops display a range of tongue in cheek messages that can be quite easy to miss. Making your way through each level the game rewards you with the ability to select from alternate ships, each having their own characteristics.

Goscurry starts with the game showing you a warning message. I don’t know the exact words by heart but it pretty much comes down to the following: by playing the game you agree that you’re going to play an extremely hard game which, of course, is both scary and exciting. So which one of the two is it really?

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
When you start your first game you’ll probably crash within just a few seconds, and if you’re lucky it might take a few seconds longer, or, in the best case scenario, a few minutes. Either way it won’t take long before you crash your ship. It’s most likely the simple visuals that fooled you.

The gameplay is reminiscent to games from the arcades where the story usually didn’t matter and the gameplay was shallow, but hard and addictive. Goscurry is exactly that; it’s extremely simple in its execution and very shallow, but at the same time you can’t help but restart the game every time you crash. It’s very addictive but needs to be played in same doses. It’s not a game meant to be played for hours and hours, but, in the end, that’s still up to you of course.

This really is game of skill, not memory, because the tracks are randomly generated and you need to have good reflexes if you want to make it far. Tracks will get increasingly more difficult and the speed will also ramp up and if you don’t pay attention it will take but a millisecond to make a fatal mistake. But you’ll try again and again if you have the determination.

Score enough points in a mode and do it several times and you’ll unlock new ships to should make things a little easier for you while also providing a bit of new eye candy. Problem is that it will take several hours before you’ll have unlocked a second one. I only managed to unlock one and I had a hard time doing it.

The first mode is called Training mode and if you die here you probably have no idea what to expect from the Hard and Pro modes. The fact that it’s called Training mode is discouraging to newcomers; it takes at least 30 minutes, most likely even longer, to get the hang of things. In Training mode the camera will follow you so that it’s easy/easier to turn and there are no obstacles you have to avoid. In Hard mode the camera will follow you but there will be obstacles and in Pro mode the camera will be fixed, making things even harder. Don’t ask me what the Speedfreak or Paranoid modes do because, to be honest, I didn’t want to find out.

Besides the obstacles there are some visual distractions. Distractions that bothered me. I’m not sure if they’re there for the fun of it or if they’re really there to distract you because that is what it felt like to me. The subliminal messages, the messages on the buildings, the pop-in messages that show you the city and/or tracks; it all distracted me. At first, at least, because later on you learn how to automatically ignore these distractions. Still, I wish this was done differently. It feels like an artificial way to make the game harder.

In the intro I also talked about the warning/disclaimer message that the game shows you pretty much immediately after booting it up. It feels unnecessary to have this message in the game if people already bought your game. People looking for a way to relax might quit the game immediately and never look back. I’d rather see this message posted on the product page, where it belongs in the first place.
Now, I haven’t really talked about how the game controls. I’m sorry for this; the game feels like a simplified Audiosurf where the game accelerates for you and it’s up to you to move left, right, backward or forward while avoiding or jumping over obstacles and gaps. The controls are very good and responsive and make the game a joy to play (don’t think this too literally, though ;)).

[h1]Audio & Graphics[/h1]
Musically Goscurry is pretty good. It has some electronic, up-tempo beats that give off a lot of energy and keep you going. Other than that there isn’t much to be found here as far as audio is concerned.

The visuals aren’t the best in the world but they get the job done. You have a colorful ship and a colorful city with very basic geometry (I don’t know if it looks any different/better if you get any further. I’m afraid I wasn’t able to pull it off.) It’s very simplistic but it’s all very clear and one of the things that actually doesn’t manage to distract. I talked about Audiosurf earlier and the game has that same kind of vibe, minus the neon (effects).

[h1]Length[/h1]
Here is where Goscurry really shines. The game is infinitely replayable just because it’s so damn hard, so it will take you many, many hours to make even a bit of progress and it will probably take you days, maybe even weeks, to finish it at all. I don’t think many people will finish it, however, because like Dark Souls it takes a lot of dedication. I actually think Dark Souls is easier and that’s saying something…

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While Goscurry plays like a lot of games from the 80’s and early 90’s. If you were a kid back then you probably kept replaying and replaying a game until you finished it. And then you played it again. I was one of those kids. But these are different times and I don’t think people, myself included, will find the energy to keep playing this over and over again. As I mentioned; it’s a game best played in small doses. It’s even fun in small doses. But play it for too long and you’ll probably grow tired of it soon enough. I don’t hate Goscurry, on the contrary, but I’ve definitely played better games in this genre than this.

[h1]Too long, didn’t read[/h1]
Pros:
+ Addictive
+ Enjoyable in short sessions
+ Skill based (might understandably be a – for some)

Mixed:
+/- The difficulty might scare people off

Cons:
- Takes too much effort to unlock (better) ships and new cities
- Disclaimer message shown [i]after[/i] you bought the game
- It’s just too hard
- Not so good if you would to play it in long(er) sessions

However, it is hard. Like, legitimately hard. If you aren't in to being challenged, don't pick it up. The controls are easy to use and incredibly responsive, and there’s even a boost that makes you move faster for anyone who loves speed. There’s a decent amount of replayability that comes from the leaderboards and achievements, as well as the 5 different modes available, so if you’re in to any of that you’ll likely have a good time with this game. There’s also great aesthetics, and some amazing music.

Here is a first impression video and a quick 2 minute “summary” video, followed by a written review below:

First Impressions: http://youtu.be/70PllPUbGtM

2 min video: http://youtu.be/PPwElfxrY64

In this game you follow a procedurally generated track, which means that it's more about reflexes as opposed to learning tracks. As time goes on, the track will get increasingly more difficult, throwing more turns and hazards at you that must be dealt with. When it comes down to it, the controls are fairly simple. You have turn left, turn right, jump, dodge and boost. While jumping and dodging are used to avoid hazards, boost will make you move at a much faster rate, but gain a higher score multiplier. There are also special 'speed boost areas' that will move you at a speed comparable to that when using the manual speed boost, but will either give you a straight section with more frequent hazards, or one with no hazards but a ton of turns.

So I mentioned above that the controls are responsive, and that’s no joke. One thing I noticed is that if you make a mistake, it is entirely possible to fix it. Hell, if you’re fast enough, you can do things like turning right 3 times instead of turning left – you have that degree of control, which is great when it comes to a game as fast paced as this one.

Having said that, being precise is incredibly important in this game. Mistiming a dodge or jump will be the end of you, and there is little room for error, particularly when it comes to dodging the taller hazard. However, the game does feel very fair, and when you die it’s because you messed up, not because the game did.

There’s a degree of replayability due to the leaderboards, as well as the achievements. Through completing achievements you can actually unlock alternate ships to play as, which aside from the most difficult to unlock won’t actually alter gameplay, but some do look pretty cool. Also on the note of replayability there are 5 different modes that change up the rules a little, so there is that bit of variety. The first 3 modes (Training, Hard and Pro) seem like 3 difficulty levels that ramp up, where as the other 2, Speedfreak and Paranoid, seem like a bonus.

The way it works is that in Training, the camera follows in a sort of zoomed out third person view, and there are no hazards. In Hard, the camera follows at the same angle, but hazards are added. Pro changes the camera angle up - it gives you more of a top-down view and doesn't turn when you do, meaning you do need to think about which way the ship is facing when you make turns. Speedfreak is a mode made up entirely of those two special speed boost sections I mentioned earlier, just one after the other. Paranoid on the other hand takes the top-down camera angle, but changes the hazards up a bit. Instead of just having just yellow hazards that must be avoided, purple hazards are added in to the mix, which you must run into, and if you miss one, your run is over.

Aesthetically, this game is very well done. The background looks great, but doesn’t draw too much attention from the things in the foreground, which are clearly displayed and look pretty nice themselves. Also, Goscurry has some amazing music, which is good because as far as I could tell the music was involved in the procedural generation of the track itself, so listening to it can actually help out with the timing of your actions. Also, if you don’t like a song you can just skip it, which is a very nice addition since it does give you that control over what you’re listening to.

The final thing to mention is the price point. Some may consider this to be a bit expensive for what it is – personally, I think it’s absolutely fine because of the time I’ll get out of it, but I would understand if people thought it was a bit much.

Just one tip for anyone who picks this up: I found it a bit hard using down as my evade key, and would frequently get mixed up when trying to turn or jump and then evade immediately afterwards. Thankfully all controls are fully rebindable, so I ended up rebinding it to a lone key used by my other hand and it was much easier.

Anyway, fantastic game, lots of fun and if you’re into this genre, I highly recommend it!",1421421056,1421424208,True,7,0,0.565217375755310059,0,False,False,False,False,,,
