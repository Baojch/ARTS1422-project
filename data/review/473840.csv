It's a whopping 24 years old at the time of this review.  The game runs in a Java runtime environment and lacks proper widescreen aspect ratio support (it's locked at 4:3) or support for any modern gaming display resolutions, hasn't been modernised or updated to run smoothly on modern gaming PCs.  Alt + Tab will cause the game to crash immediately.  Despite this lack of modernisation and zero testing, it carries a pretty high price tag for such an ancient game.  This seems to have been put on Steam as a nostalgia gouge.

I understand developers will often do these nostalgia gouges from games that were dearly loved fan favourites.  But in this case Diib's Dilemma went straight into the shovelware bins at launch, it was never considered a quality game.  Some context for anyone who wasn't around back then, but in 1999, PC gamers were pretty busy and pretty happy with Starcraft, Valve's Half-Life game (don't know if you heard about that one but it was pretty big), Rainbow Six, System Shock and Baldur's Gate.  For context, Java games didn't quite catch on to the same extent. 

So if you try to take this Java game seriously, you'll see it's an old school action strategy game that revolves around building up and using powerful spells, and dodging enemies like crazy while your cooldowns tick over.  And that might seem okay but the technical execution is just subpar even for 1999. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

Comically, the game was written in Java (I'm not making this up).  Talk about not using the right tools for the job.  Might as well try to bake a cake with a screwdriver.  The extremely poor choice of game engine here is a major contributing factor to the defects with the game.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Diib's Dilemma is relatively expensive for an abandonware nostalgia gouge, at $2 USD, and it's not worth it.  The game is just too old, hasn't been modernised, and wasn't even that good when it was new.  And as the old saying goes, you can't go home again.

首先从游戏的剧情和故事线来看显得相当平淡无奇。游戏的背景设定虽然独特，但故事情节缺乏吸引力和深度，角色塑造也显得单薄，缺乏足够的个性和情感表达。这使得玩家在游玩过程中难以对故事产生兴趣，也无法真正沉浸在游戏的世界中。

其次游戏的谜题设计同样令人失望。解谜冒险游戏的核心在于谜题的创意和挑战性，但在这方面却做得不够好。游戏中的谜题设计过于简单和重复，缺乏足够的创新性和深度，使得玩家在解谜过程中感到乏味和无聊。同时一些谜题缺乏合理的提示和引导，导致玩家在解决过程中感到困惑和挫败。

在游戏的画面和音效方面也未能达到玩家的期待。画面质量相对粗糙，缺乏细节和精致度，无法为玩家营造出沉浸式的游戏体验。音效方面同样令人失望，背景音乐单调乏味，音效效果也缺乏真实感和代入感，无法为游戏增色添彩。

此外游戏的操作体验也令人头疼。游戏在控制响应和界面设计方面存在一些问题，使得玩家在操作过程中感到不便和困扰。尤其是在进行复杂操作或快速切换时，这些问题更是频繁出现，严重影响了游戏的流畅性和体验。

最后从性价比的角度来看同样未能给玩家带来物超所值的体验。相较于其他同类游戏，它在剧情、谜题设计、画面、音效以及操作体验等方面都显得较为逊色，但价格却并不亲民。这使得玩家在购买时可能会感到不值，尤其是对于期待高质量游戏体验的玩家来说。

综上所述，在剧情、谜题设计、画面、音效、操作体验以及性价比等方面都未能满足玩家的期待。如果你对这款游戏抱有较高的期望，或者希望寻找一款更具深度和趣味性的解谜冒险游戏，那么这款游戏可能并不适合你。希望开发者能够在未来的作品中认真倾听玩家的反馈，不断改进和完善游戏的设计，为玩家带来更好的游戏体验。",1643484208,1711539884,False,0,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its a free web java game from 1999. It is buggy, glitchy, not very smooth, the controls can't be remapped so you'll be using arrow keys and numbers... still, despite that, I am going to cautiously, with a million disclaimers, recommend this game.

In Diibs Dilemma you play a wizard's apprentice challenged to go through a tower of 100 levels, with each level presenting one or more monsters you must fight. Monsters occasionally randomly drop 1 of 4 types of soulstones that you use to buy better spells. There are 40 different types of spells, some of which are just upgrades of previous spells. 

The bones, the core mechanics of this game, are very good. The game doesn't tell you what spells can be unlocked, they just appear as an option to build when you have built the prerequisite spells. I tried to find a spell list online and couldn't, so you are basically forced to discover the spells. This is actually pretty fun because of how varied and balanced the spells are. Ranged attacks, aoes with long cooldowns, traps of various kinds, summons, heals... there is a lot to choose from. And there are varieties of monsters to try them against such as quick ones, high damage ones, ones immune to types of damage, ranged attacking ones and others. Discovering all this is pretty fun, so long as you don't mind dying in some unfair ways. Luckily you can save between almost all levels so you never lose much unless you forgot to save.

But here come the caveats. There are a ton of little glitches and quirks. The exact moment a monster starts moving into a new square it no longer occupies the old square, even though 90% of its model is still there. Monsters can also become invisible and uninteractable when two move into the same square at the same time. Your character faces the way they moved into the square, and facing cannot be changed without moving squares. This all adds up to the actual levels feeling sluggish and messy. AoE spells are really good because aiming anything in this game is a nightmare. Also some monsters are immune to many types of spells, so you can literally enter a level unable to complete it (looking at you blue slimes), and level 99 is infamous for being impossible except with VERY specific spells. 

You can have fun experimenting with spells but you will need to be OK with save scumming, starting over, and just dealing with the jank involved in actual levels.

As a quick note, the graphics are and sound design are obviously pretty minimal, but they are actually quite effective. There is one song that plays over and over during levels, but its a bit strange and bombastic. Knights have loud human screams when they are hit and its the only noise they make. When you die there is a really dramatic cross with a blood red sky. Sure its minimal by modern standards, but they made some interesting choices and I think it works.

Bottom line, if you enjoy older games and don't mind overlooking a bunch of problems, don't mind what would now be considered really low quality assets, and don't mind starting over a lot... there is a really fun experience to be had here.",1638390430,1638390430,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Cooldowns in this game are LONG. You'll spend a large chunk of your time running around the board, avoiding being utterly ransacked and destroyed by primitive but relentless AIs. If you can survive long enough for you spells to pop back up, you'll juggle remembering which squares you left traps in, timing your attacks just right so they hit before you get smacked, or crossing your fingers and hoping your summons attack the enemy chasing you instead of the others one or everything, including you, at once.

Diib's Dilemma is an arcade style game where you are given a selection of spells to choose from which you take into a chamber to fight foes. More spells can be unlocked (built) by gathering soul stones, which are either dropped by enemies or given in groups of five each time you beat four rounds without taking damage. The battle screen is a grid, and its really up to you how you play. This game is not for the faint of hard, as it is quite hard.

The gameplay allows you to pick your own strategy, especially as you gather more spells, and rewards a player for performing well. You use the arrow keys to move on the grid and the number keys to fire the spell assigned to them. However, as soon as you begin moving to the next square, you can be hit as though you are on it, and the same rules apply to enemies, making it risky to step up to enemies, especially if you want to get that 0 damage. The game is RNG heavy, as not getting the right soul stones means not getting the right spells and you can fall into what feels like a hopeless situation.

A lot of little quality of life improvements could be made to make the game flow more smotthly, but is it really worth the effort? If the game was completely remade with no grid as a fast paced arcade game, I could see it as an instant classic or even an app to be played on the go, but for now I'll just have to enjoy it as a fun (and frustrating) piece of nostalgia. It's great to see old games like this come back and not be lost forever. For its current humble price, I can definitely recommend this game.",1464441269,1464441269,True,13,1,0.525369167327880859,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Minutes to learn, lifetime to master, this game shows its age but the core game is still solid and fun.  A warning to everyone right up front, this game can only be played with a keyboard.  Clicking on menu options or spells does nothing.

The sound and music and art also do not appear to have been upgraded at all since the original version was available.  I don't mind the retro feel, but know before you buy this one that it really was released 20 years ago.

The game is a devilishly deep puzzle game about strategy and resource management.  Take in a limited number of spells and figure out a way to survive to.... well to as far as you can make it, I've never beaten it in all the years.  There are a huge number of strategies to employ.  You simply put a spell in a slot, and then after you cast it you have to wait for it to reload.  Spells can be direct damage, summoning, traps, healing, score boosting, aoe, teleportation and on and on.  You command so much power, but when you are dead, you are done.  It is back to your last save or level 1.

The levels play very quickly, allowing you to build up power early to try new strategies in how to beat the levels.  Also, some monsters are immune to certain spells, but the game does not warn you of this, so some levels are a bit of trial and error.  This does make it so there is no one ""super build"" of spells that will let you get through every level of the game.  Or not that I have ever found.

Make no mistake though, this game is hard.  A kind of hard that doesn't exist in modern games.  You were warned.  If someone tells you they beat this, screenshot or it didn't happen.

Pros:
- Clever design
- Lots of spells
- Freedom to find your own strategy
- Lots of weird secrets and bonuses

Cons:
- Clunky, keyboard only controls
- Old art 
- Old sound
- Hard as nails

There is still an addicting game in there though.

The meat of the game is to survive through increasing levels of difficulty by upgrading the spells in your spell book with elements found battling in the levels.  Unlike other games of this type there are no maps to explore, instead each level will be the same-sized, square, isometric grid (presumably one floor of Diib's Dilemma Tower) which you then have to defeat all the monsters of the current level in order to progress.  You have a limited number of spell types to take into battle, 2 at the start of the game, and you must be able to cast spells to defeat monsters, and then dodge enemies as your spells slowly recharge.

Your character does not have levels or stats that increase as the game progresses, just the spells in his book.  At first there are 4 spells to choose from including attack spells, a trap and a heal spell.  After you have collected some of the 4 elements found defeating monsters, you can start creating newer and more powerful spells.  The real fun and strategy of the game is to experiment with different spell combos, and to discover new spells as you build up your spell book roster.  But be warned, this game has an old-school difficulty to it, traps you lay will be invisible once you have set them, and if you are the first to walk through the square then you will spring the trap and take the damage.  Also, many monsters require several hits to defeat and there are no shown lifebars, plus the mosnsters move all over, so it gets hard to keep track of which ones you have weakened and which you have not.  But all of that is designed to keep the strategy of the game interesting as there is not much variety to each level other than monsters types and the spells you choose.

This is an old-school game and it's graphics and audio lack the polish that simple games of today have.  The game doesn't even utilize the mouse, this is a keyboard game only which uses the arrow keys and the number keys in order to play.  And there are almost no options other than turning sound and/or music on and off.  However, given the fact that this game was made in the 90's and the game's low price point, I'm willing to overlook those points.  The overall movement of both your character and the monsters has a slight delay to it, making dodging and moving through the enemies a bit of a prediction game but I feel the quirky movement actually adds to the strategy and difficulty of the game in an interesting way.

Another point to mention is that this is a survival game more than a story driven RPG.  You are expected to die, and you will die and you accumulate a score as you play so that when you die you will have a top score chart to keep track of your best playthroughs.  This is not a global leaderboard but a personal top score chart.  And while you can save your progress, there is something to keep in mind:  The save files only keep track of your current tower level, the elements you have earned, and the spells you have purchased.   If you exit the game or die your score will be set to zero when you load up your save file and your currently selected spells will be reset to the basic fire spell, so keep that in mind when choosing to exit the game if you have worked up a nice score.

All in all, the age of the game shows in its graphics, sound, and play quality, but it has a unique strategy and style to it, which makes it an interesting game to play, even today.  It's super cheap and a little different than most games out there, so I recommend trying this game out if you don't mind playing older games and want a challenging game to play.",1464395423,1464395423,True,33,4,0.733328282833099365,0,True,False,False,False,,,
