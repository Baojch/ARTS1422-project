In my experience, the other reviews about this game being buggy are mostly untrue. You just have to be careful with your roster management (if you redshirt too many players and then have injury issues, you might not have enough players to field a 'whole' team and the game bugs out when this happens, for example) and save often.

This is an incredibly fun basketball sim game, and for $5 it is definitely worth trying out! There are so many different ways to build a team based on how you want to run your offense and defense that it adds a ton of replay value in my opinion. Balancing personalities and playing time between your players can be an interesting challenge too, especially once your team gets to be a perennial top-25 team. Recruiting is also one of the most interesting aspects of the game, with many different ways of filtering through players and competing with other schools for the hidden gems in each class. If you're looking for a college basketball sim game that involves building a team from the ground up through recruiting, roster management, and scheme selection then this is the perfect game for you!

Lastly, definitely get the Bloomington's Real World Full Mod for this game! It adds in all real-world NCAA teams and their historical stats. Makes the game much more fun to play, especially if you have a favorite NCAA team that you want to use. Find it using this link:

TLDR: This game was a great experience for those looking for a college basketball sim game, with immersive recruiting and interesting team building dynamics. It's a bit buggy, so save often and make sure you always have plenty of players ready to go for each game (too many injuries and redshirted players might lead to a bug).",1619103933,1619300424,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sadly I think game is so boring, no other way to say it.    Its just not fun to me.   I couldn't get immersed.   

I think this game could have been made in 1985.   Its probably one of the better bball games on steam but thats because there are like 4....   If you love staring at boring numbers that don't really mean much, if you don't mind very limited sound and no graphics and DOS like text you may enjoy it.
