Night play in Halloween is okay.  There should be some streetlights here and there...on the fountain and the club house, maybe light the path here and there.  This would give contrast and atmosphere to the dark.

The stroke is now less effective than before.  The stroke should have strength enough to at least leave a possibility of a hole-in-one on each hole.

The maple leaf cluster needs to disappear when the ball is selected.  It can cover the course.  The same with the stroke strength text. it could be smaller and translucent, or better yet, displayed under the ball.

Hole #1 in Halloween replays on single player.  Sometimes twice.  Sometimes several.

I'll still recommend it.  It can take some getting used to but after that it's a fun and satisfying short play game.





I almost didn't buy this game for the reviews that said it was difficult to control.  That's not really true.  I had no problem.  It isn't without its bugs...minor though.  If I condemn anything it would be its physics engine.  Bounce angles are not entirely predictable.  It didn't really distract from the game but you'll curse that first one.  No one is likely to ever get a hole in one but you can shoot under par.  It's fall in the game.  It would have been nice to pick a season, but then they'd have to rename it...Seasons Park Mini Golf.  Works for me.  The distant scenery is static so they could have given options on that as well.  It might have been a good touch to allow different putter weights.  There is an animated windmill.  More of the moving obstacles would have been appreciated.

All in all it has its appeal and was well worth the dollar purchase.  I won an ice cream sandwich and tried to feed it to the bunny but he wasn't having it.  Maybe next time I'll try the cupcake.",1571348756,1604242083,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That alone was worth $1 if it wouldn't have been coupled with the most frustrating, terribly-designed, physics-defiant, buggy, glitchy, ass-backwards excuse for a mini golf course imaginable.

Forget what you know about physics, fam. And forget what you know about putt-putt golf courses you've ever played. The devs of this game wanted to make sure to aggravate you as much as possible. Most of the holes of this ""mini golf course"" play like a ski-ball game at the arcade, except your ball is covered in glue. The ball is constantly stopping short of everything or flying wayyyyy too far past everything, there is no in between, my dudes.

After 18 holes I was ready to rage quit, I'd forgotten all about the relaxing autumn aesthetic, until they gave me a fucking cosmic brownie at the reward table for finishing the course at +55 stroke score. That felt amazing. A cosmic brownie?!?! Fuck yeah!

So then I go try the pumpkin patch course for some serious spoopy Halloween vibes. All the decorations were adorable but on this course you can't adjust the terrible fucking stock wailing sax jazz music and there weren't even nature sounds so I'm just slapping a ball around another 18 holes of sticky ski-ball to the awful sounds of stock music getting extremely frustrated. I did get another cosmic brownie from the reward table but there's not even a way to eat it... so... what has all this been for?

I would have kept the game if it was just the autumn park to wander around in, but I played everything in the game in 1.5 hours and that dollar is better spent toward a real putt-putt golf ticket this autumn or a cosmic brownie to eat in real life to reward myself for putting up with a broken game that sabotages all of its good points.

The physics in the game are good fore the price however at times can be a bit wonky/off

The controls in the game however are pretty awful with movement being extremely gittery and thrustrating. To hit the golf ball you either have to move the camera with the cursor to find the right ""power"" you want to hit the ball at. However left shift is useful if you do not want to move the first person camera whilst aiming. This is a useful feature as many times the ball will be behind an object and as without using the left shift feature you cannot look straight down , using left shift to use the cursor without moving the first person camera can really help.

The graphics are decent however there is very little difference between the highest and lowest graphical settings. The lighting could be improved however in many spots as well as a possible indication to where the hole it. In many occasions the hole itself is barely visible due to it blending in with the shading on the map. This could easily be fixed with a small indication to where the hole for better visibility of where your aiming for.

The music at times can be extremely obnoxious especially when you are trying to concentrate. An option to turn off the music would be great however in its current state this is not present.

It is a great foundation for a mini put game that if the creator continues to work on it, they could have a great game one day.

Pros:
-Walking around is cool
-I like the visuals 
-Ok course design

Cons:
- Controls are wonky 
EDIT 2: controls are better! almost perfect!
-""Pause Menu"" is just terrible. None of the elements make any sense together
EDIT: Pause menu is no longer terrible. Just a bit weird.

Controls are pretty bad though, and it doesnt have reversed y-axis for the mouse. It runs fine, looks fine too. The balls physics are great, and giving power to the ball is clear. The most fun i believe is walking around the park freely, it something i personally saw before.

So would i recommend it, yes; if you can live with the clunky controls.",1474151773,1474152065,True,15,0,0.601754307746887207,8,True,False,False,False,,,
