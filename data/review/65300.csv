After 750hrs, still haven't SS ranked every level.

Community content adds so much to the game. Dustmod, atlas and the dustkid website add so much extra to the game (it's unbelievable). 
Dustmod uploads all your runs to the leaderboards instead of just main category PB's (useful for dustkid leaderboards/achievements), adds community created mappacks and nexuses (i.e. hubs with their own maps, my personal favourite is clunkforce which is just the regular game with reeeeally janky physics), allows the use of various tools and cosmetics, helps with frame rate, has a daily map to play (the dustkid daily), allows installing other modifications and much more.
atlas.dustforce is owned by the devs (i think) and is a level sharing site where players can install, play, rate and upload maps.
dustkid.com stores the leaderboards and replays for every level for many categories (with both a score and time run for each category) and the combined leaderboards for many categories for every/any/all characters for over a dozen levelsets, and also has achievements to collect, and more.

I spent most of my playtime on the 5 low% categories on dustkid. Currently got a top 10 leaderboard rank for any character overall and WR for dustworth overall on all 5 of them for stock levels (although low% dustworth is a really weak WR). Whereas, in the overall ranking for the main category I am only rank #370. You can really find your niche and be awesome at it. 

Small but great community who are very supportive. Shoutout to idyll for being so nice and supportive even though I haven't even joined the discord. I even got to be a part of a 48hr mapjam (available to play on Dustmod or via atlas).

The replay system is amazing and watching other players makes it so much easier to learn how to improve. As a mapmaker it is also really great watching other players beat your maps.

The controls are difficult to get used to but have real depth.

Routing out maps for super niche categories is so so much fun.

Sadly, no in-game microtransactions (To be fair, dustforce came out before they were a big thing), still would have liked some way to support the devs more for the 100's of hours of fun I have had at least.

Even worse, it costs actual money to try with no demo or freemium (money is really hard to come by for anyone who isn't a boomer, you know).

Still, it is definitely worth the cost although I would probably never have bought dustforce if I didn't have benefits money that I needed to burn to avoid losing my benefits (the system really sucks, lol) or became interested in it when randomly looking through tvtropes.

Could easily see people spending 1000's of hours on dustforce (although I am currently suffering from burnout).

To be honest, I'm somewhat scared to reach this point. This game is extremely challenging, and in my opinion, it's not because of the game's complex level design or difficulty. The biggest challenge isn't the levels themselves, but the controls, which are absolutely terrible. I can navigate through difficult passages only to fail at an easy section, and it's always for the same reason: the controls are clunky, unresponsive & imprecise; and yes, I set the fps to 60 ;).

Many levels don't appear or feel difficult, yet it takes me multiple attempts to achieve an SS ranking because my character either floats off a platform or refuses to run up a wall or along a ceiling, despite pressing the correct keys/buttons. This game constantly frustrates me due to poor controls rather than the actual level difficulty.

When I complete a level with an SS ranking, I don't feel happy, but rather relieved. Playing and failing in games like Celeste or Trials feels like it's my fault for lacking skills or precision, whereas in Dustforce, it's more like the game controls are simply too inadequate.

I'll continue playing because I want to see the X-levels and, obviously, I want to achieve an SS rank, but it's hardly enjoyable, and I somewhat regret starting to play this game.",1699277952,1699280502,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,

I VERY tentatively recommend it and only IF you have difficult platformer experience. I have not and likely will never finish this game.[/h2]

[h3]Background:[/h3]
I played this with keyboard, and have currently SSd all levels in Bronze and Silver.
I have 320 hours in Celeste focusing on doing deathless runs of the individual chapters. I have 80 hours in N++.
Celeste is my favorite game of all time. I heavily enjoy games made in the Source engine, specifically ones which allow for skill-based movement like Bunnyhop, Surf, Rocketjumping, etc. I heavily enjoy N++. I think Super Meat Boy is overrated and not good when stacked up against other 2D platformers we see today.

[h3]Review:[/h3]
I'll keep this short; I doubt I'll ever get to experience a lot of this game.

Primer: Dustforce has a ranking system: F to SS. It also has different tiers of levels, in order of difficulty: Bronze, Iron, Gold, etc.

Dustforce starts out with a couple of tutorials. 1 and 2 are very easy, but 3 is surprisingly difficult to get an SS on. I had to come back way later after SSing all of the Bronze level section to defeat Tutorial 3 once and for all. It is very odd that Tutorial 3 is more difficult than a lot of the Bronze levels.

Bronze and Silver for the most part are a breeze. There's occasional difficulty spikes due to a weird trick you have to learn, but it's not insane. It then starts to get tricky at the Gold levels. Not all Gold levels are similar in difficulty though; some are way more difficult than others. But where the real kicker is is getting to these levels. Dustforce is unique in that it makes you work just to GET to the difficult level. A difficult level is blocked by a trickjump that you have to figure out. Some of these you HAVE to look up (once is mentioned on the one (1) newbie guide for this game on Steam because it's so obtuse and unintuitive). I've had to ask for help in the Dustforce Discord. I've seen some other reviews praise this game for not ""holding your hand"", but damn I'd love some fucking guidance every once in a while.

Overall, I ended up losing steam and stopping at around some of the Gold levels. There's a lot of depth and skill-based movement here, but the difficulty imbalance and poor guidance stops most players from ever getting there. This is easily one of the greatest platformers ever made, I know it. The problem is just having places to learn how to get good in a way that doesn't require you to just try a difficult level over and over and over again that's far beyond where you're able to comfortably attempt.

So, if you're very experienced with platformers and want to try this one, I highly recommend. Just get ready to have the learning curve whip back around and punch you in the face.

gameplay aside, the art is pretty, the music is really good, and there's even a level editor! so you can make your own levels or browse through a wealth of player-made content!

Two minor complaints. I wish the level doors marked when they were complete. Navigating the hub world became more of a chore than I'd like.

Weaving absurdly deep and broad and fun movement together with intuitive, well-flowing and extremely distinct levels together effortlessly. Dustforce has a LOT of hidden mechanical details under the hood, ranging from the meticulous attention to making level restarts as painless and engaging as possible, to the clever use of the overworld. The way characters offer a unique spin on every level, but work completely different for low-skilled players and high-skilled players. The way every mechanic finds a different use in every level, the way enemy encounters interact with your platforming moveset in different ways ( the only game that matches Sly Raccoon 1's execution of combat in a platforming game ).

After thinking it over, there is 2 tiny things I think are worth criticizing :
1. Ceiling corner jump boosts are not sufficiently onboarded. I didn't need a tutorial, but there needed to be a level or a better designed section of the overworld to teach this. It is absolutely neccessary for later levels and anything resembling good times, and as it is, it's too convoluted and figuring it out feels unorganic.
2. I think the difficulty gap between gold levels and silver levels was too big. It helps when you understand that the golden forest levels are easier than the golden lab levels, but I would have liked a little more in between. Also, I don't really think the mechanics shine in the super tight jumps in the Red levels. Stringing together movement in crazy ways and optimizing every corner is awesome, doing the final section of Giga Difficult was just cruel and not fun in any way.

Lastly, I want to talk about one way this game surpasses Celeste, my other favorite 2D platformer : The goal of shorter level times. Celeste has more rigid movement and once you beat the game, you will annihilate it on further replays. Of course I can easily SS earlier Dustforce levels now, but improving your times is so much more engaging than trying to go for golden Strawberries or doing Celeste speedruns. Celeste is a great speedrun game, but its not built for it in the same way Dustforce is based on the movement mechanics.

One tip if anyone should ever read this before going in: If you get stuck in a new category of level, go download some custom levels in the Nexus.

Even with a smaller fanbase, it will always have some longevity. This due to the level editor, which allows for community made levels. Along with the replay system, which is automatic. You finish a level and are scored based on completion and speed. This is automatically saved as a replay, and you can compare against others all in game. Honestly just checking out the a replay better than yours will open you up to a lot of different techniques to learn and master.

En este juego prima tanto la habilidad que se olvidaron de realizar un guión mínimamente atrayente.
Los gráficos están bastante trabajados aunque éste no es el punto fuerte del título. Los detalles en los escenarios y el acertado colorido, lo hacen ameno a la vista.
La banda sonora no está mal, acompaña, pero no me parece demasiado pegadiza. Típica música electrónica bastante trepidante que casa bien con el ritmo de juego.
La jugabilidad no puede decirse que sea mala, pero tampoco me parece excelente, por dos aspectos clave. El primero es que el control de los personajes cuesta de dominar por su gran cantidad de opciones, lo que penaliza mucho hasta que tengas unas cuantas horas de experiencia. El  segundo y más importante, por el comportamiento errático del personaje en ciertas situaciones, así como cierto desfase al intentar realizar algunos movimientos, que hacen que la precisión en el control no sea brillante. Esto, en un juego de la dificultad que éste atesora, es un problema serio.
La dificultad, como ya he comentado, es muy alta. Nivel top. Solo apta para jugadores con experiencia en este tipo de juegos y con reflejos felinos. Seguramente uno de los juegos más complicados del catálogo de Steam. Esto, sumado a que la precisión en el control no es brillante, hace que además de complicado sea una y otra vez desesperante.
La durabilidad está asegurada. Si consigues superar los 64 niveles de que consta el juego, recibirás 16 llaves que, en un lugar secreto del mapa, te permitirán abrir otras tantas puertas para acceder al área final (con 8 niveles más). Y si hasta ahora te parecía complicado, amigo, prepárate para llorar. Llegarás pensando que ya eres un as del control, y te encontrarás con mapas casi imposibles que te harán morir una y otra vez. De inicio, seguramente no puedas evitar pensar que jamás podrás superarlos. Sin embargo, si eres tenaz no es una tarea imposible, aunque créeme que sufrirás.
Si consigues superar con doble S (un perfect) cada uno de los 64 niveles + el nivel ""Giga Difficult"" del área final, habrás conseguido el único y meritorio logro del juego.
Por todo ello, por ser un juego casi único por lo retador pero a la vez desesperante en muchas ocasiones, y por ser variado y con un gran número de niveles pero a la vez menos preciso en el control que otros juegos del género, lo recomiendo a jugadores con pericia pero no lo veo como un imprescindible.
A tener en cuenta también, como algo positivo, el editor de mapas, y los niveles custom creados por la comunidad.

- Has a vibrant but minimalist style which I dig. It's a touch too 'cold' and empty, but it still resonated with me.
- The vibe & experience is laid back and not particularly stressful, which I appreciate.

My issues are with the gameplay and level design.  I've played a lot of platformers going back to the NES days and it's one of my favorite genres.  With great platformers, there is always a moment that happens where you lock in with the controls.  Where you feel a 'click' and you and the controller become linked.

There is a flow while playing.  And, unfortunately, this game didn't have that for me.  It never 'clicked'.  I felt like I was constantly battling the controls and mechanics.  The character is too 'sticky' when it comes to walls and ceilings and generally too 'floaty'.

The level/course design left a lot to be desired for me and only one out of the maybe two dozen rooms I cleared ever felt satisfying.

And that for me is a big thing: as a platformer this never felt satisfying when I cleared.  Nor was I relieved.  It never elicited a feeling from me, which is the problem.

There is only 1 achievement in the game: complete all levels with a double S-rank. At each level, there is some “dirt” and the first grade is given for cleaning it. S-rank is given only if everything is cleaned. The second grade is for “style” - you need to go through hole level as quickly as possible and not die. You must do it at the same time. This grading cannot be completed in different tries - after replaying the level, both ranks are rewritten, even if you had a previous score better, even if the score was already SS.

It seems as not impossible, BUT

[h1]Game review
★★☆☆☆ - Beautiful, but unplayable[/h1]

No matter how beautiful the game is, it has critical problems with controls and character movement.
- The game has an input delay, from the keyboard and the gamepad.

Dustforce is a platformer which focuses on using multiple buttons to perform moves rather than the complexities of the games movement or physics, i can see what its trying to do, but for me it just does not work at all, it ended up feeling overly clunky, overwhelming and just very very beginner unfriendly, from the times i tried to play, i had 3 major killing issues which ultimately for me, has made me come the conclusion i will never be able to play or truly appreciate this game.

Reason 1: the physics are incredibly stiff, personally i prefer platformers with a lil slack to them, dustforce does not allow for this, i found myself very frequently getting mixed up with buttons and what move would even be remotely ideal for each scenario, and the jumps you have do not carry you far unless you know how to chain it with other moves, it never came naturally to me and so as a result i just felt humiliated for trying to approach the game how classic platformers play out, which is highly discouraging.

Reason 2: the button claustrophobia, far too many moves, far too many buttons to keep track of, and just generally felt absolutely abhorrent on my hands to play, never has a game left my fingers feeling genuinely irritated by just playing a game but this definitely hit that level for me.

Reason 3: confusing mechanics, the ceiling walking, the slopes dashing, the jump refreshing and although i never got to it, the actual jumping off of spikes??? all of it completely goes against what i expected from watching and seeing the game.

Normally i talk about graphics and sound in my reviews, but being entirely honest i don't see the point when the gameplay already puts the game well beyond any chance of redemption in my eyes but for the sake of consistency: graphics are smooth and fine, music is terribly boring and i shut it off almost instantly.

Overall this game is a huge coin toss, you'll either love it or absolutely hate it, and for the games and platformers i've grown to love and appreciate, this one tries to break that meta, but does so in every wrong way imaginable.",1658381362,1658381406,False,8,3,0.503467321395874023,0,True,False,False,False,

This game does none.

You are first dropped into the tutorial where the game teaches you 40 different mechanics in 10 minutes instead of letting the player discover them naturally throughout progression. And don't get me wrong, I liked the gameplay. I think it's pretty neat and innovative, even 10 years later. But then there's the controls, which are AWFUL on a keyboard and you can remap them sure, thanks for that. But even then, after trying different combinations, it's still unplayable imo. Ah, don't worry, I'll just use my controller then. Nope, no controller support. Awesome.

I liked the levels that I've played and I've seen them get way more challenging down the line on YouTube, but the game design and balancing is awful. There's no progression in difficulty. You randomly choose a level from the Nexus and then whether it's gonna be easy or impossible is a roulette. The nexus is just bad user experience.

I can understand this game being older than most indies but people need to chill a bit when they say it's the best platformer ever. This game might be good after you have put many hours into it and died a thousand times but it is not a ""good"" game per se. It has A LOT of flaws that you can spot very early on.

For me, a 6/10 just doesn't do it. Especially when I have to put more than 20 hours into it. Not now, not ever.

When learning a level you have to learn when to use which jump or dash to get to the finish. There are also enemies that are not just fancy spikes that move. In fact touching them is fine but some have attacks.

You are graded on how much you cleaned each level and how often you failed. Speed really isn't that important here. You can miss a bit of dust but go back for it and if you don't lose your combo you'll still get a perfect.

Wir sind eine hochagile Reinigungskraft und müssen Dungeons saubermachen. Überall liegt Laub rum, das weggefegt werden will. Sogar Tiere, die herumlaufen oder -fliegen, sind komplett mit Laub bedeckt und wir entdecken erst, was sich unter dem Laubknäuel befindet, wenn wir mit unseren Besen einsetzen. 

Die Thematik wirkt merkwürdig, ist aber im Endeffekt hervorragend, denn ein solcher Präzisions-Plattformer braucht eigentlich kein Thema. Es geht in dem Genre primär um die Mechanik und um die Herausforderung, das Thema ist immer irgendwie aufgesetzt. Dann auf eine ungewöhnliche Thematik zu gehen, die keine tiefere inhaltliche Begründung hat, aber mit einem deutlichen Augenzwinkern locker und ironisch daherkommt, ist nicht nur folgerichtig, sondern auch erfrischend. Wir können sogar zwischen vier verschiedenen Reinungungskräften wählen.

Das Wichtigste bei dem Genre ist aber die Mechanik. Und die ist richtig gut gelungen. Die Steuerung wirkt zwar zunächst etwas umständlich, hat man es aber einmal gelernt, ermöglicht die Mechanik ein sehr flüssiges Spielen. Die Reaktionszeit der Mechanik ist erstaunlich kurz, so daß man mit Übung wirklich sehr präzise agieren kann, Combos aneinanderhängen kann und so einen Level in Bestzeit säubern kann. 

Denn darum geht es in den Leveln: möglichst präzise und schnell zu sein und das natürlich ohne zu sterben. Es gibt Level, die nur 20 Sekunden dauern, wenn wir sie denn perfekt absolvieren. Das bedarf allerdings viel Übung und sehr schnell ausgeführten Tastenkombinationen. 

Mit erspielten Punkten erhalten wir Schlüssel, die neue Level freischalten. Späte Level können absurd schwer werden, zum Beispiel fast nur aus Spikes bestehen, so daß ein kleiner Timing-Fehler in einer Kombination tödlich sein kann. Aber darum geht es auch in dem Genre. Man scheitert immer wieder und lernt dabei aber auch wie Abschnitte am besten zu meistern sind. Und hat man einen Level mal geschafft und auch alles Laub weggefegt, dann geht es immer noch darum, schneller zu sein als im letzten Versuch und die eigene Zeit zu verbessern. 

Und die Level sind richtig gut gebaut. Stets fordernd, aber mit viel Schweiß schaffbar.

Und das macht richtig viel Spaß, sogar mir, der kein Crack in dem Genre ist. Das liegt an der hervorragenden Mechanik, aber auch an der treffenden Comic-Ästhetik und auch an dem richtig guten Soundtrack. Bei ""Dustforce DX"" ist alles qualitativ ausgereift und gekonnt. Alles funktioniert so wie es soll und schaut so aus wie es gedacht war.

Für den, der mit dem Genre der Präzisions-Plattformer etwas anfangen kann, Spiele wie ""Super Mear Boy"" spannend findet oder sich für das Konzept des Speedruns interessiert, ist ""Dustforce DX"" ein notwendigen Pflichtkauf.

An open platformer that allows you to set your own pace, this unique take on the genre is a lot of fun.

Became infatuated quickly and bought it for the PS3. Then, I bought it here -- so my playtime isn't 100% accurate.

Dustforce is a game with amazing visuals and an equally amazing soundtrack. As much as I love it, it genuinely is not for everyone -- while I'm something of a perfectionist myself, the idea of needing to perfect every level to 100% the game may be unappealing to some. But I definitely recommend it nonetheless. Fastfall provides a host of chill songs, and it's a good game to go to if you want to kill time -- or even chill out, should you replay its easier levels.

Even if you're not a perfectionist, it's a speedrunner's paradise. While some regard its movement as clunky, or its controls unintuitive (again, I first played on consoles and I strongly recommend a controller), with proper skill and practice one can blaze through levels at insane speeds -- which, while not rewarding you with anything in-game (the score ranking systems are based on maintaining a combo and collection/defeating enemies), will cement you bragging rights on the local (Friends list) and global leaderboards.

Most importantly, it's an indie game that needs some love. With a bigger scene of runners, Dustforce could have been so much more, and the devs have basically been radio silence for a few years.

But something is wrong with the controls. It started to creep up slowly but became very apparent in the later levels. They are absurdly floaty.

Dustforce toma como premisa un concepto que nadie esperaría en un videojuego y logra con ella una formula y ejecución de lo más limpia, resultando en un plataformero fácil de jugar a simple viste, pero extremadamente complicado de dominar. Todo envuelto en una banda sonora muy relajante e inspiradora para cada escenario, haciendo que muchas veces continúes hasta lograr el éxito en cada nivel y gracias a su jugabilidad adictiva cuando logras dominar los controles, entendiendo conceptos como el peso, el momentum, la movilidad y demás cualidades de tu personaje.

Dustforce es un juego de plataformas de carácter Indie centrado en la limpieza de múltiples escenarios de la manera más precisa y en el menor tiempo posible, para lograr un desempeño perfecto en el nivel y una buen puntuación en las tablas de clasificación. No presenta ninguna historia o trasfondo remarcable, más allá de que algunos personajes no-jugables repartidos en varias localizaciones te brindarán algunos diálogos extra, pero sin terminar de entender tu origen o propósito en el juego. Simplemente es una propuesta que va directo al grano, buscando entretener por varias horas al jugador gracias a sus mecánicas y un apartado técnico minimalista, pero sumamente cuidado en todas y cada una de sus animaciones.

Los gráficos de Dustforce son simplistas y coloridos en muchos momentos, mientras que en otros (y gracias a la combinación de todos sus elementos) pueden tomar una estética y lujo de detalle como la comunidad ha sabido plasmar en numerosas ocasiones en los niveles comunitarios, haciendo que en el apartado artístico desprenda en cada momento un estilo con mucha personalidad y profundidad. [b]¿Por qué digo profundidad?[/b] Simple, todo lo anterior es potenciado, gracias a que el juego sigue muchos de los [b]principios de animación[/b] para cada una de nuestras acciones (e incluso enemigos), desde el simple salto podemos reconocer algunos principios como: estirar/encoger y anticipación; hasta para los ataques y habilidades especiales como: exageración, sincronización (timing), entre muchos más que componen los 12 principios. Logrando que en un todo, visualmente sea atractivo desde los conocedores del dibujo, arte y animación, hasta para los jugadores que desconocen estos conceptos; pero que indirectamente harán que su experiencia se sienta mucho más fluida, acertada y atractiva.
La música, como ya mencioné anteriormente, forma parte esencial del título y es la que termina de complementar a toda la obra; ya que sin esta, no desprendería el mismo carisma con el que conocemos actualmente el juego y si la dirección de sus melodías hubiesen tomado otro rumbo en otro género como el rock o incluso un chiptune más movido o frenético, no tendría la misma identidad que posee y resultando en un todo, bastante contraproducente a la larga. La música fue un acierto tan inmenso que muchos de nosotros (incluyendo su servidor), conocimos primero su banda sonora y por asares del destino, la curiosidad nos terminó trayendo a esta infravalorada, pero magnifica joya Indie.

[u]En conclusión:[/u] Dustoforce es un juego de plataformas que nos entrega otra propuesta que en papel puede sonar una auténtica discrepancia, pero que con la correcta ejecución que sus desarrolladores lograron ([url=https://hitboxteam.com/]Hitbox Team[/url]), terminaron haciendo una auténtica joya de los videojuegos Indie. Demostrando en esta ocasión que no se necesita una gran premisa o una historia profunda, para cautivar el corazón de otro jugador con cientos de horas de entretenimiento y ensayo y error. Claramente no es un juego para todo el mundo ya que su nivel de dificultad escala muy rápidamente, con muchos momentos de frustración y pensado para los perfeccionistas, completistas y amantes de los juegos de plataformas.

The controls are awkward at best. Any movement is exaggerated making minor adjustments near impossible ""on the fly"". I can only imagine the precision necessary for later stages to be pixel perfect.

If you enjoy platforming games even just a little bit, you will absolutely enjoy playing Dustforce.

The game is beautiful, aesthetically. The cartoonish graphics are very friendly on the eyes, and the layers and color schemes always make the level geometry crystal clear. The characters are all so likeable and memorable, and they're all so charming to look at. Each of the five worlds has a unique aesthetic. Looking at the screen will immediately tell you whether you're in the forest, the mansion, the city, the laboratory, or the challenge world.

The music of the game is awesome. The soundtrack gets lots of airtime in my own music library even when I'm not gaming. The music can be relaxing, mystical, ethereal, and confrontational at times. It always seems to fit the level you're playing, and it never feels like it's too much. One of the features of the game that I absolutely love is that the music doesn't stop or re-start when you fall in a level. The music simply gets a little quieter while a gentle ""failure"" sound plays, and then you re-spawn at the last checkpoint. The fact that the music doesn't stop playing through any of this keeps me motivated to keep playing the level, even when I fail. It's a subtle detail that makes a big difference.

There isn't much of a story to the game, but there is a concept that's easy for anyone to get into: You play as a team of janitors with ninja-like acrobatic capabilities who are cleaning up a messy world. In the forest, you clean dead leaves. In the mansion, you clean dust. In the city, you clean rotten food and trash. In the laboratory, you clean slime. The challenge world takes on an arcade-like aesthetic, putting all the world-building in the background to allow you to focus more on the platforming. There are other little details that make me feel like the cleaning is making an impact in the game's world. For example, when you defeat one of the enemies in the forest, you find that it was actually just a small animal (like a squirrel, for example) covered in leaves. You're freeing the squirrels! In the city, these giant trash monsters are actually construction workers covered in trash. It's a cool concept, and getting through a level with 100% completion feels very satisfying for that reason alone.

When it comes to the objective of the game, there are two of them on each level, both of which are very easy to understand: completion and finesse. Completing a level with perfect completion means cleaning up every speck of dust (or leaves, slime, whatever) in the level. Completing a level with perfect finesse means that you never fall, and that you never go on for too long without cleaning something (or, never breaking your ""combo""). You receive a separate score (from E-A, with ""S"" being a perfect score) for each of these two categories. Getting higher scores on each of the levels grants you ""keys,"" which can be used to unlock more levels at your discretion. Each level is graded on a difficulty scale, from bronze to gold, so you know what you're getting yourself into with each one. I love this setup because you can basically complete the levels in any order you like, but the key and lock system prevents you from accidentally entering a level that's too difficult for you right off the bat. You can do things at your own pace. There's no pressure, and you can always try one of the other levels you're working on if you're stuck on one for too long.

There are four different characters you can play as, and they're all unique. The blue ""dustman"" is an all-around type of character. I think the most unique character is the purple one (""dustkid""), who has the smallest attack and the shortest jump height, but can run the fastest and also has an extra jump. The developers were super thoughtful here, because you can reasonably complete every level in the game regardless of which character you play as. So, you can choose to play through the whole game as one character, or just whichever one you're most comfortable with on a level-by-level basis.

The level design is incredible. Each level is a challenging, acrobatic funhouse that will get you pumped up and challenge you in interesting ways. The first few levels on the forest get you familiar with the controls and allow you to freely enjoy the fast pace of the game. ""Ghost Parapets"" is a sparse platforming challenge with huge jumps. ""The Abyss"" is a challenging descent into a monster-filled pit. ""Night Temple"" is a booby-trapped adventure at the peak of the forest. ""Hideout"" is an incredibly difficult foray into a ninja-precision obstacle course. Each level is memorable and well-thought out. The levels are all hand-designed with character movement in-mind. There is always a fluid way to move through the level with a perfect score, if you have enough skill for it.

This brings me to my favorite aspect of the game, which is simply the way it feels. The game feels so incredibly fluid and impactful. Every time you jump or land, dust flies up, giving the characters weight and a sense of impact. When you land a big jump, the camera shakes, intensifying this weightiness. The gravity, the jump height, the attacks, and the dashing all feel like they were tweaked in minute detail with absolute love and care. One of my favorite mechanics in the game is that landing a successful attack on an enemy will grant you an extra jump or mid-air dash. In some levels, this can lead to tense moments where you go several seconds without landing on the ground, being kept in the air only by your precise attacks. The mechanics of the game are very easy to learn (there's a great tutorial), but very difficult to master.

The challenge of this game is as difficult as you want it to be. You can simply see how many levels you're able to complete (I would consider myself pretty good at Dustforce, and I haven't yet completed all of them. There are just a few in the challenge world I haven't been strong enough to complete yet). If you get bored of simply completing levels, you can try beating each level with a perfect score (doing so will grant you the game's only achievement, which I would love to have one day). If you're good enough for that, there are more challenges to be met by completing each level with a perfect score *and* doing it very quickly. Each level has a leaderboard, with the lowest times and highest scores at the top of the list. You can try to get as high up on the leaderboard as you want. You can try beating each level with each of the four different characters. Finally, if you get bored with all the in-game content, there's more waiting for you with the level editor, where you can make your own levels or push yourself by completing other player's custom-made levels. The game is very easy to get into, but it seems like there is no end to how much you can challenge yourself with it, if you want to.

I always find myself coming back to this game. It's so fun to play, even when you feel like you've gotten everything you can get out of it. Team Hitbox obviously put so much love and care into every little detail of it, and it shows. This is an absolutely wonderful little game, and I can't recommend it enough for gamers who enjoy platforming games.",1631144162,1631144162,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,1,False,False,False,False,

Levels aren't there to just be beaten, they're there to be beaten, improved upon until S rank, and then improved on for better times. The fun of Dustforce comes from mastering the movement, and learning how to use that movement to make the most of each level. I'm not the type of person that usually enjoys beating times, and chasing leaderboards; this the exception. It's extremely addicting to shave fractions of a second off your time, or trying to work in a new strat you discovered in a previous run.

Dustmod, dustkid.com, and the Dustforce Discord are all amazing community resources. The quality of information/tools on dustkid.com alone blows my mind.

This game feels like it is insanely tailored towards towards only being enjoyable for people willing to dedicate 20+ hours to mastering the mechanics. And personally I would just much rather spend 20+ hours playing something that is fun throughout.

This isn't to say the game is completely unenjoyable during the learning process, but I promise you will have a much better time during the learning process of almost any other popular platformer.

-Precision Platformer

Fit for me:
-Perfect fit, my fav genre!

Pros:
-Excellent use of physics.  It's up there w/ N++ for best use of physics in a precision platformer.  Taking advantage of going downhill, jumping at the correct time, and using your dash correctly all play a huge role in your movement and speed.
-Incredibly high skill ceiling.  This is similar to Celeste in that the best players are able to do things that seem impossible.  It feels like they have been given extra upgrades that beginning players don't have access to.  
-Skill based game w/ little to no luck.  You start off w/ everything you need right from the start; there are no upgrades, it's your skill that will improve, not your players stats.
-Very peaceful, calming music, w/ the occasional upbeat tempo that fits the theme and aesthetic really well.
-Leaderboard that is available after every level, allows you to see how you compare to others.  You can also watch replays directly after an attempt, giving players extra help.  This is kind of the assist mode for this game.
-Tons of content if you are looking to complete the one and only achievement, which is get SS rank on everything.  There are a ton of levels, and a lot of them are extremely challenging.  

Cons:
-Very steep learning curve makes it a tough game for beginners.  The tutorial is very limited, which may scare off players early.
-In order to get keys, which allow you to play more level, you need to achieve SS rank on each level, essentially proving that you have mastered the level.  You will probably have to repeat levels many times over, which some players may not like.  If you are looking to beat a level w/ any score and then move on, this option is not available to you in most cases.
-The Hub world can be a bit confusing at first for beginners.  It's not your traditional world map, and you will probably miss quite a few levels until you really make a true effort to explore the whole Hub world.

Thoughts:
-This is another extremely good platformer.  I like aesthetic, the level variety, and consistent challenge.  It feels great when you are able to SS a level that at one point seemed impossible just to finish.  Being able to find a new level in the Hub by performing a tough platforming sequence is really rewarding.  I also like the cute, simple story and the colorful but not too bright aesthetic.  This is just a really well rounded game.

Consensus:
-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  This may be 8 years old, but you wouldn't know it by playing it.  This is a really creative, challenging, physics based game w/ a really detailed and fun aesthetic.  I get N++ vibes while playing this, which is another one of my favorite platformers.

+Fantastic soundtrack

+Powerful level editor

+Tons of replay value

[b]Cons[/b]
+Was too tough for me (just a personal negative, I know many people enjoy these games)

Really great precision platformer that is the epitome of “easy to learn but hard to master.” Dustforce will demand a lot from you. In order to progress and unlock keys you not only have to keep your combo going but you must eliminate all enemies and clean up as much as you can. Your rank at the end of the level is really how you progress. Higher the rank, more keys unlock to access all the levels. 

The graphic style is very nice. Simple, clean, cute and varies in each area. The soundtrack is a real star. Great tracks that are chill and easy to listen to.

The controls are solid overall. I did feel like it was a little snappy or unpredictable but at the core it’s responsive. 

I played for a little while and really enjoyed it. I knew going in that I’ll get stuck at some point and be unable or unwilling to be perfect on all the levels to access all the levels.  

One quick shoutout is how fast you can get into the game from your desktop. Click play and in seconds you are hanging out at the Nexus entrance ready to go. I love that.

Poziomy podzielone są na kilka lokacji jak między innymi las, zamek, rezydencja oraz laboratorium. Każda z tych lokacji jest na swój sposób klimatyczna. Niektóre poziomy trzeba odblokować przy pomocy kluczy, które uzyskujemy za wysokie oceny przy ukończeniu mapy. Dostępny jest także edytor map, który umożliwia stworzenie własnej mapy oraz wypróbować poziomy stworzone przez inne osoby.

This truly is one of the best 2D platformers out there, as I see it.
	The controls and physics are sublime. They’re tricky to master, and there’s plenty of nuance, but the game naturally teaches you those mechanics as you encounter progressively harder challenges. Jumps are interestingly floaty at the start, but you’ll fall like a rock soon after, and you’ll often have to consider how hard you drop in the stages, as you may crash right through a fragile platform. Luckily, your extra jump(s) should aid your descent. Dustforce is also a bit more slippery than most platformers this tough and precise, but once you get a feel for its movement and flow, the game is a joy to control.
I love how the hub world is laid out as its own set of platforming challenges. The hub tasks you with nailing tricky maneuvers to get to levels requiring those very same maneuvers within. Additionally, the more open nature of the hub, as compared to the decidedly linear progression of stages, makes reaching level portals in the hub their own little puzzles for the player to solve. Now, midway through my playthrough, I did find myself wandering a bit aimlessly in the hub, as I tried to find an unopened door matching my current selection of keys. But regardless, this is an excellent example of a hub which complements its core gameplay.
	Stages progressively become incredibly demanding, but oh the rush when you finally pull of that perfect run. This rang true for me throughout the core set of levels. Clearing the stage at all was its own thrill at times, but getting that elusive SS rank proved similarly addictive. Revisiting levels to obtain a better rank also demonstrated the progress in learning nuances and mechanics, as stages that seemed previously difficult to even clear were a breeze. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the game’s ability to impart its intricacies. Dustforce just has that addictive quality, that drive to try “one more time”, to clear “just one more level”. It should be a testament that I spent over THREE HOURS to get the SS on Hideout, and still love the game as much as I do.
	The stages comprise a beautiful mix of interactions, from bold, sweeping leaps to tight, delicate jumps. However, I did run into an area and level that were close to impossible with my character of choice, Dustkid. I’m not sure if other levels may be nearly unbeatable with specific characters, but this was a disappointing design quirk, as the game almost forced me to learn a new character I wasn’t as well versed with. Each character has their own distinct qualities in how they play, so I was frustrated that the game forced me to shift from my favored playstyle. One other critique I’ll offer is that the spike hitboxes seemed a tad too large. I would feel a bit cheated at times when navigating tight, spike-ridden spaces.
	I love the simple but striking art style. There are also plenty of lovely little animation flourishes, such as the scattering of leaves, or the impacts and bounces of the characters. Dust is used as a natural guide for the player’s path and interactions with the stage. The game could perhaps stand to pop a bit more in its color palette, as the aesthetic is somewhat muted. With more saturated colors, the environments could serve as a nice contrast with the dusty areas of the stage, though perhaps the desaturated look is meant to emphasize the dirty environments you’re out to clean. Regardless, it’s a lovely looking game, and I didn’t find myself losing track of my character even as the camera would zoom out considerably in some stages. The music is rather nice, a selection of low-key tunes that may initially seem out of place for such an intense platformer, but which kept me level-headed even as I repeatedly fell to my death, crashed into spikes, or lost my combo.
	[SPOILERS HERE] Now, upon completing the punishing task of getting those SS ranks on every single core level, you’re rewarded with…a new suite of even more brutal levels…I’ll be honest, this set of stages became deflating after the ordeal to simply unlock them. The Difficult levels are so ludicrously hard that the notion of getting SS on all of them seems dizziyingly insurmountable. Additionally, some of these levels were once again not so friendly to Dustkid’s unique jumps. Ironically, while the final stages adopt more uniform color palettes, this makes it harder to distinguish the dust trails on walls, frustrating when these courses are already frenetic. I even lost track of myself on occasion in certain stages. I definitely felt my motivation to keep playing drop upon reaching these levels. I feel they go far beyond a challenge that I’m able to truly enjoy. [SPOILERS OVER]
But I loved the core set of stages enough to still hold Dustforce in high regard. That core experience was one of the finest I’ve ever played, a platforming bliss both graceful and thrilling.",1592681728,1592681728,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

easy the best platformer on steam.
The game feels good to just be in, with nice music and easy to look at visuals and animations, the hand drawn effects are especially cool. The main world of the game is a simple HUB world with doors to each level, after completing the levels you get graded with 2 rankings 100 percent cleanliness (no dust left) and how fast you clean up the dust in, the goal is to get (S) rank for both cleanliness and finesse some levels have keys to collect by getting S S ranking, with harder levels giving you a gold key, to get to the last level you need all the gold keys. there's also leaderboards for how fast a level was completed.
The theming of the game is a little weird and a bit of a mish mash, but it doesn't effect the experience because all the worlds have that consistent desaturated cell shaded style, the style and theme is definitely secondary and very little narrative, Dustforce cleans the dirt that corrupts the creatures and humans of the world seems to be the sole narrative. but like Mario games that really doesn't matter because the mechanics and level design is where all the love and attention went for this game. at first completing levels in a sub optimal way can feel and bit disheartening, like you just cant get the momentum. you soon learn that every level is designed to be done with an optimal path and it feels really good when you get in that flow so it might turn a lot of people of this game that couldn't be bothered with something so difficult.
as the game goes on each later level will introduce subtle mechanics that you learn through playing and not a pop up that tells you what to do, although the new tutorials levels basically tell you all you need to know. the game designer was a huge fan of melee and you can see some of elements that inspired this games character movement.

We all know this type of game lives or dies by its controls, and the controls are perfect.  To add onto that, the maneuvers your character can do are unique in this game.  You can double jump, wall jump, or run up walls; these aren't the unique part.  Where this starts to differentiate itself is with the ceiling riding mechanic.  You have the ability to slide across ceilings, which on its own may not seem like much.  This method though opens the door for the game to set up areas so that you run up a wall into a ceiling, sliding across that ceiling, and from there proceed to other incredible maneuvers.  It's a mechanic that is simple on its surface, but with proper level design it is utilized to maximize style and fun.

The soundtrack is pretty much perfect.  The game is challenging, but the soundtrack is so chill and catchy that it eases the frustration from trying a level over and over and over again.  Still on the same level for an hour?  Well the tunes will remain catchy the entire session.

[h1] This game can... *ahem*... SWEEP YOU off your feet! GAHAHAHAHA!!! [/h1]

Ever wanted to play a game as a janitor? Honestly, Viscera Cleanup detail 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/246900/Viscera_Cleanup_Detail/
 is a pretty good game so I don’t think I personally would mind. How about a super agile Janitor that would even make spider-man look jealous?

[h1]Janitors in action [/h1]

Dustforce is a game about super janitors. It’s a simple platformer where you take control of one of four janitors and you zip around a level while cleaning as much as you can in as little time as possible. Sounds fun, right? Well, yeah, it sound fun.
Anyway, Dustoforce is a pure platformer. While your primary job is to clean as many things as possible, I often forgot about that because it’s mostly racing to the end of each level while cleaning what you can along the way. 

You start the game off from the main hub-world. Here you can learn the ropes and select what you wish to do, you just have to get to them first; by this I mean, that the hub world itself is more-or-less a level… where you select levels. You aren’t bound to follow a linear level progression, instead you choose a level that you want and try to complete it as best as you can. After finishing a level you get graded based on how much you cleaned and how fast you did it. Your score gets converted into key points and once you hit a certain mark, you get a key which unlocks a gated, slightly-harder key. You can play this game solo, but you also have the option to play multiplayer (which I haven’t tested) and even to create or play custom levels.

[h1] How do you clean... I mean... play the game?[/h1]

So how do you actually play this game? Well, it looks and plays much like Sonic game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/584400/Sonic_Mania/
, honestly. You go through various 2D levels trying to get to the end and clean the surfaces of platforms and walls you pass by. You also have two types of attacks that help you deal with ""enemies"" which can also give you another jump or a speed boost. While you are supposed to clean as much as you can on each level, all you really want to do is gain some speed and to keep that speed going for as long as possible. You do this by utilizing the level and the platforms. You can run, dash, jump, double jump, slide, slide-boost and even wall-run upside down. There really is nothing stopping these janitors from cleaning. I can never get enough of a Janitor sliding down a hill only to hit a boost at the end and continue running at full speed.

[h1] Nothing freshens up the place like a good mopping/dusting [/h1] 

The graphics, while minimalistic, are really pleasant as is the music. The music is easily my favorite part of this game.

[h1] Cleaning just ins't for me [/h1]

With that said, I cannot recommend this game. It just isn’t fun to play. Just like I say in all my reviews of this nature, if anything I have written above sounds interesting to you, you are probably going to like this game. I for one, didn’t find much point to playing this game anymore. While the opening cinematic suggests an epic battle between janitors and some dust-spewing villains, the game doesn’t really have an actual story. The levels are fun to speed through but they lack that personality and rhythm that games like Super Meat Boy
https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/
 have.

[h1] How do you control this broom? [/h1]

The controls, while very functional, are really counter-intuitive. I suggest you play this game with a controller but even then, keeping the momentum going is going to be a mess (Pun intended). I could never keep the speed momentum for more than a few seconds because I had to change directions so quickly. This is especially noticeable when you are supposed to run upside-down on ceilings.There is also the double jump which only works if you don’t drop off a cliff. By that I mean, you have to make sure not to run off a platform before initiating a double-jump because otherwise you will only be able to do a normal one. I’m sure there is a reason for this, but I could never get used to it.

[h1] Not a bad game, just not for me [/h1]

Dustforce is an ok platformer. It’s pretty to look at and it has great music and if you willing to invest the time and effort into it, it’s not a bad platformer. It’s just not very fun, for me at least. If the game had more creative levels and maybe a story with easier controls, I’d probably be more favorable towards it. As it is, I really can’t recommend it.

Below is my history with the game and how I came to know it as my personal favorite platformer of all time and a contender for being my favorite game ever.

At first, I didn't really like Dustforce. I found a lot of the gameplay to be a little too difficult, even in the early levels of the game. It felt like the game didn't want me to play, like it wanted to keep me out. But me being who I am, was stubborn, and wanted at least the 100% completion on Steam. So I grinded and grinded and grinded. Through all of the levels that technically meant almost nothing to the only achievement in the game. The S+ Achievement, which is given to you on completion of a SS run of Giga Difficult, one of the levels in the game that is so far in, that it keeps anyone who doesn't have the true mentality to push, to improve, to keep playing, from ever reaching it. 

Even before reaching the Difficults, I struggled hard. With levels like Hideout, Night Temple, Observatory, or Core Temple, I would spend hours upon hours trying my absolute hardest to beat what I thought was already an impossible task, an incredibly difficult level, an overwhelmingly hard and oppressive SS rank. For to access the Difficults, you must get a SS rank on every level prior, setting a true bar of entry to them. 

After countless hours of grind to SS all the levels, I finally did do it. I reached the Difficults. What awaited me was 8 of the toughest levels the game could throw at me. Now, you only need to SS Giga for the achievement, and at first that was all I wanted. But as I kept going, I started to want more and more. It took around 3-4 hours of straight strat finding and grind to get SS on Giga. And boy, it was not easy. By the time I had reached Giga, I already had nearly 34 hours in the game. By that point I had already (or so I thought) mastered the mechanics of the game and its characters. What I didnt know, was that I was only scratching the surface as I didn't truly have them down or understood. 

After I finished Giga, I had enough playtime and enough practice to have the balls to try and do all the rest of the Difficults, or so I thought. I was able to SS most of them, Kilo, Giga of course, Tera, Peta, and Exa. But one single level, not only broke me, taught me that I didn't understand the game like I thought I did, and made me drop it entirely, saying I would never ever come back because of how much I hated the game. That level was Mega Difficult.

Mega Difficult is simple really, being technically the second Difficult level of the set, it shouldn't have been as bad as it was, but oh boy. The level centers a lot around ceiling running and midair attacks while dealing with Hit-rise, which is a somewhat complicated idea to newcomers and something I wont explain here. I thought that my experience's with other levels that I would have the capabilities to complete Mega SS, but I was so wrong. Almost every section I was terrible, and could never do perfectly the first time, or even the 50th.

After nearly 7-8 hours of grinding Mega Difficult, I gave up, and I dropped the game, stating that I would never come back because I hated the game. But, as the months went on, I found myself wondering whether or not I should go back to the game. One 100% gave me the courage to dive back in for a second try and really work on the game, that hundo was Celeste. I had gotten all the Golden Berries in Celeste up until the new Chapter 9 released. And after that, I felt like I could finally tackle the difficulty that Dustforce had.

And after coming back, I made it my mission to stay calm, have fun, and just work on truly understanding what I was doing wrong. I watched replays of better players, played some custom levels, worked on my IL times in other levels, and improved my skill with the game. By the time I felt comfortable going back and grinding Mega Difficult again, I had felt like a new man. A better, improved, and more analytical man. In in only an hour or two, I had gotten the SS on Mega Difficult.

After SSing Mega, only two levels remained. Zetta and the notorious Yotta. My end goal became to SS Yotta. And it took nearly 18 hours of simultaneous grind and practice to finally conquer the beast that it was. But while I was grinding Mega, Zetta, and Yotta. I realized something. My struggle with Dustforce was because I was too focused on getting everything done as fast as I could, whether that be 100% or All SSes. Eventually, working on just playing the game to improve and enjoying my time with it made me not only a better player, but appreciate the design of every single part of Dustforce.

I realized that the artwork and the animations moved so fluidly with such grace yet so simplistic with such a charm. I realized that the music was beautiful and kept me calm and motivated all while sounding amazing too. I found true satisfaction within the gameplay that I used to despise. The gameplay is wonderfully crafted, having almost perfect mechanics that make other platformers only wish they could be as good as Dustforce. And of course, a game with difficulty like no other, that truly taught me to persevere and keep going to accomplish my goals.

And thus, Dustforce, a game that I bought with almost no preconceptions and for only $10, became one of the absolute best I have ever played. Setting itself as a standard for any indie game I will ever play, a standard for how good a platformer can ever be, and as a standard, of how I can go from hating a game with every fiber of my being, to knowing it as one of the best there ever was. Thank you Dustforce, for bringing me pure joy, pure excitement, pure sadness, and pure rage. For all the emotions you have brought me, and all the time you took away from me, you have me fall in love with you.

German Review

Dustforce ist das ideal Spiel zum relaxen. Zumindest bis man etwas ambitionierter wird und die schwereren Levels angehen möchte. Dann wird einiges an Konzentration erfordert. Wenn man die Steuerung aber mal verinnerlicht hat muss man nicht mehr viel nachdenken und der entspannede Soundtrack trägt viel zu einem guten Spielerlebnis bei. Selbst nach über 100h werden die Tracks nicht langweilig.

Vom Gameplay her ist das hier ein Präzissions-Platformer, der viel Wert auf Momentum legt. Wenn man mal in einem Level nicht weiter kommt, kann man sich bequem im Spiel die Replays von anderen Spielern (und auch Freunden) anschauen um zu sehen wie sie das gelöst haben.

Wirklich Negatives gibt es bei dem Spiel nicht. Das Spiel ist ziemlich perfekt und wird von der Community dank eingebautem Leveleditor auch regelmässig mit neuen exzellenten Custommaps erweitert.",1574433336,1621025626,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,False,False,False,False,

my only critique:
even though there is local multiplayer, i really wish it to be online just to see this game develop and branch out to fighting communities. it's such a waste to see the gamemode and the villian sprites not being used very often.

also, the music bops

it seems there is a mod called ""dustmod"", which allows you to have multiplayer (pvp and co-op) and even more content than the original has to offer!

You will spend your time in this game fighting the controls.  They are the most difficult enemy in the game and more difficult than any level I played through.

The hub world is ridiculous.  It forces you to platform around to get to levels.  This means getting to levels can be almost as annoying as actually playing the levels if getting to the level requires advanced techniques to reach since the controls will decide at random whether you did that technique.

Even 2,000 hours in, I am learning new ways of how the game works and how I can implement that into levels. The controls take some getting used to, but that's because Dustforce is simply different from every other 2D platformer. The momentum and weightiness of your character is something no other game has.

The game is split up into 4 hubworlds, and an extra difficult hubworld. When (or [i]if,[/i] for many players, since the last level alone will likely take 30+ hours to get a perfect score on) you're done with that, you can jump into the thousands of custom levels that users have made with the highly detailed level editor built in-game. You control everything, including the background design, the choice of music, the enemies, and even the camera. Finally, when you're done, you can upload your level, with its own unique leaderboard, where you can watch every player run through your level with the in-game replay system.

Last but not least the I adore the aesthetics of this game. The soundtrack is chill and serene with little interruptions to make it a blast to listen to. And I love the art style. Going through levels quickly gives your character a sense of flow with all its stylish flourishes on attack and dash animations.

Dustforce is a game all about platforming. While there is no actual story, the mechanics, once you seek your teeth into it a little, feel exponentially more gratifying to master.

It has some of the smoothest gameplay and most satisfying challenges I've seen in a platformer, and once you've learned it, just moving around is fun. If you liked Celeste, it might be worth a try as another mobility based game, but there are some significant differences.

Namely, the game focuses very heavily on getting ""perfect runs"" of the levels - not dying or missing any of the ""dust"" you collect along the way. This is great way to add difficulty for this game - individual sections can be relatively easy, but a successful run requires mastery as you chain your dashes and jumps through the level. 

For most levels, this means the skill they test is how competent you are at moving around, or knowing what jump to use at what point, rather than precision. It also encourages you to go faster through the level, making it feel very fluid. 

This has several downsides though. It can be frustrating at times, as you'll be playing through the same part many times as you get better. Personally I still enjoyed this as the movement is fun in itself. Another problem with this is if you attempt to do imperfect runs - this can make the game boring, as there isn't much challenge. You'll spend most of your time just walking over to whatever patch you missed.

The Overworld is very well done...basically there is 4 different kinds of levels:
Normal levels - Can be accesed very easily
Bronze Levels - Can be accesed by completing enough levels to earn a bronze key...they are usually not a whole lot harder than the normal levels, but they are harder to access in the overworld
Silver levels - Can be accesed by completing enough Bronze levels to earn a Silver Key...they are usually at pretty tough to reach spots in the overworld, making sure you know what you are doing, before you accidentaly access one, difficulty really gets higher with those!
Gold Levels - Those levels are the hardest in the game, they are very well hidden in the overworld, usually hidden behind other platform courses, you need to be able to overcome first before you can enter them, they are really hard!

After you beated all of the levels with an SS score, you gain access to the ""Difficult"" levels, which is another set of levels, that is even harder than the Gold levels!

[h1]关卡设计才是平台跳跃游戏的精髓[/h1]
这款游戏已经有些年头了，它出生在平台跳跃游戏的鼎盛时期，在超级食肉男孩带火了爬墙类平台跳跃游戏之后，Dustforce也是众多跟风者之一。如果说超级食肉男孩已经脱离了任天堂系游戏，自成一种风格的话，那么Dustforce也可以说脱离了超级食肉男孩。

Dustforce在最传统最基础的爬墙跳跃中加入了微创新，不仅可以爬侧面的墙，还可以爬天花板。不要小看这小小的改变，它颠覆了整个游戏的体验。
传统跳跃游戏注重空中飞行的过程，普通爬墙类游戏跳跃与飞行比重各占一半，而这款游戏，跳跃成分大概可以占到九成。它没有过多的空中转向，不需要玩家对于惯性有着多么精妙的把控。
所以，Dustforce比起其他爬墙游戏操控起来更为舒服，玩家只需要掌握跳跃的时机，就可以做出一系列精彩的操作。

早些年游戏业界还没有形成如今的这种不良风气，游戏制作者和玩家都更为关注游戏设计部分，不像现在有这么多画面满分游戏设计不及格的作品。在群雄逐鹿的情况下，Dustforce仍旧能够脱颖而出，就是靠着它远超平均水准的关卡设计。

Dustforce的关卡设计水平，在整个steam平台上是最为顶尖的，如果考虑到其他平台作品，它仍旧能够排在上等，就算算上所有非商业的作品，它也能在那个年代属于中上。

Dustforce的关卡设计，无论从哪个方面看，都毫无瑕疵。
首先，它的关卡永远是多样的，变化的。尽管都是简单的跳跃，尽管都是简单的爬墙，你却找不出一段同样的路程。墙壁或者长出一截，或者短一截，或者两个平台距离稍远些。这款游戏就是利用这些最简单的场景物品，塑造出各种各样的跳跃体验。
游戏在难度处理上堪称完美。不同难度的关卡，不仅体现在关卡复杂度上，也涉及到专业的操控技巧上。在一步步通往更高难度的关卡中，逐渐增添了各种相对硬核的操控。一开始只是在平台间跳跃就行了，之后就更考验跳跃的时机，出现了落地立刻起跳这种动作，再之后还有F阶，转向反冲刺，墙角转折点借力加速，加速下落落地前冲，超小跳，陷阱借力等各种考验玩家的操作。
关卡长度适中，存档点相距不远，即便是一个对平台跳跃游戏不熟悉的新玩家，也能在这款游戏中得到锻炼，逐步成长。

[h1]Dustforce只接受硬核玩家[/h1]
这款游戏很优秀，玩家也认为它很优秀，游戏作者自己也是这么感觉的。
问题在于，它优秀到什么地步？或者说，它应该获得什么样的地位？

不知是谁带起的风气，硬核游戏一定要与“速通”、“无伤”这类词语挂钩。Dustforce也无可避免的陷入了这两点之中，但是，Dustforce又与其他硬核游戏不同，其他硬核游戏的速通风气是玩家自发组织的，而这款游戏却是游戏作者带起来的。
Dustforce中关卡解锁是有条件的，条件就是：“速通，且0失误上一个难度的关卡”。我个人非常讨厌这种设定，任何游戏，只要加上“无伤通关”的条件都能变成硬核游戏，硬核游戏也会因此变得更难，但它真的好玩吗？它真的有多么考验玩家的水平吗？答案是不一定，“0失误”已经不是在考验玩家水平了，而是在考验玩家的肌肉记忆，换句话说，它是花时间堆出来的。

不过，我仅对Dustforce这款游戏做出了一定程度的容忍，在我一次次解锁更高难度的关卡后，我发现高难的关卡值得我这样去做。在我20小时的游戏时间中，我反反复复重玩所有关卡，想要达成全关卡SS评价，就是为了解锁游戏的隐藏关卡。在我一遍遍的徘徊在失误与重新开始中，我打定主意，如果这款游戏的隐藏关不够惊艳，它将难逃我的差评。现如今这篇评测是好评，所以你应该知道结果了。
这款游戏这样做其实是有道理的，0失误达成低难度关卡，作为高难度关卡的入门标准，是可以接受的，游戏旨在培养硬核玩家，而不是一群靠着无限重生“瞎蒙”过关的娱乐玩家。
为了达成游戏SS评价，大概花费了我五倍通关游戏的时间，这建立在我对于平台跳跃相当熟悉的基础上，实际上，花费上百小时的也大有人在。这款游戏值不值得玩家这样去做，还需要每个人自我衡量。

[h1]Dustforce有些过于自视甚高了[/h1]
Dustforce的教程不是完全的，它只讲了一些基本操作，而没有说明高端操作技巧，但游戏在后期的高难关卡中却需要应用到这些高端技巧。
这不是游戏的教程制作出现了失误，而是游戏制作者故意的。纵观整个游戏历史，那些最出名，规模最庞大，资历最深厚的平台跳跃游戏，都没有100%完全的教程。是否懂得高端操作技巧，是衡量新人与入门级玩家的重要标准。游戏作者想要让玩家自己去研究游戏，互相讨论技巧，自发形成游戏社区。

Dustforce的确是想要建立一个游戏社区的，它自带一个地图编辑器，玩家可以自己制作地图，让别人来挑战。它有排行榜，可以直观的看见所有玩家的成绩，而且可以回放任何玩家的通关过程。
Dustforce的确是个优秀的游戏，它在所有商业游戏中可以位于上等，但是，距离建立庞大的游戏社区，距离名留青史，还有不小差距。
造成这种情况的原因很简单，Dustforce上限不够高，它没有能够让人流连忘返几年的深度。这款游戏的各种机关陷阱道具并不丰富，跳跃与爬墙没有更多复杂多变的形式，它之所以成为上等游戏，全靠着游戏制作人高超的关卡设计，但是，游戏作者已经把各种地形的摆放形式穷尽了，再难以有什么更多的内容可以发掘了。

Dustforce如果仅追求通关的话，并没有那么困难，它的难度仅仅能够在商业游戏中排在中上，但是游戏的通关率却非常低，就是因为它要求玩家0失误达成所有关卡。而0失误全关卡的难度，甚至已经超越了绝大多数同人游戏。随便看一下游戏的评论区，大多数人都卡在中期的关卡，游戏的成就达成仅为0.3%，考虑到作弊的存在，这个数字将会更低，我大概看了一下排名前200玩家的通关记录，毫不夸张的说，他们全都是用TAS达成的，依靠个人能力的玩家可能一个都没有。
如此低的通关率，如此低的成就达成率，游戏作者需要反思一下，这么做是否值得，为了保证游戏硬核的氛围，而将大多数不够格的玩家拒之门外，这样做是否合理。

[h1]总评[/h1]
这是steam平台上最顶尖的平台跳跃游戏之一，这款游戏不应错过。
Dustforce是一款“高冷”的游戏，它硬核，它不接受普通娱乐玩家，但是偏偏它有这样做的资本。这是一款不可多得的重视关卡设计的好游戏，这是一伙有着丰富经验和创意的制作团队。
也许由于Dustforce过于硬核的原因，大多数人不能完全体验这款游戏，但就算如此，人们也能在有限的关卡中体会到乐趣。",1546410651,1546413306,True,21,2,0.748587846755981445,1,False,False,False,False,

La gran diferencia aquí, además del estilo artístico singular y el concepto único, es que el movimiento de los personajes está fuertemente basado en la física y el manejo del momentum, por lo que el solo hecho de movernos implica dominar una serie de técnicas para impulsarnos a través de los níveles que requieren de cierta práctica. En un principio sentiremos los controles un poco tiesos, pesados y descontrolados, pero a medida que aprendamos las mecánicas del juego sucederá todo lo contrario y el movimiento se sentirá extremadamente fluido, ligero y preciso, lo que demuestra la profundidad del gameplay y lo hace extremadamente satisfactorio.
 Los niveles comienzan siendo bastante simples, pero el juego nos obliga a aprender sus mecánicas premiándonos con llaves de cobre, plata y oro cuando obtenemos la calificación más alta en cada nivel, permitiéndonos acceder a los niveles más difíciles. Cada vez que pasamos un nivel, nuestro puntaje queda automáticamente grabado, junto con una replay de nuestra partida, en las leaderboards mundiales, dándole al juego un toque competitivo y adictivo. A todo ello se suma un modo multijugador bastante divertido y la capacidad para descargar y jugar niveles creados por la comunidad, que hacen que la rejugabilidad sea prácticamente infinita.
Sin mucho más qué decir, recomiendo 100% Dustforce, especialemte a los fanáticos de las plataformas, con la única advertencia de que es un juego mucho más complejo y difícil, tanto mecánicamente como en el diseño de sus niveles, que quizás cualquier otro del género.

It's got an incredible art style, the core gameplay is fun, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Some levels unfold like puzzle boxes as you figure out the optimal route through the stage, and others are mad dashes through a reflex based stage, testing your reaction time and mechanical mastery. However, I have precisely one gripe with this game, and its something that is really saddening because of its omnipresence - the precision and the controls do not line up. 

What I mean by this is that Dustforce, as implied above, is a reflex driven platformer, where precision and control are vital to success. However, the game also asks for some maneuvers like circular d-pad/stick motions when moving around loops - go too fast or don't do a full sweep around the stick, and you lose your momentum and have to try again. It's subtle, a tiny little mistake that's so easy to miss, but makes it exponentially harder, as you find yourself falling off the inside of vertical loops and losing your momentum after a dive.

This could be my insistence on using the D-Pad speaking, as I prefer it over the stick for precision, and it doesn't make the game any less fun or unique - Dustforce is certainly both of those. It simply is marred by a little flaw that likely got missed in QA since it is very much a problem unique to the fresh player. 

Outside of this one flaw, the game is still fantastic and worth the asking price of $10. It's short, it's sweet, it's fun, and it's made with passion. Check this one out. 8/10",1541838562,1577224796,True,1,0,0.512520432472229004,0,True,False,False,False,

Sadly it didn't work. I played and played and practiced for so long, my head just won't shut up about the stupid achievment. Something I didn't care about in other games before. Only one achievment, one that nearly nobody got. One that I never thought would come in reach for someone like me. It's only one last level. And now I can't stop thinking about it again. That's why I am lurking the store page right now.
So I noticed, I didn't even write a review for this game. Just to avoid playing it again I am writing one now. Ultimatly because I am scared of the amount of work and frustration the last stretch holds for me.
I know I can do it god damn it. I NEED to do it before I die or lose the ability to do so. Getting older myself as well, doesn't make it easier.

Needles to say, I hold this game in high regards. I even wrote the developers an old school email once, to tell them how good their game is imo. They even answered and made me happy that way. Looks like they spent a lot of time with their dedicated community as well on reddit and such.

...It is chasing me down for a good amount of time now. If you want to know something about the gameplay, just read some other reviews. Just one thing. The depth of this game is unmatched in it's genre.

La première différence qui saute aux yeux dès que l'on commence à jouer, cependant, c'est l'ambiance: dans ""Super Meat Boy"", tout est agressif - on y dirige un petit bout de viande écorché qui laisse des traînées de sang sur tout ce qu'il touche, et qui doit se faufiler à toute vitesse entre des scies circulaires, des lasers, des missiles, etc. dans des décors hostiles, sales et délabrés, le tout représenté dans une esthétique trash et accompagné d'une musique tonitruante...

[i]A contrario,[/i] ""Dustforce"" a une ambiance posée et contemplative et une esthétique pastel et poétique qui rappellent beaucoup certains dessins animés japonais: dans ""Dustforce"", on joue des balayeurs qui au lieu d'ensanglanter leurs environnements doivent les nettoyer de leurs feuilles mortes, leur poussière ou leurs déchets, ces environnements étant sobres et paisibles et la musique du jeu étant spectaculairement douce et relaxante (pour ne pas dire ""planante"").

On pourrait donc croire que ""Dustforce"" est une version ""soft"" de ""Super Meat Boy"", mais en fait c'est le contraire: comme les jeux de puzzles les plus retors, les apparences ""zen"" de ""Dustforce"" servent en fait à compenser un gameplay extrêmement exigeant et un level design éprouvant. Si ""Super Meat Boy"" est un chef-d'œuvre, c'est (et on ne le dit pas assez) en bonne partie grâce à sa grande accessibilité, mais ce n'est pas du tout l'orientation de ""Dustforce"", qui est à l'inverse élitiste de bout en bout.

Si ""Dustforce"" est élitiste, c'est pour deux raisons - d'abord, il y a le système de notation du jeu: au lieu de simplement devoir atteindre la fin du niveau le plus vite possible pour décrocher une bonne note, il faut ici nettoyer dans un premier temps toutes les surfaces sales (ce qui est noté de 'D' à 'S') et sans prendre de pauses trop longues (il y a un système de combo qui se casse au bout de quelques secondes, la longueur du combo étant là encore notée de 'D' à 'S'), le temps sert simplement à différencier les joueurs ayant des doubles 'S' dans les classements en ligne. Le parcours d'un niveau est donc bien plus balisé et moins libre que dans ""Super Meat Boy"", et demande beaucoup plus de méthode et de précision (et de la ténacité, certains niveaux étant très voire trop longs pour un jeu du genre).

Et ensuite, ""Dustforce"" est élitiste surtout pour sa maniabilité. J'ai lu quelqu'un qui blâmait ses contrôles en les comparant à ceux de ""[b]Prince of Persia[/b]"" (l'original sur Apple II), ce qui est exagéré mais pertinent: ""Dustforce"" est en effet bourré de délais de prise d'élan, de latences variées, d'effets de magnétisme (on peut courir temporairement aux murs et même aux plafonds et on ""colle"" en quelque sorte à eux) peu intuitifs, rigides et très difficiles à maîtriser, qui enrichissent le gameplay et feront ainsi la joie d'un certain type de joueurs, mais qui risquent de beaucoup frustrer les autres.

Personnellement, j'ai gagné ""Super Meat Boy"" avec quasiment des 'A+' partout sans problème excessif, j'ai obtenu des doubles 'S' dans un peu plus de la moitié de ""Dustforce"", et je sais malgré tout que je suis un béotien complet dans ""Dustforce"" et qu'un bon tiers de ses niveaux resteront toujours hors de ma portée: quand je regarde une vidéo des meilleurs temps du jeu (on peut le faire facilement depuis les tableaux de classement en ligne), j'ai l'impression de regarder un film d'arts martiaux de Hong Kong et je suis incapable de comprendre ce que fait le joueur, alors que les vidéos de ""Super Meat Boy"" sont pour moi toujours relativement faciles à comprendre et même à reproduire.

""Dustforce"" est ainsi objectivement un bon jeu, qui m'a procuré beaucoup de plaisir et que j'ai trouvé très intéressant dans ses mécaniques, mais il est tout à fait possible qu'il vous exaspère selon le type de joueur que vous êtes.

Dustforce is  unique to me for the fact it didn't offer any new mechanics throughout the game. Yet, the gameplay never became boring or tedious. That's quite a feat. 

The only complaint I had at times with Dustforce is the feel / responsiveness of the controls. I want to say they were fluid but at the same time they took a little getting used to.

This is a very difficult platformer, but unlike any I've ever played.

This is more difficult; there are moves I cannot pull off, and there are levels I simply don't understand how to beat.

If you're a completionist, this game may drive you insane. I'll be coming back to this game, probably forever.

P.S. The reviews that say the controls are horrible / clunky / slow etc. do not understand the game. It is very easy to misunderstand that this will not feel like most platformers. This is all about momentum and ""perfect runs"", not simply beating the level. I've heard the controls compared to a fighting game, I think that's a good analogy.

While it is easy to learn it is difficult to master. If you get this game be prepared for how much time you will need to put in to be good at it.

You play a janitor sweeping up and defeating the occasional enemy. The levels themselves are accessed from a nexus, which acts as a level to get to the levels. So, you will need to platform and know how to do certain moves to get to the harder levels. After beating levels, you are graded on your completeness and your Finesse (how smooth your run was), you then receive progress to unlocking keys to get into newer and harder levels. The better you do on the level, the more progress you get to your key. 

That is where Dustforce sets itself apart, I think, from most other platformers. The goal of each level isn’t to beat it, its to master it and get the S rank in both Completion and Finesse. So, you can’t just do the level and move on you have to keep doing it and doing it and doing it until you have it perfect. While I did not spend a lot of time with Dustforce, this game is just not for me, I appreciate its difficulty and I had fun when I was able to breeze through levels and not miss a step, but I don’t have the time to put into it to master the game, and I’m just not innately good enough at platformers to do it naturally.

If you like difficult platformers and are the kind of person that loves to perfect their run on any given level, then this game is for you. If you are new to the genre and are looking to use this game as your gateway in, I’m sure there are more good, but less difficult games to get you started.

Ce jeu est probablement le meilleur jeu de plateforme existant. Même les références du genre tels VVVVVV, Super Meat Boy ou encore N++ n'ont pas l'incroyable richesse de Dustforce ni sa physique enchanteresse, infiniment plus plaisante que celle de n'importe quel autre jeu du genre.

Le principe du jeu, ou plutôt les principes sont simples : vous pouvez au choix viser les meilleurs scores en nettoyant un maximum de saletés (feuilles, poussières, détritus, slime en fonction des environnements parcourus), le tout sans mourir et en enchaînant rapidement ; ou alors atteindre la fin du niveau le plus rapidement possible. Votre performance se verra attribuer un rang entre D (le moins bon) et S (le meilleur) pour la "" complétion "" du niveau (si vous avez bien tout nettoyé) et un second pour la "" finesse "" (évalue votre capacité à enchaîner les nettoyages). À noter que la première approche est récompensée d'un rang SS si effectuez parfaitement un niveau tandis que la seconde approche, négligeant le nettoyage, sera assez peu récompensée ; mais rien ne vous empêche de viser les meilleurs temps tout en faisant un niveau en SS, au contraire !

Vous disposez de toute une palette d'actions pour vous mouvoir en plus des déplacements classiques au stick/ZQSD, selon que vous jouiez au clavier ou à la manette car les deux sont possibles. 
Tout d'abord le plus important : le dash. Contrairement à certains jeux comme Super Meat Boy qui permettent de courir en permanence avec la pression d'un bouton, ici le dash n'est qu'un petit boost en avant qui vous octroit la vitesse maximum de marche instantanément. Il permet également de conserver les vitesses très élevées, que vous pouvez atteindre en chutant ou en glissant le long des pentes, si vous réussissez à avoir le bon rythme pour dasher en boucle.
Évidemment vous pouvez sauter, et dasher, dans le jeu à n'importe quel moment depuis le sol ou un mur ; dans les airs seulement s'il vous reste une "" air charge "". C'est un nom particulier qui a son utilité puisque une fois en l'air on peut utiliser un saut ou un dash (ou exclusif si l'on omet la technique avancée du dashjump qui consiste à sauter et dasher durant la même frame), c'est pour cela qu'on parle d'air charge afin d'indiquer la possiblité de faire l'une ou l'autre de ces actions.
Vous disposez également d'attaques légères qui vous permettent de nettoyer les saletés ou de vaincre les ennemis, et aussi d'attaques lourdes, équivalentes à trois attaques légères en terme de dégâts, avec plus de portée mais plus lentes que ces dernières. Anéantir un ennemi avec une attaque lourde fera apparaître des projections si un mur se trouve suffisamment proche dans la direction de l'attaque, ce qui peut vous pénaliser car prendra plus de temps à renettoyer ou au contraire vous avantager pour remplir votre "" jauge de super "". En effet, en nettoyant votre jauge augmente petit à petit et une fois pleine, une pression simultanée des touches assignées aux attaque légères et lourdes vous fera nettoyer (à condition que la surface à nettoyer de soit pas derrière un mur par rapport à votre personnage) et annihiler tous les ennemis en une fraction de seconde dans une rayon donné autour de vous. Détruire un ennemi avec une attaque ou utiliser la super vous fera regagner votre air charge ce qui permet de longues phases impressionantes sans toucher le sol dans les derniers niveaux.
Input la direction du haut permet d'évoluer le long des murs ou des plafonds tandis que la direction du bas permet de glisser le long des pentes ou, combinée avec un dash, de "" fastfall "" (faire une chute accélerée pour retomber plus rapidement au sol).

Quatre personnages différents peuvent être incarnés : Dustman, Dustgirl, Dustkid et Dustworth ; chacun ayant des caractéristiques différentes pour la hauteur des sauts, la longueur de dash, le vitesse de chute, la portée ou encore la vitesse des attaques. Vous pourrez donc changer de personnage avant chaque début de niveau en fonction des spécificités de celui-ci ou de vos préférences personnelles.

Le jeu ne dispose pas d'écran de sélection des niveaux sous forme de menu puisque toutes les entrées de niveau sont accessibles dans un monde appelé Nexus. Le Nexus est divisé en 4 environnements : forestier, château/manoir, urbain et laboratoire. Chaque déplacement entre les niveaux est une opportunité de perfectionner sa technique. Ceux-ci sont décomposés en 4 catégories de difficulté croissante : les niveau accessibles de base, les niveaux bronze, les niveaux argent et les niveaux or. 
Chaque entrée de niveau nécessite une clef correspondante ; clefs débloquables en finissant des niveaux de difficulté inférieur. Par exemple une clef argent s'obtient en finissant plusieurs niveaux bronze. Plus vos rangs sont bons plus vous débloquerez de nouvelles clefs rapidement. Les niveaux or quant à eux vous donnent des clefs rouges...

Le jeu possède une courbe de difficulté adaptative puisque vous ne pouvez débloquer les niveaux de difficulté supérieur qu'en réussissant les niveaux plus simples. Il est théoriquement possible d'atteindre l'entrée d'un niveau or dès le début du jeu (quoiqu'extrêmement difficile pour quelqu'un n'ayant pas encore débloqué des niveaux argent) sans pouvoir le faire puisque vous n'aurez pas la clef nécessaire pour l'ouvrir. 
Au tout début les mécaniques sont relativement difficiles à assimiler, bien que les tutoriels soient exemplaires, il faut donc se familiariser un peu avec le jeu, l'affaire d'une heure ou deux en faisant le tour du Nexus et des entrées de niveau accessibles pour la technique d'un joueur débutant. Une fois chose faite on se retrouve face à une courbe de progression plutôt logarithmique : les niveaux jusqu'au bronze de font assez aisément puis les argents commencent à demander plus d'investissement et enfin les niveaux or vous prendrons autant de temps que tous les autres réunis.
Pour ma part en une petite trentaine d'heure de jeu j'ai quasiment fini tous les niveaux en SS, sauf les derniers niveaux or bien ardus, et avec un classement plutôt correct, entre 300 et 2000 en fonction des niveaux. Cependant la différence avec les joueurs qui font systématiquement top 100 est abyssale et vu la profondeur du jeu ça n'est pas étonnant de voir plusieurs joueurs atteindre le millier d'heure pour obtenir ce niveau de maîtrise.

Si le contenu proposé de base par le jeu ne vous suffit pas, de très nombreuses maps custom sont jouables. Un mode multijoueur est également disponible.

Que dire de plus, si ce n'est que la direction artistique du jeu est fantastique, agréable à l'oeil tout en restant très lisible. L'OST n'est pas en reste puisque Lifeformed a livré une musique magnifique et apaisante qui se marie à merveille avec l'aspect graphique du jeu. Le sound design en lui-même est, pour changer, d'excellente facture, et rythme les niveaux telle une cerise sur le gâteau visuel et sonore qui nous est servi.

La communauté speedrun est évidemment très active sur le jeu, plusieurs années après sa sortie les records sont encore battus régulièrement car les joueurs sont loins d'avoir maîtrisé à la perfection le jeu, beaucoup trop riche et complexe pour que cela ne soit que l'affaire de quelques années ; et les speedrun, quelle que soit la catégorie, sont toujours incroyablement fascinants à regarder mais aussi très inspirants pour les joueurs. 
La metagame du jeu s'est façonnée au fur et à mesure et c'est ainsi qu'on se retrouve avec un personnage spécifique dominant complètement le classement d'un niveau puisque tout a pu être optimisé du mieux possible avec lui ; et à l'inverse d'autres hauts de classement sont bariolés avec la présence de tous les personnages, montrant que la créativité et les styles de jeu de chacun peuvent s'exprimer sans que l'on s'en trouve limité.

Nah, but for real. You're probably not going to be able to beat the game unless you're very good at this kind of stuff or willing to invest a lot of time. This is usually something that would keep me from recommending a game (see my review of DeadCore) but the time I did decide to spend with Dustforce was exceedingly pleasant, the music is fantastic, and the level tiers allow you a sense of accomplishment and closure even if you quit early. Yes, I do wish the game conveyed even more clearly how to execute the more difficult moves (and didn't just expect me to patiently learn through trial and error and watching other players), but ultimately I do feel it's less my fault than the games' for me not being able to carry on.

Dustforce is a speedrunning game, in essence. Major focus on completing the levels as fast as possible, and the mechanics are inclined to reflect that. Movement is fluid and quick; after a little while of learning the controls you'll find yourself breezing through the beautiful enviroments and dispatching areas of dust. And that is where this game is unique, in that you have to not only go fast but to clean the room of dust/leaves/slime as best you can. Going fast by itself will not get you the best grading (although usually the dust is used to indicate to you the best possible path you can take, think of it like coins but more specific.)

This game features smoothly animated hand-drawn graphics and shows an incredible amount of attention to detail, without obtrustructing the gameplay. Leaves fall gracefully when you dust them away, old attics have a neglected ambience to them, it all fits together wonderfully.

The soundtrack is worth mentioning on its own merit. Many peaceful, relaxing or energetic tunes for this surprisingly high-octane game make playing it a pleasure. I can't properly put it into words but I think this game is worth buying for the music alone.

The game also features multiplayer and a plethora of custom levels with a wide community. I haven't really tried it out myself though.

The level design is the best I've seen from an indie game - each level has themes that are developed without ever being too repetitive, and yet it all fits into the game's core gameplay without any need for one-off mechanical gimmicks. Restarting is fast and stages never have any sections that are too easy or make you wait too much. 
The levels are somewhat long and yet more lenient compared to other games in the ""hard platforming"" subgenre, which results in lots of proper, well-paced tension while playing, whether in trying to recover form a failure or from finishing the last section of a level. Far too many of said platformers get stuck in lolhard-land, where fun comes down to retrying pixel-perfect jumps in a 10-second level hundreds of times.
My only serious criticism is perhaps about visuals getting in the way of gameplay. For one, the fluid animations can get in the way of understanding the actual coordinates of your character, which is especially frustrating when dealing with dust blocks. Also, there is no way to immediately see if you have jump charge or not. That is something I'd say would be a much better use of the glowy aura than the special attack, which can be seen at the bottom of the screen or outright memorised for certain sections of a level.
A minor complaint is with how poorly the game explains some of its controls. That's somehat aggravating given how you're required to know unintuitive techniques you're never told about to access certain levels. For instance, the fact that you can slide off a U-shaped ceiling and back into a wall without jumping if you have enough speed.",1499051074,1499051301,True,4,0,0.53600001335144043,0,True,False,False,False,

This was the first game where I found myself revisiting levels just because I wanted to do a better job.

Another great part of this game is the way they handle the learning curve. There are plenty of levels that a beginner can approach, and each of these helps teach you the tricks and strategies you'll need to tackle the more difficult parts. They never spoon-feed you any technique, but instead let you develop it yourself as you work your way through.

It feels like the inputs are done so precisely that only a machine or someone who knows the game beat-for-beat would be able to execute with such precision. And truly, precision is likely the name of the game.
You'll come for the challenge and stay, again, for the challenge of trying to perfect your runs. I doubt that anyone coming in fresh to the game will be able to top and particular chart (or even top 10 for that matter) without many dozens, possibly hundreds, of hours invested into it.
To this day I'm not sure what control scheme is better suited to this game: a controller (where all relevant buttons are a glide away) or with a keyboard (where all the actions are laid out in a row). A friend of mine, who is far better at this game than I am, swears by the keyboard, and it does sometimes feel like the superior control scheme.

An honorable mention should go out to Lifeformed for a fantastic, near flawless OST. I love it. It is likely in my top 5, in fact. If nothing else, play this game for the music and ambiance alone (or better yet, go buy and support the artist).

The game pulls its inspiration from brutal platformers such as the Jumper series and Super Meat Boy. What sets Dustforce apart, however, is the emphasis on performing fluid and stylish runs. Like the aforementioned games, the levels are relatively short and when you die you simply respawn. Primary hazards include spikes and death traps. What's unique about Dustforce though is that each level contains 'dust' cleverly distributed throughout. You can simply get to the end of a level if you wanted, but you'll score better and feel more accomplished by clearing all the dust. This requires a near perfect series of maneuvers and speed unparalleled in any other platformer. Perhaps the most clever implentation within this game is the ability to watch other players' replays. As devising a feasible route for quickly clearing dust can itself be a puzzle, it is fantastic being able to see how the best of the best go about each level.

Its creative, fast, and you can even see exactly how the guy at the top of each stage managed to do his record run and learn from it. Its insane the skill and practice you have to have to run perfectly and at top speed on each stage to even qualify for the top scores.

It requires a lot of practice, skill and timing to master each stage and even start competing with the top scores.

Cons:
-Difficulty Curve
definately not for newcomers of the platforming genre, or for impatient people. As this game is throughly made around it's mechanics. You will fail, you'll die, you'll be enraged when you can't beat a tough section. Infact I first made a joke review saying how you'll love the tutorial, because I could not get to the 3rd tutorial, Yes not beat, get to. This is also how dustforce teaches new players. By tempting a challange and use the player's curiousity to solve the issue.
-Story
The closest thing to a story is the opening sequence (Which can be disabled), and probably the multiplayer, but this is not a major issue. As the game was clearly not designed for story.

Pros:
-Graphics
Dustforce uses a vibrant and simplistic artstyle. It's soothing to look at, completely complementary to the gameplay. Your 5 enviroments are distinctive, the  tranquil forest, the grimy city roof tops, the minimalistic virtual levels, the haunting manor levels, and the futuristic lab levels. However they are not so distinct that you get tired of seeing them. A forest level might have a noon set stroll while another is at peaceful midnight. 
-Effects
The effects blend the artstyle and gameplay into a satisfying adventure. When you get that tail glow, not only does it look awesome, but helps keep track of your super attack. The trash particles when you sweep them up, feels rewarding, but also gives you visual feedback that you hit that part and you don't need to look back. Which helps the main concept of this game.
-Music
Like the Graphics, the music is reciprocal to the tough gamplay. Relaxing, and energetic the music calms the player. The devs knew it's not supposed to be snowing on your parade, so they took their cider time, and made their world a safe place to sleep. If you can't handle the frustrating 9-Bit expedition this game provides. Then buy this soundtrack.
-Gameplay
This is Why dustforce is the contender for best 2D platformer of all time. The platforming is fast paced, and gratifying. Nailing those jumps you once couldn't do as a newbie, is a sensation I rarely get from other platformers, but here it's every level. Hitting enemies and hearing that sweet SWACK sound is delightfully empowering. Even the hub world provides a amusing playground. The controls and fluid movement take some time to get use to, but you'll take to it like walking.
-Level Design
No other game knows itself better than dustforce. Their are several parts where you think, this can't be possible. But try, you'll get it eventually. Infact plottwists for this game is finding the new ways you can run in your virtual earth. The story of this game is it's gameplay. 
-Level Editor
You'd be suprised at the complexity of this thing, it offers basic building blocks and enemy placement, to light configurations and dynamic camera angles. The community maps are a treat, and diverse thanks to this robust editor.  
-Multiplayer
A fun distraction, very limiting because you have such a small arsonal, but a good time with friends.
-SpeedRuning
Normally I would not list this as a positive or negative, but man, Dustforce lives by it's speed running community. I'll never be as good as Luffy, Thor, or Freshmanic. But I love trying to beat the guy at 784th place on the leader boards, especially when I succeed.

This is a pretty well-defined moment, and one in which you realise the potential your sluggish, heavy-footed janitor has to become a ninja with a broom. This is the point where I started to have fun. The game is still about hitting precise jumps at the exact right moment, but understanding of the game's mechanics surrounding momentum is what makes it genuinely fun. The difficulty curve can be pretty brutal, which was only alleviated a little bit by the [url=http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-dx-update-released]overhaul patch[/url] released by Hitbox Team in 2014 (branded [i]Dustforce DX[/i]), which stopped the hub world from flowing like a brick wall by filtering players directly from the easiest tier of levels onto the next tier without leading them past the levels which introduce the mechanics integral for success.

The aforementioned hub world is divided into four areas - a fairly standard forest, a huge, empty mansion, a bustling city and a complex of underground laboratories. As of [i]Dustforce DX[/i], the hub world loops all the way around, filtering you back into the forest after you've completed the easiest tier of levels in the laboratories. Once back in the forest, you'll find that the new skills you've picked up actually help you access other levels within the previous regions, unveiling a more precise progression system than the game initially lets on. The [i]DX[/i] hub world is fantastic - not only does it provide potential for a more linear path through the game's many difficulty tiers, but it also creates a prerequisite level of ability for reaching certain maps. For instance, you're not going to be able to access the top floors of the mansion without some advanced climbing techniques. However, once you do reach these floors, the levels within will actually require that you use the same techniques to progress through them. It's a subtly clever way to protect players from accidentally stumbling into an pixel-perfect reflex orgy that they're not prepared to complete. It's a similar method to the one [i]Dark Souls[/i] uses - very little of the games learning curve comes in the form of text boxes or direct tutorials; you're expected to pick these things up as you go. It adds a lot of depth to the game's already gorgeous aesthetic of a janitor cleaning his environment in total solidarity.

Speaking of which - [i]Dustforce[/i] is gorgeous. From the smooth animations on the characters to the way dust and leaves kick up into the air and then dissipate when you sweep them up to the calm little chiptunes that play while you're cleaning, every cosmetic aspect of [i]Dustforce[/i] is to the end goal of contributing to the complete sense of calm that it invokes. It's a huge asset to the game's success that there isn't a plot - anything more complex than 'just clean everything up' would detract from the atmosphere and overcomplicate the two draws [i]Dustforce[/i] really has - simple controls used in complicated ways for maximum effectiveness.",1490357228,1500909740,True,2,1,0.415428727865219116,0,True,False,False,False,

Did you ever imagined a crossbreed between VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy ? This more or less wraps up that game.
Dustforce is a challenging platformer where every layer of dirt needs to be swept in order to access harder levels.

To do this, enter the Nexus, choose any of the four ninjanitors available and keep cleaning by walking over, jumping on or bashing filth. Controls are pleasant, and playthroughs sometimes heady for a cleaner work ""simulation"".

Remember, though, it's not easy task : if you're not specifically good, you'll have to arm yourself with patience, and a fairly great amount of it at that, to perfect the levels and assimilate subtle mechanics that honestly aren't obvious, and sometimes really frustrating.

But who knows, maybe you'll have a great time doing it, especially if you also enjoy those colorful 2D sceneries and Terence Lee's great music.

Anyway, Dustforce is to me an underrated platformer that should be tested at least once.

Dustforce is an indie platformer that blends various game mechanics together into a smooth and unique gameplay experience. While speed is a focus, the game also requires a certain amount of finesse that never feels too awkward. However, the challenge level rises very quickly and newbies may find themselves discouraged very early on.

Overall, I'd recommend this game more for platformer enthusiasts and hardcore players. Those who enjoyed the Sonic series and similar speed-focused games should definitely pick up this rare gem for a very memorable platformer experience.",1484540897,1484540897,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

I just didn't notice any difference between the 4 cleaners (if there's any at all) and there's not too many levels, though there's a level editor if you feel like giving it a shot. 

I recommend playing it with a controller, but you will have to manually map it in the options menu. If you don't want to, you can enjoy it with the keyboard as well, the controls are very responsive.

온라인 랭킹 및 리플레이 기능도 지원하기 때문에 고수들의 플레이를 보면서 특정 맵의 공략을 연구해볼 수도 있겠고요.
아, 스테이지 선택까지도 하나의 컨텐츠로 만들어 놓았다는 점도 빼놓을 수 없겠네요.

물론, 딱히 스토리가 있는 게임은 아니기 때문에 스토리를 보는 분들은 별로 흥미를 못 느낄 수도 있을 듯합니다. 그리고 튜토리얼도 맵을 3개나 할당할 정도로 나름대로는 꽤나 정성스럽게 구성해 놓았다는 것은 보이는데 그럼에도 불구하고 조작에 대한 모든 것을 가르쳐주진 않기 때문에 나머지는 혼자 발견해 내거나 유튜브 등지의 도움을 필요로 한다는 점도 있겠고요.

A relatively unseen, unknown game that blows away many AAA titles released today, just out of sheer love and attention by the developers.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Finely tuned. That's the most accurate description that comes to mind when I think of what it feels like to play Dustforce. In the same way that you can pick up Smash Bros for the very first time, or be a veteran who knows every combo, and still have an absolute blast, this game delievers an identical experiece on depth of fun. There is a brief tutorial in the beginning of the game to familiarize players with the most basic mechanics, but then they do a wonder of teaching through experience. The levels ramp in difficulty, from ""so easy my blind grandma could do it"" to ""you're going to have to practice this one for 8 hours if you want to finish it"". That sounds like a barrier, in a world where we feel the need to play every game until completion, but it's quite freeing in practice. You finally get to play what's [i]fun[/i]. If you like the easiest, relaxing levels, there's something here for you. If you like mind-numblingly difficult ones, they've got you covered. And when you're done with all of those? Swing over to their website for thousands of user-created cakewalks and nightmares. 

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
You can see for yourself, this game is beautiful. Lovingly crafted, the look perfectly complimenting the gameplay. Every animation, every character, every enemy, is an absolute joy to watch. As you speed around the levels sweeping up dust, leaves, and other grime, you'll feel a sense of ease and relaxation. It's odd to say for a game that can be so challenging and difficult, but how could you not when even the color pallete is perfectly chosen.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
A masterpiece. You can hear it in the trailer, but it doesn't do it quite the same justice as playing the game with it running in the background. If you would like to give the entire thing a listen, you can do so [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_B8ekeZTCM]here[/url].

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
[b]If you take the time and put in the effort to become good at this game, it's like magic. Like water flowing through your hands, or painting gorgeous works of art. One movement glides into another, no infurating bugs to ruin your progress, no janky mechanics to kill your zen-like trance. Dustforce let's you feel like you've mastered it, in a way that very few do.[/b]

Just buy the game, sit down for a good session, and hopefully you'll see what I saw in this title when I first played it many years ago.




[b]Old Review[/b]
This game is truly a masterpiece regarding mechanics and soundtrack. The depth and skill level required for some of the bonus levels is mind-boggling, and it's the most satisfying feeling to climb up the leaderboards and compete against your friends.

+Visuals: Great pixelated graphics, with cool style, so even pixelated the game looks pretty smooth. Great effects - dust, leafs etc, infected animals looks cool before and after. A pleasure to see.
+Gameplay: Has its pros and cons - one the one hand - this game is amazing platformer with сrаpton of levels + community map packs - on the other hand - after sometimes game gets really difficult, making its nearly impossible to fully complete, so you can enjoy a lot of easy/medium levels but not beat the game, or you can enjoy all levels but sweat your a55 off - would enjoy if you are hardcore platformer fan.
Oh, you also have 4 characters to pick with different stats!
+Controls - pretty smooth reliable controls, most likely this game is better with a controller.
+Steam cards
-The one and only steam achievement is nearly impossible to get - like 0.3% of people got it.

The game has in-game leaderboards with replays, so if you ever wonder how the fastest players achieved their times, you can watch their runs from within the game.

You'll find yourself grinding a hard level for hours to get SS rank without it really feeling like a grind and it'll all be worth it when you get it.

There's also a level editor with a huge amount of user created levels on the Atlas in case you want more challenges and neat ideas you wouldn't see in the stock levels.

One of my favourite features though is the leaderboard/replay system. Every run automatically gets recorded and uploaded to the boards so you can view anyone's run at any time (as long as you have an internet connection of course). No need to wonder how the world record got such a crazy time, you can just view it yourself! It really pushes you to improve yourself and compete with your friends.

That's part of the magic of Dustforce. It's one of those games that really lets you take the game at your own pace, do levels how you see fit. There's no plot or story which allows you to explore whichever unlocked door you want to first.

It's a very easy game to get into, with challenge ramping and testing you throughout. The entire game is essentially a tutorial. Unlike similar describable games though, there is an endgame there.

I love the concept, but I really can't say I enjoy the 'feel' of the game. It has some weird momentum-based physics that give it a sort of 'floaty' feel to it. A lot of people will call this a precision-based platformer. I would call it pretentious. The devs did well to implement a series of tutorials, as they thought the game was too hard for many. However, there are still a ton of hidden mechanics that aren't explicitly taught to the player, so it's often confusing once you've completed a certain number of levels on where to head next. Until you know what's possible in the context of the game, it's really off-putting. I shouldn't have to go to forums and YouTube to determine that there are many completely obtuse things hidden in the game's mechanics in order to proceed. 

Additionally, there are numerous bugs this game has, such as the game deciding it will automatically use up your double jump if you are too close to an edge. Mr Peck on YouTube has these documented, if you want some evidence of them. Tons of optimization problems, such as crashing if you alt+tab out of the window and simply setting up a controller is a nightmare if you want to switch between keyboard and gamepad; buttons across both is frustrating. They should have just used a 'set all buttons' command and let the player sequentially determine the mappings.

While the controls feel a bit different than what you'd normally expect out of this sort of game, they're actually very well made once you've had some time to get used to them. The gameplay is rock-solid, the soundtrack and art are comfy, and the higher-difficulty levels provide a great challenge.

My main gripe with the game, and consider this an important disclaimer if you're anything less than really, -really- good at platformers, is the system for unlocking new levels. 
Levels have 5 difficulties, which for purposes of space we'll call A, B, C, D, and E. By default, you have all of the A levels unlocked. Completing an A level and getting an S rank for both dust cleared and max combo (called SS rank) earns you a key to unlock a single B level. Likewise, earning SS rank on a B level unlocks you a C level, SS-C unlocks a D, and earning SS on all of the D levels opens up a bonus hub world containing the E levels.
It's important to note that to earn S-rank for each category, you must score absolutely perfectly. That is, clear -all- the dust from the level, and have a combo that stretches all the way from the first patch of dust to the last. 
If you earn less than an SS rank, be it SA, AS, BB, CD, or whatever, you only earn a portion of a key. So in example, earning BC rank on two A levels would get you a single B key and some progress towards the next one, as opposed to the two you'd have earned if you had scored SS ranks.
This brings up the pretty immediate problem that, if you don't have the skill and/or patience to keep retrying to earn SS on every level, you'll never unlock the more challenging (and at least for me, the more fun) parts of the game, especially considering that dying, or even just getting hit, automatically disqualifies you from earning S for combo unless you start the entire level over again.
While this isn't a huge issue for A and B levels for anyone of at least moderate skill, C levels already ramp up the challenge significantly, and D levels are pretty much Meat Boy tier in how many times you're going to die trying to beat them (don't even get me started on the E levels), so this system ends up locking out a lot of players from a significant portion of the game merely because they weren't -absolutely perfect- at it.

This aside, I do recommend the game to anyone who likes truly challenging platformers, as there's a light at the end of the tunnel that saved this review from being a Negative one: Should you find yourself in the same situation I did, having a lot of fun with just the challenge of beating the levels, but no fun at all at the prospect of going back and spending hours trying to perfect them, something you may simply not have the skill to do, the game has a community-made mod called Dustmod that, among a whole lot of other functions, lets you switch your save file to NG+ with the click of a button, unlocking all of the levels and letting you play the entire game without having to worry about rank.",1473366957,1473366957,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

If you enjoy speedrunning and technical movement, or just want a fun little 2D platformer with relaxing audiovisuals, I would definitely recommend this game.

The goal of the game is to get a perfect score in each level, which involves clearing all of the dust without missing a spot and while maintaining your combo. Now, it is very difficult to do this in every level, especially in the endgame levels. Dustforce is more about seeing how far you can push your abilities. Each level has an online leaderboard where you can compare your time against others, and see how low you can push your time. In the beginning, some jumps and obstacles seem impossible, like they require you to unlock a new item or technique or something, but Dustforce is purely skill-based. As you master the movement, you slowly figure out how to overcome these challenges with your default abilities, and find new ways to do levels faster and faster.

The game has instant replays for every run on the leaderboards, a level editor, a great soundtrack, and a large number of base levels. I think this is a very enjoyable game, but you have to remember to have some patience with it. It may take some time to master the movement, and some of the harder levels may take hours of attempts to beat properly.

Dustforce DX é um jogo onde o jogador interpreta o papel de um ou uma, dependendo do personagem escolhido, faxineiro. O jogo tem uma pegada muito forte na jogabilidade sendo muito fluída e muito bem correspondida. Pode-se jogar no teclado ou no controle, sendo que eu aconselho a jogar no controle, sendo mais fácil o controle do personagem. Dustforce é um jogo dos gêneros hack and slash, plataforma, 2D, sendo por várias vezes muito desafiador tendo outro ponto de alto destaque o hall da fama, o que o incentiva a ser cada vez melhor em cada fase jogada. O jogo possui 4 personagens jogáveis sendo que cada um deles possui habilidades e mecânica um pouco diferentes, mudando o golpe especial por exemplo. A mêcanica de jogo é muito bem feita tendo sua física excepcional, no jogo podemos pular, andar, dar dash, bater, usar um golpe especial, escalar, deslizar, se pendurar, sendo possível essas coisas tanto nas paredes como no teto. Combinando esses termos que citei, a jogabilidade se torna fluída e interessante, tendo várias opções para se passar uma fase. Nas fases tu terás que passar por monstros, animais, objetos que estão “sujos” e tu terás que “limpa-los”, sendo que todos possuem modo de atacar e inteligência diferentes.
O game possui um level editor sendo possível jogar suas próprias fases ou as criadas pela comunidade. É possível se jogar dois modos cooperativo local, sendo um quem conclui a fase com maior pontuação e quão rápido fez isso ganha, e o outro um modo de quem consegue matar o outro derrubando-o no “nimbo”. Os gráficos são bons para a proposta do jogo porém o mesmo não sendo focado nisso e sim na jogabilidade o que compensa e muito. É possível de se realizar combos quase infinitos bastando somente da sua capacidade de executá-los.

Dustforce is underrated and unfairly downrated. Whether you're good/not good at it, the game is great. ""Tight and responsive controls"" commonly boil down to ""easy and requiring little brain power"" and lead to less technical capability for a player to utilize. It's one loathesome reason why people say gamers barely use their brains. Blaming the non-status quo movement and momentum physics to justify giving a negative review is a poor, lazy, subjective decision that doesn't do Dustforce justice, especially when many others can actually do it. Refer to Super Metroid for a minute. It's an iconic example of completely breaking the norm for platformers. It fused with action, exploration adventure, and has controls and physics that shatter your experiences if you've only jumped like a Mario or a Mega Man.

Like a fighting game, Dustforce's controls will require some learning and does not give you ""Yeah, I get it"" filler moments. The skill ceiling is much higher. The tricks are much more complex. Good fighting game players know more than to just spam 2 moves. Good platformer players can do more than just run + (double/wall) jump. Also see TotalBiscuit's video review on his YouTube channel for a good, objective take at the game. It's for an old version but the things covered in the video still hold up. One more important thing to note is that this game was [i]not[/i] made in Game Maker. Only the [i]prototype[/i] was. The finished product uses its own workings built from scratch. Don't be like those fools who don't read/research and bash the game on an incorrect fact.

[i]Dustforce is a difficult game. That doesn't take all the fun away... There will be those incorrect people who think that being bad at a game alone means the game sucks. ""This game sucks"" is not the correct way to say ""I suck at this game"", or ""In reality, I'm too lazy to learn"".[/i] The controls, which [i]can[/i] be rebound, [i]do[/i] have a learning curve that the player is supposed to grow into and be accustomed with. This should not be a problem if you have played fighting games with a competitive/more technical mindset. If not, don't worry. Every player of this game was bad at some point. Just play through the 3 tutorial levels without worrying about getting S/S rank in the beginning. Granted, they're all harder than the first normal levels you will get so don't worry how badly you do, but they're there to show you how the game works of course. Trying to be immediately perfect at something new is an unrealistic and unhealthy mentality. Break things down into smaller pieces at a time. Their varied environments are good to experiment & practice in. You don't have to be the top 10%, or even top 30%, of the leaderboards to really enjoy what Dustforce has to offer.

A while back, this game caught some flak with being compared to another fun, difficult game: Super Meat Boy. I have seen a couple speedruns for both games, including developer commentary during 1 of each run, I've seen ""Indie Game: The Movie"" with its developer coverage of SMB, and have had my hands on both SMB and DF. SMB is great for all its reasons, but it can't be compared to Dustforce since they're fundamentally different games. SMB draws much more on artistic theme. DF draws much more on technical gameplay. It's loud and clear that both games have different target audiences. If it isn't to you, then you gotta look and listen harder. These 2 are [b]not[/b] better or worse when placed next to each other. Just [b]different[/b]. Apples and oranges, ladies and gentlemen.

SMB is more precision platformer than DF is. DF is more momentum platformer than precision. Here are a few points to think about this situation.

SMB is a bit like:
- Super Mario Bros. (Movement, as in there are fewer ""tools"" that the player will have and the environment accounts for most of your choices.)
- Classic Mega Man (platforming)
- A touch of Super Smash Bros style crossovers

DF is a bit like:
- Super Smash Bros. series (Movement, as in there are more ""tools"" for the player to use. Environment alone accounts for less than that of SMB. More on that in a bit.)
- Zero's character style from Mega Man X series and classic 2D Sonic (platforming)
- A touch of Super Smash Bros combat. It's simply ""hold a direction or not"" before hitting an attack button, but the timings must be right or you'll whiff and button mash like a newbie. The momentum style and Super Smash Bros aspect is even confirmed by one the developers. More info on that in the final paragraph.

Dustforce has more weight on utilizing the system of the character at a deeper level akin to fighting games instead of just mainly interacting with the environments themselves. Players must be thinking about what they can do with their options and what the environment calls for at the same time. Much more of the game is in the player's hands instead of the environment forcing decisions in a 1-sided fashion. DF has more meat on character controls than your typical platformer: dashes, air-dashes, air-down-dashes, normal attack, normal attack + directional mid-air, heavy attack, heavy attack + directional mid-air, wall jump, wall running, ceiling running, slope sliding, momentum preservation after hitting enemies while mid-air, fillable gauge for super AoE attack, etc. All of these interact with the physics of the game to produce even more things. All of these are learned as you go and become natural. At least they should be. More attention on what your character is ACTUALLY doing (not what you THINK s/he should be doing) is a must in this game. Level selection also isn't just a grid with things to select. To play a level, you must clear the platforming section to the door in the hub world. This introduces the techniques required to complete such levels. Difficult levels will need the player to be skilled enough to reach them, let alone complete them.

This game has been featured in Games Done Quick speedrun charity events. The Summer Games Done Quick 2015 run (Any% route) also has one of the developers talking with the runner and commentators. I highly recommend seeing that on YouTube if you're still skeptical on buying this game. The dev comments are great and the pro play will undoubtedly be amazing. There are also ""All levels S/S ranking"" runs to watch. Remember, you don't have to be as good as them to enjoy the game.

Some dev comments from that run to note & more:
- They thank the community greatly in helping detect cheated runs to delete off the leaderboards.
- It's not so much a precision platformer as much as it is a momentum platformer. Get a feel for how far your momentum can carry you and keep going. If you can't make a jump, did you deliberately decelerate in mid-air or after landing on a platform? (You might wanna call up Sonic for some tips. And fire Mario or Mega Man if they happen to be your tutors who said that they'll teach you everything you need to know about platforming. You got scammed.)
- The game is inspired in part by N+, and Super Smash Bros. series.
- Coding for the movement and momentum consists of about 5,000 lines to be able to do what it can do. Some minor inconsistencies exist most likely due to rounding errors, but you wouldn't notice unless you were told about them or spent lots of time experimenting. None of these will bar you from completing the game at any skill level (obviously many have already done so) as all physics interactions discovered were tested.
- Difficult levels requiring skill to reach and enter in the hub world is a system to help players recognize their strengths and weaknesses versus a traditional level selection screen where players would just get walled and discouraged by surprise difficulty spikes.",1469827236,1483278773,True,16,1,0.652780473232269287,0,True,False,False,False,

Dustforce is one of those games, that are repetitive in the best possible way. Where many games are a sequence of similar levels, each played a single time, Dustforce is a set of unique challenges, which have to be tried again and again to be mastered.

Let's talk about the game's overall structure first. The player is thrown into a hub world, filled with several doors, which lead to the individual levels. While in theory the player can reach every door from the start, most of them are locked with bronze, silver or golden padlocks. Those levels already accessible, need to be played to unlock bronze doors, which again are required for silver keys and so forth. In order to open all locks of a kind, every level below that kind has to be finished with a top ranking (more on that later) — but lower rankings accumulate and can unlock at least some of the higher levels as well.
This is a great way to keep the player within the flow curve. Hard levels — and boy, they get hard — can't be accessed until the player has proven his/her salt. And by using a ranking system the game makes sure, that the player actually played well and didn't just luckily stumble over the finish line. On the other hand, players are still able to unlock a few new levels, as long as they at least perform okay.

There is a second design decision preventing players from taking challenges above their skill level. I mentioned earlier, that levels are accessed through a hub world. Within that hub world, the level doors aren't just lined up, like they are in Rayman Legends for example. Instead the hub world is a level itself, where the doors have to be reached.
Doors to simple levels can be reached by walking, with a few occasional jumps in between. Doors of more difficult levels require skill and a solid understanding of different movement mechanics. And to top it all: it's not like you need any arbitrary trick, but exactly those skills needed within the level you are trying to reach. By this, the game makes sure you know what to do in every level.

Let's talk about level structure next. Most levels are linear, with a clear route and a bad guy to beat up at the end. There is dust on the floor (or on the ceiling or wherever) that the avatar brushes away automatically when running over it. The interface has a combo counter, indicating how much dust has been collected. If no dust is swept for five seconds or the player gets hit or dies, the combo is interrupted and the counter reset.
After finishing a level, the player is evaluated for the amount of dust cleaned (completion) and the number of combo interruptions (finesse). To get a double S (and unlock a key) all dust has to be collected without a single interruption.
Evaluating both completion and finesse is a clever way to ensure good play. Abusing blinking time or brute forcing every single obstacle won't bring you the necessary finesse to advance. Using shortcuts to pass by hard sections won't work either, because dust in skipped sections is guaranteed to be missed. You can use these techniques to finish a level of course — and some levels can be done ridiculously fast using shortcuts, — but harder levels are reserved for good players.

All this dynamic balancing is necessary to keep players engaged while they still learn how the game is played. Dustforce has a lot of movement techniques, from sliding down slopes over fast-falling to running at the ceiling. Every movement requires precise input. In contrast to the heavily automated system of an Assassins Creed, your avatar in Dustforce will do nothing that you don't tell him/her explicitly.
Unfortunately not all of Dustforce's options are taught properly. The game starts with a set of three solid tutorials, explaining most important aspects — how to reset your double-jump for example. Abstruse, while nevertheless useful, techniques like spike-jumping on the other hand, are left unmentioned.
It took me a few hours (and a good youtube tutorial) to ""get"" the controls and gain a solid level of mastery. Those few hours weren't boring at all though and the top-class Jump'n Run I got in return was a satisfying trade.

There isn't so much, that I want to say about Dustforce's aesthetics, but I can't let them be unmentioned.
The game's sprites have few details and let their well-chosen color pallets speak instead. I also like how the four playable characters differ in design. Each of them cleans with another tool, from broom to vacuum cleaner, and color, animations and hats all differ too. I'm particularly fond of Dustworth's design, who looks like Luigi got old fast after exorcising his mansion.
There are few sound effects — and no voices at all — but that almost feels intentional to underline the game's great chiptune soundtrack. Almost all songs are strong enough to stand their own, but they accompany each levels theme pretty well too.

Mechanics, structure, balancing and aesthetics all interlock and support each other just right. When I started Dustforce, I was expecting a satisfying high complexity platformer, but the game is so fine tuned and works so well that I'm surprised that it isn't more popular. I highly recommend it for every Jump'n Run fan out there.

It's fun to play even though I'm not the type for skill based games like these, but my only issue is that getting to some of the levels is difficult and require that you use a difficult technique to reach them and it took me a while and I had to watch some videos.
     As for the actual levels themselves, you don't really die or anything just reset when you fall or touch spikes, but when an enemy hits you, it only knocks you back a little and breaks your combo. Your combo determines your 'finess' score. If you choose to play the game at a slower pace and don't care about score, then it's pretty boring, seeing as no actual 'deaths' means no risk to messing up a jump or getting hit by an enemy. There is multiplayer but it's only local, but there is also a level editor which gives the game a lot of replay value.

Dustforce DX is a fast paced platformer where all you need to do is sweep sweep and sweep

The gameplay is simple and fluent but hard to master. The game is not easy to play especially in the later levels and can cause quite a frustrationn to some players. The music and visuals are really nice and pretty and fit in well with the aesthetic the game is going for

It is highly recommended that Dustforce DX is played with a controller rather than a keyboard because the game is fast paced and it is more tailored for a controller

Dustforce DX is a great indie game to play, it's face paced, challenging but not too difficult to play. Dustforce DX is an interesting title to pick up and play

I'm not normally the type of person who enjoys platformers, especially fast-paced ones like these, but something about Dustforce resonates very strongly with me.  I entered the game wary, as the complicated gameplay and challenging levels that I had seen were intimidating, but in under two days I've put over ten hours into it and I haven't had this much fun in a video game in a long time.

I suppose this is a difficult game to review objectively, but if you're an obsessive perfectionist like myself then this game will likely have you playing for hours at a time without slowing down.

If I had to sum up dustforce in one word it would be “Understated.” Everything from the stylized visual aesthetic, to the almost silhouette character sprites, the animations, enemies and even the level design all hold themselves with such dignity. The small flashes of flare that you get, when performing your special ability and the slow motion finishing move at the end of each level all give you a sense of “Yeah, I just did that, whatever.” As you calmly walk off from your amazing display of platforming prowess without even looking back.

Mechanics wise, dustforce is a great example of giving the player a single minded goal, and the tools to get there. I forgot where I read it and i hope they don't mind the unattributed quote but it sums up so perfectly the mentality I draw from the game. “Dustforce is not content to let you be content with yourself.” Again apologies for probably butchering the original quote but it is so true.

Dustforce has a tiered level structure where you unlock keys to higher tiered levels by completing previous ones to a certain proficiency. While simply completing the level from start to finish may be enough at the start to work towards a few keys and level, you will eventually need to break past your preconceived limits. This system of partial completion still progressing the player is great for giving the player control over their own difficulty curve and doesn’t fall into the pit of so many other challenging platformers where you get stuck on a single level and cannot progress.

Another thing it does great is support the players journey of self improvement without being overbearing. After completing any particular level you are given access to the high scores from the community. But where other games may stop there dustforce then records the exact run of that player so that you can view it whenever you want in its entirety. I cannot tell you the amount of times I was stuck on certain levels but then was able to completely change my approach after seeing a “pro” do it in front of my eyes.

But no game is perfect and Dustforce is no exception. The physics and movement in the game is very momentum based. If you are unable to continue your exact series of boosts and ramp launches you will find your experience rather jerky. When it works it makes speed runs a visually awe inspiring art, but when it doesn't you find yourself spamming jumps off walls at odd angle into spike pits or off cliffs.

I would recommend this game to anyone that loves tried and tested platforming mechanics with a stylish coat of paint and some really nice quality of life features. And to anyone that loves the feeling of becoming one with your controller, eye's glazed, as you become one with the game and skirt even the most precarious platform dungeons with grace and ease.

 Let me first explain my negative review. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this game to myself. Rather, I would recommend Dustforce to masochists, personal enemies, and professional platform gamers.

 I really wanted to like Dustforce. The promo videos made it seem like one casually 'ninjas' and floats about beautiful 16 bit levels collecting cobwebs like Sonic collects rings. Not quite. 

The concept itself is interesting. The goal is to travel through obstical courses as fast as possible. Along the way, you must run through patches of dust and hit ""enemies"" in order to clear the level. This is a 2D speed-running game. 

 The physics and mechanics make absolutely no sense to the uninitiated casual game playing plebian like myself. It can be frustrating, repetative and time consuming simply jumping from platform to platform in the overworld. This is where you wander around finding doors to unlock, which represent individual levels. 

Compare with titles like Super Meat Boy and Cave Story. These games present challenging and interesting game play, while having control schemes and movement that are predictable and intuitive. Dustforce DX creates simple levels, that are made challenging by a character that is difficult to control. Essentially, they took a relatively simple concept and made it difficult to enjoy on account of sloppy, tendinitis aggravating controls that are frustrating to learn and maddening to master.

 Further, the actual levels are fairly uninteresting and easy to get through. The challenge is that in order to properly complete a level, simply getting through it is not enough. You need to get the fastest time possible without missing any dust. This means repeating levels until you have every move perfected. This ends up being more busy work than anything else. You could easily spend a thousand hours trying to perfect each level. Combined with controls that assault your hands, it can be a very unforgiving process of which I quickly grew tired. 

I suppose in the Genre of repetitive games which slap you around and demand perfection it succeeds. However, I guess I'm not a fan of games where developers decided the best way to make a game challenging is to make the character barely controllable. I feel like back in the days of original 8 bit graphic platformers, this would simply be called bad controls and it would be relegated to 2 and 3 star reviews. These days there are gamers who specifically enjoy and excel at games with lousy controls, and I suspect if you're one of those people you will find a lot of fun in spending countless hours punishing yourself on Dustforce.  

Recall the viral flash game where the object is to control a sprinters limbs to push him over the finish line, or rather see how far you can comically stumble and hobble across a track. This is the same concept taken to it's inevitable extreme... 

OK, it's not THAT bad, but you'll be spending a half hour trying to jump onto a ledge just to get to another stage... only to discover that you don't have the key to unlock it. Oh right, keys. 

In order to unlock all the levels, you will need to complete the stages with perfect scores to accumulate keys. Ugh. 

Summary; 
If you are considering using the standard keyboard layout, either get an ice pack for your hands or forget about it. The game is barely playable on a game-pad, which is far superior to the keyboard controls. 

If you're a demi-god with spaghetti fingers and the ability to pick up outrageous controls, and have a lot of time and patience, I guess you will LOVE this game. 

If you're a casual gamer who likes simple controls, and doesn't want to invest the hours it will take to teach your hands to waltz like noodles through endlessly repetitive levels of dust ninja then get Super Meat Boy instead.",1457292002,1458080351,False,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,

At this point I've played Dust Force DX for 6 hours, ands have completed all of the default levels, bronze levels, and all of the silver and gold levels of the first area with double S rank.

Story:
You're not buying this game for the story. There is a minor one conveyed through a single opening cinematic.

Music and Art:
Both are done in a very simplistic style. The art isn't something that will blow you away. It adds to the atmosphere of the game, and doesn't make it difficult to tell where the environment ends and where you are. The music is very peaceful. It will keep you playing, keep you interested in the game, and keep you from hating yourself. There is really something very peaceful and soothing about the soundtrack and did a lot to help the game. Great music.

Controls:
The controls take a little bit to get used to, but once you understand them they are very easy to use. They usually make you feel like it's you're fault for failing, which is what you want. I say usally because there have been a few times when it was their flaw and not mine. I would press one direction and the game wouldn't pick up on it, and it would cost me the level. Other than a few isolated incidents they've worked exactly as I've expected them to.

Mechanics:
Every mechanic that you use in the game is given to you the second the game is booted up. It's is your responsibility to master them and force them to do what you want. This is a plus in my book. I love games with few movement options that I can learn and perfect.

Difficulty:
It's a hard game. It is more difficult than any other ultra hard platformer I have ever played. It sometimes becomes infuriatingly tedious and makes me want to stop playing, but there is a significant sense of gratification when you complete a challenge that tells you to keep going. However, I don't think that this is a game anyone can play and achieve a double S rank on every level. I know that there are level that I will never be able to beat simply because my hands aren't fast or precise enough. I'm not sure any amount of practicing will ever allow me to get that good.

Final thoughts:
It's a really good game. It's very difficult and infuriating, but I still enjoy it. Even though I don't think I will be able to beat the final gauntlet of levels I'm still motivated to try. I cannot reccomend it enough to anyone who is a fan of the genre.

Review:

Another day, another review from the wheel of insanity.  This time the randomizer brought up Dustforce DX, a platformer from Hitbox Team which apparently is about four people dealing with janitorial work as an art form.  Now, I am always down for unique and interesting takes on new games and all, but for some reason the idea of having your characters doing what they do because they want to keep the floors obsessive clear of leaves just seems a bit off even to me.  It doesn’t really get too much in the way of gameplay though, and that, surprisingly, is quite interesting, the controls are quite simple once you get into the swing of finding exactly when to dash jump and double jump.  The engine uses a surprisingly robust set of physics rules to control the player's movement, and i could easily see someone trying to spend a lot of time trying to really dig into the specifics of the movement of the characters.  In truth, I think this is the sort of platformer that would appeal to perfectionist platformers, both for the almost OCD nature of its story, to the demanding requirements of the level ranking systems.  For folks who love that sort of thing, this is a definite buy.  For everyone else, it’s still pretty good, and probably worth keeping on a wishlist for the next sale.

Game’s Fate: Uninstalled.  Its pretty, but just isn’t interesting enough for me to enjoy, but I can see where plenty of people would enjoy it.
Buy/No Buy: There's nothing wrong with this game, but it’s just not interesting enough to me to be worth the full price.  Keep in your wishlist and buy it when it’s on sale.",1455774119,1455774119,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

After all, I've played this game for 1,000+ hours and idle'd in its level editor for a few hundred more.

Dustforce DX is the deepest and most technically demanding 2D platformer ever made.  It has a momentum based engine where all actions have real weight and consequence, attacks have start-up frames, things are jump and dash-cancellable, and there are tricks measured in how many frames they save.  Every level has leaderboards both for score and for raw time, and the community is fiercly competitive and still very active.  More importantly, every run on the leaderboards also has a replay embedded.  Being able to watch your run (or anyone else's) is not just fun, it's a fantastic learning tool.  If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, then keep reading.

Dustforce DX will never hold the player's hand.  Several people ragequit the third TUTORIAL, and a wide number of the advanced mechanics and workings of the game are never explained in-game.  To really master this game and understand everything in it, you need to know other people who play it and/or engage on the subreddit and IRC channel.  Even if you do that and arm yourself with knowledge: this game is HARD.  When you think you've finally gotten good and beaten the game, you have only just begun because you unlocked ""The Difficults"".  Honestly even getting that far is going to take you a hundred hours at least, because the only way to unlock new levels is to complete easier levels perfectly.  I'll explain...

Dustforce DX has 4 main hub areas of one large world (The Nexus).  Each hub has 4 baby levels, 4 easy levels, 4 medium levels, and 4 exceedingly hard levels.  Each tier of level above the first is locked by a key, and you earn progress toward keys by playing the levels in the tier below.  But the only way to get a full key from 1 single level is to get an SS rank.  One S is completion: for cleaning all the dust and defeating all the enemies.  The other S is Finesse: for never losing your combo from dying, getting hit, or letting it time out.  The game doesn't just reward perfection, it demands it if you even want to see all the stock levels.

Now why did I say stock levels you may ask?  That's because the true magic of this game is its INTENSELY POWERFUL level editor.  Custom Dustforce Maps (it calls them maps instead of levels) are what keep me playing.  This is one of several games where the editor gives you every tool the dev had, letting you make stuff on par with, and often exceeding, the quality of the stock game.  You have 20 layers to work with, tons of cool props, almost complete RGB color control and control over the %blend of the color PER LAYER, a shit ton of props and emitters to place, several things with transparency for awesome effects, and total control over the music and sound effects at every point.  The last sentence is very important since this game has a truly amazing soundtrack.  Free control over the music in the editor doubles as a sound test, even if you don't enjoy making maps.  The nice thing about the leaderboards and replays is that you can watch everyone playing your map once you publish it.  That adds another level of enjoyment to the process, a feature missing from several other games with level editors.

There are almost no restrictions on what you can place anywhere, allowing the free mixing of themes from the 4 hubs if you have the skill to make it work.  The game is easily moddable and the community has several killer spritemods available, one even turns a character into Kirby!  There are several different classes of mods both for art and for performance, and they are all easy enough to find on the subreddit.  Sadly they aren't integrated into Steam like with many other games.  The community also has several third party tools available for more detailed stat-tracking, new kinds of competition, and even a cool TAS community.

In conclusion, Dustforce DX is a great game and one of my all time favorites.  It's not easy to get into: indeed you will struggle if you go it alone and it's still very difficult even with friends beside you.  You'll get what you put into it.

With an included level editor, and leaderboards available for all levels ever uploaded- it becomes a very competetive experience, especially since you can watch every (!) player's replay in-game. 
You can try to redo their runs and improve upon them- to climb the leaderboards, and feel like the king of the big internet arcade.

The game itself is very challenging, but selfexplanatory and easy to learn. The progress you make as a player is always clearly visible and definitely satisfying. If you want online challenges- there's plenty available; if you want to play just for yourself- there are medals at the end of each level, to reward you with a bit of singleplayer experience.

It's big, fun, and sometimes frustrating to play; but even if you can't get very far- there is always the great artstyle to gaze upon, and chill soundtrack to soothe your nerves (not to mention level editor, where you can make your own kind of experience).

I love this game and I definitely recommend it; but it's hard for me to tell whether I like the game better, or just it's beautiful soundtrack (STRONGLY ADVISED TO PLAY THE TRAILER).",1452569966,1452569966,True,1,0,0.492410272359848022,0,False,False,False,False,

Das Spiel an sich ist ein Spaßiges Jump and Run mit ein paar extra kniffen hier und da.
Im Grunde allerdings nicht für mich, 
ich komme mit den Grundsätzlichen Mechaniken wie dem Springen nicht wirklich klar.
Es fühlt sich alles etwas schwammig an, noch dazu hat dieses Spiel zwar Controller Support,
jedoch muss man im Menü selbst die Knöpfe den Aktionen zuweisen!
Das hätte ich mit einem Controller Tool auch extern gekonnt,
zusätzlich kann man in diesem Menü nicht mal Start und Select mit z.b dem Menü und dem schnellen Neustart belegen.
Mehr kann ich an diesem Punkt noch nicht wirklich sagen und ich werde das Spiel wohl auch nicht weiter Spielen.

Im punkto Soundtrack möchte ich allerdings noch etwas sagen, denn der hat mich an diesem Spiel gereizt!
Im Spiele Ordner selbst gibt es unter content/audio/music alle Lieder in voller Länge zu hören, anbei eine Readme Datei.
In dieser Readme steht Zitat: 
""All the songs in the game are here"" ""The songs in the album are remastered and uncompressed, and have proper endings (the ones in this folder just end abruptly)."" ""There are also a few bonus tracks!  Also included are a nice insert tracklist image and liner notes.""

Nun habe ich ja das Soundtrack Bundle gekauft und muss sagen... 
Ja da gibt es ein Bild mit der Tracklist und Notizen zu den einzelnen Liedern in einer Readme. 
Ansonsten ist das alles Müll was er in dieser Readme geschrieben hat!
Erst mal widersprich er sich selbst in dem er sagt, dass alle Lieder des Spiels hier zu finden sind und beim richtigen Soundtrack angeblich Extras dabei währen.
In dem 'music' Ordner sind nämlich wirklich alle dabei und beim Soundtrack gibt es keinerlei Extra!
Noch dazu sind die Dateien im Album soweit ich das hören kann nur mit einem Hall Effekt o.ä belegt worden und haben am Ende einen 'fade out' Effekt bekommen wo es bei den Liedern im 'music' Ordner einfach endet.
Wirklich remastered sind sie also nicht, ein richtiges Ende würde ich das auch nicht nennen und uncompressed?
Auf dem Album sind die Lieder deutlich kleiner vom Format und in .mp3, im music Ordner sind sie im .ogg Format und entsprechend deutlich besser.

Jetzt kann ich das Ganze leider nun wirklich nicht verstehen, die Lieder sind gut, ich mag sie wirklich gerne!
Nur wirkt es hier als hätte sich jemand so überhaupt keine Mühe gegeben und will dafür wohl auch noch Geld,
da er ja für das Album wirbt!
Die Lieder scheinen gar kein Ende zu haben, 
da sie immer mit demselben 'fade out' Enden und im 'music' Ordner einfach so abgehackt werden.
Die Readme scheint einen Schlichtweg verarschen und zum Kauf überreden zu wollen.

Fazit:
Das Spiel ist nicht meins, trotzdem würde ich es weiter empfehlen weil ich denke,
dass es echt Spaß machen kann, sobald man sich etwas rein gefuchst hat.
Die Sache mit dem Soundtrack ist einfach nur dreist und unverständlich, 
ich würde den Kauf vom Soundtrack nicht empfehlen, da könnt Ihr euch die Lieder auch aus dem 'music' Ordner holen.
Ansonsten ein interessantes Jump and Run für jeden der es mag!",1452280860,1452280860,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Personally I have always been drawn to games like this, ever since I first played Sonic the Hedgehog when I was just 4 years old.
As far as 2D platformers where the goal is to reach the finish line as fast as you can goes, this one stands out at the top of the list. It's no surprise, since the game clearly caters to the speedrunning community.
By that, I mean that it is possible to beat levels in less than a minute, without stoping or dealing with enemies, and the feeling is fantastic.
On the other hand, the game provides some moves that only expert players will learn because the game does not teach them to the players anywere in the game, but pulling it off in the long run makes you feel like a beast.

And that is my problem recommending it. It's definitely not a game for everyone. 
Only the most persistent and skilled will reach the end of the game, and only a few dozens of players will beat the game 100%.

But for me that is the beauty of it. The game has no story, it expects you only to get good at the game, and the most positive thing, is that it feels outstanding getting good at the game.

Also, play it for the music alone. It's god tier",1449804624,1449804813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

The Good

I love platformers and Dustforce made me remember why I love platformers. Everything about this game is well done and polished until it shines.

First thing first, you’ll be hard pressed to find another game with as good a soundtrack as the one that accompanies Dustforce. It is pure, relaxing majesty and nothing could possibly fit this game better in terms of music. It makes you feel good while you play.



The art is phenomenal. Character designs are simple and beautiful, enemies are original, and the environments themselves will provide you with a good eyeful as well.

The controls are smooth and fluid. You can easily transition from floors to ceilings in a matter of seconds, all the while cleaning the living hell out of dust ridden creatures and persons. Dustforce is, essentially, 2D parkour and I love it.

There are a huge amount of levels for you to play through with four different characters, all of whom have their own play style. Not only does the core game have over 100 levels, but there are a heaping amount of user created levels that you can play through as well. The fun doesn’t have to end with this one, ever.

The Bad

Nothing. Nothing at all my friends.

The Meh

See the above category, please.

Verdict: Yea

Dustforce is a lighthearted, refreshing platformer that serious and casual gamers alike can enjoy at their leisure. If you’re looking for something new to play, look no further. As always, thanks for reading.",1447552053,1447552053,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

I have played a few more hours than shows here.  Not that many more though... 

I really love the idea of this game. I wish I would like it. In the end it comes down mostly to control responsiveness.

Even the simplest jumps feel hard to accomplish, movement feels jerky and if you miss a wallrun edge by a pixel the outcome is completely different and unexpected. I guess you can get used to it and ""get good"", but in this day and age there are so many games that do this right and feel natural, responsive and tight from the get-go while still having a crazy high skill ceiling. Supermeatboy: I'm looking at you and blowing a kiss.

Because of this little mistakes completely ruin your runs. Maybe it's by design, but I don't like it. I feel little mistakes should screw you a little and big mistakes screw you a lot. 

Controller support exists (I play using an xbox360 controller), but it still feels funny. Some commands register on soft presses while others require full presses...

Ah and the game's pacing: While it demands big apm spikes there's more focus on precision and routing than hectic speed. So it feels weird: sluggish, complex and puzzling, kinda like that weirdly chosen soothing new age soundtrack.

Speaking of difficulty, the controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used at first, but soon you'll get better at basic movement which will allow you to clear the easy levels, while getting better to beat the normal levels, and with enough practice you'll be able to beat the hard levels. And this progression works well, because when you unlock the hard levels it means that you are ready for them. And once you beat the hard levels, you'll unlock the hardest levels, which are easily harder than Super Meat Boy (even some hard levels are). You'll also fail a lot, but there's some things that will keep you invested: the art and music are great, and a checkpoint system that will allow you to practice sections of a level instead of starting from the beginning every time. There's also 4 characters, and they feel different from each other. Also, the developers keep the leaderboards clean from cheaters, which is something rare.

[*]Shitty controls for controllers: Have to press two buttons on the digital pad to run on the wall/ceiling which even have the same combination of buttons to use them and I can't imagine that it's better with the analogue stick. Which sucks when you get to a spot where both moves are possible. (You usually get the move you didn't want to use) The other buttons are fine.
[*]Sometimes when you kill an enemy you can't jump again, even though it's a feature of the game and even get's explained in the tutorial. (Might be something wrong on my end, but I dunno. I can just tell what happened to me)
[*]Sometimes my character breaks in midair without my input to do so. (Might have a common cause with my jump problem in the last con)

I hate it, but I love it. 

You’re part of the Dustforce, charged with ridding the world from… dust! Go figure, right? I had my reservations about it at first, but as it turns out, it’s a really fun platformer game. The gameplay is simple (and the keyboard controls are simple, too), yet at the same time, complicated. You clean this dust by simply touching it or smacking dusty creatures. You have jumps, double jumps, dashes, normal hit, hard hit, and a few wall and ceiling grabbing skills depending on key combinations used. This requires plenty of skills, because while you’re essentially only using like 3-4 buttons at most, you have to do so in a specific order with a specific timing in order to reach certain ledges/floors/areas. And this, my friends, is where it gets difficult. 

The levels are progressively difficult, requiring you to hone your button-pressing order/timing skills in order to complete them. While you don’t have to mop away every single trace of dust, you -are- graded at the end according to your performance, and you will need the keys awarded from this to unlock certain levels. The better you do, the easier to unlock those levels. There’s only one achievement for the game (which made me lol a little). 

The graphics are very nice and simple, they make the game stand out and seem pretty unique, and I really loved it. The character moves around the screen with pretty amazing fluidity, and I just love to see them dash and jump and double jump, and do all kinds of parkour-y things. 

Dustforce also has a level editor for you to play around in and fiddle to your heart’s content, and you’re able to share your levels with other users.

It's not as weird as it sounds!

So as weird as this game sounds, it's actually a beautiful and fun game. It seems simple on the surface, but you'll sink hours into it slowly improving at levels. You play as a graceful janitor who can jump from platform to platform with ease. You have to strategically use air jumps, light/strong attacks, wall runs, and dashes to clean up a level (or just make it to the end) as fast as possible. You have to carefully pick which character to use on a level, as each of the 4 characters is distinctly different and has different strengths and weaknesses. Overall this makes for a seemingly simple yet actually complex game you can sink hours into getting better at.

The decisions the developer made here seem actively antagonistic to new players. I would have to link the game along with 3-4 different guides just to make sure whoever I recommended it to had a decent chance of enjoying it. If you have all the information it really is quite good. It's just that the game never bothers to give you the information you need in order to enjoy it.

Here are the things wrong with this game.

1) The tutorial is too hard. Instead of spreading the 3 tutorial levels out over time the game requires you to be able to execute even the advanced mechanics right from the beginning. I imagine some casual players may not even be able to complete these 3 tutorial levels. These levels also lack any kind of flow, and so they're also just bad levels in general.

2) The tutorial is too short. The tutorial doesn't explain some very key movement mechanics that are profoundly unintuitive to the point that they are literally the opposite of reality. There's a hidden ""charge"" system the game never explains that allows you to either dash or jump in mid-air. Not all of the cases where the recharges happen are explained and so the player is left without enough information to even begin to tackle anything past the first 15 courses. The player is forced to look up a guide online or spend a lot of time randomly button mashing in order to progress.

3) The ""overworld"" is dumb and confusing. Instead of the devs bothering to figure out which order the levels should be in the game has you exploring these 4 zones between the worlds in order to find new levels. Sometimes this requires executing extraordinarily difficult platforming tricks as well as a key obtained from doing really well on previous levels. The layout of this zone is very confusing, and it is very very very very very frustrating having to deal with a dumb mini-game just to get to the next course. The courses are hard enough on their own. I already did well enough on the courses in order to get the key. Just let me pick them from a menu, and don't lock content behind meaningless redundant skill gates you didn't think through properly before you implemented. It's very easy to get stuck.

4) Keys aren't explained. The game doesn't explain adequately how to obtain keys. This leads to being stuck until you look up a guide online that explains how to get more keys. 

5) Key colors are difficult to differentiate. I'm a little bit color-blind. The game has like 5 key colors. I can only differentiate between silver and ""the rest of them."" They bothered to make the key icons look different, but not the locks. So good luck being able to figure out where to take a key you just obtained because a) the lock colors are all very similar and b) you might not even be able to get there due to point #3.

6) Character differences are not explained.  2 of them are quite similar while the other 2 are quite different from all others. It would have been nice to have been told by the game why I should ever choose a different character than the default.

In conclusion, I do like this game, but don't be afraid to look up guides on how the mechanics of the game work. It's really not fun if you don't do that.

I also want to reiterate again that the entire concept of The Nexus feels very much like the dev fell in love with their own ""clever"" idea, and never bothered to think through the ramifications of what they were doing. I'm sure it took a lot of time to build and design, but it only ever serves to frustrate and impede player progress to new courses. Just save yourself the trouble and look up a YouTube video that shows how to navigate to all the courses along with a map of door lock colors. You will have a much better time of it.",1438410143,1439430312,True,19,0,0.602953612804412842,0,True,False,False,False,

I really enjoyed watching speedruns of Dustforce. I had high hopes that I'd be able to do the same stunts that several of the top players displayed in various playthroughs. Unfortunately, this game has ultimately taught me the difference between watching videos of Dustforce and physically playing Dustforce.

+Pros: Beautiful music (very relaxing!) and art. Fun to watch. Competitive for the speedrunning community. High replay value*
-Cons: Stiff controls, hard to master even after brushing and practicing the tutorial several times, confusing hub world, definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.

Summary:
While the gameplay looks impressive, the controls are extremely stiff and difficult to master (actions like jumping are delayed once the button is pressed, not immediate). After the tutorial, you'll have to perform the actions you just learned to enter a door that leads to a hub world; this took me a bunch of tries (I just wanted to play the game already!). There's no sense of direction in this hub world; I found myself entering harder levels earlier just because I was wandering around aimlessly. Without a sense of direction (especially on a first playthrough), casual players will find the difficulty going all over the place rather than easier--->harder levels. With an insanely steep learning curve and a non-linear flow of gameplay, I don't feel enticed to explore this game further after 5+ hours of trying to work with the game's mechanics.

*Because Dustforce drives players to complete levels as fast as possible, much of the core gameplay revolves around beating your personal best time.

Considering there seems to be a trend for games that confuse challenge with stress and difficulty with laboriousness, this game is kind of a miracle.
For starters, it has a learning curve. Yes: an ACTUAL LEARNING CURVE. You have some brief tutorials to help you get the hang of the controls, with are fairly complex and prety tricky to get right, and soon you're in a ""nexus"" which you can traverse and unlock levels. These levels come in different difficulties, and you hve to beat a certain number of easier levels to get keys and unlock the harder ones.
As usual, the controls define about half of the playability and the fun of the game, and they work quite well here. It strikes a balance between fast, fluid, complex and challenging. Yes, it can get annoying and a little innaccurate at times, but those flaws seem to be more due to the natural limitations of keyboard controls rather than the game designers letting them suck deliberately because ""that makes it HARD!!!"". The only thing that does annoy me is how the gravity works: within a millisecond, you'll switch from ""gently floating down"" to ""plummetting like a stone"". I don't think this adds anything to the game.
The levels are good, and range from flowing and pleasant to devilishly hard. So far, I've played more than half of the levels, and only one was seriously beyond my skills. The others, at their most difficult, are reasonably doable. Also, you're not expected to simply reach the end of the level: the more dust you clean up, the higher your ""Completion"" rank goes up, and the higher the combo you get at the end, the higher your ""Finesse"" rank (it took me ages to understand what that meant). The higher your ranks, the sooner you get keys to unlock the harder levels. Also, if you're really perverted, you can try to improve your time and improve your rank in the scoreboard. If you like speedrunning, you'll have a field day.
Finally, I really enjoy the art style. The visuals are pretty, cartoony and slightly dreamy. The music is nice, and whomever wrote it did a pretty good job at imitating Tycho. Also, you get to choose from four different characters: the guy in blue, and... er... four others. (another gripe I have is that you have to choose your character EVERY TIME you start a level.

This is technically quite clean for an indie game, too. No annoying bugs I could notice, quality updates (with minor rebalancing), a level editor which I have not tried but seems to work great judging from the quantity of good maps around, a nice level portal for browsing and downloading these maps, a good replay and ranking system. I so wish Super Meat Boy got these implemented ! They make for an experience a fair notch better overall.

Keep an eye on Hitbox Team's upcoming game, Spire. If they get 3D platforming right as much as they did for 2D platforming, this sure is going to be good :)

---

I obtained Dustforce as part of a Humble Bundle, and it turned out to be one of the weakest entries of the set. Having enjoyed Super Meat Boy, I thought taking on another challenging speed/flow platformer would be good fun, but Dustforce didn't measure up.

In premise, Dustforce seemed like a lot of fun. Ninja janitors! Fighting-game style uppercuts and kicks, used to navigate hazards and literally clean house! Some lovely sprite work and a fantastic soundtrack enticed me to give it a go.

Unfortunately, Dustforce turns out to be one of those games where only the hardest of the hard core need apply, and no lesser player has any hope of wringing some entertainment from this sharp, unforgiving stone of a title. Unless you master the moves immediately (perhaps by some years' experience playing Street Fighter on the competitive scene?), you will fail constantly, progressing to the end of even the earliest levels only by determination and brute repetition. That in and of itself is not irredeemable--that's part and parcel of SMB's shtick, after all. However, the insult to injury is that speedrunning is mandatory. You cannot barely squeak out a level completion and advance in the game; you *must* achieve a ranking score in speed and thoroughness in order to earn keys to open additional levels. If you don't, well, enjoy replaying the first world a lot, because that's all you'll get to see.

There is something to be said for defying the predominant game design pattern of ""if you just play long enough, no matter your skill, you will win."" And no doubt a truly elite button-pusher would revel in it here. But if you don't consider yourself such a chest-thumping master, you would do well to give this game a pass.",1435270808,1436199383,False,3,1,0.486580342054367065,0,False,False,False,False,

At a glance, it's a great concept, you speedrun levels while dealing with all the cleaning hotspots and keeping a combo going from start to finish if you want to S-rank it. In practice, unfortunately, I find myself wrestling with the controls twice as much as the level design. Entirely too often I'm kicking off of a wall when I was attempting to do a double-jump, clinging to the ceiling when I was trying to do a dash-jump, or dealing with the bizarre inertia that makes it impossible to just nudge yourself a half-inch in any direction when trying to set up for some precision platforming or just attempt that double-jump from a little farther away from the wall so I don't do a goddamn wall jump by mistake again.

The control is unreal for me even better than Super Meat Boy's which is insane, because I thought Super Meat Boy's control was absolutely perfect this just pushes the limits of polished controls. This is what difficult platformers should be where you learn by playing one level later get to a more advanced one, and can already feel and percieve what you need to do to accomplish the tasks at hand. It has four different characters each with their own unique playstyle and feel. It's just such a rewarding experience to learn how to pick up every piece of garbage, defeat every foe, and keep your combo up in each level and perfect them bringing you one step closer to completing the game.

[i]This is my personal view on the game, and though you may disagree with some of the statements I make I stand with them nonetheless.[/i]

[i]Game was purchased in the Humble Indie Game bundle.[/i]

Dustforce DX is platformer game like many other platformer games, with the primary objective of the game being to gain the fastest possible time accompanied by style and completion of a level as possible. It has a large player base, many levels to choose from, a level editor and plenty of UGC. Here's a list of pros and cons I've compiled which I felt summarise the game:

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Tidy graphics that are pleasing to the eye.
[*]OST's that can be enjoyable to listen to.
[*]A plethera of levels to choose from with varying levels of difficulty for the player.
[*]Solid gameplay mechanics that aid the game in differing from other generic platformers.
[*]Full gamepad support (Which I also highly recommend if you choose to buy this game).
[/list]

With those positives, you may wonder what made me not recommend this game. Well, here's the list of cons that detracted from the game, mostly personal preference:

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]Somewhat repetitive gameplay, as of many generic platformers. Gets exceedingly boring over extended periods of playtime, I had to resort to 15 minutes each session.
[*]Can feel extremely unrewarding at times, given the 'speedrun' feel to the game. Completing a section of a level you have been stuck on for a while does not mean success, but rather spending time trying to complete levels decreases your final score, which leads onto the next point.
[*]Can grind to a halt at certain parts of gameplay. By this, I mean some of the early levels can be gruelling and seem out of place, as early users as myself may find certain parts of a level too difficult to proceed on, meaning the rest of the level goes to waste as one part of the level cannot be completed. Ties in as hard parts of levels that take multiple tries to complete can be pointless in the end to complete.
[*]Speed problems. Not running speed, such as lag, but rather play speed. The game at times can feel sluggish, and over long stretches of rock can feel slow. The game can also lose momentum when you make a minor slip and parts of the level such as loops are impossible to make, ergo reducing your final score and sometimes making you backtrack.
[*]No threats. This one being more personal preference than the others, but every enemy I've encountered in the game so far (Around 20-25 levels in) has posed no threat, and at the most has only knocked me over for me to only recover again within a matter of a second. This makes levels seem somewhat bland, as the only enemy is the level itself.
[*]Again, somewhat more personal, the dash-jump mechanic is frustrating to carry out. The mechanic intends that you dash then jump on solid ground to jump a long distance without the need for a run-up, although for many times I have found in levels it is intended to be used I cannot carry out the dash-jump. This, for me, was mostly experienced on the Advanced Training level, where the game does not tell you HOW to dash-jump and the level is also seemingly harder than the previous two tutorials by far.
[/list]

For the points listed above, I cannot recommend this game. This game by no means is a bad game, as can provide some entertaining gameplay at points and is well made, but due to the way it plays, I would not recommend this game to a friend.

Overall rating: 6/10

The music is also fantastic and suits the art style and areas very well. Great variety in difficulty too.

My only criticism is that there's a there's a disappointing number of levels. Now, 75 levels may sound like a lot. However, most only take a minute or two to complete and if you're going for a perfect run, sometimes as little as 20 seconds is all it takes to get to the finish line (or giant leafy bear in the case of this game.) 

Most of you're game time comes either from the community made levels or perfecting the defult ones to get the last few keys. An interesting point is how unless you've got perfect on all previous levels, you'll never unlock the final door. I don't really mind (I like a challenge) but some may find this quite frustrating.

It's a simple idea, and executed quite well. The movement system is precise and interesting, and all of the levels are designed the system in mind. This creates a really strong gameplay experience which can be missed in a lot of games. The soft visuals and calming tunes create a very warm and pleasant mood.

But after about four hours of play time and not one minute of fun I gave up on this game. Here are the reasons for this.

Instead of moving smoothly you kind of ""trigger"" fixed movement schemes (e.g. pressing right ones makes about two or three steps to the right). Because of this your input does not always have an effect on the movement. This means that precise timing and reactions are less important than pure mezmorizing and in the worst cases playing felt more like a long boring quick time event. Personally I can't stand QTE's.
In order to progress you have to collect every single piece (!) of dust in a level. To me this feels like a goal that should clearly be optional. Suppose some Mario game that says: ""Oh, you didn't collect every coin in the level. Go back to the beginning."" Another problem is that this completely breaks the flow of the gameplay. So instead of going for a quick smooth run you turn around and do backtracking to collect the last pieces of dust. In most levels this acutally seems to be what the level-designers intended.
In order to progress to must also make sure that your combo-chain does not break, whichs happen if you didn't collect dust for some time. I think this is supposed to force the player to make a ""smooth"" run, but it doesn't. The problem is that usually there is dust in so many places that messing it up first try and clumsily turning around is a valid option. I really don't understand what the developers were going for with this. Why is going through a level fast not rewarded in a game that (I think) is basically designed to be a speedrunner-heaven. Also it should be way better indicated when the combo-chain breaks.
Another minor complaint is that the tutorial just does not give you enough information to play the game. You have to figure out  the details of the gameplay-mechanics yourself, it is never explained what the finesse-ranking is based on and neither does the game explain that you actually need double-S ranking in order to unlock all levels (which is by the way stupid as (insert insulting word here) anyway).",1433429001,1433429001,False,6,0,0.470600128173828125,0,False,False,False,False,

Right off the bat, the most admirable features of Dustforce are its depth and the multifaceted ways there are to complete each stage with a perfect rank. It's a speedrunner's dream. The basic moves are simple: run, jump, dash, attack. But [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS8bmh_U1RU] check out what the most talented players can do with them.	[/url] There is a path laid out for you, and it's up to you to decide [i]how[/i] to traverse it. Mechanics like dashing at the end of a slope or boosting downward to increase momentum illustrate how the gameplay is meant to be experimented with, and it feels awesome. 

My personal favorite part of this game, though, is the atmosphere. It's self-aware, but not ""I-am-self-aware""-self-aware; there isn't an attempt at a story, there isn't any humor, there isn't even any characterization beyond some subtle win animations (without the internet, the only way we'd even know the names of the characters would be looking through the game's files). It's just the ever-so-video-game-ish premise of acrobatic janitors sweeping up and down the walls, and it's done so smoothly. The controls are easy to get used to, the animations are smooth, the environments are beautiful, and the music is soothing, composed by the awesome [url=http://lifeformed.bandcamp.com/] Lifeformed [/url].

Also worth mentioning is the awesome community surrounding Dustforce. The subreddit is a pretty active place, and with replays being attached to every rank on every leaderboard, the best way to learn how to get better is by watching and learning from others.

If you're the sort of person that likes exploration and collecting in platformers, Dustforce is right up your dirty alley. First is its beautiful art style that makes it stand out from a heap of other platformers. Then you have a great sense of movement control. You can double jump, dash, run up walls for a brief time, wall jump, cling to a ceiling and move along to it before you ultimately fall off.  You can slide down slopes and Yaba-Daba-Do your way off inclines at the end to launch yourself.

The game introduces you to all these incredible mechanics via three tutorial levels. One for traversing, another for combat and the third for advanced techniques such as dash jumping into a double jump to run up a wall. I had to return to the advanced techniques 2 hours into the game to complete it. You are never forced to do anything in the game, but there is definitely a need to perfect these skills.

As a member of dust force, your goal is to clean the world of dirt by touching it. Its easy enough to just run across dirt, making it disappear, but the challenge becomes getting up walls, onto ceilings, and beating the dirt from enemies that gives harmless things a sinister new life. The object of each level is to dust trails of leaves, green glop and other forms of dirt all the way up to defeating a few enemies at the end. There's nothing to differentiate these enemies, one dead end full of enemies might not be the dead end full of enemies you're looking for.

Combat gets relegated to two buttons, a weak attack and strong attack. The strong is only good for larger enemies, because defeating a smaller enemy will only scatter the dirt covering them and you'll still need to clean it. Light attacking enemies in the air gives you an extra jump, so you can double jump, hit an enemy and then jump a third time. As you play, you're also building a meter. When it gets full your character will color trail and pressing both attacks will give an automatic beating to enemies and dirt on screen. Assuming your character will be able to reach them.

There are a few different types of enemies, big hopping heads, angry bears. There are more mundane hovering types either balls of leaves or gargoyles. Green balls of goo that will punch you back, hovering barrels dumping goo beneath them. Even a sort of porcupine that shoots quills or sharp leaves at you. The biggest threat is spikes that cover large areas in later parts of the game. Each spike death or pit in the Nexus or in a level will respawn you.

When going through a level, you don't have to sweep every bit of dust or leaves, but at the end you're graded on your completion and finesse. For everything you clean, enemy or trail of dirt, you build a combo. Finesse gets determined by how high of a combo you score in each level. Getting hit or taking too long to clean something new will break your combo and hurt your finesse grade. Each level is also connected to a global leader board. Getting a ""S"" rank in a level will give you one of three colored keys (copper, silver and gold) to unlock new levels.

The problem is you need to find every level in the game via a hub world called the Nexus. This hub world offers. a real sense of exploration and challenge even to get to these level doors. Some doors are clustered in easy to access areas, but others are for more skilled players. You'll need to slide down ramps and vault over pits, or double cling to ceilings to make it across a bed of spikes. There are even areas that you'll need to time jump, dash, jumps to make it through and then do it again. For every path you take in the Nexus, you'll need to make your way back. Its never as simple as doing the same thing a second time. You'll need to figure out a way to do it or take a different route and hope that it circles back. Other doors are completely hidden and you'll need to get into every nook and cranny to find secrets.

Its not like Metroid where you unlock a new ability, getting there relies completely on your skill. After the first two dozen levels, everything gets a lot more difficult. Its this difficulty that some may love, but it hindered my enjoyment of the game. This Nexus is big and it has to be to fit over 70 levels in it.

Each level starts by letting you select from one of four members of Dustforce. They're all color coated with different looks and ways to clean, but they all play the same. No one has any ability over one another. These characters definitely give the game character and charm. An old man wearing green carrying a vacuum, a brunette in purple with pom poms as dusters, a blue clad janitor with a humble broom and a female version with red overalls.

In fact style summarizes the game as a whole, from the beautiful world with rich backgrounds in a washed out color pallet to the movement and flow of your character. Even the soundtrack has a style that fits the art. Its tranquil synthetic ballads fit perfect into the background of the beautiful cityscape, caves and laboratories.

Outside of the Nexus is a different sort of hub. Its a place that lets you visit the tutorial levels, and even go through previous levels you've beaten. These tomes come in four different books, each for different themes of each level. There's the cityscape, the castle, laboratory and. I'd much prefer flipping through a book to find a level rather than exploring the Nexus, but whatever.

For anyone creative, there's a level editor that lets you make levels in game as rich and beautiful as you'll find in Dustforce. You can even go online to download levels from your web browser. It seems like an extra step that should just be in the game. These levels all have ratings, difficulties and keywords tagged with them so you can find whatever you have a mind for.

There's even local multiplayer survival and king of the hill for up to four local players. I didn't test this or anything so I can't review it until I get a party together on my wide screen to play Dustforce.

Now for the bad stuff, by default there is no controller support, but you can rebind the keys to support your controller. The only problem with that is you still need to hit the ESC key to bring up a menu. Having a menu bind would have been nice, but its hardly a big issue. I've managed to get myself stuck outside of the screen and the camera just wouldn't follow me. Are these enough to ruin a game, no certainly not.

While this is a beautiful game with a lot of fun mechanics, it just feels needlessly difficult to get to levels. Some may like the exploration to find a level or get to a door they see high up above, but it feels like extra padding. Even with all these mechanics the game still just didn't feel like fun. It felt like a chore to go into a level and touch every place with dirt, dust and leaves. Sure I didn't have to, but if I wanted a key I'd have to. In the later hours of my play through I spent more time just getting to the levels.",1427906778,1427906778,True,40,3,0.719662904739379883,4,False,False,False,False,

It is an interesting (albeit kinda boring) idea you just sweep everything up. There is not story whatsoever (meh). Music seems fine. Then the problems happen. The game requires all these tricky movements and long fluid combos, but the controls and mechanics and super finnicky, inconsistent and dont work half the time. Sometimes I will be able to jump after a wall-run, while other times I won't. Sometimes I will only get a single jump and sometimes I will get a double jump. It seems stupid to me you can't double jump, wall run, and double jump again. The wall running and ceiling running is the worst crime. Sometimes I will be able to run up a wall, and other times I will hold against it and my gun will just run a tiny bit or won't even start a wallrun. One part to get to a new area my guy runs up and then on the ceiling, then just stops for no reason. I try to jump to the next area and hold over because the ledge is right there, but he just won't react to any buttons and falls down. This makes no sense. Sometimes you can run on the ceiling and then around on to the wall, and other times it won't. It just seems the people want to game to be more fluid, but the controls aren't consistent enough. The movements are also floaty and you will try to jump next to something and overshoot it or you will try to double jump next to a wall and instead it will make you run up it. 

Same goes with hitting, which you can hit up, but at and angle. Countless times I would be next to a guy and hit, only to go through him because I was TOO CLOSE and I wasn't at the perfect spot where the end of my broom ended exactly on his body, but thats like saying you can't hit someone with a sword because they aren't at the tip......I still hit him with the rest of my broom it should count. Very questionable hit recognition. Then there is the level design. Instead of making the levels easy to get to, like the level book, you can only look at them and replay unlocked ones, which seems dumb, because I'd rather be able to play the ones I haven't yet. Instead there is this open map with tons of different platforms and branching paths, and I am supposed to find every unlockable level by exploring....what this does is make me wonder if I have missed levels, and the only way to find out is to backtrack and try to make sense of things. Why not have the levels you created that you want people to play accessible, not in a convoluted area where people can easily miss them. Then there are levels and are like impossible to get it. I went through and played all the levels that seemed accessible and apparent how to get to them, and I know there are more but have no clue how to get to them, and then other parts I am wondering if there are other ways to get to. This shouldn't be that way this early to leave this many levels on the table like that. I don't understand why they would add the monotony of walking from door to door and retracing steps and trying to figure out how to get to this impossible looking spot, just to play the levels of a platformer, it seems counterintuitive to me. Why waste time with boring things when we just want to get to the good parts.

Also they say controller support, but it doesn't automatically detect it, and you have to manually reset all of the buttons, and even then you can't use just the controller, because you can't program start to pause or use the controller on the menus very well....for a platformer thats a mistake by them.

And i know there are people on here that are tryhards that are like ""I don't have any of these problems"" and ""you're just bad"" but the fact is I'm not, I've played tons of platformers. I recently played a game called freedom fall that had tight controls and I had no problems with. The people that I mentioned above that will say those things, put like 70 hours into the game, and it shouldn't take that long to try and get consistency out of movement controls, they shouldn't take that much repetition and effort to figure them out, they should be obvious. I have played other games that do wall-running, air juggling, and sliding, better than this. Also there is the keys and the scores. I mentioned in my ""AAAAA for awesome"" that scores are cool for the tryhards like the ones that want to SS everything and spend 20 hours on 20 levels, but you shouldn't force that. I shouldn't have to get certain preset scores to unlock more levels by getting keys based on my score. Just let me play the levels you created. I do like how they included level editor, multiplayer, and the community maps, although those are just a lot of dumb ones with all spikes created by tryhards that want you to be perfect with moves and have spent 60 hours like them, so I wasn't impressed with some of the creations. 4.5/10.",1427411539,1427415475,False,2,0,0.383184552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,

The platforming is super fun; really easy to pick up but super hard to master.

The way momentum works really sets you up with some really cool opportunities. It just has that whole speedrunning feeling to it, like what you would feel like when playing Mirror's Edge or the early Sonic games. 

The graphics are wonderful. I don't doubt you can't run this game on any machine, but the game still looks gorgeous despite being somewhat flat and minimalistic. The music fits VERY well with the art. The game is worth to buy just for the soundtrack. I'd say the art style and music are in the same league as Fez or Hotline Miami, if not better (fight me if you disagree). 

There's nothing much to complain about. I didn't like the standard controlls, but you can rebind those.

ちなみに、すべての金鍵ステージでもノーミスクリアできると隠し要素（？）が解禁されます。
高難度のステージは最初から最後まで殺しに来ているのでかなりの練習が必要ですが…。
Backup ShiftとHideoutは突出して難しい印象です。プレイ時間150時間が近づき、一部のステージでは世界ランク2～3桁も取れるようになってきましたが、この2つはいまだにS+を取れる気配がないです。

ただ、このゲームの本当に素晴らしいところはそういうマゾい難易度ではなく、優れたリプレイ性にあると思います。

Крепко держась за свои швабры, они смело идут спасать наш засранный мир.

Dustforce — акробатический платформер с неудобным управлением. Как я писал ранее, управляя одним из четырех уборщиков вы спасаете мир от говна. Выполняя различные трюки вы не только стираете пыли или катаетесь шваброй по слою мусора, но и деретесь с противниками. Например с медведем, испачканным в листьях, шариками слизи, ожившими коробками и гаргульями. Конечно в игре нет крови. После драки противник очищается от грязи и больше не ведет себя враждебно.

Игра, которая требует идеального прохождения не может обойтись без своего топа. Вот прошли вы локацию и высвечивается таблица, где стоят игроки с лучшим временем прохождения и невероятными оценками S. Чтобы не ломать себе голову как игрок получил первое место, можно посмотреть запись и впасть в депрессию от крутости.

В игре всего три огромные локации. Это город, научный комплекс и лес. Так же там и встречаются побочные, типа стройки в городе и т.д. Чтобы начать спасать мир необходимо получить ключ и открыть дверь, где включается таймер и вы попадаете на лоеацию. Таймер показывает время, за которое вы убрались, после чего получаете оценки и ключ для новой двери. Оценки две. Одна за скорость уборки, а вторая за количество убранного мусора. Если пройти все уровни и получить красные ключи, то откроются секретные двери, где вас ждут еще более хардкорные уровни в духе Super Meat Boy и I Wanna Be The Guy. Однако там главное не выжить, а пройти быстро и плюс еще убраться.

У каждого из персонажей есть свои способности и оружие для наведения чистоты. Например девочка с щетками может выполнить тройной прыжок, а парень с метлой скользит быстрее всех ну и т.д. Кроме того профи в игре заранее знают каких персов лучше использовать для чистки какой-либо локации. Однако я играл только той малолеткой с щетками и старпером.

Да, у игры отличная графика и анимация, выполненная в стиле мультфильма. Расстраивает отсутствие сюжета. Есть только цель, по которой игрок должен пройти все локации на оценку S или получить первое место в топе. Огорчает и отсутствие озвучки, без которой пропадает та самая атмосфера мультика. Однако это недоразумение компенсируется фразами над головами персонажей и спокойной музыкой, которая расслабляет и помогает настроится на прохождение.

Плюсы: Игра получилась динамичной, с оригинальной идеей и музыкой. Отличная игра, чтобы уделать пару игроков в топе.
Минусы: Кроме отсутствия сюжета имеется и сложное управление, к которому нужно привыкать минимум 4 локации, а потом уже свободно бегать по локации. Без озвучки пропадает атмосфера мультфильма.",1421079578,1421079578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

Think games like Mario Bros. or N+, where you can just tap a jump or movement key and only move a small amount.

This game doesn't follow that at all, at least on keyboard controls.

While playing, I found a set of ledges with a gap just big enough for the character to fall between, but for some reason, the game will still ""jump"" you from one platform to the next even while trying to walk and fall between them.

I never thought I'd see the day where I wanted to play a game that revolved around cleaning up dust particles, but nevertheless, here we are. They say never judge a book by it's cover. Well, never judge a video game by it's screenshots. For this game appeared to have it all, but managed to fall short. Let me start out by saying that I loved the art style though, along with the soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack is probably the best part about 'Dustforce' and is exactly what you want in a platformer. As for the controls, they are nowhere near as bad as some of the people on here make them out to be, and personally I found them to be quite good. The only thing that stinks is how they make you assign the controller buttons yourself, as opposed to just having them preset for you. I wouldn't even dream of using a keyboard to play this game. 

As you may already know, this game was made with speedrunning in mind. Speedrunning is something I enjoy watching, but not performing, and had I known that beforehand, I would have skipped this game entirely. I mean, who makes a game specifically tailored for speedruns? Getting to the end of a level as quickly as possible? Where's the fun in that? No, I like to take my time, look around, really take in my surroundings. And besides, isn't the whole fun in speedrunning, coming up with the fastest method on your own? It just doesn't make much sense if you ask me. Aside from that, there's pretty much nothing else to do in this game but run from door to door playing level after level for the best time. No bosses, no enemies, just jumping from one platform to another, climbing wall after wall, sweeping up that dirty dust. 

There just doesn't feel like much of a reason to continue playing 'Dustforce' after an hour or two, unless you care about posting the highest scores for all to see. Which is basically where 99% of the incentive to continue playing comes from; the highest possible score. On the other hand, I can definitely see how people enjoy playing this game. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, the art style although simplistic, works quite well, and the controls are pretty good.",1420601269,1423697315,False,7,0,0.480632156133651733,0,True,False,False,False,

I'm not very good at Dustforce, but I still enjoy it a lot. I'm pretty clumsy with both a keyboard or a controller, I'm fairly certain the input doesn't matter, a skilled player can dance through the levels whilst a clumsier player like myself will find multiple ways to blame the controller whilst really it's the player at fault.

Completing a level isn't good enough, you have to go over and over, to get that S / S rating, shaving off seconds, perfecting a route, figuring the perfect peaceful and flowing pattern that will earn you a perfect and you can move on. Practice makes perfect.

The animations are beautiful and smooth, matching the gameplay style and giving everything a wonderful flow. The soundtrack is amazing, helping your mind hit that half-focused, half-zen-like concentration zone.

I'll never complete Dustforce, I'll never get S / S on many of the levels, I'm not even good enough to even GET to many of the levels in the hub world (they're hidden away out of reach, requiring a certain precision and timing of skills to climb to them)...

This game is not hard at all, plus i found it more easy than Super Meat Boy, but there are two things that i didn't like too much on game, the controls and the BGM. 

The controls are not smooth, they take a while to respond and for some odd reason i could't connect a controller, and the BGM is bit annoying.  

Still is a game that is worth playing!

Let's start with all the things this game does right, though:

-Cool theme/graphical style
-Fun characters (all functionally identical, but visually distinct)
-Pleasant music

So what's wrong with Dustforce? It's hard to put into words, as the vocabulary for platform video game reviewing is still in its infancy and words like ""floaty"", ""mushy"", ""heavy"", ""satisfying"" and so on are all very subjective. If I was forced to put it into words, I'd say that your character is too heavy, yet doesn't have enough inertia - it takes a while to get up to speed, and it's very easy to lose that momentum with the way that levels are designed. It's fairly fluid when you play perfectly, but it falls apart in the hands of an inexpert player. 

What else?

The overworld is directionless and confusing. There are no (threatening) enemies, so this is purely platforming for the sake of platforming. Rarely are you directly challenged - the game is clearly designed for speedrun enthusiasts.

Here in the modern era of gaming, you have tons of options if you're looking to run and jump on some platforms. If I were you, I'd be cautious about this one. Check out Super Meat Boy instead.",1419213811,1419213859,False,26,1,0.495628684759140015,5,True,False,False,False,

Thank God at least it comes with trading cards. Also the soundtrack seemed pretty nice, at least during the tutorial part, cause getting any further is clearly not something I'll get to do.

Neben dieser Herausforderung und dem Aufbau eines gewissen Frustfells, darf ich während meiner stilvollen Putzaktionen eine atmosphärische, manchmal sehr entspannende Musik genießen.
Grafisch passt das ganze Spiel sauber zusammen und auch der Service der Hersteller ist bisher ausgezeichnet.

This game is designed exceptionally well. Everything feels intentional and like meticulous thought was put into it, this caries over into how you learn to play the game as well. 

In the Dustforce you progress in an spawling overworld by beating levels, gaining keys and subsequently unlocking harder levels. In reality you progress by obsessing over every fraction of a second you could have done better in order to get higher on the leaderboards. You can watch replays others playthroughs of the levels, which is a great resource for new players and works splendidly within game.

You can play as 4 characters with slightly different traits, which really wont matter initially for the casual player but can make all the difference once you are acquainted with the game and aim to shoot hundreths of a second off your speed run.  

The controls felt a bit loose (or more floaty) to me persoanlly, having just finished playing several other platformers, but it was easy to adjust to and may have just been me. You have an insane amount of mobility and the levels are designed to show this off, letting you fluidly slide around walls, ceiling floors, and lay down some beatdown on enemies when they show up. 

The music is mostly mellow and slow and almost seems contrary to the pressure of trying to perfect your run. It does a nice job at keep you calm after several trails on the same level. 

Local Multiplayer works well and is fun to play, and is a wonderful addition.

However, playing the actual game has shown me that good intentions do not necessarily translate into a full experience.

I think that Dustforce's biggest problem is how it defines 'skill' and 'difficulty'. Dustforce has very little in the way of rewarding a player, only giving out keys which are used to unlock a handful of harder levels. When most of the game's content is unlocked from the start, the player's only remaining motivation is the scoreboard. When one takes a cursory glance at said scoreboard, one notices very long strings of players who complete the level in virtually the same amount of time, give or take a fraction of a second. Not only that, but the requirement of sweeping all dust in a level for a perfect score causes every level, regardless of size, to develop a 'one true path' that sacrifices exploration and player experience for the sake of a higher score. This makes the game extremely tedious to play, boiling itself down to memorization of a level and restarting the level at the slightest mishap.

I'm aware that the game is designed with the speedrunning community in mind, but one reason as to why speedrunning is so highly valued in those circles is the fact that speedrunners interpret a game in a different manner than the developers, and play it at a much faster speed than intended, entertaining others who are only familiar with a more down-to-earth means of beating the game. Meanwhile, Dustforce's design mentality is rigidly geared towards beating the levels as fast as possible, causing the practice of speedrunning to be rendered pedestrian, and therefore moot. 

Aside from the core gameplay, which is admittedly quite interesting despite its flawed implementation, there is honestly not much else to say about Dustforce. I did like how the game's various sprites were traditionally animated, but the artstyle itself is so minimalistic that the subtlties and quirks that normally come with such techniques are lost. The music on its own is good, but not exciting or emotional, causing it to simply blend into the background, when music should enhance the player's experience by being memorable or unique.

When looking at Hitbox Team's upcoming Spire, I'm glad to see that the team is taking more consideration to the skill of the individual and motivating the individual to get better in order to progress further. Hopefully, it'll make for a more rewarding and engaging experience than Dustforce, which, in my opinion, feels like more of a chore than actual dusting.",1417131756,1417131863,False,12,0,0.518127739429473877,3,True,False,False,False,

I got this game in a bundle, and was really excited to try it because of all the technical gameplay mechanics - like the complex executions you have to use in order to make your run look as seamless as possible. I had watched a few speedruns on YouTube and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of experience provided by Dustforce DX.

If you like cleaning, artsy and smooth platforming gameplay, a stellar electronic soundtrack, chaining combos, score attacks, and challenging mechanics, then you will really enjoy this game.

The aesthetics are great - the detail in the different levels is very high and well-done. The music and sound effects are awesome, and I will provide a link to the OST here because it is that good; I think the only other game OST I ever linked in my review was NEOTOKYO's.

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_B8ekeZTCM]Dustforce DX OST[/url]. 

The controls are a bit tricky to learn, but the tutorials are very helpful and will ensure you get a firm grasp on the game's mechanics before you start your janitorial runs. You can try using a controller, but the keyboard bindings work just as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - one of the most difficult elements of the game is combining the different actions in order to achieve a smooth run. Combos are also essential for reaching many areas in each level and progressing deeper into the game. For example, you may have to wall run upward, double/wall jump several times, and hit a dustball/enemy at the top in order to reach a higher level (and if you do everything except hitting the object at the top, you will not be able to make the climb). Practising and repeating levels will really hone your skills.

Overall, the gameplay is very quick and technical - chaining the proper actions is critical. Once you can achieve a seamless run, the visual aesthetics are so satisfying and rewarding. The main hub will allow you to access the options and all the levels, however, you must unlock new levels by completing preceding ones. There are a good number of levels available for you to test your skills, and the game offers a lot of time value if you are really into speedruns and 100% completion. During your playthrough, you must complete each level in a set amount of time, while maintaining a smooth (finesse) run. If you can finish the stage within the time limit and maintain a good combo bar, then you will achieve a double S rank (best possible score).

For the achievement junkies, there is only one to collect, and this requires you to complete every level by performing the most perfect possible run. I really, really love this type of achievement system in a game, and not the stupid, meaningless artificial-game-lengthener types found in games like Lucius (which I will be reviewing soon) - where you need 20 and 40 game hours when the game takes ~10 hours to complete. No, in Dustforce DX there's just one, challenging achievement that involves you spending quite a bit of time refining your skills and experience so you can obtain those perfect runs.

The game can get a bit repetitive once you've invested a large amount of time, however, the variety in level layout and different enemy types adds lots of playability. There are also different characters with slightly different attributes, allowing for a unique playstyle depending on who you select (ex: one character has quicker drops and longer jump range).

If you like challenging platformers with an emphasis on finesse and score attacks, then you must give this game a try.

Definitely recommend!

The premise of the game is to sweep each level while never letting your combo drop; which occurs when you have not swept up any dust after a set period of time. A flawless continuous sweep gives you a 'perfect' rating, which can unlock keys which you can use to enter more difficult levels. This is not necessary to enjoy the game, though, as many levels are available without unlocks and community made levels are plentiful and just as enjoyable. You can complete levels without perfecting them, though this gives you a worse rating and no key. Earning a perfect rating on difficult levels is really a challenge as the mechanics in Dustforce take hours, maybe even days of playtime to perfect. 

The game contains a leaderboard where you can watch replays of the best times to get a feel for how to perfect a level and different paths to take. Only a small handful of players have perfected every level, and I am not one of them. The challenge does not take away from the game, though, it is still a fantastic game with gorgeous visuals and a calming and beautiful soundtrack that I have listened to for nearly 3 years now. I highly suggest picking up Dustforce if you are a fan of difficult platformers and want a real challenge fit for a perfectionist. 
 
Pros: 
-Beautiful art style and soundtrack, both go great together. 
-Difficult but rewarding controls and mechanics. 
-Tons of levels varying in difficulty. 
-Map editor and thousands of custom made levels from the community to keep you busy. 
-Leaderboard with a replay system which helps on more difficult levels. 
-4 different characters with their own slight differences. 
 
Cons: 
-Some advanced mechanics are not taught in game and are to be learned via the replay system or fanmade tutorials on youtube. 
-Multiplayer mode is local only (I have never touched it). 
-Some of the most difficult levels are possibly too hard and require a lot of time to figure out and perfect (may not be a downside to some).

I personally would have never bought Dustforce had it not been part of a bundle, but everything about the game was well done and lovingly put together and it really showed.
Sadly, something has changed. I booted the game back up to sweep some leaves and collect some cards and all of the mechanics are just broken. The controls are floaty and imprecise, the character seems to have a bizarre response time and beyond the fact that I openly admit I was dreadful at the game upon it’s release, whatever updates that have been put in place since then have made it completely unplayable. It’s truly a shame, but I can no longer say I recommend Dustforce.",1415668012,1415668012,False,4,0,0.412844061851501465,0,False,False,False,False,

Verdikt: Dustforce je originálna 2D hra o upratovacej čate. Hra vyniká po výtvarnej stránke a dizajn úrovní je taktiež dobrý. Herná doba závisí od trpezlivosti, naozaj veľkej trpezlivosti hráča, prípadne hráčov, pretože hra obsahuje aj multiplayer. Obtiažnosť sa postupne zvyšuje do extrémov a opakovanie niektorých pasáži sa počíta na desiatky. Pred hraním je najlepšie odstrániť všetko cenné z vášho blízkeho okolia. Pre istotu odložte niekde bokom aj myšku, ktorú k hraniu nepotrebujete. Dustforce je hra pre sadomasochistov, ktorí holdujú ťažkým hrám. Pri jej hraní je vhodné občas odbehnúť do telocvične alebo posilovne a vybiť zo seba nervy radšej tam ako neskôr objednávať nový nábytok z IKEI.

За его спиной спал мирным сном увядающий сад. Пруд сверкал в холодных лучах осеннего солнца. 
“Тернист и труден путь Дворника, от тьмы к свету, от немощи к могуществу, от невежества к мудрости”. 
Его руки крепко сжимали полированное дерево ясеневой рукояти. Каждый прут из связки прошел скрупулезный отбор, и теперь они торчали один к одному, эффективные и беспощадные, как спартанская фаланга. В руках истинного мастера метла становилась неподражаемым орудием чистоты и порядка.   
“Быть дворником – значит, посвятить себя Метле без остатка. Стремиться к спокойствию разума и пониманию истинной природы Уборки”. 
Дворник неспешно огляделся по сторонам. Грязные углы, пыльные скамейки, замусоренные поляны - всё сложилось для него в гармоничную картину. Теперь он знал, что нужно делать. Одним виртуозным движением он крутанул метлу над головой и привел её в боевую готовность.
И началось представление. 
Внезапно, земля ушла у мусорщика из под ног. Штормовой шквал разошелся по сторонам света, подняв волны палой листвы выше верхушек деревьев. 
Уборщик парил словно птица, и подтяжки рабочего комбинезона трепетали на ветру. Время бессильно застыло, а Дворник спускался вниз тягучей упоительной спиралью. В следующий миг секунды побежали вперед с утроенной скоростью, пытаясь нагнать намеченный график. Ураганный танец помела заставлял сердце сжиматься от страха и восторга. Зрение не могло уследить за движениями метелки. В те редкие секунды, когда он сбавлял темп, наблюдатели заворожено любовались его отточеным движениями и непредсказуемым стилем Уборки. Блистательная феерия превращала очищение урн в калейдоскоп ярких красок. От накала страстей закипала в ведерке грязная вода. Хореография подметания по праву могла называться искусством. 
Уборка закончилась так же резко, как началась. Яростным хлестким ударом Дворник вырвал бурундука из плена кленовых листьев, с размаха вогнал метлу в землю, улыбнулся и показал зрителям большой палец. Сила бурлила в нем, но все мысли и чувства испарились в ревущем костре эмоций.

Другими словами, стильный, красивый платформер, рассчитанный на тысячекратное перепрохождение. Быстрее, ровнее, точнее. Можно расслабиться. Можно напрячься. Можно сойти с ума.

If you can learn to play it, then I imagine ti would be an awesome game.

The learning curve. You look at hard platform games like super meat boy or electronic super joy, these are hard games. But the learning curves are pretty good.  But this game just lacks that entirely.

Before the ""DX"" update, it was impossible to ""get into the game"" without already having knowledge of it. In the new DX update, things are easier, but they are still not perfect. I mean, for goodness sake, in order to even reach the 3rd tutorial, you seem to require the knowldge that is taught to you in that 3rd tutorial. (i.e. dash-jumping) It is very badly designed.

Having not been able to play them, I can't speak for the design of the later levels.

The control scheme for this game is impossible to use. In order to set it up to use a controller, you need to set up each button manually. And if you do set it up with a controller, it is impossible to switch back to keyboard without again manually resetting each button, via your controller. And god help you if you can't connect your controller again to do this. Also, I can't seem to figure out why the menu can't be opened by the controller. It can only be opened by pressing Esc on the keyboard.

Now, as for the music and art in this game, it looks really good.  Kudos to the dev team for that. The music is very calming (which is helpful in alleviating frustration), and the art style is simplistic, but avoids feeling ""flat"".

To summarize, I really think this game is lacking a lot in the way of easing new players in. It is just impossible to learn how to play it. Even with help from snipppets of conversations in the forums, it just feels like it's missing something. That, or I am the one missing something here.

[Incidentally, if anyone knows what it is that i'm missing, please tell me, because I really want to be able to play this game].",1414852967,1414852967,False,6,0,0.468752145767211914,1,False,False,False,False,

Instead of simply jumping from any ordinary platform to the next, it takes some sort of pseudo-Sonic approach of fast paced, all-surfaces high-octane super-platforming.

Let me be frank: this game is hard. Sure, it does a good job of easing you into it, but this isn't just some casual romp. Be prepared to put all your effort into getting constant SS ranks if you want to explore all the game's content.

The visuals are pleasing and colorful, just a nice view for the eyes. The music is likewise calm and soothing techno, which is just as well to ease you from the rage that will transpire.

The game controls butter smooth, and has a lot of depth from a rather simple means of traversing the maps. I did have one complaint about the controls, namely the lack of complete controller support. Most basic buttons are there, except the menu button. I can't even count how many times I've had to restart, and I have to do it all from going to the keyboard to press escape. Is an extra respec option too much to ask for?
EDIT: Though there is no option to respec the escape menu in the controls, I found that the ""instant restart"" key in another menu is able to be bound to a controller button, which is quite swell.

Another complaint I have, though not with the game, is the lack of community attention. When exploring the nexus, it is entirely up to me to find the one bronze door that I still have a key for, and it still eludes me because no one has a nexus map uploaded.

All said, it's crazily addictive to the right people, namely: twitch-reflex, practice-based skill games that never stop the action.",1414801350,1451101315,True,8,0,0.54578852653503418,0,False,False,False,False,

It isn't really a platformer for someone looking for a quick drive-by game, and while there are lots of technique intensive platformers this one definitely stands out. Going through the motions of the game and then watching replays of the top runs through each level makes it very easy for the player to feel very unskilled at the game. 

I think it's easy to have a love/hate relationship with the controls in the game. Be willing to change them to something more comfortable if you find their initial configuration unpleasant to work around. Try the game on a gamepad or arcade stick. They ARE responsive controls, but I know that I didn't feel like that immediately. Adapting to the idiosyncracies of a game makes it more intuitive and this game will most likely require some adaptation. The game physics and the controls will require precise timing and attention to detail to progress through it.

The game looks fairly nice, and the soundtrack is beautiful. There's lots of levels to run through, and an editor if you like playing around with the tools.

DO buy this game if you enjoy technical platformers with non-combat goals.

Dustforce DX changed the layout of the levels a bit, and added different tutorial levels to explain a few techniques a little better.

Game's core features:
Dusting/Sweeping
Different Playable Characters
Platforming
Parkour
Special Gague
Level Evaluation/Grading System (S, A, B, C, D)
Easy Controls
Semi-Open environment

Dusting/Sweeping: If you couldn't tell already the main idea behind this game is dusting levels with a tool that varies depending on what character you play as.

Different Playable Characters: There are four playable characters, each have different tools they use to clean up the dust with: A kitchen Broom, a Push Broom, Feather Dusters and a Vacuum, each of these somehow seem to complete the characters personality, even though [i]so far[/i] there hasn't been any dialogue. Each character has a different ""Style"" of moving about, not really sure how to describe it, but there is a slightly different feeling between each of the characters.

Platforming: Not much to say here, you jump from platform to platform, however i will say the platforming isn't very repetitive and just feels right.

Parkour: Not Minecraft-Style ""parkour"", we're talking runing up a wall to jump to the next wall, then jump off of that wall to reach a platform, dash to get speed jump and RUN ON THE CIELING of the next platform to procede to the next section of the level, it's incredible and you feel like a champ for pulling off these stunts.

Special Gague: As you progress through each level and clean up dust, a gague at the bottom of the screen will slowly start filling up, once this gague fills completely, you can use a special move. This move is incredibly useful and does not change depending on which character you are (in one way I am glad that that's how it works, however in another way I am slightly dissapointed...) when you activate your special move your character will flash across the screen cleaning up all the dust within a certain radius of the character. It looks very much like a scene from a typical fighting anime show, but it's funny cause it's just them cleaning up dust.

Level Evaluation System: You are graded on two criteria after completing a level: How much of the dust you clean up in a level (Completion), and how many times your combo meter gets set back to 0 (Finese). S is the highest grade you can reach and D is the lowest (at least I think, it's the lowest I've gotten...). Once completing a level you will be awarded points towards different keys whih will allow you to complete other levels in the game.

Easy Controls: At the begining of the game you are bombarded with lots of information that seems a bit overwhelming at first, however the levels in each area ease you into learning the controls and before you know it, it's like second nature to you and you're pulling off nice fluid parkour tricks.

Semi Open-Environment: Each actual level is actually not connected to another, however, you don't choose the level from the menu, instead you're navigating your character to the next doorway wich will take you to the level. It would be like the old Mega Man X games met Super Metroid. Even the game menu is navigated this way.

Other Features: Hand painted graphics and a really nice ""chill out"" styled soundtrack. Reminescent of an old Sega Genesis or SNES game.",1414391497,1414391497,True,6,0,0.546569108963012695,0,False,False,False,False,

However, the new tutorials in the DX update are vastly better than the old ones, and once everything clicks you realize how d*** brilliant everything is.

There are few things more exhilarating than flowing from platform to platform, effortlessly cleaning up all of the trash in your way. There are few things more satisfying than, after many restarts, nailing every jump and pressing every button at exactly the right time. There are few things more rewarding than racking up a 300+ combo and taking out all of the end-level enemies with the press of a button and seeing your janitor jump effortlessly around the screen, turning everything into a cloud of dust in slow motion, then falling to the ground with your newly-cleaned buddies, pumping your janitor's fist triumphantly.

The soundtrack is a unique, atmospheric montage of skillfully crafted musical sounds. The gameplay is flawless and exciting, and can be quite the challenge to those who think they've seen all the game has to offer! With an intricate overworld, gorgeous scenery, and riveting gameplay, this is a must-have game for anyone who enjoys platformers or video games in general.

There are hidden spots in every level where you can sit and enjoy the scenery for as long as you like, all while relaxing to the fabulous soundtrack. There are hidden secrets which add to the game's depth as you struggle to find at least one in every level of every one of the four worlds. For an indie game, it does everything right.

The controls are responsive and they will not miss an input unless you put in a dash while you're in the air (as that won't happen on any game anyways). Each level is better than the last, and there's a Tome of Levels for you to visit your favorites if you choose not to run through the overworld to get to it. Please play it with a controller, as keyboard takes getting used to.

All in all, this game is wonderful. For me personally not worth 10 bucks or whatever it goes for, but you can get it every few months in a bundle for a dollar with some other games, so there's always that.

一句话点评：
[H1][b]Platformer中的高等物理学，观赏性和学术性在同类中首屈一指
[/b][/H1]
——————————————————————————————————————————

绝对是硬核向的Platformer，融入了很神奇的扫地元素，变得独具一格，且极难上手，想精通更是遥遥无期。

[H1]前言[/H1]
如果你是看了商店那段行云流水的PV有点心动，也想体验这种飒爽的话，最好先参考下[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarofmud/recommended/65300/]这篇评测[/URL]
[quote=glass]
This game does not have a skill ceiling. 90 hours in and I've just started learning how to play.[/quote]
上百小时的扫地僧大有人在，但大多数玩家基本熬不过最初的上手阶段
全新的操作体验让你分分钟都在吃瘪，和SuperMeatBoy、ElectronicSuperJoy完全不是一个套路，相比之下后两者还显得亲民了，因为它们至少还有个选关界面，而Dustforce中要到达关卡门前还得进行一番挣扎……但是一旦上手又是如此妙不可言，不能停的节奏。这类硬核游戏往往都有这样奇特的魅力
至于这款几十m的小游戏值不值得自残下呢，列几个亮点大家感受感受

[H1]操作[/H1]
低容错，高严谨——也就是我们一开始感受到的重力感、判定延迟、“渣”手感
在这里提个异端：二段跳后无法直接冲刺。在许多Metroidvania到了后期上天入地都会出现的能力，但仔细想想，并不科学，取而代之的是跳跃前的冲刺，只有熟悉了玩法后才会发现其合理性
另外一点就是滑行。大触Replay里感觉像脚底抹了油，而自己玩却慢得不忍直视，单纯的Dash又完全没有加速的效果。但是如果对关卡地形观察到位的话，利用斜坡配合↓+Dash向下俯冲进行加速，注意方向变换，抓住正确时机，强大的惯性会带你突破时速120码(难度系数★★★★★)，这绝对是其他任何Platformer都没有的体验！

[H1]Replay系统[/H1]
许多Platformer都有Leaderboard功能，但并不一定都有Replay功能。你看Leaderboard前几名的用时，对比下自身，完全不在一个战斗力层面，但通常时候你会想：这是Speedruner吗，还是Cheater？无从考证
而Dustforce的Replay系统，可以说是前期至中期最重要的功能。当你吃力地完成某个关卡感觉浑身难受，正想删游戏给个差评，Leaderboard上那一列DoubleS都会用出神入化的Replay来打你的脸，玩得比TAS还赏心悦目，而且人人都有不一样的玩法，这特么玩的是同一个游戏？想知道答案就得乖乖缩回去，继续修炼自己的扫地技艺吧

[H1]成就[/H1]
最高冷的也是唯一的成就——Double S！没有什么额外的收集要素，全游戏中唯一的硬指标就是达成关卡的双S评价，新关卡的解锁亦是
由于关卡更新前后带来的微妙问题，这个成就正好止步于里世界关卡中的其中一个，就是说只要完成表世界全S+里世界此关卡单S=成就到手，难度在所有里关卡中排倒数第二……如果最终目的是里世界全S，没有两三百小时说不出过去。可以说是点到为止，苦尽甘来，这个蓝色的S成就图标是你通过入门考试的有力证明！

[H1]音乐[/H1]
OST绝了！简直温暖人心，能轻易地穿透那群高不胜寒的扫地僧们

方向キーと4つのキー（ジャンプ、ダッシュ、攻撃）を使いステージを攻略していくのですが
スピードが速いうえ方向キーで方向を指定しながら跳んだり壁を滑ったり攻撃したりで
操作量が多く難しいです。方向キーの操作が重要なのでコントローラーをお勧めします。

基本的にはステージクリアと高スコアを目指すのがこのゲームの目的です。
クリア時に三つの　掃除率//タイム//コンボ　の評価があり
丁寧にかつ素早く手際よく掃除すれば高い評価が得られます。
ステージクリア時にランキングが表示され、そこからリプレイをみることが可能です。
フレンドとスコアを競ったり、他人のリプレイをみてプレイの参考にしたり、
もちろん自分のリプレイを見ることもできます。

私の評価ではこのゲームはとっても良いゲームです。定価で買ってもいい。
操作をまちがえイライラが溜まるかもしれません、しかし！
諦めずに繰り返しプレイしていくにつれ今までには出来なかった動きができるようになり
どんどん自らの動きが機敏でスタイリッシュになっていきます。
これがすごく気持ちいい。これがこのゲームの一番の魅力かもしれません。
フレのタイムを抜こうと必死にプレイしているとあっという間に時間が過ぎていきます。
競うフレンドがいないのなら私がフレになりましょう！

良BGMなのでサントラもオススメ

Dustforce offers a ton of replayability, if you like the gameplay and dont give up too easily, then you can spend a lot of time on it.

It's slick, beautiful, and most importantly the movement feels perfect.

The gameplay is what you expect it to be - you progress from level to level, attempting to complete it as fast as possible (with global leaderboards on time). Additional depth is added by the inclusion of your broom, used to sweep 'dust' as you run and hit 'enemies' with, building up a combo which you are rated on along with the time. Although initially the game may seem laggy or unresponsive, within a few hours you become accustomed to how the momentum and motion works in the game and begin to understand that the opposite actually holds. The game gives you perfect control, and punishes the tiniest of your mistakes.

That's really where the beauty lies. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, obvious to see if you watch a speedrun of this game. The game encourages you towards this perfection, and indeed the only achievement in this game is one of completing it - a feat few people (myself not included) have achieved. There's no RNG in the game, it's just you and how you play. This is certainly not for everyone, but for those few who don't like grinding and obtaining perfect muscle memory, the game hits all the right buttons

It is also worth mentioning the soundtrack. Some games have terrible music. Some games have good music for the game. Some have soundtracks that are amazing standalone, and this is one of them. It's (largely) calm, electronic stuff that's perfect for relaxing or concentrating too. Look it up on youtube - Fastfall by Lifeformed is the album.

If you combine Super Meat Boy, Mirror's Edge and N you might get something like Dustforce.
You try to run and jump your way through a large number of levels as fast as possible while, well, cleaning dust or to be more accurate, foliage.
The combination of wall jumping and multiple jumps by dusting of flying enemies gets you into a flow in which you will want to complete every level. But the difficulty rises fast and this game will make you retry a level many many times even if you somehow beat it, especially then.

Everything fits together, it is a true masterpiece. For beginners a challenge and for perfectionists an endless pursuit. The music is excellent, the graphics are tight and the animations fit perfectly. Character design is cool as well. The concept of sweeping dust is strange indeed but that gives it the originality to lift it from other games in its category. Level design subtly teaches you skills gradually.

It is a matter of taste if you like the concept of time attack. Speed running. Split second timing, and endless attempts at perfection. But it is very satisfying once you belong to the best 1% in a level - of course you'll never beat Thor and his homies, but his replays serve as a good reference and may inspire new techniques.

If you liked the dashing in Mega Man X on SNES and don't despise the thought on a game that revolves around the moveset in the named game - while expanding it in mobility, variety and speed - then this is a title you will most certainly enjoy. No guns - but whacking bears with a mop proves equally satisfying if well performed.

Every little detail seems to be intended - even if you find out something that appears like a bug (for example keeping high momentum by dashing after a long slide) you will soon find a level that solely revolves on the perfection of this technique. This makes the game difficult to like at first, since you have to invest some hours to get used to it and to realize the little moveset combos that exist intentionally but don't appear intended. You will have to scratch off the surface if you want to see it's true genuity. I predict, you will either play this game for 10 hrs and get bored due to it's difficulty, or forever if you realize and accept the challenge it poses.

I highly recommend this game either way, it is one of those games that i will never forget - and i have been playing videogames for some decades now. I know that many other people agree. It's quite cheap, for the thought, the design and the music that went into it. The level editor potentially increases gametime by many hourse  -  but in practice most people will have enough by the levels given by the creators. I myself have by far not cleared them all, but i just love beating the ""noob"" stages and perfecting my basic techniques. Beating my own records gradually on daily basis and belonging to the fastest 1% is actually a quite low set goal, but a good way to improve.",1411222906,1411222906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,

In it, you go very fast, sweep up the dust, you're a janitor man, lady, girl, old man, start at the start, end when the level says it's over, sweep the dust and wack the dust monsters as you go

The dust leads the way, so that your instincts are all you need; make the jump, do the slide: the power is in your hands

The music sooths and checkpoints about. There is no need for a game over screen when the point is graceful iteration. there will be frustrating hiccups, but the game is earnest: it wants you to succeed, and it does its best to get out of the way 

Levels teach you the skills you need to advance, with the grace and subtlety of a janitorial mr miyagi, and you say why have i been sweeping all this time, when am i going to learn karate? you knew it all along. but you're supposed to sweep anyway, you're a janitor. please be serious.

the elevator pitch: sonic the hedgehog, if sonic was actually a good game and had good levels, with an emphasis on speed, grace, fluidity, and perfection

it is one of a few games i've ever bothered getting 100%. this one's worth every penny. god bless

Du coup, pas de scénario du tout (dommage, perso j'aime bien qu'il y aie un fil conducteur quand même), des leaderboards et 4 zones de 12 niveaux. 
Les 4*12 niveaux se répartissent en fait en 4*3*4 niveaux, chaque zone ayant 4 portes standard, 4 portes argentées et 4 portes dorées qui représentent les niveaux de difficulté. (moyen / dur / super dur, grossièrement) 
De base, uniquement les portes standards sont ouvertes, faire un perfect sur une porte standard vous donne une clé argentée, et faire un perfect argenté vous donne une clé dorée. Faire un perfect doré vous donne une clé rouge qui ne sert que si on a toutes les clés rouges du jeu (= si on a perfect tous les niveaux de base, moins de 0.3% des joueurs ont réussi à faire ceci) et qui permet d'accéder à la série de niveau ""ultra difficulty"" ( :lol: ) pour les gros tarés.

Une fois qu'on maitrise le jeu on peut faire des trucs vraiment très sympas ceci dit.

There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it all, but at least you'll get your money's worth.
Dustforce combines speedrunning and combat to create an intense ""race against the clock"" battle in each level. The basis is to clean up as much of the level as you can in order to advance on to the next levels, each one being more difficult than the last.
This game prides itself in its level design, and therefore also in its aesthetics. Its levels, characters, enemies, and even movements are visually pleasing, which helps when you play the game for hours on end in order to beat it. The sound design is similar, having a bit of the ""fresh"" element to it in order to keep you from getting sick of playing. Secrets are also scattered around levels, awaiting the player's arrival to reveal themselves--and then unfortunately yield no product. All of this wrapped in a thoroughly-vetted world makes for an overall good game, worth the buy.

However, if you're not a completionist, I would approach this purchase with caution. As I said before, because this is an extensive game with many, many levels, you'll get your money's worth, but only if you're able to play them. You can only advance on to the more difficult levels in this game if you beat the previous level well enough, and eventually this stops your progress entirely until you return to fully complete the previous levels (which can be extremely difficult later on). Most importantly, if you're not enjoying it, then you'll more than likely quit and never return. So, again, think well before buying it if you don't want to be completionist and then waste your money.

(Also, there is a multiplayer function to this game, but I don't have friends who own the game so I can't say whether that's worth a try or not. Given the game's speed-combat combination, I imagine it would be fun but can't say for certain!)",1406939342,1406939342,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

Dustforce is a platforming game where your goal is to navigate rooms in different levels of a mansion in order to clean them, for you are the worlds most awesome custodian. Don't be turned off by that description, for each of the 4 characters you can choose from has special abilities that make them able to clean in no way seen before. You are more like a ninja than a cleaner, and you can dart through levels creating combos as you clean dust and fight off enemies to clear the level. You earn points for how well you do, which eventually unlocks keys to more rooms, etc.

In order to unlock every level though, you must eventually complete each level by cleaning every speck of dust without breaking your combo. The combo window is long enough to allow you to use differing forms of strategy, but just short enough to induce high levels of muscle tension when you are trying to keep it going over long distances. This can easily be the biggest turn off of the game, and the level of perfection required to fully beat the game is astounding when you reach the veteran levels. Some may find that frustrating and too much of a roadblock, which is understandable. On the other hand (I have never beaten all the levels, and never will) Dustforce has enough content to provide a fun playthrough to suit the difficulty level you wish to attain. More of a casual player? You have plenty of levels that are loads of fun to play. Looking for a challenge after getting the basics? Dustforce provides a good set of intermediate levels, all the way up to insanely hard.

The controls feel great, the characters move fluidly, and no 2 levels are the same. Each character can provide a different strategy, and some are much more usefel than others on specific levels. The game provides the opportunity to watch the playthroughs of any player who has completed a level, meaning that you can learn some good strategies from some very good players.

Especially for only a few bucks, Dustforce is a great game that shouldn't be missed if you like platformers.",1404695500,1404695500,True,3,0,0.535774469375610352,0,False,False,False,False,

The game employs a ranking system that judges based on completion (how much dust was ran over and how many enemies were defeated) and finesse (how few hits and restarts taken).  This game is perfect for those who go for perfect ranks in modern Sonic titles.

However, later levels in the game approach unfair difficulty, spamming spikes and requiring jumps and dashes to be timed down to the millisecond to succeed.

Story: NA/10
There is none.

Gameplay: 9.8/10
The gameplay is a mix of mirrors edge and janitorial duties, allowing your character to leap off the walls and traverse the enviroment in fluid, dynamic movement. It's nothing short of simply breathtaking, and looks just as good to watch as it is to play, but only slightly. Everything has this great sense of weight and momentum to it- your air dash is small, but builds momentum insanely quickly, sending you into top speed in a flash, running up walls is quick and sticky, meaning getting around on walls, ceilings and ramps is a breeze. The combat, while simple, serves as an excellent momentum booster. Smack an enemy in the air, and your air-dash or double jump becomes replenished, increasing your jump distance and allowing you to pull off some crazy crap. It's utterly fantastic.

Graphics: 8/10
They're simple, stylish and beautiful. The leaves, slime, dust and trash all liven up the levels, and even suggest where to go next. They add a lot of charm.

Music: 8.2/10
Great to listen to in and out of Dustforce, and is relaxing enough to not make you frustrated.

I fucking love Dustforce. 

Probably the biggest challenge, aside from the hardest levels in this game, is getting the hang of the controls. It takes a special amount of dedication to truly master the techniques and proper methods to control your character. I played the game for a pretty decent amount of time (10 or more hours?) and I kind of stopped playing at a certain point. It wasn't until I came back into the game that I found a control scheme that actually worked for me, and went on to complete most of the levels in their entirety. Fast forward to the time I wrote this review and I have over 400 hours put into the game. Oops.

So you're probably wondering ""Bbop, how the hell did you manage to get 400+ hours into this game and never truly 100% beat the game?"" Well, to tell the truth, most of my hours spent on this game doesn't even come from playing the main levels.

atlas.dustforce.com gives you a massive archive of user-created levels. I've also spent a LOT of time creating my own levels! I would recommend checking my stuff out whenever you get the chance. ;)

Dustforce might just have some of the best level-editing tools a platformer could ever give you. I know this because I've spent about as much time making Dustforce maps as I have playing them.

Also time-attacking both custom and vanilla maps is addicting as hell, since every map in the game AND every map that gets published on the Atlas has their own leaderboard. The best part about the leaderboards is that they save replays of each run so you get so see how the game's most dedicated players got such amazing times.

So yeah, is it the best platformer ever? I would say no - I honestly have no idea - but it is surely the most addicting one I've ever played. Atlas gives Dustforce a near-infinite amount of replayability, whether you like designing levels or playing and reviewing them... or both. o_o

Les maps sont classés par difficulté; les maps de bases, les silvers (il faut gagner une clé en argent pour les ouvrir), les golds (clé gold) et les rouges qui sont proches de l'impossible.

Le but est d'arriver au bout de chaque map mais plus votre nettoyage est propre, plus vos clés gold et silver arriveront vite. Au final il faudra tout faire à 100% pour débloquer les maps rouges. Pour obtenir un score maximum il faut obtenir S en completion  et S en finesse. La completion est votre pourcentage de nettoyage (tout nettoyer donne un S). La finesse depend de si vous perdez votre combo (se faire taper par une entité, tomber ou ne rien nettoyer pendant quelques secondes). Pas perdre le combo donne le S.
Donc on peut dire que le vrai but est d'avoir SS sur toutes les maps.

Je trouve ce jeu très difficile mais une fois qu'on à la main sur les contrôles on peut faire SS sur les maps de bases et les silvers après plusieurs essais. Faire SS sur les maps golds est beaucoup plus dur même si certaines maps se font en 20 secondes. Je dois avoir 3 SS sur les gold.

Now, after about 20 hours of playtime I can safely say that this game is really worth the effort.

Dustforce is a single-player speedy platformer clean-‘em-up with resemblance to games such as Super Meat Boy. The aim of each level is to dash around cleaning the objective dirt off the various walls, floors and enemies in the fastest time possible, and by ""enemies"" I use the word very loosely. When you come across one of these dusty creatures you simply smack them a few times with your broom until they are thoroughly clean. The woodland animals then drop to the floor unharmed, which I find easier to live with than the Tomb Raider style destruction of wild animals; this way they’re just getting squeaky clean.

At the end of each level you are presented with two ranks: one for completion and one for finesse. The aim is to get the highest rank in both areas by cleaning up all the scum in the level without breaking streak. When you do so, you get a key to a harder level. One of my favourite aspects of Dustforce is the menus, which are like independent levels where the goal is to find the actual levels of the game. All the game mechanics and physics are present here, so if you can’t access a level it’s either because you don’t have a key to it or you just suck. Another great part of the game is the replays that get uploaded at the end of each level and the scoreboard that is also shown, as it lets you know who’s the fastest duster in town. For most of the levels it’s a guy named Thor claiming #1, and by clicking next to his name you can watch Thor diving through the level.

It’s a game I have 20 hours in and still believe I’ve only scraped the surface. If you do get round to playing this masterpiece beware of spikes, stone faces and the fact that you’re not Thor.",1399681904,1399681904,True,2,0,0.543726265430450439,0,False,False,False,False,

It's also the most difficult platformer I've ever played.

Visuals are amazing, soundtrack kicks ass, presentation is very slick. But the real reason this game shines is because of the platforming.

The way that you move about the environment is, for lack of a better term, beautiful. You can double-jump, dash around, slide down slopes, and run up walls and across ceilings. All of the levels test your ability to string together and combine these skills as you run through.

At first, just trying to complete some levels is a daunting task. Many of the harder stages require some pixel- or frame-perfect actions to maneuver through tight corridors full of spikes. I never became frustrated with dying in this game because I always felt like a death or a combo break was my fault and not the game's. But once I cleared a difficult stage with a double-S rating, it was an awesome feeling every time. Getting through a level on a perfect run looks and feels like an intricate dance, and it provides a level of satisfaction that surpasses any other platformer I've played.

All that said, I don't think I will ever beat this game. The late-game stages are just insanely brutal, and I'm not sure that I can spend the numerous hours needed to optimize my movement through just one of them to get a double-S.

It miserably.

¿Por qué no cambiar la dinámica de un videojuego? La estructura tipo/s bueno/s vs. tipo/s malo/s no tiene que ser la bandera de todo título que se precie. Aquí es donde un juego va a resultar (o no) novedoso, sorprendente. Y últimamente, salvo honrosas excepciones, este es un lujo que solo se “marcan” los juegos descargables. En este caso, el estudio Hitbox Team es el encargado de sorprendernos con un título en el que vamos a dejar cada escenario barrido de suciedad. Literalmente.



                No creo que ninguno de los presentes desee legar un mundo sucio a las próximas generaciones. No, no es un manifiesto pro-medio ambiente. En Dustforce protagonizamos una aventura de plataformas y acción en la que debemos librar cada rincón del escenario de polvo y hojas secas. Disponemos de cuatro héroes a elegir, diferenciados por el color de sus ropas y su aspecto. Dos, chico y chica, usan escoba. Otra jovencita empuña plumeros que podrían ser la envidia de Kratos, y el restante lleva una potente aspiradora. Todos ellos se mueven como auténticos personajes de acción, saltando, planeando para golpear en el aire, se suben por las paredes, dan volteretas, pueden corre por el techo…

                Antes de nada, decir que gráficamente estamos ante un trabajo muy bueno y positivo de cara a suplir la ausencia de un apartado técnico aún más potente. Todo está envuelto de una atmósfera agradable y encantadora, fría por los colores pero llena de matices, y con muchos detalles, como el vuelo de las hojas por nuestros impactos. El movimiento de los personajes es muy estilo “cartoon”, pero todo funciona con mucha fluidez incluso con un PC de gama intermedia. Y esto, para un título descargable, se agradece.



                Hay varios modos de juego en Dustforce. El modo individual es un “desfile” de fases en las que vamos haciendo limpieza sistemática de todo el entorno (recordemos que estamos ante un juego bidimensional, por lo que todo lo que exploremos va en sentido lateral, no en profundidad). Da igual si es simple polvo, hojas o incluso personajes que parecen haberse zambullido en residuos, que se comportan de forma especial. Nos toca devolverlos a la normalidad a golpe de herramienta de limpieza. La agilidad con los botones (tampoco son más de tres, sin contar las teclas de dirección) es esencial. Los dobles saltos, los rebotes, la escalada o el sujetarnos al techo temporalmente son nuestras herramientas para llegar a todos los puntos. Esto nos permite ir ganando combos, de cara a mejorar nuestras habilidades llegado a un punto, y esto a su vez facilita las cosas para dejarlo todo como los chorros. Si somos totalmente limpios, desbloquearemos niveles, y esto se agradece enormemente para hacer del juego una experiencia más duradera.



                Pero esto es como la realidad, y esto lo sabe todo el que no viva solo, sea con la familia o comparta vivienda con otra gente: es mejor si limpian varios. Lejos de querer hacer mención a las divertidas trifulcas de las viviendas de estudiantes (tú no has limpiado, esto te tocaba a ti, me has llenado de porquerías el suelo de…) en Dustforce podemos disfrutar de un simpático multijugador, de uso Local, eso sí. En él, caracterizado por la velocidad del desarrollo, habrá dos bandos, y pueden participar hasta 4 jugadores. Unos limpian, otros ensucian, y este enfrentamiento puede llegar a violentarse en muchos sentidos, pues debemos elegir si atacar golpeando, limpiar detrás del enemigo… y éste podrá seguirnos deshaciendo nuestro trabajo.

CONCLUSIONES

Que tengamos entre manos un juego de barrer no convierte a Dustforce en algo que pasar por alto. Lejos de los simuladores de cosas de la vida cotidiana que se han hecho tan famosos en las consolas gracias a sagas que hacen uso de pantallas táctiles y cámaras, Dustforce es un encantador juego de plataformas y acción en el que la habilidad lo es todo. Este modo de juego “de la vieja escuela” se adapta a todos los jugadores, y nos hará querer seguir adelante y exprimir cada nivel. ¿Alguien tiene ganas de quitar el polvo?

took some time until i found this gem!! you normally got a double jump and a dash, while air dash is also possible. in addition, you have kind of a drop dash at your disposal which can only be performed at the apex of a jump, but also after you double jumped. you may cling to walls and ceilings and move along them for a fixed distance, however, you cannot jump-climb walls since the do not ""load"" the double jump. you gain enormous speed if you use your environment, like drop-dashing (you can mash it) on a slope, which is essential for speed runs. it's tricky tricky :D",1395764865,1395766768,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,

Рекомендую эту игру тем кому нравятся Super Meat Boy и N/N+. Суть игры сводится к поиску (и исполнению) наиболее эффективного и быстрого способа зачистки уровня. Здесь очень высокие требования к навыкам игрока и без тренировки и запоминания уровней ничего не получится. Да, это игра для задpотов.
Эстетически игра смотрится отлично. В достоинства входят стильно декорированные уровни, плавная анимация и красивые движения. Саундтрек заслуживает особой похвалы. Геймплей затягивает, хотя есть и проблемы о которых я напишу ниже. И ещё мне очень понравились таблицы лидеров где нет читеров. Можно посмотреть повтор прохождения любого игрока.
Это хорошая игра, но по моему мнению она серьёзно уступает SMB. Игровая механика и дизайн уровней здесь менее интуитивные. В базовом обучении не объясняются продвинутые техники, которые необходимо исполнять для прохождения поздних уровней. Нужно либо самому догадываться, либо лезть в интернет. Кроме того некоторые трюки очень сложны в исполнении и тайминг должен быть ИДЕАЛЬНЫМ. Всё это с одной стороны поднимает планку совершенствования, но с другой стороны падает количество получаемого фана для новичка, когда не получается пройти уровень по причине неинтуитивности игровой механики.
Дизайн уровней интересен и продуман. Но. Уровни Dustforce по мере прохождения почти не предлагают каких-то новых элементов. Например в SMB постоянно появлялось что-то свежее - вентиляторы, движущиеся дорожки, гравитационные сферы и т.д. Здесь же уровни состоят из одних и тех же уклонов, пропастей и шипов.
Управление довольно неподатливое. Персонаж плохо контролируется во время прыжка, нужно относительно много времени что-бы сменить направление полёта или стабилизироваться для вертикального падения вниз. Кроме того проблему составлят даже точно встать в необходимую точку. Персонаж не может сдвинуться чуть-чуть, вместо этого он делает ощутимый шаг. Развернуться без смещения тоже нельзя. Такая неточность создаёт много проблем. Особенно это заметно когда приходится прыгать по узким платформам (см. уровень Hideout).

Dustforce เป็นเกม 2 มิติตะลุยไปข้างหน้า ที่้เราต้องทำเวลาในการทำความสะอาดฉากให้สมบูรณ์และรวดเร็วที่สุด 

ภายในเกมจะแยกเป็นฉากย่อยๆ และแต่ละฉากก็จะมีความยากที่แตกต่างกัน เมื่อเล่นไปจบแล้วจะมีตารางคะแนนให้ดูเปรียบเทียบกับผู้เล่นคนอื่น (ออนไลน์) คะแนนจะมีสองแบบคือ Best Score (สมบูรณ์และเร็วที่สุด) กับ Best Time (เร็วที่สุด) เราสามารถกดที่ชื่อบนตารางคะแนนเพื่อเข้าไปศึกษาวิธีการเล่นของคนอื่นได้ด้วย ในเกมจะมีตัวละครให้เลือกเล่น 4 ตัวละคร แต่ละตัวละครก็จะมีค่าพื้นฐานตัวละครต่างกัน(เล็กน้อย)

จุดเด่นของเกมจะเป็นเรื่องของความลื่นไหลในการบังคับตัวละครที่ทำออกมาได้ดีมาก ทำให้เวลาเล่นรู้สึกสนุกที่จะไปต่อข้างหน้า หากพลาดจะรู้สึกได้ว่าเป็นเพราะเรากดพลาดเองไม่ใช่ปัญหาของตัวเกม

ข้อเสียของเกมก็คือ ฉากเลือกฉากที่ดูสับสน ทำให้มองหาฉากที่ต้องการลำบากมาก และเพลงประกอบฉากที่ฟังดูจืดชืด

Dustforce is, and most likely will be, my favorite indie game of all time. I've never really even been into speedrunning platformers, but I absolutely loved this game.

The visuals. They're so simple, and are perfect for this game. It has a lovely look that never gets tiring to look at.

The flow/feel. Dustforce just feels great to play. Whether it's on keyboard or controller, this game has a flow that feels like you're riding through a musical masterpiece.

The soundtrack. Naturally, achieving flawless runs is what you aim for in this game, and naturally, it can get frustrating as the difficulty increases. Thanfully lifeformed (the artist) has created the absolutely perfect soundtrack for this game. The calming tunes are insanely catchy, as well as soothing to the soul as you unfortunately realize you missed a piece of dust 20% through that track you've never SS'd.

The devs. They just seem like awesome people who love making games. They've released their financial information on Dustforce after all it has been through (steam, humble bundle etc), which is a rare thing to do. They also created a level editor and website for people to share! They are currently developing a new game called Spire, which will be an instant purchase for me =]

dustforce is ludicrously difficult. it belongs to an elite faction of games I’d describe as harder than hard. the way it’s presented, that fact lays dormant. though loss is common in dustforce, there is no mean-spirit. nothing is out for your blood and none of the platforming is dishonest. what you need to do is nearly always set clearly ahead and it’s all up to your fingers. consequently, and not in a bad meaning, the stages end up feeling more like race tracks than levels. mind you, very stylized race tracks, or race track stages, but very laid-out and bare compared to genre tradition. this feel is accented, arguably engineered, by dustforce’s mode of progression. it doesn’t matter if you only get to the end of a stage in dustforce. you will, it’s always fun to clear a stage, it just won’t let you fully continue.

dustforce’s inspiration and idiosyncrasy is speed running. platformers have always been a speed running favorite. converting art into performance and display, manifesting game and human potential. speed runs are incredible, but there’s an equally incredible entry barrier. the time expenditure needed to participate means that few will experience the overwhelming play. dustforce acts as a bridge. its ranking system enforces perfection. it does not simply weigh down your time a ranking. clear time is not relevant. to unlock levels, you need SS. to get SS, you need a perfect combo with full completion. dustforce’s ranking deals with links. dust you collect on the stage builds up links. hitting dust covered enemies continues links. they are lost when you are hit, go out of bounds, or have about a five second pause since your last link. there cannot be mistakes. speed runs contain no mistakes. though complete perfection is not required, dustforce is unforgiving to even the smallest mistake. finishing a long level from beginning to end, allowed only stylistic mistakes, puts dustforce above a precision platformer to a speed run simulator.

dustforce isn’t the first platformer to demand perfection. I personally love contra for its sheer display and skill or die gameplay. dustforce’s pacifist aura and dedication to a track indeed separate it from any other perfection platformer, but what is most important is dustforce’s fluidity and sense of speed. though in plain movement it is slower than a mario game, a speed run never stops and dustforce doesn’t want you to stop. borrowing two key elements from other very fluid series - mega man X’s dash and modern sonic’s magnetlike fast-fall - and adding their own radical innovations with air dashing, wall runs, and jump refreshes, dustforce has constant varied movement. the combinations and radical changes in input keep you more than engaged, with the coolness of each character’s movement drilling in your performance. the rhythm, intensity, and constant movement translate to feeling unstoppable speed. dustforce’s core is an incredible renovation of tried mechanics with unbelievable vision in its additions. it has its idyllic goal of speed running and it refused accepted conditions. it contributes altogether on its own making both its direction and its core individual and fantastic.

dustforce has a special presentation with a unique goal and altogether new gameplay, so I would be skeptic to ask: how are the levels? by my language, well, this is pretty easy to anticipate. dustforce’s levels are masterful. they allow for all kinds of different and often new naturalizations, realizations, and combinations of their gameplay. the tracks have clear and differing focuses, requiring techniques, hopefully building your repertoire while it remixes its challenges, playing on your expectations. there are huge clearings to cross, towers to climb, ceilings and floors to repel, narrow spiked corridors to squeeze through, enemies to chain your airtime, small platforms to caustically land on, expansive hills to slide through, beautiful spirals to loop around. dustforce isn’t just a very personal and unique idea, it’s a masterpiece of level design. I have qualms for the lack of linear pacing, there isn’t a way to know how difficult a level is going to be, but that’s a very small criticism, and the game still builds from easy stages to hard stages, it’s just done in blocks.

plain to say, combat is not dustforce’s strong suit, and it feels relatively forced. so it is with an absolute lack of understanding that there are four small and constrained levels dedicated to fighting masses of around twenty enemies. to compensate for keyboard controls, for better and worse, dustforce ques moves. when platforming, it gives the game a sort of rhythmic and planned feel based on anticipation and expectation. in the heat of combat, it is awkward. you’ll find yourself locked into quick strikes and unable to dodge obvious enemy attacks, which is frustrating and unrewarding.

another actually affecting flaw is how much singular input influences the character. slight adjustments are impossible. this again compensates for the difficulty to make smalls presses on a keyboard, however it removes from dustforce’s most important aspect: its fluidity. an obvious expression of this is a single block-wide hole with ground on either side of it. pressing right or left will walk over the hole and onto the terrain on the other side. there is no possible way to enter the hole from the ground, you must jump and make the adjustment. yet even if there is slightly more control in the air, it still involves much too large movements, and makes landing on small blocks or falling down in a specific direction imprecise and very much out of your own control, which is somewhat of a deathblow. the hideout is an infamous stage that brings this flaw to light but also serves as a great way to learn how to make the flaw work for you. the keyboard-tailored control is impossible to ignore, and while it is a noble effort, it sadly stains a perfect formula.

dustforce is performance art. the fluidity feels like a dance. the speed feels like superimposed mastery. unlike a rhythm game, there is pure and awesome actualized design depth existing in-addition to the performance. unlike a perfection platformer, dustforce is rarely stressful, instead being meditative, being conductive, being pointed, being beautiful. it doesn’t demand perfection, it encourages it. as dustforce opens up, grows and evolves, so do you as the player. it shows that difficulty can be symbiotic to achieve fully wholesome results. dustforce isn’t do or die. it’s be or don’t be.",1391401825,1431890745,True,34,0,0.752717256546020508,1,True,False,False,False,

But if you look past the difficulty you'll find a life consuming challenge, an amazing soundtrack and endless amounts of content provided by the level editor (over 1000 custom levels atm). 
The learning curve is massive which may not be appealing to some people but that's the thing keeps me playing after 800+ hours. I'm pretty sure that I'm capable but haven't gotten what's called SS score on the last level so I'm technically not even done yet.
The level design is amazing and blends perfectly with the soundtrack. And the best part of the game: the leaderboards. Every level (including custom maps) have a leaderboard for the best SS time (cleared everything in the level) and the fastest time just to finish. And every run has intant replay so you can see how the best player does or how the worst player doesn't :P
Many may compare Dustforce to Super Meat Boy but I would disagree mostly because of the controls but also because of the fact that dustforce has some brawler elements. At first glance you may feel that dustforce has floaty controls where meat boy feels more slick but dustforce's ""floaty"" controls imo Allows for more precise maneuvering. A thing to mention on controls is that I recommend using a keyboard or a controller with a good D-pad (instantly ruling out 360 controller) like PS3 or 4. You could use analog sticks... but you're gonna have a bad time if you do that.

If you can enjoy the precision and timing involved in such endeavors you won't be disappointed. If you enjoy watching other players' speedruns you won't be disappointed (and in a sense, this is your reward for at least finishing a level).

I think Dustforce stands out in the design more than actual gameplay (you can get a similar challenge from e.g., Super Meat Boy). The game is distilled in the art design, character design, and level design. That's not to say it's sparse, the levels are often beautiful, but there is very little that doesn't directly serve the game. There's very little narrative. There's not a lot of moving parts and gimmicks. It's simply: here's an obstacle course, find the shortest course and execute perfectly (with a few exceptions for arena stages; here's a room full of enemies, flawlessly defeat them).

The soundtrack to the game is excellent, and one of my all time favorites. Definitely check out the composer's web page.

This is a game for all ages and abilities. I often play this with my 2.5 year-old son. He likes to watch the colorful characters run around cleaning and making the animals and people happy. In the hubs he will just make the people sweep and jump around and narrate the action. He likes the music, too. Older kids will be able to finish a lot of the levels and have fun doing it. Parents might be interested to know there's next to no violence in single player, since the sweeping ""attacks"" are really cleaning off the inhabitants of the stages and they are largely greatful for it. 

The biggest drawback to me, is that progression is entirely linked to perfecting skills. Most of you will eventually reach a plateau where you've unlocked every level you can and you're stuck trying endlessly to improve your times and combos on the hardest levels. There's no ""grind"" to ""brute force"" your way forward, you either get good or accept defeat. Judging from the global achievement (there's only one) stats, around 90% of players will not unlock the highest levels. Less than 1% have perfected every level. You can't see everything even as just a tourist.

In most platformers, there are usually a few different ways to approach problems. In Dustforce, however, you are forced into a single kind of ""perfect run"" to progress normally through the game. You can complete stages without these perfect runs, but by doing so, you lock yourself out of so many stages. Perfection is demanded of you in this game.

I'm the kind of person that really enjoys a challenge, but the level of timing, reaction, knowledge, and control demanded of the player is so insane that I made it about 75% of the game before finally stopping to retain my sanity.

But sometimes the game feels incredibly inconsistent, and I know that's only because the timing on everything in this game is on a hair-trigger.

Jokes aside, what originally attracted to me to Dustforce was a feeling that something was missing from Super Meat Boy, something that the game didn't seem to quite capture or address. It was difficult, but in a way that let me put it down and step away from it, knowing I could always come back at a later date and defeat it. The music was good, but I don't know that I could hum a tune from it right now. The level design was well thought out, but often times only allowed for one method of play.

Dustforce takes every one of these (admittedly small) complaints and addresses them: the technical skills required to beat some of the levels that ensure you can't set it down and come back to it without having to remaster things, the decision to design the game from the get-go with speed-running in mind, and a soundtrack that is as catchy as it is lovely...the list goes on and on.

Without gushing on for too long about it, I recommend Dustforce as highly as I can recommend anything, provided that you know what you want in a platformer. This game will be hard and it will be unforgiving, assuming you attempt to play it at the highest level. The level design will keep pulling you back in, making you wonder if you could have shaved off a second or two by doing this loop slightly differently.

Worlds are only thematic variations, repeating the same kind of level structure over and over with no unique mechanics between them, while the characters themselves all play pretty much the same, with some minor tweaks from one character to another (with some of the more subtle changes not even being hinted in-game).

If that wasn't enough, the game demands ""perfect"" double-S scores for players to be able to make standard progress. Scores that in any other game would exist only as a side challenge to those who truly want to spend their times mastering it. Here, you'll have to clear every single stage flawlessly if you ever hope to see those final levels, and there are MANY stages to be mastered — enough to make one feel like the game overstayed its welcome after only a few hours.

Bottom line is: Dustforce gets old. Fast. It offers almost no variety in its gameplay and the absurd requirement to progress through stages is a cheap way of stepping up the difficulty, which only helps to add to the incessant repetition the player will experience. I cleared one world + a bunch of other stages and saw no point in continuing. It offers no reason to go on beyond getting a good performance on stages, so you can move on to more stages and repeat the process in the exact same way, everytime. I felt like I had already seen all the game had to offer, and that more arrangements of the same stage elements weren't really worth stressing over.

It's a shame, really. Dustforce has tight controls and a unique core theme and aesthetics (though it keeps the same kind of mild/serene atmosphere all the way through. I got bored of it after a while). If it just presented new mechanics for each world and/or character and reduced the overly-demanding difficulty a tad (a double-A ranking requirement to get keys for further stages would be a huge improvement) this review could have been a ""Yes"" instead. The way it is, though, I'd only recommend this game to the most time-attack obsessed players with plenty of time to burn and that wouldn't care much for a more varied and rich experience.

The game is short, simple, and tells the story of four custodial protagonists who attempt to sweep away a world corrupted by dust and filth. The game was released on Steam in January of 2012 and will be pushed to the Playstation 3, Playstation Vita, and Xbox 360 consoles in January of 2014. 

The game consists of roughly 50 levels in which the player has to use a number of acrobatic skills in order to clean up small sections of leaves and defeat filth-covered creatures to score and progress though the level. Some of the skills that the player will have to master to complete each level in an efficient manner are the double jump, wall jump, mid-air dash, and the ability to cling to the walls and ceiling. The player also has the choice of a light or heavy attack with which to defeat the enemies in the levels. The levels themselves are laid out very well and tend to vary from horizontal to vertical design, which pushes the player to master the controls of Dustforce (a game best played with a controller, if possible). The game tracks your progress through each level with the combo meter, which is influence by the player's ability to move through the level and eliminate both enemies and leaf piles in an efficient manner. At the end of each level, the player is ""ranked"" by their abilities to achieve a high combo and how quickly they moved through the stage. The game also comes with a four-player multiplayer system with some typical variants such as Survivor and King of the Hill, along with a level editor that was introduced via patch after the games initial release. 

While it's certainly an interesting way to promote level completion, the biggest problem with Dustforce's ranking system is that in order to access many levels of the game, the player is required to complete each previous level in a near-perfect manner. I found myself running through previous levels over and over just so I could access the next one. This certainly speaks volumes about Dustforce's ambitious gameplay, but also says a lot about how the game is put together. Forcing a player to run through previous levels 10-15 times will often make it feel as if the developers are simply padding out their game. It's a fantastic experience, but it would be a lot better if it were only longer and if it were easier to progress through the game. Also, the acrobatic abilities are hard to master, and it will take a lot of time with a controller in hand in order for an average player to perfect the play style that Dustforce presents. 

However, there are many things about Dustforce that makes it an indie game that you should experience for yourself. The game has a unique art style that is gorgeous to look at, especially when a player is whizzing through a level at top speed. The colors blend together in a fantastic way that makes the game visually stunning. Also, the techno soundtrack was created by lifeformed, and it is nothing short of amazing. The music is stunning, and is some of the best I've ever heard in an indie game. Since it's release, Dustforce has been compared to other indie games, such as Super Meat Boy and N+, and while it shares a similiar style, Dustforce is a game that stands alone. It's innovations seperate it from other games like it, and it's penchant towards speedrunning implies that the developers knew exactly what market Dustforce would do best in. 

Unfortunately, while Dustforce is a fantastic game, it is one that is more difficult than it's predecessors, and to the players that have never experienced fast-paced platforming gameplay, I would have to recommend that they play Super Meat Boy or N+ before this one. Those games are simpler, and typically will be a more casual experience than the one Dustforce provides. That being said, if you have experienced either of those games and hunger for more, then Dustforce is the game for you. Dustforce will impress and, hopefully, amaze you.

Leaves, dust and slime all coat the floors, walls and ceilings of each level and it’s your job to sweep, dust or vacuum it all away.  To do so requires precise, difficult control and levels are designed to be completed with finesse.  The game shines in its difficulty which drives the player to finish each level as quickly and elegantly as possible, striving for an elusive SS Rank.

Dustforce is not a game without some fault, however.  The controller support is limited, requiring some menu fidgeting to get it to work and the d-input controls override the keyboard inputs.  The game also doesn’t do a great job of guiding the player or setting a level curve, despite the door and key mechanic for some of the harder levels.  But really, those are minor gripes.

Despite its minor flaws, I’ve really been enjoying this game.  The beautiful visuals and vibrant music have quite a grip on me.  The animation uses a lot of fluid animation smears and the the music presents a feeling of adventure without being over the top.  It’s very relaxing, which can be very important when dealing with a particularly difficult run.

One of the better mechanics also lies in the replay mechanic.  When looking at the leaderboard, simply click on any of the camera icons (including the one by your own run) to view a replay of that run in its entirety.  This is a cool way to see how your friends compare, how you can improve your own run and what the top players are doing to get such good runs.

In the end, this game is fantastic, and somewhat reminiscent of something like N+ or perhaps even Super Meat Boy.  If you’re into that sort of tough platforming, Dustforce is worth your time and money.  And buy the soundtrack edition; it’ll save you a step later.

To me, this game is a lot like Sonic the Hedgehog with smaller levels and more specific goals. All you really need to do is get to the end of the level and clean the 'boss'. However, to progress you need to meet certain goals: % of the level cleaned and point value, which you get by maintaining a combo for as long as possible.

The graphics are interesting but nothing terribly special- I think it could be best described as artistically minimal. The audio is there, but neither good nor bad. The story... well, a game like this doesn't really need much of a story.

Mechanically the game is pretty solid. There are times when it feels like the controls aren't as tight as they could be, and the objective-based advancement means you find yourself doing many iterations of the same frustrating levels. The game does have controller support, but you'll have to do a lot of rigging to make it work right.

Its an interesting challenge game, but lacks a certain something. It doesn't make it bad, just... not something I play at for long periods. This indie title is still worth playing though, so consider picking it up if it happens to be on sale.

Meat Boy's approach to wall jumping mechanics was very simple, and the challenges were largely about precision.
Dustforce take a much more strict approach. Rather than simply megaman your way up a wall, you can run up it- for a short distance. Then you'll either need a facing wall, or to spend your precious precious second jump, the one you can't get back without landing on solid ground or killing an enemy in midair. You can also run along slopes and ceilings, air dash, and a number of other fancy tricks that look super cool but all add complexity.
The challenges here are not only about precision, but also working out how long you can save that air jump, which direction to hold (or not hold) when you make contact with the wall, or how to get that extra bit of dust up on the ceiling.
Unfortunately, the experience is hurt a little by slightly picky controls and the rather annoying way momentum is handled when you've wall-run up to the edge of a platform (or anything treated as one, whether it has spikes on it or not).

Sweep dust up and make it look awesome while doing so. It's a great concept, beautiful and simplistic art, and has bopping tracks you can't resist dancing to.

It's also one of the better indie-platformers I've played; makes someone like me, who is garbage at platformer, feel good about succeeding.

Just don't risk shift+tabbing out while you're in the middle of a level. I'd do that to reply to someone and sometimes the game would make me redo the entire level from the beginning. That's about the only criticism I have with it. Otherwise, sound, gameplay, and aesthetics are very pleasant.

It's very much playable on a keyboard, but it might be a bit more recommended to play with a controller, though it seemingly lacks any real support for it outside of being able to bind most of the functions to the controller buttons.

The basic concept of the game is janitors cleaning levels in a very ninja-like manner. There's no story or real goal to the game aside from getting perfect ranks in every level in order to unlock the hardest levels in the game, which is why this game is meant for perfectionists. It's also meant for those who want extreme challenges where—on a constant basis—too light a tap or too strong a press of the jump button can mean the failure of a run. The controls and mechanics are all great and feel great when you get them to work the way you want, but as you progress you'll need to put in major dedication into mastering them.

The way you access levels in this game is from an overworld of sorts you run around in where you can pretty much get a handle of the basic controls and mechanics of the game. There are tutorial levels at the very beginning and the rest can only be unlocked if you find them.
Many of the entrances to the actual levels themselves are behind skill walls, like extremely complicated jumps that force you to take advantage of the game's seemingly hidden mechanics. They're kind of like tests and learning experiences to teach you and test you about the many things you can do with the game's physics. The easier they are to access, the easier the levels themselves are most likely and vice versa. If you do something with your character that looks like it can be exploited, it's likely a feature.
Once a level is completed, it is immediately unlocked in an easier-to-access level-select area for when you'd like to try the level again and don't want to go all the way to the place you found the door at.
The difficulty in the game is never artificial, at least not on the first attempts. Everything is skill based and the levels can get somewhat lengthy. They start off simple but as you find more levels behind more difficult obstacles, just practicing them can get mind numbing.

Due to how difficult the game eventually gets, you'll be spending hours upon hours doing the same things over & over again just so you can get that perfect rank. There are even leaderboards and replays so you can see how the fastest people got through a level, though they're only unlocked when you actually beat said specific level for the first time. There's no point to just beating anything in this game with ranks that aren't perfect except maybe for the hardest, longest one, which is the most excrutiating to even beat once.
This is a game for those who want nothing but platforming levels that test skill. The idea of janitors cleaning things is just there for novelty purposes. There's no plot or an ending even when you finally beat the last, difficult levels; not even perfecting [i]those[/i] give an ending, so the only real replay value is in the desire to improve. It's all legitimate fun until it starts to become a game about being a hardcore platforming perfectionist for dozens of hours.",1352951144,1542128577,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,

It's not very hard to get through a level on it's own typically but what you're really after is to get a S rank for both mainting a long combo and getting every piece of trash. As long as your attacking something or cleaning something you can maintain the combo but if you fail and lose it then you probably won't get that S rank. 

There's 4 different areas; a  forest, mansion, city and a labratory. They all have the same rules at play but some have a few different things between them. Initally you only have access to levels that don't have a key required but then you'll have levels that require a bronze, silver or gold key So you have to keep doing well to get to the harder levels. There are some techniques to learn to help you go through levels.

The music is wonderful and varied. I would highly recommend getting the soundtrack.  The calm nature of it helps reduce frustration of failure. It also helps that the graphics are nice to look at and that you can retry a level very quickly.

Last year it was Jamestown for me, this year it might well be Dustforce.

This is a great looking, acrobatic/ninja-rific platformer with a chilled out electronic score and a nice scaling difficultly level.  Imagine Meatboy, but way less frustrating and soul-crushingly difficult, plus more move variety, and rewarding combat. (!)

While levels can be beat without necessarily being an ace player, for me there's a strong, strong ""I know I can do better"" urge after completing a run, so there's a lot of value here if you're a perfectionist.  And the game's beautiful graphics, balletic animations and excellent level design always reward me for coming back to previous challenges.

Lastly, the ability to watch replays of the top players is also an excellent addition, both to help you see how others solved tricky spots and to help you improve your game.

This is a real gem, grab it if you like platformers with style!

EDIT: I've enjoyed my time with Dust Force, but unforunately I feel like I've hit the skill ceiling.  I've gotten to a point in the levels where I'm just not good enough to progress further, and don't think it's worth my entertainment time to put in the hours to get better.

It's basically Super Meat Boy with some sort of janitors as main characters. You defeat enemies by slamming them with your broom while running/jumping/gliding/sliding around the level (Meat Boy style !) sweeping the leaves that lay around. You get scored for speed and effectiveness and it's actually extremely difficult. Especially if you want to earn S ranks for every level.

The thing is... the controls just don't feel right. Controllers aren't automatically recognized and configured so you have to do that yourself. A controller definitely works better than a keyboard, I can tell you that, but if you don't know how to properly set it up it's still really hard to play.
I did finish Super Meat Boy, but I won't be able to finish this until they succesfully implement controller functionality without the player having to mess around with it.
Controller issues aside, this is a great game that just needs to be experienced.

N with Donkey Kong Country 2 music.
Indie platformer (THE PRESSES HAVE BEEN HALTED) about passing over specific spots and adminstering parental-style broom violence to enemies (who are sometimes tiny animals, you jerk.) No plot to follow. You have to 'SS' perfect each level to progress entirely, so you'll need more dedication than your megamans.

The thing I enjoyed the most, is due to the generally sharp mechancis, there can be room to do suave recoveries. Lower ranked ss replays on the (well-implemented) leaderboards have been more mind-boggling because of this. 

However, there's many places that require pixel perfect actions (or some tricks, which are admittedly fun to figure out,) and the level designer has a habit of placing a clusterfuck of awkward near the end of a level. Slip up, and you're forced to restart. I spent 5 hours on one.
But damn if that music doesn't keep you going.

I like the thrill of shooting monsters and solving sliding puzzles, I relish exploring the world and having adventures in it, I love seeing my cities and theme parks grow because I made them just so. Crawling through dungeons, directing your minions strategically to best your foe, sneaking around conspiracy theory-laden faculties – video games are a rich medium with terrific entries in all kinds of experience. And even though I don’t particularly enjoy role-playing games, I can see why it’s pleasing to build and personalize a character of your making and vanquish your enemies. Even in a world with such a varied library of enterprises, there’s a single holy grail for me: finesse.

Let’s use my favorite game of 2012, Dustforce, to illustrate. Dustforce is a platformer made Hitbox Team, a group of four people. It stars four janitors (the eponymous “Dustforce”) who are put up against stages filled with leaves, rubbish, slime, and other waste that they can aptly clean up by swinging their broom (which involves walking over it). They’re not your average grumpy, unshaven, high school brutes though – they’re agile acrobats who can climb walls, hang on ceilings and traverse the most dangerous of environments. However, it’s not the dangerous environments that are the main objective of the game (though they will certainly test you, especially later), it’s finishing the stages completely clean – and herein lies the game’s greatest strength. The game measures two things, and rates you, at the end of the stage, accordingly: completion and finesse. Completion is the percentage of dust you cleaned up and enemies you defeated. Finesse is how often you lost your combo, preferably never – it’s a meter at the bottom of the screen that tracks how long it has been since you last dutifully scraped the last specks off the floor, and you lose it after a given amount of time. These two combined make for a drive to hone your abilities and learn every stage so that you sweep through it both smoothly and flawlessly.

The levels themselves are created in such a way that doing it right will give you a great flow through it, never really slowing down or losing a beat, making for a great sense of satisfaction when you finish them thoroughly. Not only that, but the stages gently go from very easy but enjoyable to an excruciating but very gratifying hard. If you happen to run into the later stages when you’re still a rookie cleaner, they will seem daunting to you, almost impossible. When you come back later, however, you suddenly realize how it’s done, and after a few runs, you will be able to beat that which looked to be so insurmountable to you earlier. It’s this “I can’t believe I did that” feeling, this ascendancy, that is so bliss. And it’s never because you upgraded your fanciful armor at a merchant, or upgraded your cannon with gems, it’s just you. You, physically, became more dexterous and skilled at this game. Your character didn’t gain any new abilities, he didn’t become stronger, you did. The realization of this is an amazing feeling, because it’s so fair – you put time into this, and you reaped the benefits by knocking out the obstacles in ways you earlier never thought possible.

Reinforcing this sentiment in Dustforce is the sleek graphic style, emphasizing the player’s action through a simple, but well animated, cel shaded style which make the janitors a joy to look at while they bounce through the environment. These environments, too, look great – while clearly being what they are (a city, a mountainous forest, a laboratory, and a crumbling mansion) they are presented in stylish, sometimes almost surreal ways, making for an aestethically pleasing journey through them. Also accompanying these is a terrific soundtrack, which never gets monotonous or annoying, even if you spend hours perfecting those later levels. It’s these elements that make mastering Dustforce a real joy, and here’s hoping many more follow its ways.",1327180859,1479992900,True,3,0,0.546775162220001221,0,True,False,False,False,

Think Super Meatboy with the same challenging levels and tight controls, but a more zen-enducing aroma and style. You will die a ton trying to get SS ranks on a few levels, but unlike Meat Boy you won't curse every time. 

The game also reminds me a lot of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (the underrated 2-D game for GCN using the Bongos) in a really good way: The goal is to keep a combo through the entire level by moving along every single line of dust or beating down an enemy. If those two objectives are left undone for more than 5 seconds or you are hurt, you lose the combo.

This game FEELS amazing. With gorgeously stylized visuals and amazingly fluid controls, this was one of the best experiences I've had with 2D platformers.

It's very heavy on the competitive aspect focusing on speed running. You get to try the same levels over and over again until you are happy with your performance, then you proceed to submit your score and realize you are in a 4 digits place on the leader board. You then check the first place's replay to see how he\she did it and your jaw drops on the floor refusing to believe that's humanly possible.

It's a very nice game about a very interesting and unusual theme. The animation quality is top notch and the controls are very responsive.

I recommend this game regardless if you are into high score based speed running games or not. It has too many good things about it for you to miss out on it.

It also kind of gives you a very unusual urge to clean up your room in a very speedy manner, so that's deffinitely a plus! :D",1326864624,1390870649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,
