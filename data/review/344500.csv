My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1709682470,1709682470,True,1,0,0.462980329990386963,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Developed by Bracket Games, this unique game takes you on a heartwarming journey through the complexities of family relationships, like attending a family reunion filled with laughter, tears, and awkward moments. So, grab your tissues and a box of chocolates, and let's dive into the immersive world of Three Fourths Home.

A Moving Tale of Family Bonds:

The game's narrative follows the life of Kelly, a young woman on a phone call with her family as she drives through a thunderstorm, setting the stage for a deeply human exploration of family dynamics.

The storytelling is as nuanced as a symphony conductor guiding a masterpiece. The game's dialogue and interactions reveal the complex relationships between Kelly and her family, making you feel like a participant in their lives.

An Interactive Phone Call:
The game's unique mechanic of a phone call is a stroke of genius, like chatting with a long-lost friend on a rainy day. As you make choices during the conversation, you'll shape the outcome of the story, much like a choose-your-own-adventure novel.

The phone call is more than just a gameplay element; it's a window into the characters' hearts and minds. You'll find yourself pondering the impact of your words, just like you would in real-life conversations.

Minimalistic Beauty:
Three Fourths Home is a testament to how minimalism can be breathtakingly beautiful, like a single rose standing out in a vast field. The game's simple black and white visuals are complemented by a moody soundtrack, creating an atmosphere that's as immersive as a dream.

The lack of flashy graphics allows the narrative to take center stage, like a delicate flower blooming in a sea of distractions. It's a reminder that games can be powerful storytelling tools, even without photorealistic graphics.

A Slice of Life:
The game's narrative explores the ordinary moments in life, like snapshots in a family photo album. It's a refreshing departure from the epic battles and grand adventures often found in games, reminding us that the little moments matter too.

Through its intimate exploration of mundane events, Three Fourths Home captures the essence of the human experience. It's like a warm hug from a loved one, reminding you of the beauty in the everyday.

Humor in the Storm:
Amidst the stormy emotions, Three Fourths Home weaves humor into its narrative, like a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. The moments of levity add a touch of warmth and authenticity, making the characters feel like old friends.

The game's witty dialogue and clever observations will leave you chuckling, like sharing inside jokes with your closest companions. It's a reminder that even in difficult times, laughter can be a beacon of light.

An Emotional Resonance:
Three Fourths Home is more than just a game; it's an emotional experience that lingers in your heart long after the credits roll. It's like a soul-stirring melody that echoes through your thoughts, prompting self-reflection.

The game's honest portrayal of family dynamics will strike a chord with players, like a heartfelt ballad that speaks to the depths of the human soul. It's an invitation to explore our own family relationships and cherish the connections we hold dear.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Three Fourths Home is a captivating and emotionally charged experience that immerses you in the intimate world of family relationships. With its unique storytelling, interactive phone call mechanic, and minimalist beauty, it's a game that leaves a lasting impression like a cherished memory.",1690310385,1690310385,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I think the first main thing is visual presentation and inference; It's very simple and wonderful to look at from an aesthetic point of view, but the visual layout was a bit jarring and unfocused, the illusion of player agency didn't work for me (for example, I never saw the need to control driving the car when it doesn't add anything to the overall crux of the game, it just felt like an unnecessarily feature to make the player feel like they were, no pun intended, steering the story along). I didn't mind the textual-layout in some moments, but in other moments, I found it was hard to read and follow and would actually click to continue without realising their was still text I had missed (primarily on the right side of the screen, Kelly's text); this wasn't a major issue, as I don't think I ended up missing anything, but it would have been nice to allow for a user-friendly layout. 
That said, these minor little nick-picky issues aside, the strength lies in it's writing, and I think especially the way it was able to convey so much distant and varied personalities among it's three text-only characters. It's narrative ambiguity might put off some, but I felt there was enough context to grasp your own satisfying conclusions. The maingame length might put off some people (it's not overly long) but I think the gratifying added epilogue gives you more dept that than might appear lacking in the main game to make up for it.
I would say this is worth the AU $8, if you're looking for a beautiful bittersweet storytelling that can you get through in an hour. A solid job, just which maybe there were some accessibility options to adjust the visual presentation.",1689595578,1689595578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

acredito que não.

Em outra parte somos uma sombra andando em meio a neve e texturas de sombra parecida das árvores; e ai a palheta de textos combina melhor; porém a personagem as vezes fica perdida por termos que faze-la caminhar.

Ésta consiste simplemente en acelerar y en elegir entre varias respuestas para encauzar la conversación en una u otra dirección. Sin embargo, no es por esto por lo que no lo recomiendo, ya que, siempre y cuando lo que cuenten sea interesante o produzca algún tipo de emoción, no tengo nada en contra de este tipo de juegos. Pero, al menos en mi caso, la historia de éste me ha parecido plana, predecible y, en definitiva, sin nada que hiciera que me enganchase.

En cuanto a lo artístico, gráficamente es bastante simple, con unos diseños muy pobres y, para empeorar las cosas, tiene una gama de colores que dificulta la lectura en el juego principal (lo cual tiene poco o ningún sentido siendo un ""juego de leer""). En contraste, la banda sonora es notable. Por otro lado, la duración es bastante exigua, ronda la hora u hora y media.

No recomendado.

The game narates a story between the protagonist (Kelly) and her family experiencing tornado's. You are driving on your way to home while talking on the phone with them and that's all I will tell without going in to too much detail.

The controls felt unnecessary. The idea of holding the right button to drive for the story to continue feel a little bit clunky at times and the amount of time it takes before you can skip text is based on the size of the textblock. This is fine, but if you're an avid reader and read quite fast it can be annoying at times.

The story itself wasn't bad, but it felt really hollow. At the same time, you try and make exciting footage of two people calling each other. But you either like it or don't

The music and atmosphere is great though. The sound of the rain and everything that comes with it is just really nice and I really appreciated that.


Can I recommend this game? Well if you want a small story which doesn't really engage you too much, yeah sure. 
But were you looking for a huge story with options that feel like they matter, you might want to look elsewhere.

Three Fourths Home is a tale about a woman named Kelly, who is estranged from her struggling family living in rural Nebraska. Her mom's jobless, her dad is disabled due to a workplace accident and drinking heavily to medicate his PTSD, her brother is a talented writer but has an unspecified mental disorder (I personally suspect it's autism of some stripe), and Kelly herself is a college dropout estranged from her friends with no self-confidence (and possibly depression). The stress mounts over the course of a phone call as Kelly struggles to drive home in the middle of a tornado warning. It's a bittersweet story, made all the worse because you really don't know if Kelly's family survives or not. There's a lot of regret, a lot of feels, and a lot of difficult subject matter in this one.

The game is not so much a game, except that you have to press space to choose dialogue options, and you have to hold down D or right arrow to keep driving (which I think many players will get annoyed with). The epilogue lets you walk back and forth though. There's not much game to this game, it's more of an interactive experience and an art piece with some nice little short stories, good music, and a slice from the life of a very typical person and their estranged, struggling family. I can't recommend this to everyone for that reason. It's just not the typical game. It's a lot more like A Bird Story than anything else. Now, I got this as part of a bundle of keys, and really only played it for the cheevos. It didn't impact me super hard, but it did for several reasons personally hit close to home. I suspect others will find it a lot more emotionally gut-wrenching than me though - I'm just not easily moved to tears by sad stories that are trying to be sad on purpose.

IMHO this experience should be free to play, not sold. But I do understand the developers need to make money, and I'd recommend this for anyone who likes to cheevo-hunt or anyone who likes artistic casual experiences like this.

You would need around 3-4 hours to reveal every aspect of the Story. Neither finishing the ""main game"" nor finishing ""the epilogue"" would count as 'finished'. To unravel the complete story and realising what all of this Story is about would have you read short-stories of Ben and looking at photographs of Kelly and doing every little thing this game offers you to explore. 

This complete game is a form of art. Again, if you do not like this kind of game, do not play it. 

All of that said, I liked how the game was made. That everything you could do, click, read or see in this game completes the Story

The only game mechanic it has is holding down the button to drive forward.

I chose the ""nice"" options, and I ended up feeling ambivalent about the ending. I didn't have much of a connection to Kelly or her family, and as someone that was born and raised in the Midwest there's really only one way your day can go when a sudden and severe storm system moves in, so I didn't get the ""punch"" from the ending that other people mention. There's not much motivation for me to go back and go through the other options since I found the first read through tedious enough to begin with.

The other parts of the main game are trying to decide if there's anything worth looking at in the scenery, and quietly interpreting Ben's story how ever you think is correct given everything you've learned from the dialogue up until now and just carrying that with you, or going online to ponder about it with others. The epilogue is apparently where the dialogue branches actually take you to different endings, but I'm not interested enough to read it. 

I suppose it's worth the 5 bucks if you look at it as a short story because overall the writing is pretty good and if you play through the epilogue you'll put some decent time in.

В центре проекта стоит диалог между четырьмя персонажами - членами семьи Мейерсов - и с литературной точки зрения они выполнены на весьма высоком уровне, однако не стоит ожидать от TFH сюжетных откровений: это довольно мрачная камерная зарисовка об отношениях, которые рушатся, времени, которого не вернуть, и людях, которых оно меняет.

Спустя несколько лет обучения в городском университете главная героиня возвращается домой, в провинцию, и, управляя машиной, по очереди ведет телефонный разговор с матерью, отцом и младшим братом. В этих диалогах раскрываются характеры героев сравнительно короткой истории о ""современной несчастливой семье"", в которой сеттинг лишь играет роль метафоры, а номинальный сюжет оказывается не так важен, как специфика отношений между его персонажами. Даже абстрактная концовка TFH (которую можно интерпретировать несколькими способами, включая иносказательный) не ставит точку в затянувшейся, мучительно тоскливой, но настолько же тревожной бытовой драме, которую скрывает под собой крыша неспокойного дома семейства Майерсов, три четверти которого оказываются не готовы к возвращению некогда отколовшейся четвертой ""части"".

Главным недостатком проекта с точки зрения любителей ""настоящих игр"" является слабая интерактивность, которая ограничивается возможностью выбора вариантов ответа в диалогах и необходимостью держать зажатой кнопку, чтобы машина героини ехала вперед. Действительно, рассказывать о TFH как об экстравагантной электронной книге гораздо приятнее, чем как об ""игровом опыте"" - но если вам нравятся лирические бытовые истории без приторного хэппи-энда, она стоит прочтения.

Вердикт: интерактивный сценарий для - без иронии - пронзительной драматической пьесы на полтора часа, с отличной музыкой и рудиментарным геймплейным элементом из одной кнопки.

Three Fourths Home does actually hit a bit close to home; not too much but there's still the relatable story of moving away from your parents, temporarily coming back and knowing how things has changed while you're gone. Arguing with your parents over things that in the long run might not matter. 

It's one of those games of its time, back in the mid-2010s when the genre of experimental games were huge; for example Kentucky Route Zero and other ""mechanic-less"" games. There's not much to this game other than the story. But beyond that, there's also the feeling of actually driving through this storm; not knowing when you'll arrive to your destination. If you dig deeper, there's something in that metaphor.

The game is shorter than the 2 hours I spent in-game, this is the time if you want to get all the achivements. In total I'd say the game takes around an hour to finish if not less.

It revolves around a woman who is having a phone conservation with their family while driving home during a tornado warning. You have to use the arrow key to drive and the conservation stops when you stop driving so you have to keep moving as well as choosing responses. You start to get a sense of why she was out wondering around old family property and what issues the family is going through. The dialogue is some of the best I have seen in a visual novel and the background story is well done. The atmosphere of rain and tornado sirens going off while driving really set a good mood. The soundtrack over the credits was also well matched. There were some dialogue choices that were in brackets and I couldn’t tell if they were supposed to be an inner monologue; sarcasm; or something else. They still got a response from whoever I was talking to so I don’t think inner monologue fit but the responses were always hostile or prompted a negative response. It didn’t seem to fit with the other parts of the conservation. There is an epilogue to play when done with the main game but it wasn’t as well done as the main game. It sheds light on some of the main characters life issues but just failed to hold my interest as much. The text was pretty hard to read at first but luckily I noticed that there was an option to switch to a more bold font which solved that issue for me.

	I played Three Fourths Home on Linux. It never crashed on me. It uses the Unity engine. There is one graphics setting as well as an AA toggle. The games used up 2334MB of disk space. I didn’t notice any spelling errors. There is a manual save option you can use at any time but there is only one save slot so you will overwrite the save each time. Alt-Tab didn’t work. 

VRAM Used: 802-971MB
CPU Usage: 1-4%
RAM Usage: 2.8-2.9GB

	Overall I would recommend the game to fans of visual novels. It tries to set itself apart in terms of content and game play and succeeds. It’s warts are minor and didn’t hurt the experience. I paid $2.33 CAD for the game and it was well worth it for that. The full price of $5.49 CAD is also a decent fit for it although that’s about the maximum I would pay. I finished the main game and epilogue in 58 minutes.

My Score: 7/10

With that said, the game might not be for everyone; it is pretty much all about the dialogue, with few substantial changes to the environment and few controls (plus the fact that they really should've made a toggle option for driving - you can only hold D for so long). However, if you allow yourself to take in the story, to explore the different options in the dialogue tree and learn about the family, it turns out to be a really gripping tale with some great detailing. The way the backgrounds follows the story (your character says ""I'm at the highschool"" and it appears in the background, for instance) is also beautiful and is very much served by the scaled down aesthetic, as it really is noticable when something appears.

And then we have the Epilogue, which is a must-play when you've finished the game. While the main game has the plot and the overall story interactions, this is where the heart of the game really lies - at least in my opinion. It hits every beat supremely well and illustrates the main character's feelings in a way that is both artistic and yet very clear (at least for someone who has gone through similar things).

TLDR: Kind of like a really boring visual novel without proper art. Or a sidescroll flash grade walking simulator with illusion of choice in dialogue options.

Vaguely confusing narrative about multiple people having a conference call while you drive a car. Mostly family members and all conversations are mostly of the mundane variety. Dialogue options are present but simple and boil down to sassy or good girl reponses and you often get funnelled into your decision making about things like choosing whom you're gonna call to socialize while you are free to make up if you scored your job for your interview. It is jarring and the forced narrative is a little in your face. It is soon over however with an abrupt ending which is meant to add contrast and gravity to the mundane events that just transpired. But really, it is unlikely that it will have given the low amount of emotional connection a normal human being is likely to be able to form through the thin veil of suspension of disbelief created by the boring character banter. The visuals are downed in white, and the audio consisted mostly of my case fans ramping up due to bad optimization with very sparse notes or rain sound effects, or a siren sound to create a mood. The lack of puzzles and the fact that you hold one button while trying to skip dialogue reminds me of very boring visual novels.",1507711726,1509669711,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I love it, whenever whatever I'm reading is well written. Fortunately, that's the case with this piece of literature (not always I have this luck with ""visual novels""). 

Yeah, this is not a game. It's barely audiovisual. There's no voice acting and there's only music if you remember to turn the radio on (I did it only after a while; the other controls are inconsequential). The scenery is monotonous [spoiler](maybe it's like that in Nebraska; I've met a guy from Nebraska once when I was studying in California and he was surprised that a foreigner knew about its existence: he told me that was not the case with a lot of Americans; I didn't tell him I only knew the word because of a Bruce Springsteen record, but I digress)[/spoiler] and you don't need to look at it anyway, because nothing unusual happens and your eyes will be busy reading. 

I'm not going to summarize the plot, but it's very well conveyed through dialogue only, without hand holding; even with a few things open for interpretation, there's really no mystery here. Character development is also great. Although there are branches of dialogue, there's no choice and consequence, no multiple endings, no replayability (you'll only need to play the epilogue again if you want the 2 last achievements; it's a very easy one to 100%). It's very short (2 hours tops), but it doesn't feel lacking. The extras are a nice addition: the music is very good, as the short stories. 

The only annoying things are the need to keep a button pressed for the main game to go forward (the epilogue corrects that) and the general slowness, including the menus . But they're only a small nuisance, what matters here is the story.

And then you talk to your mother, father and brother on the phone by selecting various answers to some of the most trivial questions you can imagine about being a rural family living somewhere with more corn that sense. I just looked it up. It's Nebraska. 

You can call it a visual novel or interactive fiction if you want. You might even call it art - but then again everything can be art, thanks to Piero Manzoni who decided to shit in cans and call that ""art"" so maybe that’s not such a stamp of quality any more. 

I don’t mind games that have a strong narrative or something important to tell or teach me. God knows I could stand to learn a thing or two, but at least make the narrative interesting, as simply having a narrative in a game isn’t a quality unto itself. Heck, calling a sex line could be called having a narrative and I’d much rather experience that. 

So a rather trivial story and some really really poor design choices (just make the damn car go already) kinda put this one in the grave for me.

It's storming, and you are driving your car through the Nebraska landscape on the way home while having a conversation on the cell phone w/ your parents and brother (conversation in text on the screen). As you drive through the storm you get to know the family's problems and perhaps identify w/ a young adult who's trying to strike out in life for the first time. 

The Extended Edition added some new elements to the game, such as the epilogue, an extra scene and the new save system. Overall a good addition to the main game itself, and the epilogue also sheds some light to the main character's past.

Note, this is not a game as much as it is a multimedia presentation w/ a few user interface controls. It has a good story, the art design is nice, and the visuals and sounds create a nice atmosphere, but there's not a lot beyond that. If this story appeals to you go for it, but understand there's not really gameplay as much as reading the story and watching how the visuals interact w/ the story that's happening. It's targeted to a specific audience. For me, it is art, but it lacks some depth either in the gameplay and plot. 

The gameplay is fairly simple, all you have to do is simply holding down the Right Trigger button to drive/walk forward (or the right directional key on the keyboard) and then selecting options in order to take part in a telephone conversation. There is not much to do beside that, and I have to wonder why they'd bother adding the button for the wiper, also for the horn. Through the entire time I was driving really slow, afraid I might hit something on the road but nothing really happens.

The gameplay is basically holding down the D button to drive, and clicking on dialogue options. That's really it. The entire game is driving and talking.

It is certainly a short game; my playtime as shown here on Steam includes some time after I finished the story and extras where I let the game sit open in order to get the ""Listen to the Radio"" achievement.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the game - yes, the gameplay is minimal, but the way you get to know the characters through your dialogue choices is well paced and ratchets up the tension as the story builds up to its conclusion. 

I haven't done a second playthrough as of yet - I've certainly thought back about whether I'd make some choices differently as the protagonist, and I can see myself doing a couple of playthroughs in order to get some different reactions and bits of information from the other family members. So while the game's features in the store description don't exactly scream ""replayability,"" I think there's some added value if you enjoyed the story the first time around and want to see what more there is to learn. Playing the epilogue and reading Ben's stories definitely added to the experience; it's easy to identify with the protagonist from the get-go but you really get a deeper understanding of her motivations the more you interact with the game.

The base game is currently 66% off as part of the 2016 Summer Sale; if you like story-driven games with very simple dialogue-based gameplay, I'd say it's definitely worth it - I bought it at a smaller discount and feel like I've got my money's worth.

The conversation itself feels mostly authentic, but I was slightly distracted by the fact that the mother keeps simulataneously telling your character to be careful driving in the bad weather, but refusing to get off of the phone.  That is a minor complaint, but the bigger problem is that the story doesn't really go anywhere.

This game offers a nice twist to the visual novel genre. The story didn't wow me but the gameplay and graphics compelled me enough to enjoy it! You play as Kelly, a girl moving back home to fulfil family obligations. The entire game takes place on the road traversing through 20 miles of storm ridden farmland on the phone. Smart!

You must drive Kelly down the road to trigger the story which takes place via phone conversation with her mom. The story unfolds and concludes in 20-30 minutes which was enough for me. Bonus content unlocks in the form of a playable epilogue. After playing; $5 seems fair based on the length and story graphical intrigue.

Fun side note: ""20"" seems to be the magic number!!
-Kelly is in her ""20's""
-Game takes place over ""20"" Miles
-Game takes ""20"" something minutes to complete
-Game was released on March ""20th""
- Each Achievement accounts for ""20%"" 1/5

3/4 Home is an innovative text-adventure with very simplified b/w graphics. You are a daughter on a longride by car to Minnesota and phoned your Mom. The whole journey you stay in a neverending dialog between her and rest of family. The landscape is changing in the background until the phone connection breaks shortly before the end in a snow blizzard. Now you are waiting for the right bus to take the last leap to home (epilogue). The conversation with your Mom comes to a climax talking out all of your problems.
Technically this game is a cheap Unity production. The graphics look horrible and the game concept to drive the longway and keep on talking is poor. I can just praise the richness of dialogues which seem very realistic. But then you realize the raindrops are going through the text and if your car stops also the background sirens stop (wtf?). The decision matrix concentrates just on the epilogue. It's not easy to catch the right bus (which is allegedly 404).

 The visuals are actually interesting even if they are a little static and the sound design is spot-on, placing you in a car ride during a rain storm but it's actually the narrative that was the biggest let down of the game. The subject of having to return from school, back to a small town and back to living with your parents is a story that's becoming more and more real for a lot of people and something video games haven't really tackled. And the portrayal of this feels honest. There's a contrained politeness from the main character when she's talking to her mom and dad but that's where it ends. The story's told through a series of phone calls between the main character and her family but it feels limited and constrained.

[h1] Full Review [/h1]
[i]TL;DR at bottom![/i] 

[b]Story:[/b] It can develop into whatever you wish it to, the different thinks you can say change other people's answers drastically.
[b]Graphics:[/b] The well done minimalistic design adds to the atmosphere and makes it easy to focus on what's important: the story.
[b]Music:[/b] It's delightful! You can play it while riding through the storm (and I strongly recommend you do) and it's sure to make your ride even more interesting.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b] This is a game for casual players. People hoping for gunshots, gore or utter action will bore themselves easily. A game such as this is made to be appreciated by people who are into the genre and who have the patience to make choices and read text. This game is not for everyone, like all games aren't. With that in mind, I strongly recommend it - but with the prospect of not doing so for everyone.

[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]
Three Fourths Home is a game about its characters. It's minimalistic in regards of appearance, but deep when considering thoughts, actions and outcomes. It is much like real life, when you can decide to pry, dwell or avoid certain situations and topics.

To begin, I loved the art style, sound effects, music and subtly that the game brought when I first booted it up and started playing.

However, the game felt like reading someones short-story fiction they submitted to a group critique for an undergrad advanced writing course. I'm not much a fan of visual novels, it's not my cup of tea. This one in particular had some beautiful visual elements that matched where you were in reading the dialogue that added to the mood and really played on your emotions. But, after a while the game just really felt like it was dragging on. 

If you like visual novels and are drawn in by character studies, this is a great game for you. It really is designed well and the visuals are fantastic.

Come into this expecting an experience more like ""Kentucky Route Zero-lite."" If you do, it's worth the entrace fee. We are inventing and defining this medium as we go and I'm enjoying each step along the way. Three Fourths Home being one of them.
This is not a huge powerhouse of narrative exposition, nor is it a ""videogame"" in the classic sense. Steer clear if those are what you are looking for.

Dialogue does not feel stilted or forced and characters are believable. The premise was sound and made me want to call my mom. It was also just the right length for its content and subject matter. My favorite part of the experience would be Ben's stories. Somebody on this team is a decent fiction writer, which feels odd in this day and age.
My least favorite part would be my fingers getting tired/bored from holding ""right"" the whole time. That may have actually been intentional though, as driving for a long time can have the same effect.

If you're interested in this type of thing, don't pass it up. Also, play it in one sitting.",1445665838,1445665838,True,8,0,0.576309382915496826,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Quite simply this is much more about the story than the game. And to me that's not such a bad thing.

The characters are believable, I suppose in part because you get to decide how Kelly should respond and in turn guiding how the other characters repsond. I found myself at times telling her to say what I would say and at other times playing along with the narrative - saying what I think would bring more of the story out for me to hear.

The other part of the believability is how well they're crafted. You don't know their backstory. You get snippets from them. Snippets from other family members. Snippets from Kelly's replies. Enough to make a picture, enough to let your imagination fill in the blanks without thinking the storyteller should have given you more (but wishing they had).

Actually the storytelling is so good I do want more. I want to go back and play it again. Change my answers, try and learn more about everyone. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any spoilers.

So storytelling before gameplay? Yeah that's how this car rolls...through Nebraska...in a storm...but only when holding the buttons down...(play it, you'll see what I mean).

I gotta say, wouldn't you pay such an itty bitty price for an amazingly well crafted and engaging story with believable characters? So why not pay it for a story and game?",1445238743,1445238827,True,11,0,0.602214395999908447,0,False,False,False,False,,,

エピローグを含めクリアまで1時間ほど。全て英語かつ止まって文章を確認できない仕様のため、ある程度の英語力は必要あり。

このゲームをおすすめしない最大の理由は「噛み合っていない」ところにある。
例えばそのシステム。常にクルマを走らせながら会話をしなければならないため、プレイ中はひたすら矢印の右キー or Dキーを押しっぱなしにしなければならない。
選択肢を選ぶ時も、次の文を読む時も。60分間ずっと押さえなければならないのは辛いものがある。
運転している感じを出したかったのは理解できるが、このあたりは1回押すだけで走りっぱなしでよかったのではないか。
またその魅力的なビジュアルも、ノベルゲームの背景となると不向きであり、白い画面に小さい文字（文字サイズは設定で2つから選択可能）が載るので目が痛くなってしまう。
上半分のクルマの様子と、下半分のテキスト欄の、上下がほぼ乖離したゲームプレイは不完全でギクシャクして見える。
携帯電話で喋り続けることは許すにしても、家族内で電話を回す不自然な会話の流れには首をかしげざるを得ない。
選択肢は多いが、それによって物語が変化する様子もない。
（ただし独立したエピローグのみマルチエンディング有り、グッドは1つバッドは複数。ここは面白い）
このように多くの要素が噛み合わず、「なんだかなあ」という思いのままゲームが終わってしまう。

それぞれが問題を抱えながら生きる家族の姿や、自然に変化する風景の空気感など、やりたいことは伝わるし好きになれる部分も多いだけに、そういった噛み合わない部分が余計に目立ってしまうのが惜しい。
この手のジャンルが好きな人間としては、完璧とまではいかなくてもある程度ゲームシステムとストーリーの調和が見られたらそれでオッケーなのだけども、今作はそれが上手くいっていなかった。
もう少し、1時間のボタン押しに応えるストーリーがあれば評価は上がったと思うが、あまりに地味なまま終わりを迎えてしまうので不満が残ってしまう。
（そこが良いという人もいるかもしれないが、個人的には物足りないものだった）
それでも前述したような良いところはあるので、定価では全く勧められないが、気になったらプレイしてみるのもいいかもしれない。
悪いゲームだとは言わないが、良いゲームとも言えない、そんな作品だった。

-remarkable art style

-well-written and emotional story

-great dialogue

-interesting and deep characters

-good pacing, it starts a bit slow but soon things speed up as the weather gets worse

-great soundtrack

-solid sound design

-once you finish the game and epilogue you'll have an Extra section with the whole soundtrack, a few fiction stories written by Kelly's brother and a photo project: they're all very interesting (if you ""complete"" the whole Extras section you'll also be presented with an extra game scene that fleshes out the story)

-provides ample food for thought when played by its target audience


[b]CONS:[/b]

-the lack of voice acting slightly lessens the emotional impact

-short at 45ish minutes for the main game plus 15 for the epilogue

-limited replay value

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487957515

Three Fourths Home was truly an outstanding experience for me, it started out a bit slow but as the minutes went by it was easy to connect with Kelly's problems and fears and here lies the game's greatest strength: through its impressive story and storytelling it not only tells a great tale but will also give you quite a few things to think about in regards to life choices, missed chances and how one deals with family relationships.

Even if you're not looking for some intellectual nourishment Three Fourths Home sports a story strong enough to be considered a good purchase even if you only take it at face value: the ending was pretty tense and somewhat of a punch in the gut with the powerful epilogue section being equally strong and emotional.

All things considered you might be, at first, slightly disappointed with the level of interactivity you're given since it all boils down to making a few choices during the dialogue but picking different answers will actually not only give the dialogue itself a different nuance but also shed light on different sides of a character's feelings or a life event. Having said this there's no denying that the dialogue will flow forward on the same path regardless of your choices so here's why the replay value is limited.

Three Fourths Home is a great visual novel with excellent story and writing: a cursory look at online reviews will show you that quite a few people were left pondering on how the story tied with their life long after they stopped playing and this should tell you plenty about its quality. Depending on how much you value ""artsy"" games and novels it might be overpriced for what it does but if you see it on sale or, like me, in a bundle pick it up, you won't be disappointed.",1437883908,1437929443,True,2,0,0.544933557510375977,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I backed it just for the game because it looked interesting, but it didn't make it. After playing this game, it's a bigger shame that it failed.

Three Fourths Homes lies more on the interactive fiction side of the adventure game spectrum so if you need to shoot things or stick a rubber duck onto a fishing pole than this isn't for you. Interactive fiction/narrative games live and die on the quality of their writing and I'd say the game delivers. You play as a young woman named Kelly who's returning to her family's farmhouse in Nebraska after not being in contact for some time while a large storm is brewing. Gameplay is simple you just keep driving by holding down a button while you make dialogue choices. Having to hold down a button might be annoying for some but I have to admit I actually stopped noticing that I was doing it and it sort of helped a bit to immerse me more. 

Like Kentucky Route Zero and Walking Dead Season 1, the choices you make in the main game are more about shaping who Kelly is and her relationship with her family. The writing is also low key and manages to bring some real humanity and character to the cast that a lot of games struggle with. You get a good feeling for Kelly and her family and you grow to care. The atmosphere is also really good and at some points it can be quite haunting. The ending isn't unpredictable but the epilogue greatly enhances it, really tying together the themes of regret and decay that the game has in a strong way. The Epilogue is the best part of the game because of this and really helps the game to stick with you after its done.

Overall Three Fourths Home is powerful and to the point, a really nice first outing for a fledging dev. I hope the best for them and I'd be willing to back them again if they give To Azimuth another shot.

It isn’t any of the things usually required for an item to be offered by Steam. But it is (in my opinion) two things less commonly found on Steam: a totally inclusive artistic experience, and a detailed work by a writer bursting to express themselves through an emotional outlet involving the player. 

It’s an account of a young woman, Kelly, early 20s, talking on the phone to her parents and younger brother, Ben, as she attempts to drive home in the midst of a Nebraska storm, tornado approaching. It’s a family, like any other, with a great deal of love, and lots of issues. It’s very difficult to say much without saying too much, so this will be an unusually short review, with fewer details.

This is the story of a search for self by all participants; characters, players and writer/developer, in no set priority that I can determine. The characters could be kinder toward each other, but in how many families is that generally the case? Everyone in this family has lost something, and throughout, they struggle to regain, or accept the changes that come with loss. Much is expressed through hints and subtle emotion and comments, since only the player is in the dark, and learns certain things through the dialog choices they select during the long conversation over the phone. The existing storm and the approaching tornado add a sense of inevitability, a feeling of the foolishness of man to focus on the minutia of our lives. This game is largely about aspects that may seem petty, but in reality are the very things that consume nearly every moment of our existence. Perhaps ultimately this is about the attempts all humans make to discover themselves through their attempts to discover each other.

One very simple choice I made in this game was so utterly tragic and heartbreaking that I nearly stopped “playing”, for fear continuing would taint the developers intent. I’m very glad I didn’t

Some hints to enjoy this game more completely
Examine the menu option for the game controls. Some are simply there to add a sense of heightened reality. One that I sorely wish I’d known of is the control for playing music in Kelly’s car. The music in this game is one of its strongest features (and that is saying a GREAT deal.) While the music would have added to my game enjoyment, I listen to the music by itself, and enjoy it immensely. Not just the music, but the sounds of the weather add much to the story. Headphones are a strong consideration. (The text is all silent, read from the screen.) 
At no point assume this story is over (attempting to exit the game emphasizes this.) Perhaps the presence of achievements, ordinarily a distraction in such a game, may actually serve the purpose of indicating completeness more than accomplishment. Do NOT miss Kelly’s photo essay. And by NO means skip over Ben’s stories. I only hope that some day a game is developed based entirely on these, and similar, atmospheric short stories.

While comparisons to other games, such as Journal, To the Moon or Kentucky Route Zero might be made, this game is far more immersive and artistic than those. Perhaps more than any game that will come along any time soon. If you want to learn something about people and families, and perhaps even something about yourself with a game that does have some degree of replayability, Three Fourths Home is quite possibly the game for you.

It handled the topic at hand with surprising delicacy. The main game is basically Kelly, the protagonist, basically visiting her grandfathers home in the country when the weather turns bad, so she heads home. She and her mom start talking on the phone, and in the midst of the conversation, it is revealed that one or more tornadoes are going to be touching down in the area. So, Kelly must try to get to the safety of home. All the while, she is chatting with her mom, and later with her dad and her brother Ben as well. 

It is obvious that she has been estranged from her family and has recently come back to live with them, which has resulted in conflicted feelings and a lot of trying to regain the relationships she once shared.

I wont reveal the ending, but it was both ambiguous and obvious (funny how that works). Through the game, you are basically driving home as mentioned before, and the only knock I have is that you actually have to hold down the D key or (on a gamepad) and trigger.....the entire game, which is annoying. Outside of that however, I thought it was a fairly seamless experience. The dialogue was interesting and the interactions felt real.

There is an epilogue, and this is really where the variant choices and decision come into play (as was highlighted on the product page via the current first page curation (800+ variations). they all take place in the epilogue, and without revealing the actual content (as it would also serve as a spoiler for the main game), I will just say that this was at least as interesting as the main game.

The extras were all cool as well. Ben's stories were all well written and fun to read. Kelly's photo class final was fun to look at, and the soundtrack was excellent.

[h1]De la nécéssité[/h1]Dans les phrases d'accroche, on peut lire en substance : « un jeu comme celui-ci est important ». Permettez-moi de paraphraser cette mention : « Three Fourths Home » est un jeu « nécessaire », bien entendu il n'est pas le premier à l'être cependant on ne peut pas dire que cela soit fréquent à l'heure qu'il est. 
J'ignore si les joueurs sont familiers avec ce concept, globalement, pour moi, cela signifie plusieurs choses : Three Fourth Home est nécessaire parce qu'il préfigure ce que le Jeu sera inévitablement amené à devenir. Il ouvre la voie, comme un pionnier. En plus de cela, TFH va à la rencontre d'émotions qui sont encore le domaine réservé des films, livres et autres.  Enfin TFH est nécessaire, car il est imprudent, tout comme Dear Esther pouvait l'être, il est un jalon pour les créateurs à venir qui pourront le voir au-dessus de leur tête, comme un phare qui inviterait les navires à venir à le rejoindre... je suis rassuré de savoir qu'il existe.

Three Fourths Home est un jeu « expérimental » en ce sens qu'il balaye les conventions ordinaires du jeu et forcément déstabilise le joueur traditionnel qui n'y retrouve pas ce à quoi il est habitué. Difficile d'approche, difficile à apprécier, un rien austère... 

Le jeu est fait d'une seule conversation suivie entre une jeune femme et sa famille. La jeune femme est au volant et traverse des grands espaces, elle est sur la route du retour à la maison, avec ses parents,  son frère. Le joueur est parachuté dans la conversation, sans rien savoir, petit à petit le discours donne les indices pour saisir les évènements passés et l'histoire de cette famille.

L'atmosphère s'épaissit rapidement au point qu'on pourrait la couper au couteau, quelques phrases d'apparence anodines soulèvent rapidement une impression puissante de gravité, de drame. 
La moitié supérieure de l'écran affiche la voiture traversant des décors minimalistes qui se répètent. La moitié basse indique à gauche les paroles de la famille et à droite les multiples réponses que vous pouvez faire. 
Tout au long de l'expérience, c'est à vous de garder la voiture en mouvement en appuyant sur une touche, relâchez là et le temps dans le jeu se ralentit jusqu'à se mettre sur pause. Cette nécessité est pénible (40 min avec le doigt appuyé sur une même touche c'est un peu lourd...) mais pourtant cela me paraît un élément majeur qui à de nombreuses conséquences dans l'esprit du joueur. Comme si cette touche maintenait tout le monde en vie, comme si elle amplifiait le drame, elle renforce physiquement l'immersion et l'empathie envers l'histoire. Aussi désagréable que cela soit, cela m'apparaît un petit compromis qui provoque un grand résultat. On s'absorbe très vite dans la lecture relevant la tête de temps en temps pour voir que l'on a avancé, on les nouveaux paysages et bâtiments en deviennent impressionnant et plein de sens.

TFH est certainement le meilleur drame (le seul ?) que j'ai expérimenté, il produit une émotion durable. Les discours très banal, très prosaïque qui n'en finissent plus de s'approfondir pour toucher certains thèmes capitaux. La mauvaise météo donnera bientôt une impression d'insécurité indicible. 
Les possibilités de dialogues sont remarquables et leurs liens tissés avec subtilité. Le jeu s'approche de beaucoup d'un livre que l'on commencerait à lire sans pouvoir s'en détacher tant on veut voir la fin.

Es difícil explicar lo que supone volver a casa tras estar mucho tiempo alejado.

En España, en la que empieza a surgir la “movilidad exterior” como respuesta al paro, empieza a ser un fenómeno un poco más común, pero donde ha pasado desde tiempos inmemoriales es en países como Estados Unidos, con esos estudiantes que se van lejos, lejos de casa; a la universidad y en busca de una nueva vida.

Siendo yo uno de esos apátridas que han hecho del nomadismo un estilo de vida, no pude sino enamorarme del concepto que hay detrás de Three Fourths Home: la historia de una chica que vuelve a casa en Nebraska (uno de los estados del midwest americano), desde la bulliciosa gran ciudad hasta el mundo rural de la infancia. De las hileras de edificios a los interminables campos de maíz que alimentan al resto del país. De su vida actual a una vida antigua, intermedia y deshecha, coronada por la nostalgia y un pasado que ya no existe.

¿Cómo no me va a interesar Three Fourths Home? Tras cinco años fuera de mi Tenerife natal, acabo de volver y estoy escribiendo esto mientras me ubico y vuelvo a ver a la familia y los lugares de la infancia.


Pero dejemos de hablar de mí y hablemos de Kelly. En la mitad de su veintenta ha vuelto a un mundo al que no creía que volvería, a las llanuras infinitas de cosecha y los silos oxidados que pueblan sus recuerdos.

¿Qué hace ahí y por qué ha vuelto? Es sólo uno de los detalles que tendremos que decidir en Three Fourths Home, a través de su única mecánica jugable. Porque la propuesta del juego de BracketGames es sencillísima: empezamos a conducir para volver al hogar tras haber ido a visitar una casucha con mucho significado emocional. Las teclas del ordenador nos dejan encender los faros, poner música…pero nada de eso tiene sentido. Sólo avanzar por la carretera (un poco a lo Glitchhikers) mientras huimos de una tormenta que empieza a gestarse en el trayecto y conversamos con los miembros de la familia.

Esta charla telefónica es la verdadera razón de ser de Three Fourths Home, la que hace que sea una experiencia fascinante que debe ser vivida. Casi una novela gráfica (de no ser por el manejo del coche, sería indistinguible de una), las respuestas que vayamos dando a nuestra madre, padre y hermano harán que creemos la historia anterior de Kelly, que “elijamos nuestra propia aventura”.


Three Fourths Home no evita los temas controvertidos, ni mucho menos. Aborda cosas que hemos visto pocas veces en los videojuegos (quizá Gone Home o The Novelist…), y lo hace con una madurez inquietante para un título tan “pequeño”. Alcoholismo, discapacidad, la muerte de las relaciones de pareja…Y en todos tenemos que decidir qué es lo que está pasando, creando un retrato de la familia que realmente funcionará como espejo que nos devuelve la imagen de nuestras elecciones.

Por supuesto, no es un título para todo el mundo. Salvo un par de pinceladas realmente es una historia interactiva, sus elecciones se desenvuelven ante nosotros a medida que elegimos el diálogo y apretamos el acelerador del coche, pero es toda la jugabilidad que encontraremos. Quien quiera lanzarse a discutir si esto es un videojuego o no seguramente pasará un mal rato ante él.

Pero si tú que lees esto eres otro nómada como yo, o simplemente te apetece vivir la extraña sensación que colorea la vida de nosotros, los “hijos pródigos del mundo”, tienes que experimentarlo. Saborear sus posibilidades y dejarte hechizar por la música y un escenario minimalista, de un gris fantasmal e inquietante que quizá deje entrever algo más.

If you are looking for a game with a lot of interactivity, this game is not for you. But I suspect anyone reading this would know that already.

The main story, as far as I can see, has but one ending no matter which dialogue choices you make: the ""interactivity"" besides picking your words is holding down a button to drive...while you read. The graphics were simplistic and didn't work that well in terms of the main story. The epilogue was done quite a bit better: it had multiple endings - some bad that end it early, one ""good"" ending, all equally bleak - and the graphics actually fit the emotional tone of the narrative. Furthermore, at least the epilogue showed you the main character, as opposed to the main story where all you see is a car going along a background, and all the characters are merely heard, not seen. They're expressive enough but some facial expression would have been nice to go with it.

You'll notice I spent two and a half hours on this game. That was the main story once, the epilogue four times, going through the extras (including letting the soundtrack run all the way through for an achievement,) and then a final cutscene. So to do absolutely everything, less than three hours. Full disclosure: I did receive a free copy of this game from the developer. Do I think it was worth the time I invested? Only partly. Some of it was good, the rest I did not find a very engaging story - it IS a character study, do not assume plot of any kind. Will it be worth the time AND money that YOU invest in it?

I have several complaints about this game.. 
(Be aware that reading this review does have minor spoilers)

First off, understand that even with the initial 10% discount, $7 USD is too much money for this kind of game.

Secondly, a big complaint is that I honestly think the choices you make likely matter not in the end as it seems that everyone is going to get the same or a very similar ending.

Third, I dont understand the point of needing to drive, of having controls for lights and a horn.  The lights and horn and zoom controls included offer absolutely ZERO SIGNIFICANCE in the game.

Fourth, Whats the point of needing to hold ""D"" down the entire story to drive?  Why not just make the car drive automatically and offer a pause option to the player if needed?  It's not like holding down the D button on your keyboard gives the game some great gameplay mechanics.  There is nothing to dodge, no reason to stop driving, slow down.  It's just making sure you hold down the D key to keep the story flowing along!  FOR AN HOUR!

Fifth, parts of the story make no sense at all.  Ben's story he tells his sister is ""a cool story bro"" but offers nothing to the main story's plot, makes no sense in the situation at all.  There's a massive rainstorm, tornadoes are risking the lives of everyone in the story, but Ben is going to tell her a 15 minute fantasy story he wrote about a mystical beast in a fantasy land?!?  Uhh, okay.

Sixth problem is that parts of the story also are awkward.  Options to have your star 24 year old female obsessing over the masturbation of her younger 16 year old brother while driving in a rain storm talking to her mother feels out of place, awkward, and 'forced'.. not natural.

Seventh problem.. Unsatisfying ending to say the least.  Why build up this much tension and require the player to read and hold down a D key for an hour for ""that""?  WTF.  Garbage.

I like the writing, parts of it.  I like the theme of the game just fine.  But for $7, or over $6 at the current 10% off when I bought it... ehhh.  I just think it could have been done much, much better and for the price, we should probably get something besides this completely random, unsensical mess of a story.

If the game is 80% off, it might be a good value for the people who tend to like this kind of game, including myself.  Anything over an 80% off sale will likely leave you shaking your head and thinking exactly what I thought at the end.. ""WTF"".

Two thumbs down, as much as I want to like it, for all the reasons above and the fact that the negatives outweigh the postives.",1426895555,1426957059,False,20,3,0.432031095027923584,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The driving aspect of the game is not as complicated as it sounds...you simply hold in D to keep the story going.  You don't have to worry about dodging traffic or staying on the road.  Frankly it got annoying after a while.  While the story was indeed well done, I don't think that the game warrants a $7 price tag, especially since replayability is practically nil.  I'd give this a go if/when it drops in price, but it won't be for everyone.  I'm giving it a no-recommend based on the price and the content you get for said price.  Buy a Stephen King (or what have you) book that takes days to get through instead.
