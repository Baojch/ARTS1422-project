The game's unique concept of controlling individual air deflectors rather than just directing the plane traditionally is both challenging and rewarding. Mastering the controls to perform tight aerobatic stunts and recoveries feels genuinely fulfilling, like I'm part of an elite group of pilots.

The procedurally-generated world of ""StratO"" is a playground for creativity and skill. As I glide, swoop, and dive through rings, each maneuver feels like a dance with gravity. The game pushes me to my limits, demanding dedication and determination, but the sense of achievement when executing perfect stunts is unparalleled.

I appreciate the deep game mechanics that intertwine various actions like sliding, boosting, tucking, and magnetizing. The complexity adds layers to the gameplay, making every session a learning experience. The fact that the game is challenging yet approachable is a testament to its design - simple to learn but hard to master.

The support for different controllers, including flight sticks, and the customizable controls, make ""StratO"" accessible and enjoyable for various players. The attention to detail, like the alternate color scheme for players with Deuteranopia, shows the developers' commitment to inclusivity.

In conclusion, ""StratO"" is more than a game; it's a testament to skillful flying and strategic gameplay. It stands out not just for its unique mechanics and challenging gameplay but for the sense of pride and accomplishment it instills in players. For anyone looking for a game that breaks the mold of traditional flight sims, ""StratO"" is a must-try.",1700430590,1700430590,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

TLDR: Unity Engine Superman64 score attack flying inside rings. Plane that veers left and right in abrupt motions. Camera has trouble keeping smooth. Visibility is nil. Assets are minimalistic. Hard pass.

I believe there is an old console game in which you fly as superman through rings. This is the same idea. Score attack, you gracefully go from circle to circle, avoid the skyscrape shaped rectangles, avoid the occasional yellow arrow chasing you. Except I found the camera and controls to not be so fluid at all. I know from experience that this can be due to the small display screen I am using at the moment, but based on what I saw, even if the controls were fluid, this simply is too simple and barebones to warrant a place in my permanent collection.

I have tried to figure this game out, it looks cool, innovative & different (it is what captured my interest to buy), but nothing makes sense! I have never felt so lost in a game in years! 

Flying aimlessly trying to understand the controls first, then what is benefitial to do and what is not. Controls are not intuitive, but that is fine, I do like a challenging game. They are very sensitive though and rather unforgiving with a controller. Precision of this does improve as you play further, and taking into account the physics better as you fly.

Sometimes a number in the bottom right of the screen goes up then it goes back to zero, I hit things and stall or go faster doesn't seem to make any difference as I haven't been able to find a way to die or string anything together consistently to start to piece together the obscure game mechanics. Sometimes a special move pops up in the bottom left corner that I dont really know how I did it or how to combine these to get something/anything going. Gather I am meant to get the circles, but not sure what that does. I get a few circles, then the string of them often disappear into the fog (I guess I go the wrong direction perhaps)? What are the hazards, should I avoid hitting things or not, or go faster/slower, or just get the circles as quickly as possible.. I'm so confused.

There is a HUD which has no explaination to it (a bunch of circles and other symbols/colours that change as you move around), nor what to do to get any score or navigate through the endless level. Procedural generation is basic from what I have seen with the same shapes with high level of fog to hide things from view. Felt like I was going around & around which becomes somewhat nausiating.

Graphics do look nice in the simplistic style used though - they have depth when coupled with the fog effects. Audio/music gets rather repetitive in a short time although it does add some nice atmosphere to the game & complements the graphic set. No real complaints here other that the HUD/UI I have previously mentioned.

With a game with such abstract game mechanics the lack of any type of tutorial, guide, manual or explaination on what is the goal is or how to play is baffling. This might be a great game but without any explaination on the mechanics, scratching my ball sack is more enjoyable. I am clearly in the minority looking at the primarily positive reviews, but in my time playing it has been unenjoyable & frustrating. I like a hard game, a game of skill (as the store page suggests this is), but at least explain the basic rules first!


[u]Update post Devs comments:[/u] [i]I have watched the brief introduction instructional video linked in the comments and also found an extended advanced 22 minute video on the channel that I have also watched. This does help explain some of the mechanics of the game and some of the possible moves you can do. To be fair, I returned to the game to give it another try and did find my initial frustrations diminished to a degree. I was able to string together some higher scores & get some of the achievements. Saying this, I do still maintain that the game needs better explaination for new players and should not need to search online to see how to play.

Once you get start getting the hang of the plane controls & physics, the game becomes more enjoyable, but ultimately I do not see this as a game I would come back to play regularly. Other than getting a higher score the game itself is repetitive with the same scenery, sound effects/audio & layouts (which do progressively get harder to navigate). Wall grinding seems to be the best option to increase your score, but I did try for the circles to see if I could progress and hit a few of the harder achievements. Finite control still eludes me so hitting a bullseye of a circle for example was next to impossible & the HUD still seemed redundant (or I did not pick up what the circles and symbols mean from the videos). Also, it is hard to judge how close to the bottom of the map you are where (I now know) your score resets.

I always admire a dev who is willing to try something different and not churn out the same game or game mechanics we have seen in a 100 other titles. This is a good effort, and enjoyable to a point once the game was understood, but there is not enough content or variety, and does still need better explaination of the mechanics for new players.

When you first get into the game you start off in black space with the plane flying.
Then, some words appear which I forgot what they say, but it's nothing that actually teaches
you or tells you anything about the game. I am impatient, though, so I mashed all of the buttons (using PS3 controller).
Maybe I skipped the introduction (if there is one). After that it sends you straight into the game.
If you're like me and you have been watching Moatdd play the game, you came in thinking ""I got this.""
But after 15 seconds of being in the game reality hits you. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
IT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS! Don't
come into the game with the mentality that you're going to pull off what Moatdd (or anybody else) is doing.
The game does have a learning curve. You will not get into the game and pull off awesome stunts.
You will have to put time into the game and practice. Flying the craft is a skill itself.
This gives you a sense of accomplishment whenever you do manage to pull off a stunt or 
turbo manouver through a small tunnel. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a game 
you can randomly play, such as while waiting for your League of Legends queue to load. 

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Graphics wise, the game is really crisp. I am playing on a GTX 970 at 1920x1080 resolution
and hit an average of 150 FPS. This is all with max settings. When I first saw the game 
I thought ""Oh, look at all of those things! Looks flashy and awesome. Must play!""

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
Overall this is a great game. The only negative thing is that I am having a hard time 
learning how to fly, but that's my own fault I guess. For sure worth the $9.99 and 
will recommend to friends.

stratO is a game that I feel needs some advice given before even starting this review. There are a few strategies online for stratO (even by the developer) mentioning a few different tactics, but I have to admit that one tactic rises above the rest. That strategy is to pick one set of controls (like the left and right air brakes) and while not trying to fly through rings, just get used to what those specific controls do to the plane. Just focus on those buttons while trying to avoid the giant blocks. That’s it; rinse and repeat for additional controls. This should help the learning curve. It’s weird and feels pointless, but it does work.

That said, I was frustrated with the controls since I couldn’t configure them the way I wanted to, that and there seemed to be a lot of buttons. Changing the controls wasn’t exactly straightforward, but I eventually did figure it out. Instead of getting used to what the developer had set up, I was trying to set up controls that the game refused to let me use. I was trying to assign two different controls to the joysticks and while it would work on the control setup screen, it wouldn’t work in-game. Eventually I gave up and just used what I was given and I then got used to it and the 100 rings in a row achievement. I feel I could have done this a little easier with my idea, but you can only do so much.

There is no tutorial and point to the game just yet. Well “point” may be the wrong word. I think maybe “reason” would be the better word. Why am I flying here? Why are there random blocks jumping up in front of me? What’s with the rings? Why would I want to continuously fly through them? Is it just for the achievements? The short answer is that stratO is a game that the developer seemed to want to create around his control scheme. Figure out the controls to the best of your abilities and enjoy trying to get all the achievements. It can actually be quite relaxing once you figure out enough of the controls to not hit things.

The developer is also adding a new mode to the game named Salvo. It’s almost the same game currently but with a gun attached to your plane that automatically fires. I’m assuming that you’re just supposed shoot the blocks. This feels like an easier mode than the regular mode and can almost act as a bit of a tutorial. I’d almost recommend playing Salvo mode first. I’m sure that there will be more to this, but as it stands, it’s good enough since he’s still creating it.

Score: Gewd.

While there’s not much going on in stratO and you can see the developer is working on this and adding more to the game and that’s no small feat. stratO is a smooth experience and if you can get a combo going with some good flying the music rewards you and makes the experience all that much better. While I am not completely enjoy the controls, it’s not something that can’t be overcome like some other games I’ve played. It took me a bit to get completely into this game, but in the end I can say that I enjoyed my experience. I can’t say its got a lot to make you want to come back unless you’re an achievement hunter. Maybe when the Salvo mode gets fleshed out we might have something a bit more to solidify the foundation and possibly help me get the one achievement I tried hard to get: “I DO WHAT I WANT”.",1436444711,1436444711,True,1,0,0.443925231695175171,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its hard enough to be challenging but you're so in control that if you want to take it easy you can head down and take a break just peacefully collecting Os until you're ready for some more intense action.
The camera follows you really well and creates a fluid sense of continuity and imersion, the aesthetic and the music are quite well put together, the sounds blend in without disturbing the music, the respawns are seamless. I really just love how well everything meshes.

Be careful about try-harding though. Actions have consequences.

I started out confused and frustrated. I went to the forums and complained about the lack of tutorial and how confusing the controls were.

One of the forum moderators added me almost instantly, walked me through some of the basics, watched a broadcast of me playing, and then had me watch a broadcast of him playing. After that, I kind of knew what was goin on, but still felt lost.

Then the developer himself got on the forums and posted a 22 minute comprehensive tutorial. I watched the whole thing and after my next flight I got my first achievement.

1.3 hours of gameplay later, after all of that, I still feel like a complete n00b, and am still very lost as to what I'm doing when playing, but I'm starting to figure it out little by little.

And, with each little bit I figure out, I'm more and more impressed by how groundbreaking this game is.

I am going to recommend this game, but with the warning that if you're not ready to go through a serious amount of learning just to figure out the basics, this might not be worth your time.

However, if you're craving something new and insanely challenging, buy this now.

Also, I'd like to point out that the dev and moderator who helped me are two of the nicest and most patient people I've come across on Steam, and should get a medal just for dealing with crazy people like me :)",1433922436,1433922436,True,10,0,0.562941670417785645,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I should also mention the game music.  This guy is simply genius, and I hope that he puts out a soundtrack as DLC.

The only knock I can place on the game is that I would have preferred to have a little more structure to the content.  Endless high score runs are enjoyable, but give me a set of tasks to accomplish that build up my skills.  That would do much to alleviate the steep learning curve.

I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to like it, I've been a fan of the developers streams for a while but wasn't sure if this was quite my cup of tea. 

The game seems brutally difficult at first, but upon a few trail and error attempts and reviewing the controls, I found myself becoming more and more accustomed to the gameplay. Within the first twenty minutes I was coasting off of walls and blasting through rings at lightning speed! 

The gameplay get's very intense, as you scrape by buildings at blazing speeds you'll hear gusting winds as the camera shakes vigorously giving you that feeling as if you're an ace pilot in a big budget action film! It makes the game's learning curve SO worth it! 

The biggest plus for me however, is the game seems to adapt to any style of play. If you're looking to collect rings as fast as you can, scoring multiple bullseyes while preforming skill chains will phase the player into what is known as ""B-side"", were rings scored will award double the points but it's significantly harder in the process. However if you're looking for something more laid back and chill, you can traverse the map at a laid back pace and still remain competitive against other players.

There is no ineffective way to play this game, and that's probably the game's strongest feature. Some have stated that this game is anti casual. I'd argue the opposite. Once you take the time to learn the controls and physics of StratO, it's very easy to log in, play it for ten minutes, and go back to your work space feeling completely satisfied! 

Gameplay: 5/5 - Difficult to learn at first, but after a while it all starts to make sense. The physics are incredible!

Graphics:   4/5 - Simple but effective. Nothing looks awkward or out of place. The lighting in some of the later maps is beautiful! 

Soundtrack: 4/5 - Clever use of game mechanics that change the in game music while rocket boosting make it hard to resist muting the music for something else. The in game music, particularly the ""default"" map track which is most commonly used is great! It's not too fancy and fits the atmosphere well. My only complaint is there needs to be more music tracks for the game to swap through as you get into the later maps.

That's kind of like what this game is like, if the buildings fell from the sky at every possible angle, and your plane has no working engine. You always feel like you're 3 seconds from doom, because you usually are. And it's great.

I stumbled upon this game by chance, because the guy who made it was streaming his development on twitch. That was several months ago, and man is it polished since I first saw it. It just oozes ""game feel"", and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.

PROS:
*It's fun. It's intense. Neat plane physics.

CONS:
*Personally I found the default controls hard to use, and it was a bit confusing to change them because you have to use the scroll wheel (I think) to cycle through them, instead of just having a menu.
*There's no in-game guide yet, but I think he's working on that. (The game came out 6 hours ago)",1433195236,1433195236,True,4,1,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Tighter, albeit more difficult controls with similarly addictive gameplay and a great sound-track.

This game CAN be played on keyboard, but you are putting yourself at a great disadvantage. This game plays the best on a 360/XBone controller.

This is the definition of a great arcade game. Fast paced action, tricky, combo building, and the craziness only grows more out of control as your score increases. 

The ONLY possible negative here would be the learning curve. Prepare to up your hand/eye coordination game.

I've been following his developer on his live stream since he started working on stratO and the greatest thing I can say is he has accomplished to create a really hard flying game, it's learning curve is really sharp but once you get used to it it will give you some kind of feeling.

For me, that feeling is tranquility, I start playing it with some drum n' bass music on the background and I can easily play for two hours without stop. It's just the flow it achieves that makes it so great.",1433176497,1433176497,True,11,1,0.574632644653320313,1,False,False,False,False,,,
