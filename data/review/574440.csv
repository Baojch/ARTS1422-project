I don't think the devs are still working on it but listing the problems I was having in case they do. 

The start screen is amazing, and the graphics in general are reasonable to very good, but on WMR the controls aren't what is in the program (you need to work it out). It does work, but especially on the asteroid game, movement seemed quite bugged and made that game almost unplayable. The flight game was also unplayable. The movement was really coarse and didn't always reflect where you had your hands. Also I found if I turned away from the computer that I just kept traveling in the wrong direction. Since there was no way to rotate using the controllers, this was not fixable. Also it would have been far more fun to be able to do free flight rather than only having the choice of going through the rings.  Couldn't even get the spear toss to start as the spears wouldn't release properly. The ninja game worked, but you kind of just had to point your sword at incoming weapons as you couldn't cut them out of the air. 

Has both free movement and teleport, but no apparent way to rotate on the spot with the controller, which makes it awkward to play seated. (I don't quite understand why so many developers develop a game that can be played seated and then leave that out.) Loading times are HUGE. Basically put your headset down, go get a cup of coffee and come back in 5-15 mins between games.
