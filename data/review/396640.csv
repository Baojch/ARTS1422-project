First off, this game is VERY punishing - one hit from anything results in instant death (even just falling from too high of a platform) and will send you back to the beginning of the game. This isn't a downside though; many punishing games can be rewarding for skilled players. However, I prefer if the difficulty comes from the gameplay rather than the CONTROLS simply being obtuse. To swing a sword, you press the Jump button (yes, it will also make you jump). To hold something, you have to hold down X the ENTIRE time because if you ever let it go, the item in your hands will be violently flung away from you. Did I mention X is also the Run button? Additionally, there's no pause button whatsoever and the developer has expressed his dislike of them - good luck if anything ever requires your immediate attention in real life. This is a game that does not respect your time.

One thing that really strikes me as unusual is that this game actually has lots of hidden content that 99% of the playerbase will almost never see due to the base games difficulty. It seems like the developer finished the first two chapters and then spent all his time adding optional content behind it, but it feels pointless because only the most dedicated, adderall-infused, diehard gamers will actually manage to see any of it. The Boiler Room? The Colosseum? Seeing the final boss in basketball jersey and dunking on him in a basketball match? All this developer effort spent on things almost nobody will ever experience.

It doesnt work at all and there's no good or easy way to fix it.

-
Gameplay is alright, didn't have a problem with the controls like people complain about.
But really the games a bit too slow paced for me, 
especially considering you'll be replaying the same levels over and over it becomes time consuming.

The shortcuts help with this, but wizard man kept woopin me every time after the first couple games.

Expected songs from the trailer to be in the areas shown on-trailer but got more generic music for them instead.
The music was good enough for me though.

Haven't tried the multiplayer yet since I never got it working on steam deck.

It's also a fair bit more technical than most games - there's a few moves that feel like I'm describing fighting game combos.

It does have an easy mode, although it's not a huge concession - 3 health instead of 2. I assume it makes a fairly big difference in how far you can go, but it's still no easier to do anything in particular...

It's an absurdly difficult game, but mastering the mechanics completely alleviates that. Any time you die, it is 100% your fault. There's a lot to them aswell, from chaining item throws to ascend higher than what a single item throw would let you, to throwing an item and boomerang at the same time to get the extra height and have the boomerang recover the item you used, to the extremely finnicky mobility items that are just as likely to get you killed but let you go dangerously fast.

The true ending took me about 80 hours of grinding to achieve (with a single full run only taking about an hour), which involves starting from the beginning and visiting a few secret areas that each have an item you need to carry to the end of the game. Having to haul these severely limits your inventory space which further compounds the difficulty as you have less room for important tools to help navigate. It was an extremely rewarding journey to go through, and now I'm able to chain multiple wins together back to back.

Not to mention the eye candy pixel art, which is best complimented with the awesome soundtrack of the game (my favorite tracks being...well, pretty much every single one, yes they are THAT good, but to get an idea on how good it is, listen to Flex Flash or even the Overly Epic Tutorial Music).
Another big reason why i can't stop coming back to this game is because it oozes atmosphere, it really is unlike anything i've ever played and, again, a big part of that is because of the graphics and kickass soundtrack, which together create this beautiful sinergy of an atmosphere that the only way i can describe, is that it feels like playing while it's raining outside, you have a nice cup of hot cocoa and a blanket and the outside world just ceases to exist the moment you start playing. In short, it's extremely immersive.

I heard about this game from a friend and it has quickly risen up to one of my favorites of all time, It hits the mark on just about every front for me as a gamer. The music is fantastic, it has a retro style but the spritework is great, especially on the death cards. Most important of all the gameplay is some of the most addictive I've ever come across, the mechanics are simple at a first glance but there's many little nuances that can advance your runs to higher levels, you're forced to be resourceful and think even at the earlier levels of the game. Not once did I feel like I was playing something that was padded out to increase the playtime, it took me 100 hours to get my first win and out of hundreds of runs, i can only think of about 3-4 times a death felt unfair. This game has an amazing way of making you want to see more, just break your record even if only by a few feet, discovering the intriguing new areas and new items drove me to keep climbing despite any frustration I may have felt. I'm now pushing 130 hours and still have new things to see in this game, motivation to play and I really have to commend Davioware and Quazi, the developers. It's still baffling to me that only 2 people worked on one of the most fun and addictive games I have ever played in my life, when AAA developers struggle to hold my attention for more than a few months. I'd recommend that any challenge lovers / platformer fans give this game a shot, because if you give TowerClimb the chance it will reward you greatly.

这个游戏有着非常高的难度，但是每一次到达新的区域的激动是无法掩饰的，它会促使你继续往上爬，探索更多新的区域，开阔更多的剧情，迎接更多的挑战。
游戏里面有着庞大的物品数据库，这些物品需要谨慎使用并且熟练使用，玩家的背包大小是有限的，所以要合理管理。而且还有强大的合成系统，需要找合成师合成物品，有些看上去还挺有趣的。
在游戏里面，药水是个很重要并且十分救命的资源，所以尽可能使用item来跳跃到更高的高度。
特别在一些关卡，药水的作用自然体现出来，像是item无法够到的地方，Zardo Land左右的滚轮，要是掉下去了能用药水及时救急。
而且游戏还有很多很多细节，隐藏的剧情，在主线之外的那些，同样非常诱人。
不过比较难受的一点就是一些恶心的随机事件和地形的生成，所以这个游戏不仅考验技术，有时候脸也很关键。
除了主线的第一章第二章之外，这个游戏还有100层模式，给具有更强实力的玩家挑战(第二章还没打通，不知道有没有解锁新的模式)
最后我想说一下，强烈推荐这个硬核Roguelite，可惜的就是这个游戏虽然很好，但是全球性的冷门。
评分：10/10

期待第三章能赶上Half-Life 3(笑)

I've been playing it since long, long before it became available on Steam.  Must've ploughed 500+ hours into it by now.  In my opinion, it's one of the best games I've ever played.  

I'm not a great platform gamer, but this appeals to the roguelike fan in me more than anything else.  Every move is a puzzle to solve, and there's always a solution. You just have to find it.  Quickly.  Or die.  Learn, or die.  Or, more accurately, learn AND die.  No one is ""completing"" this in their first run. 

It's the epitome of pure, concentrated gameplay.  A relatively simple set of basic components with a vast amount of potential and replayability.  Some reviews have complained that it's too hardcore.  Well, not all games are created equal.  Some will lead you by the hand and others will tear off your hand and beat you to death with the soggy stump.  This is of the latter type.  So, what did you learn? Keep your hands to yourself. 

I just noticed there's an ""Easy"" mode been added at some point.  Not sure what that does, but my recommendation would be to stick with the classic experience and learn to be at peace with dying.  Maybe go play some roguelikes to get you out of the habit of assuming you'll walk through every game you play.  Once that expectation is broken, there''s a whole world of wondrous challenges ahead!

The variance on the difficulty of layout for some stages are completely fucked. You either get a manageable or hundreds of the hell bugs in Volt Cave. You can either pass through the watchers in the Temple well enough or they cluster 5 of them in the same area. And then there's Club Z, where if you get a bad obstacle spawn you CANNOT do anything about it except teleport around it. 

It's ridiculous how much the game punishes you for mistakes. Part 1 is fine, but when you get to Part 2, half the stages contain instant no-revive death pits and you have one chance to traverse some of the obstacles or you will have to waste a bunch of resources to get back up because the only way up is destroyed. At that point there is no point in having extra lives, and sometimes even when you DO, the respawn time and the camera speed is so slow that you will die again before you can get back your bearings.

This game has one of the most arbitrary and poorly done crafting system I've ever seen. It's all wild guessing, there's only a few recipes that are helpful in an average run, and the ""best"" items are so stupidly rare that there is no chance in hell you will ever craft one, let alone FIND the components for its components.

And don't even get me started on Legend Fragments. What kind of insane person do you have to be to play the game from the beginning, do one of the WORST instant death challenge stages using skills you will be completely untrained for, another RNG stage, beat a enemy gauntlet for a game that did NOT have combat made in mind, AND beat another final boss with 90-120 minutes in between attempts, 5/6 of it requiring you spend at LEAST an hour to get to that part?

Funny as much Cruel, Ruthless, Hard. 
All this is Towerclimb, a roguelike like few. A game that challenges your skills. Fun, hallucinating, competitive. It is an enterprise to try to survive from the tutorial and this will be what drives you to say ""why not ... I'll try again!"". It is hard to get tired of a title that offers a considerable level of challenge but at the same time so well balanced to make you think that you can, indeed you MUST continue your climb to glory. Because who knows what else is up there that you haven't seen yet.
The gameplay coincides with the structure of the game: challenging. You will use the first hour only to try to SURVIVE THE TUTORIAL, imagine what you can expect starting from the first level which, right from the start, will make you understand that climbing will be a difficult task. Game mechanics are original, innovative and funny and this, for a platform in 2019, is simply upsetting.
The soundtrack is taken care of and adapts perfectly to this title, which has that retrogame flavor that I never regretted, having grown up in '90s with many MS-DOS titles.
The graphics, although it may seems dated, actually INSPIRED by the eight-bit titles of the '80s and '90s, thus being well-kept and fascinating.
If you are looking for something that engages your brain since you start the game, this is the title for you.
And remember: ""None has returned"".

Divertente tanto quanto Crudele, Spietato, Difficile.
Tutto questo è Towerclimb, un roguelike come pochi. Un gioco che sfida le tue capacità. Divertente, allucinante, competitivo. E' un'impresa cercare di sopravvivere fin dal tutorial e sarà proprio questo a spingervi a dire ""ma sì... ci provo un'altra volta!"". E' arduo stancarsi di un titolo che offre un livello di sfida non indifferente ma al contempo talmente ben bilanciato da farti pensare che puoi, anzi DEVI continuare la tua scalata verso la gloria. Perché chissà cos'altro c'è lassù che ancora non hai visto.
Il gameplay coincide con la struttura del gioco: impegnativo. Impiegherete la prima ora solo a cercare di SOPRAVVIVERE AL TUTORIAL, immaginate cosa può attendervi a partire dal primo livello che, fin da subito, vi farà capire che la scalata sarà un'ardua impresa. Le meccaniche di gioco sono originali, innovative e divertenti e questo, per un platform nel 2019, è qualcosa di sconvolgente.
La colonna sonora è curata e si adegua perfettamente a questo titolo che ha quel sapore retrogame che a me non è mai dispiaciuto, essendo cresciuto negli anni novanta con molti titoli MS-DOS. 
La grafica, nonostante possa sembrare datata, in realtà si ISPIRA ai titoli 8 bit degli anni ottanta risultando così curata ed affascinante. 
Se cercate qualcosa che impegni le vostre meningi fin da quando avviate il gioco, questo è il titolo che fa per voi.

What do you mention to make sure as many people as possible give this textbook example of a hidden gem a shot instead of scrolling past it? At the end of the day, I think it's just something you have to experience. Something you have to stick through to the end despite all odds.

And yes, you will die, a lot. Of course, that can be said about a lot of indie platformers. What matters here is that each death is accompanied by some revelation, helping you save a few more resources, maybe get a few floors further each time. TowerClimb has a seemingly infinite amount of little nuances and interactions of different mechanics. ""What, I can stand on spears? I jump higher if I touch a wasp? Fish are distracted by meat? I can safely hold onto these mines? I can store these grenades for later?"" I can promise you that you'll still be discovering things 400 hours in like I am. TowerClimb offers such a sense of progression through skill alone. Check out the death log and notice that the trend of your deaths is getting higher, and higher up the tower.

This game has such an incredible hook that I haven't seen any other game accomplish with just music, atmosphere, and world design. With each new area or secret you discover, your mind will be blown trying to imagine how these developers composed another song of THAT quality, designed another unique setting, mechanic, enemy, item, the list goes on. You could maybe compare the music and artstyle to some of this game's SNES inspirations, but I think that robs it of the incredibly unique identity this game has earned for itself. The pixel art style may seem generic at first, but as you climb higher you'll realize it's truly full of heart and soul and crafts a perfect atmosphere that complements every other element of the game. And honestly, taking this game's music alone, I'm surprised its not a mainstream indie game. By the end you'll be feeling rightfully upset that Davio and Quazi don't receive more recognition for their talent.

All of these elements combined together result in a game that inspires such a great sense of discovery, one that few games truly offer. When you play it, you almost feel like some otherworldly force is commanding you to get just a bit higher. If you can reach the top, I promise this game will have found a permanent place in your heart.

Firstly there's the level generation--some developers use ""procedural generation"" as an excuse to just dump a bunch of bad levels on you and this is one of them.  It is quite, quite frequent that you receive areas you simply cannot pass without using your very limited stock of items and you cannot easily restock those when they're gone.  

The other flaw, the one that really ended my interest, is the control scheme.  It's overly finicky and designed to make your life difficult.  Using items is an enormous pain since the default action is always to hurl it away as hard as possible which is awkward when you're generally on small ledges.  To swing a sword, you have to jump.  What?  That's of course on the one run in ten where you even find a sword.  You also must keep pressing in the direction of whatever surface you are climbing at all times or your character will immediately let go and usually die for the sin of not holding up hard enough.  There are items that grant you a temporary double jump aura, activated by jumping again while in the air, but the game frequently interprets a single jump press as two and wastes the aura.  

Oh, and in a game about carefully making your way up an endless tower, occasionally the levels fill with lava that rises at the same speed you can climb.  Good luck with that.",1524605101,1524605101,False,10,4,0.502641379833221436,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Towerclimb feels random and unfair (and this is coming from someone who loves difficult platformers), to the point that I didn't really feel any desire to continue playing. The control scheme is inaccurate, and the pixelated graphics make it hard to discern hazards and items. Often, you spawn into a level with upward gaps that force you to dip into your limited potion supply.

First off, if you're buying the game without much prior knowledge of it, either ask someone who previously played it for advice or look up the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595709855] community guide, [/url] because the in-game tutorial kind of stinks.

Onward to my next point: this is the best platformer, and maybe even general game, I have ever played. The main gameplay loop consists of entering the tower, climbing as high as you can get, dying from [b] your own [/b] mistakes, and starting again with whatever newfound knowledge and experience you have.

What makes this work so well is how tangible your progress through the tower feels. At any point on your journey, you will find yourself in a completely different environment than the one from the one half an hour ago, giving the tower a layered feel as you make your way to the top, and a feeling of true accomplishment with every conquered area. This is accompanied by fantastic pixel art and amazing sound design, not to mention the beautiful soundtrack. 

The gameplay is in a league of its own. The developers realize very well that less is more, and so the gameplay can be entirely captured in running, jumping, climbing, and throwing or using items. The controls serve this gameplay near perfectly, except for the rare instances where you have to interact with vines (vines are not your friends). A complaint I have seen often is that this game's controls make no sense, and I frankly have to question whether whoever says this gave themselves a chance to even learn how to use them.

The design of this game will never cheat you. Your enemies in the game are the environments of the tower and the creatures residing in them. Every single one of the hazards will kill you almost instantly, but their behaviour and rules are clearly telegraphed no matter what. Whenever you die, it's because [b] you [/b] made a mistake, and the game punished you accordingly.

To summarize, this is a beautiful, well designed and, most importantly, fun game which has lasted me almost 150 hours so far, and I have yet to finish even the core game as of writing this review. If you pick this game up, or are even slightly interested in it, I recommend checking out the game's [url=https://discord.gg/82TQnWy] discord server, [/url] a dedicated and active community of helpful TowerClimb players who are always up to the task of answering your questions about the game or just having a chat about whatever.

They know every exploit there is, every square inch of the game and practiced way more than any reasonable player. I'm sure they had fun doing it but most people are not interested in knowing a game that well. However, while anyone can enjoy half life with only a fraction of all that knowledge and dedication, Tower Climb requires that much as a bare minimum.

I didn't get very far in the game but I did enjoy my time with it. I won't be playing it any more, but since I got it on sale, I think the game pretty much paid itself for 7 hours of gameplay. At full price I would have felt pretty bad for paying it.",1499381294,1499381294,False,11,1,0.478077590465545654,2,True,False,False,False,,,

However, I would also say that this game isn't for everyone. This game's difficulty level is very high, and is pretty much exclusive towards a hardcore audience. Even on easy, you'll die a lot. Scrubs will get kicked in the teeth here.

The controls, once you get to learn them, are very fluid. The gameplay is great and the music is very reminiscient of super metroid. As you climb the tower, you have to carefully manage your resources, and sometimes even make quick decisions on the fly. This can be both a good and a bad thing. The good, being that it teaches you to ""git gud"" over time, and the bad, being that you can't pause the game and oftentimes leads you to your death because you cant react quick enough. 

Ok....you can't pause. I know, I kind of got turned off by it too. But each floor is usually very quick, and after beating the level, that's where you're supposed to take your break.  I think the reason why the devs didnt really bother to implement a pause button was to help you improve, but I still think it causes setbacks too, especially when nature calls or you have to answer your telephone, etc. I imagine that having a pause button would actually help the game more than do harm, but that's my opinion.

The other two things I think would make this better would be to add a quick save function and achievements. Having a quick save would be extremely helpful with this game for those who have to leave and come back later. Achievements would also be a great addition too, as this is a very challenging game. To get you an idea of how challenging, there are people on steam who have played over 100 hours and still havent beaten it. So trust me when I say that if this game had achievements, it would give a player great accomplishment in getting them all.

All things considered, with its flaws, I would give the game an 8.5 out of 10. Without them, I can see the game going to a 9 at least. This a very solid platforming title that would give fans of the genre a lot to offer.

The simple graphics combined with the huge worlds and massive amount of content make this game one you would spend hours on even if you have already finished it.  Just like Spelunky, it's a simple, yet brutal game that will destroy you countless times in the beginning, but once you conquer it and beat that final boss, nothing matches that feeling, and I mean NOTHING.  The mechanics in the game only make it better, from item-hopping, to using swords, and Metal Gear-like stealth action gives you even more reason to play it.  Not only that, but the music is gorgeous, and always fitting the environments.  I always find myself replaying Chapter 1 just for the Ruins music, and the amazing ice environments.  

To sum it all up, TowerClimb is a beautiful game that will beat the shit out of you for a while, but when you overcome it, the ecstasy will last forever (probably).  The music, mechanics, and environments only make it more memorable, and investing hundreds of hours into it (as I have) will feel enjoyable instead of painful.

Short version: like hard games? Buy this game! NOW! IT'S WAY MORE THAN WORTH IT!

Slightly less short version: TowerClimb is an amazing game drawing inspiration from Spelunky, but flipped upside down. Just like Spelunky, the various zones are super different and creative, and each new zone takes some clever thinking, maneuvering, and of course, learning. Though the controls may seem janky at first, with a bit of practice (seriously like only at 5 hours in) they feel more intuitive than Spelunky.

Tl;dr This game is good. It may even be amazing. But it is FAR too hardcore to have a broad audience, and for that reason, I must give it a thumbs down. That's the basis for my review at the core, but it's not the only reason. I think you should only buy this game if you are the most dedicated of roguelike players with your own personal high mechanical skill cap and are a junkie for Dark Souls to infinity levels of punishment. If you're not, then there is no world where this game is for you. This is not an Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, or Don't Starve. Buy it, test it, but don't be afraid to get a refund from Steam and don't let yourself feel like this game ""beat"" you. This game requires religious amounts of dedication to learning its ins and outs along with the most stringent of mechanical prowess to get satisfaction from what you put in. 

PROS

I loved a lot about this game, and I think it does yield a decent return on effort put in (if you can make it that far). That all, however, is not the aim of my review. If you want positives about the game, I suggest looking at the positive reviews. It's got an overall positive rating for a reason. I think that's completely justified, but I can also assume that it doesn't have a very large owner base either. 

CONS

What TowerClimb copiously offers in hardcore rogue-like platforming it falls short in virtually every other department.

* The pixel art is extremely basic. We're talking like if the Atari took steroids, that's the level of art you're to expect from this game. It's hard to distinguish hazards amongst all the muddy sprites sometimes, and it's just generally not very pretty to look at. Now I know that's a preference thing, but let's be serious about how much the quality of art has evolved in games compared to what's being offered here. There's an option to ""depixelize"" the games which just turns everything into what appears to be blurry, borderless watercolors. Ironically, making it harder to distinguish the multitude of hazards in the game.

* The controls, while seemingly tight, are not very intuitive and require some relatively strict mechanical input to operate in frequent high stress situations. There are a lot of instances where you have less than a second to react to several incoming hazards. They're nigh unnavigable when you have to use upwards of 3-5 inputs almost instantenously. On top of that, several of the buttons serve dual functions at the same time, further complicating these highly mechanical maneuvers. To put this in perspective with an Xbox controller, to hold any item in your hand, you HAVE to hold down the X button at all times if you want it to be held in your hands. If you DO let go of the X button, your character will hurl the item away from you. The X button incidentally also must be held down to run. Very similar to Super Mario's control scheme. Then, let's say you're holding a sword, you have to press and hold the A button to swing it (with a delay on the lower tier swords). The A button also controls your jumping. That's 4 inputs plus movement controlling 6 functions all while trying to navigate hazards in the environment. Then combine all of that with the fact that you can only hold one item in your hands at once and every item has different uses, you're having to do an intricate dance with your hands to operate within life or death situations that affect whether or not you have to completely start over. Unfortunatley, the way the controls are designed and how they interact with mechanics are entirely intentional, so readjusting them would require a lot of reworking of some of the game mechanics.

* The music is unbearably repetitive. Especially when you'll be spending a good chunk of time going back through the same areas after you die and restart. Now the two big issues with this, 1) There are certain sound cues tied to dangers/events happening around you that fall under ""music"". Not the worst thing and infrequent, but definitely an issue. 2) There isn't an option to turn off the music in the game. That's pretty basic functionality in my opinion. The workaround is to change the name of the ""Music"" folder in the game's directory to something else, but I don't feel like I should ever be required to do something like that for something literally every game has. Normally, this wouldn't really be a problem, because it's a tendency of rogue-likes. How often can you listen to the same music while dying over and over and not find it repetitive? But without integrated functionality to mute it, it's worth noting.

* Now this is a HUGE issue for me. I'm talking monumental. There is no way to pause or save the game. I understand it's a roguelike where death and restarting are inevitable, but the sheer length of the ""story"" makes the ability to save a necessity. Even pausing alone would be far better than not being able to at all. I had to leave my computer running with the game playing for 11 hours one night, so I could pick up where I left off in a run.

* As for variety, there are a slew of different biomes and hazards/enemies over the course of the game's 50 or so floor run, but each biome is divided into three floors and you'll be rerunning those floors a lot. Now I've put 10 hours into the first 4 biomes alone and I can very confidently tell you that there is not much variety within them. You are always the same guy, albeit with a different name and outfit color. There is hardly any equipment variation. I must have picked up nearly a thousand crates and blast berries at this point. The rarest thing I've found is appropriately and plainly named Golden Greaves. The cool, rare items that do exist are extremely hard to obtain or have a very low chance of coming into play, and they're usually one use items. The same 3-5 enemies/hazards are present in each biome. (Outside of a few random chance environmental hazards. Which I assure you, you don't want to encounter.) There are no unlockables or persistence aspects of any form between runs. The only thing there is to unlock are harder challenges. Which is great if you didn't mind the rough pounding the game gave you the first time around.

*SLIGHT SPOILER* there is a slight bit of persistence in the form of one checkpoint halfway through the story. *END SPOILER*


OVERALL

I respect the two brothers who made this game. They clearly have a passion for niche, hardcore gaming, but that doesn't mean they're infallible nor does it mean that their project is perfect. 5 years is a lot of time to pour into something you care about, and I know critcism is hard to stomach especially with the amount of thought I'm sure you've put into every aspect of the game. Working as a two man unit without all the resources of a bigger company or studio can leave you lacking in certain areas and that's fine. Maybe you two don't want to cater to anything less than the hardcore fanbase, and I respect that, too. But it can and will alienate your game from mainstream titles like the ones mentioned at the start of this review.

Ever think platformers were too easy??  Think you are too hardcore for a platformer??  This game will open your eyes!  

Towerclimb is a brutal platformer that will punish most small mistakes with death.  That ever present threat of immenant death makes the game really epic and enjoyable.  You can purchase revive potions from shopkeeps to help offset the 'one slip and dead' situation.  The controls are very responsive - and 99% of your deaths will be YOUR fault. (whether from lack of skill, stupid decisions, not using/rationing items properly, etc.)   The music is fantastic.  Each run will tend to have a unique feel that requires different platforming skills.  The game has VERY impressive level randomization - which adds to the replay value significantly.  I'd say its definitely worth buying/playing 100%  

Notes - I've played only with an xbox controller and it plays great
           -  I have a high tolerance for dying a lot and learning my way to victory.  If you're impatient or hate dying, this game is probably not for you, lol.
      -Patience, Focus, strategy, intelligence, determination, raw skill, twitch reflexes.....all of these things will help you in this game and create a rewarding experience.  Even with all of this going for you...you will still die....a lot....really a lot.... 
       -Fairly sure the people that downvoted this game about control issues all gave up after a few hours or didn't play with a gamepad.  The controls admittedly have a learning curve - you have to power through it before you will get very far.
     -I personally didn't read any guides or look up any information on this game until after I got to the top of <redacted>  If you take this route - the game will be more of a punishing slog lol.  If you don't care about looking up information - I highly recommend it, as it will open up a lot of useful items and strategy's that make the game generally more enjoyable and survivable.  If you need game info, I highly recommend Tobash's guide.

-update-

Have made significant progress through trials and tribulations - There's really quite a bit more to do in this game for the ultra hardcore platformer lover.  I'm VERY glad I revisited this title and logged in 100+ hours more.  I've been playing with steams remote play feature - with a friend - which is surprisingly really fun.  (this also opens up a whole world of cooperative platforming mechanics that can be quite satisfying - and entertaining - whether you execute them properly or not :P   )  Expect periodic lag for the connecting player in most cases - but with time, patience, and skill  - it can still be played.    Would make an excellent couch co-op game if there's two hardcore climbers in the same spot.  Have noted that the steam overlay can cause some issues with remote play - also having everyone opt in for steam beta 'can' help 'maybe?'

Have tasted victory in a couple places and there's still more to do.  Really impressed with the amount of endgame content that Quazi crammed into this thing.  It's a labor of love and its awesome!

I can honestly say that this game has been an unforgettable experience.  Amazingly with over 1000 death's, I still enjoyed myself significantly!  (somehow?)",1490071303,1612119073,True,8,1,0.552083969116210938,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Seulement, il m'a fallu une vingtaine d'heures pour le comprendre, et tout le reste pour l'apprécier.

C'est à mon sens un joyau rare mais recouvert d'une épaisse couche de pierre :
difficile d'accès voir un brin rebutant au départ, il révèlera toute sa splendeur à ceux qui auront pris la peine d'en gratter la surface. 

Je me lance donc ce long commentaire pour tenter d'expliquer les richesses que possède ce jeu étrange et fascinant, 
et les obstacles qu'ils vous faudra franchir pour pouvoir en profiter ! 


+ NARRATION +
A une époque indéterminée, on incarne l'un après l'autre chaque humain qui tente d'escalader une tour mystérieuse afin d'en percer les secrets. Un scénario simple et très discret, mais c'est surtout l'univers et l'ambiance qui se distinguent :
Towerclimb dégage une atmosphère extrêmement particulière, chargée de mythes, de mystères et de mélancolie.
Je n'avais pas ressenti une ambiance aussi singulière depuis Zelda Majora's Mask ou les jeux de Fumito Ueda, qui possèdent une âme, une personnalité très forte.
Towerclimb fait partie de ces jeux-là.


+ STYLE DE JEU +
C'est un rogue-like platformer façon Spelunky, sauf qu'ici il s'agit de grimper au lieu de descendre...
ce qui est d'autant plus intéressant, car l'ascension est difficile et la crainte de la chute est omniprésente.
On a un petit inventaire pour stocker et utiliser divers objets comme des armes, de l'équipement facilitant l'escalade, 
des potions permettant de sauter plus haut ou de créer une explosion, etc.
On parcourt des niveaux générés aléatoirement mais ayant un thème fixe à chaque fois.
Le jeu est divisé en deux chapitres distincts avec un checkpoint au milieu, bien utile pour s'entraîner.
Le second chapitre est excellent et bien plus créatif que le premier, qui reste plus classique mais très réussi quand même.
Il y a deux boss obligatoires à la fin de chaque chapitre, et le combat final, faites-moi confiance, est vraiment exceptionnel. 


+ GRAPHISMES +
J'étais un peu dubitatif en regardant juste le trailer et les screens, mais une fois immergé dans le jeu manette en main, c'est bien différent. Car dans Towerclimb, le visuel, le rythme du jeu, les musiques, l'ambiance, tous ces éléments communiquent ensemble pour créer une belle atmosphère, cohérente et surprenante. 
Les niveaux sont très variés, avec même certaines thématiques que vous ne retrouverez dans aucun autre jeu de ce genre.
Le style est rétro mais ultra fluide, et il se distingue par une direction artistique chatoyante, très personnelle et singulière. Le rétro n'est clairement pas un cache misère ici. De plus, des FX de lumière étonnants (et de bon goût) viennent moderniser le visuel et dynamiser l'action en permanence.


+ DIFFICULTE +
Towerclimb, c'est l'esprit d'un jeu rétro combiné avec un gameplay nerveux, fluide et moderne.
Difficile et décourageant au début, on se met à maîtriser et à adorer le jeu avec la pratique.
Le challenge est clairement compensé par une réelle courbe de progression hyper gratifiante.
Chaque obstacle semble insurmontable au début, mais avec le recul nous paraîtra bien plus simple à aborder une fois arrivé un peu plus loin. Ce challenge fait partie de la durée de vie du jeu : Comptez une vingtaine d'heures pour maîtriser le chapitre 1, 
et le double pour maîtriser le chapitre 2, qui est d'autant plus dur que fun.


+ GAMEPLAY +
Le gameplay jongle entre des phases nerveuses d'action, d'esquive et de plateforme précise, 
et des temps morts plutôt reposants lorsqu'on est occupé à grimper.
Passé le premier quart du jeu, chaque niveau se renouvelle en adoptant une mécanique différente et unique (notamment dans le chapitre 2). Un niveau où il est interdit de casser le moindre bloc sous peine d'être sanctionné, un autre basé sur le principe d'1, 2, 3, soleil avec des ennemis qui tentent de vous forcer à bouger malgré tout, un autre ne contenant aucun ennemi mais qui est basé sur la seule gestion de votre inventaire, un niveau concentré sinon sur de la plateforme pure et dure... 
Franchement, les idées sont excellentes et variées ! c'est dur au départ, mais également super fun d'apprendre à dompter puis à maîtriser chacune des mécaniques du jeu.


+ COMMANDES +
Il est indispensable de jouer à la manette pour en profiter. 
Les commandes sont très inhabituelles, et on pourrait penser qu'elles sont mal foutues.
En réalité, elles sont précisément adaptées aux mécaniques proposées, et ont été volontairement réfléchies dans le sens du jeu. C'est très rebutant pendant quelques heures, mais si on accepte cette phase d'adaptation et d'apprentissage, 
on se surprendra plus tard à maîtriser le personnage comme jamais, de façon fluide, ultra précise et très agréable.
C'est juste une manière différente d'aborder les commandes, mais il faut simplement le savoir et l'accepter.


+ BANDE SON +
Inattaquable, cette OST de 83 pistes (!) est l'un des très gros points forts de Towerclimb.
Elle colle parfaitement au jeu en renforçant son aura tantôt mystique et mélancolique (on sent les influences de Joe Hisaishi et Koji Kondo, comme en témoignent par exemple ""Chapter 1 Ending"", ou ""Temple of Devotion""), tantôt complètement folle et déjantée, avec une sorte de bitpop cosmique super entraînante (l'incontournable ""Flex Flash"" et les thèmes du ""Final Battle"" vous convaincront à coup sûr). Ah, et les FX sonores sont excellents aussi. Franchement ce jeu, c'est un régal pour les oreilles. J'ai d'ailleurs acheté l'OST sur steam, et c'est la seule que je possède !



- DEFAUTS -

> Impossible de mettre le jeu en pause ! Alors ça c'est incompréhensible, je n'ai jamais vu ça ailleurs.
Heureusement qu'il y a de nombreux safe spots pour pouvoir souffler un peu, se gratter le dos, ou commander une pizza.
Mais vous savez quoi, cette bizarrerie renforce étrangement l'immersion du jeu. Car on est vraiment dedans. Mais bon, ça n'excuse pas.

> Même si c'est parfois facultatif, on aimerait pouvoir crafter des items un peu plus souvent.
Le personnage qui nous permet de le faire apparaît peut-être un peu trop rarement.

> Certains points de gameplay, qui vont plus loin que le tutoriel, sont un peu difficiles à découvrir par soi-même.
Je recommande donc fortement, après quelques heures, d'aller faire un tour sur le wiki du jeu et surtout de regarder des vidéos de pro-gamers jouant à Towerclimb (comme Tobash par ex.) pour comprendre certaines astuces et mécaniques fort utiles afin d'aborder le gameplay plus facilement ! C'est ainsi que j'ai pu m'améliorer très rapidement et découvrir tout le potentiel de ce jeu.


* CONCLUSION *

Towerclimb ne s'adresse pas à tous car il peut être difficile d'accès sous certains aspects.
Tout dépend de vos affinités : si vos aimez les rogues-like, l'esprit rétro modernisé par un gameplay fun et nerveux à dompter, avec un challenge élevé mais hyper gratifiant, le tout enrobé d'une atmosphère mystérieuse et singulière... alors n'hésitez pas un seul instant !
Dans tous les cas, Towerclimb est, à mon sens, un jeu exceptionnel.

Bought Catacomb Kids and it ran like garbage on my machine so used the refund to get Towerclimb. It had been on my wishlist for a long time and every time I would go through to thin the herd a bit the trailer would always get me excited and it would survive the thinning. Finally I bought it. Now, my first impression was actually not so great. The tutorial level is pretty brutal and I felt the controls were very slow and clunky at first. I even considered refunding it. Boy am I glad I didn't. I made a few climbs and it did not take long for me to realize just what a great purchase this was. This game is incredible fun and addictive. Just when I think I""m getting a good strategy the game throws a new challenge at me. The diversity of levels and orientations and obstacles is staggering and once you get a grip on how the game controls it no longer feels clunky. It feels very tight and polished.

Since then, that was my review for a long time. However, I've decided to give this game a more in depth and fair review after almost 50 hours in. 
You will die. There is no exception to this. After every death, you get a death card, and then you start over from the bottom. You have no healthbar; one mistake and your dead. Luckily the game provided revives to help you along the way, but they won't be of any use if you aren't careful. When I first started playing the game, I only thought of it as your typical hard-as-hell rougelike. But every time I died, I went straight back to climbing. You will gradually get better, and the progress is easy to see. Overtime the game has gotten to me. The music is wonderfull, unique, and suprisinly fits each area very well. Along with that, each area has new elements to it that add to the unique challenge each area provides as you climb with the few resources the game provides you. On that note, it is vital that you must utilize everything the game gives you to be succesful. A blast berry you didnt pick up might have you wasting a resource later on, or those golden berries you missed might have become the revive potion you so desperately needed. 
Something so simple as climbing a tower has provided more entertainment and rewarding gameplay then some games do over their lifetime.

An amazing game if you give it the chance. It will not be easy to overcome, but will be well worth it if you take the time to learn. The community is very accommodating and is willing to tell you anything you want to know. It is a shame so few people know of this game.

And the content is vast, not that it takes lots of time, in fact you could 100% (not including death cards) in a few hours, but the sheer amount of time you must take improving your skill is where the length comes from, and Davio and Quazi did it good job of it and made every death seem fair (besides a few) which is important because your gonna die a lot. to wrap this up, this is one of the few games i could give a unbiased 10/10, the one problem i have with it is that there is no sound option which is bad if you talking on  discord or steam, but besides that there is no other problems besides preference, which brings me into my next point that this game is not for everyone, if you are a semi-casual gamer then consider that this game is incredibly hard, it requires nerves of steel, and skills beyond belief, if you don't have patients don't go right into this game, but please if even after all the talk of harsh difficulty, if you are even a tad bit interested get this game, it's only 15$, and has sadly very few sales at just 7k in about a year, give this game the notice it deserves, the community on discord is awesome and the creators often talk about future projects, so please give this game a chance, i'm overjoyed i found this gem and can now call it my favorite single-player, and rouge-lite of all time. thank you Davio and Quazi, please make more games so i can throw all my $DOSH$ at you.",1480716192,1549923898,True,5,0,0.488937079906463623,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I do not recommend this game for you if you haven't played something like it before. It is seriously hard, and there is only 1 checkpoint halfway through the main game.

With that said, onto the review.
This game can be compared to Spelunky, where instead of climbing down, you're climbing up. This game is slower paced and less about reflexes, and more about planning the best path to take and using your resources wisely. Despite the levels being randomly generated, situations where you are forced to lose some of your items to get through a level are rare if you are careful with how you use them.

It might take a while to get used to how the game plays, but once you master the controls, it feels satisfying to pull off tricks that you discover as you play. It may not look like it from the store page, but there is quite a lot of stuff in this game. It starts to really get interesting once you get halfway through the game. You will be exited to climb higher and see what lies ahead.

It took some time to get adjusted to the new world of vertical ascention, but every time I'd re-enter the tower, I'd climb a few feet higher than the last, with every step of the way being met with a fresh new challenge, and all new traps to keep my confidence in check. It's a pain, but such trials only fueled my determination to keep making my way towards the top.  It didn't take long before I knew I was hooked.  I had to know what was up there.

My whole climb was filled with thoughts of what mystery awaited me at the top.  An amazing treasure?  A ferocious guardian?  Every foot higher that I climb pushed me harder to keep going, but I was not prepared for what awaited me at the top.

It's uncommon for a game to completely catch me by surprise and leave me stunned, but making it to the top only made me realize that there was much, much more to this tower than meets the eye. And honestly, what I found at the top was exactly what I wanted to see the most.. but it's something you'll have to discover for yourself.

If you're a tough customer who's ready for some true challenge, then get your gear ready because I cannot recommend this game enough. It's gameplay, atmospheric soundtrack, controls, and challenge are all in perfect sync with one another to create a truly unique and solid experience that towers above other roguelikes.  It's tough as nails and unforgiving from the moment you enter the tower, but I wouldn't have it any other way than to earn the rewards waiting at the top.

-Amazing job on atmosphere. (game gets so much better than it already is as you ascend the tower.)
-Fun and intimidating villains
-Hours of gameplay

[h1] ~ Neutral [/h1]

(basically, what can be called good or bad depending on your preference.)

-Hard (there is a difficulty setting for this game that is good for beginners of the game. And it's not Dark Souls or Battle Toads level of hair-pulling, but is definitely a challenge.)
-Lack of story (there is a story, but it is not much of importance for this game and isn't the focus of the game. That goes for characters too. There IS a story that you can piece together but, like I said, it's not really the focus of the game.)

[h1] - Cons [/h1]
-Controls are slightly finicky (sometimes the controls can be unresponsive)

You do this by running, jumping and climbing walls and ceilings.
It's a simple concept, change the usual right-to-left platforming into an upwards climb. This actually creates many ways of progressing through even relatively simple obstacles. And oh it's executed so well!
You die in one hit and have very limited lives. TowerClimb is hard, but fair. Almost all of the obstacles and enemies are either stationary, or slow and predictable in their movements. Not only that but they also have a set up time and audio/visual cues. You have a fair amount of vision around the climber, giving you a chance to spot enemies from below and think of a way around in advance.
The level layouts are randomly generated, making this game about routing your way up in a way that preserves your resources while not dying. To change things up, there are many different parts of the tower that have enemies and tiles unique to them.
There are also items, like swords, magic wands, springs, hookshots and many more to help you get to the top.

I really like this game; the moment-to-moment gameplay that requires critical thinking and ability to execute difficult maneuvers, fact that almost every death is caused by the player misplaying instead of random bullshit, many things to master.. It's so good.

The amount of buttons (they will take up every button of your controller) and weird way of how the button for running is also used for grabbing and throwing items will take a bit to get used to, but other than that I see no reason to NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW ITS AND EMBARK ON THE JOURNEY TO COLLECT EVERY DEATH CARD AND KICK SOME TRASHBAG WIZARD ASS IT IS PURE JOY TO PLAY.",1475494595,1479998956,True,3,0,0.504761874675750732,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Every time I play, I feel as if I'm controlling a brave human being with opinons, a family who loves them, an identity, opinions of his or her own, and complete obedience, so when I accidentally jump into a spinning fan blade I feel as if I've foolishly wasted someone's life. Most games just churn out the same protagonist over and over. Despite a simple procedural trick, I feel much more involved with the characters and their elation when we find a pair of climbing gloves, and their fear when they fall from an almost-fatal height.

TowerClimb's visual style is a combination of dynamic lighting and crunchy pixels, and it's beautiful. The character animations are expressive, especially when the avatar pushes against a block or wall. That specific animation almost looks rotoscoped. I can imagine a backstory where the Climbers don their ceremonial one-color climbing suit. The color changes for every climber, so it feels like each avatar has a unique identity.

The controls don't make sense at first, but perservere and they become natural.

The gameplay is tight, hard but mostly fair, though the giant worm miniboss is a bit OP. Even touching its abdomen is fatal, and I think that makes it really to escape it when one is cornered.

There are lots of secrets and side-quests, so the replay value is high, though I haven't beaten the main quest yet I can imagine playing through multiple times to explore the secrets.

The music is great, and very evocative of each level's theme. The music in panic levels, like when the lava rises or the worm chases you, is pretty good at getting novice players to crack under stress and die, which is always entertaining. It takes some concentration to tune it out, but it's doable.

There's substantial support and hints on the wiki, so novice players such as myself can pick up a lot of the knowledge required for a successful run, but don't be fooled, this game is very skill-based. The game includes a playthrough log, so I can clearly see that I'm getting progressively better.

I'm glad it's not item-based, and I'm glad that nothing carries over from my previous runs. The game is very well balanced, and you will become a better Climber with experience. Good luck!

TowerClimb is a game in which, oddly enough, you climb a tower.  It is very difficult, and every death comes as a learning experience. There are tonnes of nuances and tricks that you learn as you play to improve your speed and efficiency, and figuring new ones out is always satisfying.  Compared to other games in this genre, Towerclimb plays much slower, and many players actually dislike that weapons aren't something you get to use very frequently. There also isn't any form of unlock system found in other roguelite games where even if you die you're still making progress.  Despite this, TowerClimb is perfect for those who don't mind starting from square one at every death, and love learning from their mistakes.  
===========================
[b]Pros:[/b]
===========================
-Extremely difficult (for those who enjoy that sort of thing)
-Very few deaths feel ""unfair"", and even the ones that are unfair are still a learning experience
-Excelent sound track
-Photos of all of your deaths get listed on a handy-dandy chart so you can view your progress and possibly see where your mistakes have been made 
-The wiki isn't very expansive. This is a good thing, as finding things out on your own is just so much better.
===========================
[b]Cons:[/b]
===========================
-Extremely difficult (for those who don't enjoy that sort of thing)
-Some runs can take upwards of an hour , so if you don't have much time to spend on this game you might not like it
-The main mode as a ""side quest"" that is heavily dependant on RNG being in your favor

-------------------------------------

[b]TL;DR:[/b] It's a wonderful game. Very tough, but with many different nuances and tricks, you can learn to master the tower. After all, every death is a learning experience.

Tout, ou presque (y compris certains bonus) peut vous tuer, et pourtant, rien de véritablement injuste. Avec un peu de prudence, il peut vous arriver de comprendre et de surmonter un obstacle qui vous était complètement inconnu auparavant.

Les contrôles sont difficiles à appréhender au départ, mais une fois maitrisés, vous vous rendrez compte de leur richesse : ce qu'ils permettent, en termes de gestion de situations, est prodigieux. Vous finirez par savoir ce que vous pouvez faire ou non, et à quelles conditions. Vous vous surprendrez à passez aisément des lieux qui vous avaient semblés impossibles, tout simplement parce que vous aurez compris le fonctionnement des divers éléments. Ce qui est particulièrement agréable est que la génération procédurale nous confronte à des situations toujours nouvelles, mais composées d'éléments dont on apprend vite à prévoir le comportement (pâles de ventilateur, lasers, blocs qui tombent, pics, et même animaux, obéissent tous à des schémas très simples).

Un mot sur la direction artistique : il s'agit d'un pixel-art assez sommaire, dans une résolution trop basse pour nos écrans, forçant presque à jouer en mode fenetré. Et pourtant, le filtre appliqué à ces pixels, qui donne un aspect impressioniste, contribue, avec la bande son magnifique, à former une véritable ambiance. 
Or, cette création d'une ambiance, quand on l'ajoute à celle de situations inédites par le gameplay et les éléments du monde du jeu, fait selon moi de ce jeu un véritable chef d'oeuvre.
On voit que la personne (je crois qu'elle était plus ou moins seule) qui a fait ce jeu l'a travaillé, avec passion, jusque dans ses moindres détails. Elle y a même mis un humour surprenant et discret, qui insuffle au titre une personnalité forte (je n'en dirai pas plus pour ne pas gâcher les surprises).

Enfin, car c'est important : le contenu est suffisamment important pour vous donner envie de jouer pendant longtemps. Je ne sais pas exactement l'étendue de ce que propose le jeu, car je ne l'ai pas fini, mais ce que j'en ai vu justifie déjà, à mon sens, l'achat du jeu au prix ""fort"".


En résumé : roguelike exigeant avec direction artistique incroyable.

But this game is different. It doesn't feel like a game. It feels like an ADVENTURE. The music, the atmosphere, the imaginative level, monster, and character designs all make this world feel like more than just another rearrangement of the same levels.

First of all, for a roguelike, it has absolutely no mercy. Imagine if Spelunky and I Wanna Be The Guy meet, and you get an idea of how difficult it is.

On top of that, the game is long, and the challenge keeps growing as the levels go on.
So, basically, what you need to play this game is patience, humility, and sheer determination if you want to reach the end... so it's not a good fit for everyone.

Besides your additionnal ""HP"", you can also count your ressources (potions, items) as another HP bar too, because if you run out of them, the terrain generation may likely stop you.

I've done it all, every gamemode requires a different approach and different skills, the most common in all of them is endurance. Beating it has never been more worth it from any other game I've played. Even with no steam achievements, I deeply feel every bit of success this game offered. This game left me a print that won't never go away.

Pros :
- The atmosphere. The musics are fitting very well to the slow pace of the game.
- The original way to manage items. It's part of the steep learning curve.
- The feeling of accomplishement once you complete something (quest, zones, mini games)
- No time limit. You can take all the time you want to strategize your actions and manage your items. (except when there is lava, but that's close to non-existent in later stages)
- A perfect run require to fill your inventory with key items, which makes the game all the more challenging for those who could find this game somewhat easy.
- Multiplayer. Reviving your teammates is cheaper than reviving yourself. Inventory is shared among players so there's no way to cheese the legend fragment run ;)

Anti-Pros :
- 1 checkpoint, practicing the later stages can be very brutal.
- No steam achievement (yet ?)
- The coliseum of 50 waves, oh dear.
- No pausing, even when the windows is out of focus. At least you can wait at places where you're safe.

TowerClimb provides a very unique blend of atmosphere and challenge.
There are a plethora of opportunities to utilize the environment to your advantage: Need something to kill those monsters? Blow up those spikes and use them as improvised throwing weapons. Want equipment to climb even faster? Cook the rat meat in lava and give them to the crafter when you see him next etc.
Dangers you will face include terrain eating giant worms, rising lava, malevolent mages and spinning lazers; which you can often twist to your advantage to.

The soundtrack is amazing, and reaches a whole new level in the second chapter. The same can be said about the evolution of the graphics. The dev team have been extremely active in addressing player feedback across the last 5 years of the games development.

[h1]Not for everyone?[/h1]
Be advised that it is also one of the most brutal platformers out there. Most players won’t see beyond the first 1/3rd of the content the game has to offer within the first 50 hours.
You can only carry one (replenishable) revive potion at a time (two on ""easy"" mode) and there are a few hazards like lava that will destroy you instantly regardless. BS deaths are extremely rare (<5% of deaths) but there are a few things early on that could be telegraphed better (like giant bats suddenly zipping across the screen). There is only one checkpoint for chapter 2 after the 20th floor. The game is very fair, however, and with the right combination of practice, brains and reflexes you will prevail...

Controls are a bit different, but become very intuitive after with an hour of practice or less (not sure why so many of those posting negative reviews played only a few minutes and forgot that they are fully rebindable).
My main nit-pick is that there is currently no proper way to pause the game if you're interrupted (though you can use <alt> in windowed mode, but this won't allow you to swap to other applications mid play). Thankfully though it usually only takes a few minutes to get to reach the safety of the transition screen.

[h1]Game Content/Length[/h1]
In terms of content the game is huge: There are 14 main areas, each having some of their own unique mechanics across 46 levels. Such include bug sanctuaries, factories of death, disco club of twisted apparitions etc. There are some deadly secret areas to such as the world within the arcade machine as well as bonus unlockable game modes like Z-Ball.
The levels themselves are randomized each time you play so you’re forced to learn generalist strategies rather than rote learn layouts.
I've played a lot of roguelite platformers (also involved in making one called ""Aura of Worlds""), and I found that TowerClimb has provided over 100 hours of engagement post main campaign. I still need to complete the bonus challenges such as the Colossus arena and 7 legendary fragment run...

I know a whole bunch of people will likely be getting this game due to it being on the sales. So, let me just say up front. This is a game that requires a lot from you. And well...I came close to not reaching those requirements. See, the controls are very unusual - They take a LOT of getting used to and they are VERY frustrating to use at first. So frustrating that, for the past half hour of play, I had been seriously considering getting a refund on this - But not due to any real fault of the developer. Any other time, I would have been okay to just eat the paltry £6 cost and put it on my ""to come back to"" pile. But I am currently between jobs, so I do not have the luxury to do that. If I got a game, I told myself, it had to be something I would be happy investing in, so at first, I was close to refunding it. 

But then I got better at the game. 

Oh man. This is the sort of game you got back in the day where you intially find it terrible, but because you were a kid and refunds weren't a viable option, you'd keep muscling through, trying to like it...Until eventually you have that breakthrough and end up adoring it. 

Something clicked with me on my tenth run, and I got all the way up to floor 8. It was exhilirating. 

I would give this a tentative reccomendation, just...Know what you're getting in for. But if you're the sort of gamer that can deal with wonky controls if it results in a wonderful experience once you're used to it...Go for it. I've made far worse investments on Steam.

EDIT: 24 hours of played time later, and I have to say that the game only gets better as time goes on. Everyone thinks I'm an utter lunatic, but I love this game now. I love it so, so much. I will not spoil anything, but...After the halfway point (You'll know when it is), the game just takes a massive, unpredictable turn and goes absoloutly off the wall. Saying any more would spoil the ""WHOAAAAA"" aspect of it that I had, but...It is almost Undertale levels of out-of-nowhere depth and change. 

And something I forgot to mention before? The music. OH. MY. GOD. Why is it that obscure games tend to have truly incredible soundtracks? This is a prime example, and more people need to hear it. So underrated, but so amazing.

I will start this review by pointing out some core features which can hold you back from enjoying/buying the game.
[list]
[*]The game is very difficult, has a steep learning curve and involves a lot of skill
[*]The game contains only one checkpoint. It will take probably 30 min to reach the checkpoint and 1.5 hours to beat the game starting from this checkpoint. Total game length is approximately 2 hours.
[*]No Save & Exit feature
[*]It has permadeath
[*]Pixel Graphics
[*]This is not a rogue-like game but has rogue-like elements, you should buy this game mainly because you like platformers. I Don't recommend buying it if you are looking for a rogue-like game.
[*]Controls: Scroll down to the Controls & Physics section for the reason why.

[h1]Game description and my experience[/h1]

In this platformer your goal is to reach the top of the tower. This will be mainly achieved by climbing the side of blocks and wall of the tower. There are 46 floors (excluding many secret floors). The theme of the floors change every 3 floors, like 3 snow covered floors after 3 lava maps etc. The floors are littered with blocks, enemies, items, chests, obstacles and sometimes a witch which will sell you potions and lifes or a crafter which will craft items if you hand over multiple items and a small fee for crafting (check out the wiki for item combinations). Resources help you overcome the tower and on some floors it is a requisite. So gathering resources is an important element in the game. Items can change your character's properties like raising run and climbing speed.

On normal difficulty you will carry one extra life which can be refilled at the witch for a few golden berries, which are spread throughout the floors. The layout of the floors is randomized thanks to procedural generation and keeps the replayability high, creating unique situations and is the major reason why I think this the most replayable platformer I have encountered. This also makes sure the game involves a lot of skill and takes away being good at the game by memorizing the level unlike many other platformers. You will die a lot in this game not because the game is unfair but more like the slightest misstep often result in death.You need to train yourself to become better and reach higher floors. Persistency is key here. It took me 15 hours to reach the checkpoint and finished the game exactly at the 100 hour mark for a game with a length of 2 hours while I'm familiar with difficult platformers.

This game is about improving your runs which will probably happen with baby steps. The game can play with your mental state for example, when you are closing in at the end and aware that every small misstep means that you throw away all your progress can make an ordinary jump look like an extreme hurdle, it suddenly becomes a scary thing. The process up until the moment you die is fun but never frustrating and can be tense. The reason is because this game is fair, there are no cheap shots. If you die it always is due to your own fault. Once you get the hang of the controls and being familiar at what the tower is throwing at you the experience changes from a slight tense to a relaxing one where mastering the game feels almost zen-like. 

Reaching higher floors feel rewarding especially clearing the game similar as what Dark Souls does. Level design is not only diverse for its graphical appearance but also for its playstyle. Some floors require fast or slow climbing, avoiding certain enemies, let you use more resources or force you to use certain objects. You are not simply playing the game but rather experience it. Conquering the tower feels like completing an epic journey. 

[h1]Controls & Physics[/h1]

The first thing you will notice when starting out is the, what you will think of, weird control layout. There are multiple functions assigned to a button. For example jump and attack shares the same button, so you cannot attack without jumping. This is done because there will be moments where you have to do a combination of different actions within a short timeframe like jumping, catching an item, store this item, dodging an enemy, Scroll through your inventory to take a different weapon and attack the same enemy. It doesn't work if you are playing twister on your controller when using one button for every action. The control scheme does make sense, although this doesn't seem obvious when you first start out, keep this in mind. This point is repeatedly brought forward in negative reviews, people don't seem to understand.

The most common things I don't like in general with platform games are lag between controls and the actual movement of the character, the feel if as characters are walking on ice especially when turning around or floaty physics. There are no such things in towerclimb, the controls are responsive, tight and the physics are spot on. You may struggle with the controls due to the layout and it takes a while before getting used to as described above. Another important factor to me is the flow of the gameplay, which is fine in this game, you are always on the move.

[u]Small sidenote[/u]: Using the left trigger while holding the right one and vice versa on a xbox 360 controller doesn't work. Using them simultaneous is impossible. You can solve it by using the cheap software called Controller Companion on steam. Even if you don't buy this game I highly recommend that piece of software.

[h1]Graphics, Sound & Music[/h1]

The graphics of this game are minimalistic. You can argue that it is a step back from modern gaming but in the end it comes down whether you like the pixel style. I like the pixel style and also see it more as an art style. Despite the minimalistic approach there is a lot attention to detail. When it comes down to sounds there is great diversity although simple. Every item has its own sound when executing an attack, throwing or picking it up. Enemies have different sounds for movement, patrolling, attacking, being attacked etc. A strong point of this game is its great soundtrack. The musics fits the game very well, from ambient eerie sounds, mysterious tunes to dance music. It has characteristic tracks with great diversity. It really helps setting the mood on a floor.

[h1]Final Word[/h1]

I played a lot of platform games in my life from old school titles like the Mario, Crash Bandicoot and Donkey Kong Country series to modern platformers like N+ and Super Meat Boy, but I have to say this is the best platformer I have played. DKC2 was my favorite one for almost 20 years up till the moment I played towerclimb. It is also the most difficult, replayable and addictive one, a true classic in my book and ridiculously overlooked. A prime example of an indie gem lost in a sea of titles on steam. Or like a reviewer mentioned ''It's probably the best kept secret on steam right now actually''. Worth every penny. One thing that can make this game even better is a level editor, including level sharing via steam workshop.

Towerclimb is a difficult game. It has permadeath, and little forgiveness for mistakes. The gameplay consists of you trying to climb as the inside of this tower as high as you can, in hopes to reach the top. You achieve this mainly through platforming. There are climbing mechanics, your character can climb on walls and ceilings to get to where they need to go.

There are a ton of items you can use to survive and climb higher. These items add a very light RPG element to the game and different players will have different preferred methods for survivng the terrible tower. 

The art design look great. It has a very dark and foggy atmposhphere. The music is also very good- dark and foggy but also triumphant and powerful.

Im in the tutorial and im so frustrated by the controls, it just makes no sense.

I am supposed to pick up an item from the ground by standing still on an item but holding the sprint button (which is just contradictory), and press C to add it to my inventory for some reason, while my inventory opens with W. In the inventory you have to press CTRL to switch items per example. The tutorial then asks to place a crate, but items are automatically thrown away when you release the button, so you have to hold the button or the item will be thrown. To place the crate on the ground, you have to throw it upwards, which is a strange solution but alright. Then I get a weapon and I am supposed to attack with it by sprinting and jumping at the same time (???) It just all feels so wrong, the hotkeys chosen, the way they need to be executed, so much feels wrong, im sorry. I rather watch someone play it than play it myself. 

Also why does the 30seconds intro play every time ?
Edit: You can close the intro with pressing ""X""

@Devs, you really need to rework this control system, its a total mess and breaks all conventions of what people know about controlling a platformer. Its strange, complicated, unintuitive and makes me want to stop the game before ending the tutorial. Keys are somewhat rebindable but these are mostly that can not be fixed by changing keys.

Towerclimb does simple things wrong that Mario did right 20 years ago.

You've only played 30 minutes, barely enough time to even scratch the surface of this game or it's controls, or why they were made this way.

You claim that you can't jump off the wall ""like in super meat boy"". If you played this game longer than 30 minutes you'd have easily figured out this can be done with jump potions/aura. Comparing this game's controls to simple twitch platformers like meat boy is like asking why a roguelike isn't as simple as pacman. It's simply an invalid comparison. There's much more that can be done in this game. Here's a quote from someone with 500+ hours playtime: 

""People have complained that the controls are very inconvenient and don't make very much sense. Trust me, they do, and you'll get the hang of it with some practice."" 

Play, and you'll see that the controls make sense once you understand the game and it's nuances. There's a lot of subtle things you can do. This game is very strategic, complex, and vast. Do not expect to be good at the game in 30 minutes.

You claim throwing the crate upwards is the only way to place it on the ground. You can simply hold down and drop it. Since the tutorial didn't tell you this word for word, you thought you could only place it by throwing it straight up.

You claim the intro plays every time. You can skip it by pressing jump.

You claim switching items with CTRL isn't explained, when it VERY CLEARLY is.

You simply got frustrated at a game you didn't play, and a control scheme you didn't immediately understand, and left a negative review full of misformation, based on controls you don't understand. There's a reason many people say this game is among their all time favorites; just read any reviews with actual playtime.

If you get frustrated by learning a unique control scheme then this game might be too much for you. Complete the game, then come back and say the controls don't make sense. You won't if you get that far."

 there is also more story then i expected, and the sections ive managed to uncover have left me enthralled with the conquest of this game. their are great and terrible things waiting to happen and be remembered in the tower. and only Endurance willl yield them.

Why do I love this game? It's like Spelunky but reversed, looks less polished but feels far more intricate, and detailed. The way you go about a level varies a lot more than Spelunky does, and when you die over and over like you will, it doesn't get boring! It stays as fun every try. You will die a lot, and you will die most of the time by making stupid mistakes. But that's what makes it fun! It's brutally difficult.

It's intense.

Once you know how the control works it becomes an incredible journey. You are a man/woman. You want to climb the tower. You are weak but you are resourceful. You never felt so impowered and powerless at the same time. You feel the clinging to the rock as if your life depends on it. There is jumps that you will question because you won't be sure if the distance is close enough to make it. You will be put in situations that may force you to use an item because it's the differnce between life and death. Often death will come A lot. The controls are tight, the music fits perfectly, and I like the art (pixelated, not the weird filter seen in the trailer).

It's a good game. Strongly recommend it if you enjoy Spelunky or other roguelike/lite games.

Last, there is a log of all the deaths you encounter with a kill screenshot for each one. It's really cool to see your progress on an interactive graph. If you ever feel discouraged playing this game, take a look at the graph and you can see yourself get better as you play. I still die on lower floors but it makes me want to climb higher.

Este jogo é muito bom, Tower Climb é um jogo de Aventura, Rogue-Like e Procedural, isso significa que cada vez que você jogar, será uma partida diferente. O jogo é bem desafiador, mas como a maioria dos jogos, se você pegar a manha de como lidar com os inimigos você facilmente consegue evita-los.

No Tower Climb o melhor que você pode fazer para lidar com os inimigos é evita-los, matar apenas em casos extremos aonde sua vida dependa da morte do inimigo, pois você não tem muito recurso para gastar tentando mata-los.

O grafico do jogo é muito bonito e os auidos são bem legais, as musicas são viciantes.

Apenas um erro com este jogo, os comandos são uma bosta.
Não me pergunte o porque mas os Devs deste jogo acharam que seria melhor por o botão de ""Attack"" e ""Jump"" no mesmo comando, forçando os jogadores  a pularem 100% das vezes que for atacar os inimigos, algo completamente sem logica, na minha opinião. Se os Devs fossem mais inteligentes eles veriam que isso é imbecil e adicionariam um comando novo para separar o botão de ""Jump"" e de ""Attack"".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVy7oY8-f-U

[H1]The Good[/H1] Fantastic, suspenseful rogue-lite experience full of thrills and endless content. Earthy, low-resolution pixel art combined with pretty lighting effects oozes atmosphere. Tight, responsive controls. Lots of level variety, fully destructable environments. Sometimes it makes you think slow and carefully, working your way through environmental puzzles while trying to conserve resources. Other times it will push you to your limit, forcing you to work your way up the tower as fast as humanly possible. 6-player local cooperative (fantastic). Supports split-screen or same-screen, but I have yet to test that feature.

[H1]The Bad[/H1] Technically primitive. Screen stretching not implemented well, so playing without a black border seems like a no-go (for now). Head-scratching interface choices (Shift-Esc to exit to main menu?), and analog controls that desperately need a dead-zone adjustment. One slip could kill you, you don't want it to be the fault of your controller. The control scheme itself could benefit from few more buttons, as you often find yourself playing twister with your fingers to pull items out, keep them in hand, and use them with care.

[H1]The End[/H1] Highly recommended for fans of the Rogue-lite genre, specifically fans of Spelunky. This is Spelunky in reverse, but more cerebral, and more suspenseful.

It's hard to put my finger on exactly, but I think it was a combination of soft-edged sprites and synth woodwind soundtrack that gave a lot of titles a deep, otherworldly feel. TowerClimb somehow manages to evoke that same sense of depth and wonder while relentlessly murdering me again and again in the most delightful ways.

Part of the unique feel of TowerClimb comes from the mysterious, parable-like setup for the game. There are immense stone towers, people keep trying to climb them, and no one knows what's at the top. You control a never-ending series of unfortunates who challenge the tower, mantling up through floor after deadly floor. It plays a lot like a reverse Spelunky, with your character able to run, jump, scale walls, and crawl along ceilings in search of the exit high above. In place of treasure are tools like crates and springs, and golden berries that can be traded for potions that let you double-jump, break blocks, and teleport.

You're going to need every move and tool at your disposal, though, because the levels in TowerClimb are bizarre and merciless. Sometimes you'll enter a level and it'll start filling with lava. Sometimes everything will be coated in acid. Sometimes carnivorous worms burst from the walls. And sometimes there are pleasant, floaty dandelion-things to ride... straight into the jaws of a bloodthirsty hound. Even if the level gimmick isn't out for your hide, the random generation might very well give you an improbable network of tricky jumps to the exit, far worse than anything you may have encountered in the likes of Spelunky. I'm not kidding about the challenge here, and if not for all the neat things to find and entertaining ways to die, it might not be worth overcoming.

But there is indeed a lot to discover in the tower, and the pixellated graphics make experimentation essential to figuring out what you're encountering. Enemies may get the best of you the first time you meet them, in part because they can be very unpredictable but mainly because you might not know what they are at first. You'll run into all manner of plants and animals, NPCs, chests, shortcuts, and more among the randomly-generated floors. Navigating is always challenging given some of the layouts, but your control over your character is very precise and allows for masterful moves once you fully grok the mantling.

It's hard and you're going to die a ton, but TowerClimb makes it look so good you'll hardly mind. The graphics remind me very much of the old SNES Lemmings port, with chunky detail and silky-smooth animations and bizarre, impossible terrains. Sound design is also excellent, with some very detailed effects and a soundtrack reminiscent of ancient titles like Soul Blazer and Super Metroid in parts. The unexpected nostalgia rush definitely colors my view but make no mistake, TowerClimb is a tight, challenging roguelike platformer with plenty of wonders to offer.

It's one of my favourite platformers ever. Together with spelunky, this was a procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements before it was cool (it's been in development for that long).

Don't expect Spelunky though. Towerclimb is slower, grittier and even more difficult. You have to be even more careful and it's more about evasion than killing stuff. It's fun cause it's difficult and you die a lot. There are several general level themes in the first part of the game (standard caves, jungle, lava caverns...) and special levels (rising lava, water levels, levels where you fly on giant flying plant ballons and more/weirder). And once you finish that, which will take closer to tens of hours, there's chapter two that has more specific (some could say gimmicky, imo a good thing in a game like this) and even more difficult levels, where the gameplay is a bit different.

The graphics was pixel art before it was cool. It's pretty nice and features some cool shader effects, but I understand people who have enough of that. Also the music is excellent.

Towerclimb has local coop and it is even more fun (and a bit easier, since, unlike spelunky, it's not that easy to harm each other. The biggest problem is that setting up controllers is a pain in the ass.

This definitely belongs among the best roguelite platformers and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys the genre.

This game is a hidden gem between so many terrible games on steam.

I'm 20 hours in so far in the steam version (I already played the beta),  and havent been able to complete chapter 2 yet, and I consider myself pretty damn good. I have seen only a glimpse of some the secrets hidden in the game, strange items, optional hidden areas, hidden game modes and alot more stuff. I can see myself playing this for at least 100 hours, or more because I bet it takes me more time to find everything.

If you like hard platformes, a huge load of content, great soundtrack, lots and lots of secrets  and a great atmosphere then just go and buy this.


Go and climb that tower.

The premise of the game is simple: Your character, through some sort of sheer bravery, lust for death or perhaps morbid curiosity, decides to enter a tower full of monsters, traps and random layouts to climb to the top (Cause why the hell not?).

There's really nothing else to the game. Im serious! That's [i]literally[/i] all this game is about! The experience whilst climbing the tower however is unbelievably satisfying and I have to admit i never though i'd see myself replaying this game again.

The game is kept extremely simple. Simple controls, simple UI (I think all there is is that menu on the left that displays your current inventory, items etc) simple shop/npc system (All ive seen so far is some guy asking for stuff and a witch selling you potions/items) and simple goal (Get to the top). In fact, there really is no reason to look at a wiki or guide for this game since everything is so simple to figure out (Or that could just be me).

I think one thing the game does very well is making everything your own doing. I dont know how to put it. If you fall to your death/get mauled by a dog/burn in lava/ dismembered by a trap/ punctured by spikes and all sorts of other things, its [i]entirely your fault[/i]. In retrospect, it is a really does feel like an achievement when you actually do make it out past a level without dying. Very little is left to chances and alot of it is to do with skill. That's something i found enjoyable.

In terms of content however, im not exactly sure. Im not one to look into wikis and guides cause in my extreme minority opinion, looking at a guide or wiki destroys a very large part of playing the game (Figuring out stuff!). With that said, ive only seen very few items variety, 2 special level events (Lava and a worm thing), about 4 to 5 different map biome/layout/type, 2 NPCs and 1 special door (Path of exiles shortcut). I dont know if this was planned to make the game remain as simple as possible or not but it's very likely that im still missing out on a ton of content such as secrets and future levels (I believe I've only made it up until 2.5k feet).

I guess the best way to make a comparison for this game is to say it's upward spelunky with less content and [strike]more tears[/strike] more skill. Either ways, im pretty sure this game is worth the 30RM/10$ i paid for it. At least im pretty darn sure it's better spent on them then [i]SOME[/i] other games...",1448866039,1448866067,True,1,0,0,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The idea of the game and its unique art style immediately caught my attention. I had been familiar with rogue-likes and different platformers; the original Spelunky is one of my favorite games and I saw a lot of similar aspects in TowerClimb. 

I finally made the jump to purchase the game in April of 2015 while the game was still in beta and began playing it religiously. I got a good deal of my own friends into it and they themselves enjoyed the challenge posed by simply Chapter 1. The gameplay feels fluid and reminds me of the classic platformers I grew up loving. Since then, the game has only improved and expanded. It is amazing to look back and see that so many years of work and dedication were put into the making of this game and the same work and dedication that comes from the community.

I am proud to have been a part of TowerClimb in my own little way and hope that it can entertain you just like it has for me. 

If I had to summarize what I enjoy about the game, the major points would be a great soundtrack and the mental challenge it gives. At the beginning of a run, you can take it slowly and space out every jump, but as the game gets more hectic and fast-paced, you really feel your mind kicking into overdrive just to make the precise movements and grabs you need to survive. TowerClimb properly has proposed a puzzle that players feel a desire to solve. Learning piece by piece lets you truly experience the game, but an active community and veterans from half a decade ago are available to help out a novice player.

I like to call this game the Quake of roguelike platformers, because just like Quake it offers raw, fun and deterministic  gameplay free of any unnecessary distractions.

If you want to prove your skill and test your mettle, look no further - the game will challenge your both strategic and tactical decision making as you climb to reach the top while avoiding rabid dogs, throwing spikes at rats and taking leaps of faith to dodge magic missiles cast by the mad wizard.

Thankfully you're not entirely defenseless - you begin the journey equipped with [b]4 kinds of potions[/b] - 3 granting instant effects when used and the 4th acting as one-time revival*, that you can occasionally replenish - for a price. 

During your gameplay you will stumble upon a variety of items that will often prove [i]indispensable[/i] in advancing higher, ranging from spring boxes, spears and boomerangs, through various equipment enhancing your movement abilities to magical orbs and wands, [i]arcane steaks[/i] and even legendary weaponry!

As you climb higher, you'll get a chance to visit different sections of the tower - each with its own distinct look, set of challenges and mechanics - be it often flooded [b]conservatory[/b] inhabited by worms, piranhas and exploding seed pods, icy platforms of [b]ancient ruins[/b] with windy passages and unsettlingly long, sharp and fragile stalactites hanging as if in anticipation, [b]the heart[/b], a hellish home to lava bats that will grab any careless adventurer and hurl him into the omnipresent lava... and that's just the beginning.

And if you're feeling especially brave, you might be tempted to take a shortcut through the infamous [b]path of exile[/b] - but very few survived to tell the tale.

High risks and high rewards.

The controls...will take some time to get used to...

you either do a swan dive or you climb like hell.

this is an absolutely vicious platformer.You really have no weapons...you mainly try to avoid problems.

Long form - This game is recommended for persistant, dedicated, patient players. It is *very* old school tough and it does NOT cater to people who are looking for a game with all the (cough) ""features"" of modern rogue-lites like constant saves, several lives,  and character building mechanics that make successive runs easier; this game gives you none of that. This is 80's-90's tough, at least when you are starting out. Then you play more, get a bit farther, learn what things to watch out for, learn how far you jump and the way you can move in the air. You begin to understand how the monsters and traps work. Then, gradually you can get to floor 8, then 10, then 19 and finally you beat chapter 1. And when you do reach the top for your first time your heart, I gauruntee you this, will feel like it is about to explode with a mix of anxiety, fear, and joy. Then your baloon ride up puts you into chapter 2. You can relax a bit at this point because you can now access chapter 2 content without having to beat the tower again. Which BTW...

**Acessing chapter 2 is done by picking-up the ""2"" to the right of the Tower Entrance and bringing it to the portal during the new game scene. The skull, if brought to the portal, activates Centurion Trials.**

 On the negative, a downside faced by new players is that It has *very* nuanced and subtle mechanics and ""tricks"" that are not laid out clearly. Almost none of these tricks are required for beating the first chapter but knowing them and using them well makes the climb to the top significantly safer.",1443808532,1443808532,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The controls are solid, and at first glance, seem extremely simple. However, with enough experimentation and practice, you'll slowly realize a whole spectrum of mobility options available to you. With each technique you learn, new paths to traverse the difficult terrain will unfold before your eyes.

Although most of the story is inferred, this is a game rich with music, ambiance and theme. The slow ardous task of climbing could have made for a very dull game, but each floor offers out new and exciting challenges to overcome. Throw in some different random events and variations, and you'll be thankful for just an extra second to plan your next move.

The core themes of this game are mastery and discovery. Each set of three floors you surpass will lead you to a new ""zone"" which will have a different visual theme. Watch the trailer if you want to see some of those in more detail. In addition to the mechanics that must be mastered to progress through each zone, each zone has a sort of philosophical theme that you must master as a person, as well. For example, some zones test your ability to plan ahead, whereas others will test your ability to think quickly.

One thing to note is that this is a very difficult and punishing game. Normally, sessions only take less than 30 minutes. By my first 30, I had died probably 25 times. However, as you learn, you will blow through the early stages very quickly. Reaching the first and only checkpoint takes about a 30 minute session, once you've mastered the controls and concepts.

Currently, there is no way to save any progress inside of the Tower. Once you unlock the checkpoint, that's it. People have suggested a save/quit feature, and we may see it in a future patch. 

Regardless of whether another checkpoint is added or save/quit gets added, I still fully reccommend this title. There is so much to enjoy and there are tons of unlockables that take quite a bit of effort to achieve.

Easily one of the best features is the local co-op; this game is a blast if you have some friends around to play it with.

TowerClimb is absolutely a fantastic game, great pixel-art (which can be depixelated via settings!) amazing music and it has the most replayability you could possibly get out of a procederally generated world based video game. I originally bought the beta and I've been playing it for a little over one year and I'm still not bored of it.

Trying to set my bias aside, here are some pros and cons about TowerClimb:
Pros:
- Replayability: TowerClimb has probably the most replay value I've seen compared to most dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes and similar games. Every time you play you get different events, you discover to new areas and you die in a variety of fantastic different ways (105 different deaths to be exact).
- Aesthetic: There are a lot of pixel-art oriented games out there, especially in the genre of platforming, however TowerClimb does it quite well above and beyond the rest. Using a blend of visual effects and pixel-art you get a wonderfully crafted world with complete consistency.

Cons:
- Controls: While TowerClimb is great, I am curently at a stand-still with the controls. Even after mapping the controls to a controller--GCN controller in my case--I am still not quite happy with them. Over all you've got probably 12 different keys needed to play, for example: 3 for potions, 3 for inventory, 4 to move(possibly 5 if you re-map jump) along with the run key and item-store key. So the controls can be a bit of a mess a first, but they are re-configurable with up to 25 different profiles, so there isn't too much of a problem once you've finally settled in.

My overall score is 9/10. Controls aside, TowerClimb is too fantastic to pass up.",1443297627,1443297627,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's got many things in its favor: the danger is everywhere, but you get plenty of ways to deal with it; the controls are smooth and fast; the different areas are all quite distinct, but also predictable enough that you should be able to learn how to face them. Perhaps the only problem is that, due to the randomized platforms, you might eventually find yourself in an ""unwinnable"" situation if you wasted all your jumping potions.

Dripping with otherworldly atmosphere, aided largely by an awesome low-fi soundtrack. Puzzle platforming at its finest (and deadliest). That's how I'd describe this unique little (huge!) game, but that wouldn't even come close to doing it justice.

As you might've read from other reviews, the controls take a while to get used to. You might call it the first big challenge of the game. Thankfully, you can map them however you'd like, and after a few deaths you'll begin to develop a particular instinct for it. I play on keyboard, so I can't speak to the issues people are experiencing with gamepads-- but I can say that on keyboard, the only barrier to mastery is your own skill. One of the first lessons you'll teach yourself is when best to hold the run button. The answer, unless you're very skilled, is rarely ""always"". Taking your time, planning your route and using all items to your advantage is the key to success.

Once you've mastered the controls, the real challenge awaits: 100 floors, no saves. That's Chapter 1, anyway. Each floor is themed to a particular 'biome', and each biome contains its own set of enemies and challenges. Scattered around the levels are various items you can use or store for later, such as jump berries or crates. The levels being largely destructable, sometimes you must use your collected arsenal to jump larger gaps, blast a path through the terrain, or kill enemies that stand between you and the exit. On top of this, special 'events' may trigger upon entering a new level. I won't spoil them, but suffice it to say you'll never quite know what to expect on the next floor!

A quick word on the graphics: What you're seeing in the screenshots is NOT how the game can look at its best! By default, for some inexplicable reason, there is a filter called 'de-pixelize' being applied. If you want the best experience, immediately toggle the 'de-pixel' setting OFF in the graphics options! I don't know quite what they were thinking when they added this, as it wasn't in the beta, but I think it makes everything look like a bad SNES emulator. The sprites were designed and work best as pixel art; the player character and various enemies you'll encounter have very minimalist sprites, but the de-pixel setting blends and smooths their edges in a way that looks quite ghastly to me. Maybe this opinion is a product of playing the beta for so long without this option, but I don't think so. I don't like the filtered look on my SNES games, and I don't like it here. It somehow manages to reduce the details, turning crisp graphics into wet goop. Don't use it, you won't miss it.

In summary:
*Challenging and rewarding gameplay
*Beautifully rendered (as long as you switch de-pixelize off)
*Incredible, moody soundtrack and effects
*Difficult to master, and may prove frustrating for more casual players, or those who struggle with platforming
*Best suited for keyboard play, but gamepad support is currently being improved based on feedback

Towerclimb is a phenomenal platformer with a handful of roguelike qualities, such as random level generation and permanent death. To reach even the end of the first chapter requires skill, dedication, patience, and let's face it: A huge helping of luck. Because you -will- fuck up. You -will- make a mistake. That mistake will most likely be your end!

But that's okay! You start with one revive potion! And not everything is out to get you! Almost everything, maybe even 99% of everything, but not completely everything! You'll start out with several supplies, like jump potions and potions that blow up blocks, and one that teleports you within a short range. You can replenish these potions by collecting Golden berries, usually placed in a precarious location, and trade them tower inhabitants such as the Witch. You can also give items to a guy who will craft stuff for you, but he'll charge you for new items that he makes and sometimes he'll give you junk. 

It's so hard to review this game without spoilers, because a lot of the fun comes with exploring the world of the towers and discovering very subtle hints as to the lore of the world. As well, discovering new items, creatures to fight, and traps to overcome can be extremely rewarding from a standpoint of ""Am I skilled enough to do this?"". The atmosphere is simply as beautiful as it is deadly, which is to say very. I simply can't praise this game enough, and recommend it to everyone who appreciates difficult, yet rewarding challenges.

The levels change after every 3 to 4 stages, and each has it's own unique theme. Each level has many variations to it that are possible, as well, both in design and gameplay.  It is extremely rare to have an unfairly generated level, and even those can be overcome by conserving and using your supplies at the right times. You will have to manage how many potions you have left, and you'll have to carefully consider climbing routes. Maybe instead of blowing up that block stopping you from climbing up the side of the tower, you can long jump across a gap and find a way. Maybe instead of teleporting in the Ruins, you can find a gust of wind to make you soar to the next platform. It makes you think about the safest route, and it makes you pit risk against reward. Sure, you could go for that treasure chest past the lava pit, right behind that pulsating, hatching beetle egg. But at what cost? Will the reward be worth it, or will it be just another gold berry? Well, maybe I can safely explode a wasp nest instead and get one from there. Or maybe I'll climb the side wall as far as possible and avoid that nonsense altogether, finding an alternative route. Maybe a rat will fall on my head and explode me. Maybe ???? will happen!

This game has come SO FAR since the Alpha 5 years ago, and even far from the Beta. I am super proud of Davio and Quazi for releasing this game, a game that deserves far more attention and adoration than it is receiving at the time of this writing. So, I'll leave you with this. If you love a difficult and rewarding challenge and won't run away, if you can laugh at yourself when you die, if you can accept that you will make mistakes and will learn from them for next time, if you love discovery and mystery, if you love chunky pixel art and amazing music, this game might be for you. Just two last things, eh kid? If you fall, you di... I mean you lose. And if you see your character go ""?"", climb quickly! Beat cheeks out of there! I can tell you that from experience...

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Simple base mechanics, you've got your run and jump, you can also climb walls, but that's only the
beginning and you probably have died already because you weren't paying attention to environment 
and game doesn't hold your hand with the RNG it throws at you. I feel confident in my ability but 
even then I keep dying and dying over again, and I can't really stress enough how important it is to look
around and always search for the best path to go. By the way you've got items and probably already
Wasted all of them just to get through first few floors, so it's really up to you how you want to use
resources you've been given.

As you climb higher, you will reach different zones, every last one of them has it's own kinks and
pace, if you think you are getting good at the game already, yo... GAME OVER. Every new zone
you reach you can feel the suspense and not being familiar in it really scares your guts. After 
playing Chapter 2 and having intense butt clenching, neck hurting experience and I still can't get
through first few levels consistently I can easily say that Chapter 1 feels like a one big tutorial stage,
pretty hard to get through it at first though.

The attention to detail is god tier, this game is every roguelike/roguelite fans' dream, Davio 
and Quazi like really thought everything over countless times and this god damn music, why 
is it so good? it's spot on and I sometimes get both sad and happy knowing that brothers will stop
supporting this game someday, cause I just want more and more even though I didn't even complete
what is given to me right now.

If this game was first in it's genre, it would be genre defining goty all year every year, and I'm giving 
this 9/10. I don't think any game can be rated 10/10 as it would mean it's a perfect game in all sense,
and I haven't rated one like that, but god damn this game is truly reaching that boundary and I'm scared

I've played a lot of platformers. Super Mario games are great, but they're always relatively easy to blow through with little difficulty, and a lot of other games just always mess up small details that makes it not quite that game I'm looking for. Then along comes TowerClimb, and everything is about as close to perfect as it can get.

Graphics:
I know there are a lot of games out there that have pixel art, but let's be honest here, they don't always do it well, and that's why they don't always look good. Davioware and Quazi really nailed the detail on their game in this category. The amount of detail put into everything is exquisite, and it really makes for some nice eye candy.

For some reason there's an option for depixelizing the game that is on by default, and I highly suggest turning that off, as the smoothness to me just doesn't look as good in my opinion. Some may like it I suppose, and that's why the option is there.

Music/sound:
This soundtrack is incredible. Once you hit chapter 2, the music hits this level of epic that just blew me away. At times I wanted to just put the controller down and just jam out to the music. Chapter 1's music is awesome as well, but it feels like it's just one level below the second chapter.

The sounds of the game are incredibly satisfying. Whether I'm slicing into a beetle, killing a dog, or dying for the 50th time, every sound is fitting, enjoyable, and adds that nice little touch to an overall great experience. All of it just feels like it was well thought out and well composed. Top notch here!

Story:

The story is interesting, deep, and definitely makes one think despite how simple it appears. You are a climber, and you are climbing a tower that many have tried to climb before. You may fail, but you may succeed. Take it from there! Yet somehow there's so much more to it than that, as this tower has some history, and it alludes to it in many different forms. It is almost akin to jumping into the world of The Labyrinth. 

Gameplay:
Take Super Mario World. Now add climbing, extra jumps, item hopping, teleporting, and weapons, and you have the controls for this game. It feels amazing to control. The controls are extremely responsive and expect you to be too. The controls are straightforward and easy to learn (with the exception of item hopping, which I suggest learning), yet take a lot of practice to master. Even after mastering the controls, you have to learn how to deal with all the different situations you encounter in the game. since this is a roguelite, there's perma-death, which means you're dead when you die. No checkpoints. No quicksaves. No ranking system to beef you up for your next journey. You start with the clothes on your back and the determination you set out with.

Seeing as how this is a roguelite, there's an expectation that this game is hard, and it is. It is incredibly hard. This game has to be learned. Rather than rote memorization, expect to know how to deal with beetles swarming you, or being dropped into a den of hounds. Or both, since there is indeed an edge of cruelty to this game. There are items to help you through all the terrors of the tower, and they can be greatly helpful to moderately helpful, ranging from gloves that help you run faster to seeds that hold explosive berries and jump berries. All these items can be stored in the inventory for later use or carried on hand ready to be used in some capacity. The items are really well thought out, and the limit on items makes one not feel too overwhelmed with useless items yet sometimes trying to figure out which items is the least useful at the time. Expect to die until you figure out how to use items wisely and be resourceful.

Summary:
Persevere and the rewards shall be bountiful, as this game really feels great to run through. Climbing up and down the towers is just a pleasure to do, and this is my personal go to game for when I want to blow off some steam. Don't expect to be good at the game to start, and don't expect to find everything quickly. This game will chop off your head, hand it to you, then make you figure out how to eat it. But when you figure out how to eat it, oh does it taste so good! It's definitely my favorite game of the year, and possibly my favorite game of all time.

Score: 10/10

You play as one of many who seek to climb to the top of an ancient stone tower. The path is wrought with many obstacles, including enormous creatures, traps, and supernatural events. Along the way, you'll encounter strange characters and find useful tools to aid you on your journey. As you progress, you'll uncover a hidden lore and various side-quests in order to unlock the mysteries of the towers.

Similar to games like [i]Spelunky[/i] and [i]Just Get Through[/i], the game is split into randomized levels, each with different themes and variations to keep things challenging. Unlike [i]Spelunky[/i], however, the game is slower-paced and is much more methodical. You can't just breeze through with a Teleporter (not to knock its difficult skill ceiling). Ascending the tower is a careful process. Not all paths will get you to the exit, so planning and patience is a necessity. Because of this, the game expects the player to have skill, mastery, and knowledge of the game's finer mechanics as one mistake can cost you the whole run. Also, there are multiple environmental mechanisms that need to be mastered in order to traverse the game's later levels, similar to [i]Donkey Kong Country[/i] or [i]Super Mario[/i]. In true roguelike fashion, death means an immediate game over -- there are no checkpoints or saves (though revival potions can be bought from vendors). 

The platforming mechanics of [i]TowerClimb[/i] are unique. Climbing is simple but important: it allows you to save yourself from falling to your death, and you can even climb across ceilings and the bottoms of platforms. Jumping is interesting in this game as you start with a single limited leap. However, items like potions or special berries can allow you to jump multiple times in succession. Even finer skills of the game allow you to throw items downward to give yourself a boost when there's no other solution. Destructive items double as weapons against enemies and erasers to change the generated terrain. There's other items that modify your abilities, but they aren't necessarily needed in order to succeed. Everything about [i]TowerClimb[/i]'s gameplay shows a great deal of polish, which is remarkable considering the small development team of two. 

My favorite thing about the game is its atmosphere. I'm reminded of [i]Risk of Rain[/i], where your avatar is only a few pixels tall, and everything else is incredibly vast. It adds this great sense of mystery and wonder to the game. Even from the beginning, as you enter the tower, you face a looming ominous portal bathing you in an intense violet light. On the ground floor, it's apparent that the path ahead won't be easy, even on the first level. Giant rats and hounds look truly monstrous in comparison to you, and the creatures only get creepier as you climb higher. Environmental hazards can be just as deadly. Just about anything can happen in this tower: from lava bursting out of the ground to entire levels filled with water. Compared to how gigantic everything is, you can't help but feel a sense of humility. Exploring the tower can make you feel almost insignificant, and you're reminded of just how fragile you are when braving the many dangers that surround you.

Aesthetically, the game is done in a pixelated art style. It uses low-resolution graphics infused with hardware accelerated lighting effects and rendering capabilities, and gameplay runs at 60 FPS. You can choose to play the game with its raw pixel art or with a blended filter that somehow manages to look even more retro. However, the soundtrack really steals the show. The game features more than 80 dark and foreboding tracks. It reminds me of RPGs from the 90's on consoles like the SNES or the Sega Genesis. It definitely makes your quest feel epic, and I can't imagine playing this game while listening to something else.

As much as I love this game, it definitely isn't perfect. The game doesn't have a tutorial, so players might have a hard time mastering the basics in just a couple of runs. It's a pretty difficult game that will offer challenges to players of all skill levels. It feels awkward to play the game with just a keyboard, so I would definitely recommend using a gamepad. Graphically, I know there are lots of players out there who are tired of the pixelated art that's found in many other indie games. Sometimes, items and hazards aren't easily recognizable and can cause some frustrating ends to runs. However, the development team is incredibly dedicated and is open-minded to suggestions and ways to improve the game.

[i]TowerClimb[/i] serves as a testament to how amazing indie games can be. It started as a humble demo on GameJolt and was Greenlit on Steam in 2012. It's taken Davioware and Quazi [b]6[/b] whole years to develop and polish the game. They didn't put it on Kickstarter or crowdfund the game. Just by playing it, you can feel how much love and labor was invested into this project. $15.00 may feel like a little steep of a price for this game, but I feel that they've definitely earned it after creating such an artistic masterpiece. This game is a great little reminder of how much beauty and depth can be found in unassuming simple things.

It's incredibly challenging, but always in a fair way. Every run is an intense experience, and the higher you get into the tower, the better it gets. When you get to a new place, way up in the tower, that you've never been to before, you're just swarmed with so many different emotions that it's hard to describe. The amazement of seeing the new place, the fear of dying and having to start all over again, and the sense of accomplishment, all at once, makes for an unforgettable experience.

The mechanics are solid, altough it can be pretty difficult to get the hang of the controls for new players.
Once you learn the basics, though, you're gonna have insane ammounts of fun.

That's what I still think after playing it for more than 2 years. I've never played a game as challenging and rewarding as towerclimb. When I first starting playing, I thought I'd never beat chapter 1, but when I finally did, I was ecstatic. I thought I was a pro, who has conquered towerclimb and all the challenges it has to offer. Then the centurial trials appeared. 100 floors of pure insanity... I knew I'd never beat it. ""That's just for fun, right? People aren't actually expected to beat this."" Hundreds of deaths and hundreds of hours later, I finally reached floor 101. I beat the trials. It was the most amazing gaming experience I've ever had. Being on floor 90 and knowing that I can lose it all with one tiny misstep is the most scary feeling I've experienced in any game. Not even a game like dead space could keep me continuously on-edge like that. 

Towerclimb is an emotional rollercoaster that can bring you intense feelings of fear, frustration, happiness, excitement, etc., and the music is a big part of that. The music fits the atmosphere and scenarios perfectly. In the plant-controlled observatory, the music feels as if it's alive, and creeping up on you. In the cold, icey ruins, you can hear just how frigid it is, and you can almost feel the pain from the cold air brushing against you. In the volcanic heart, you can feel the magma boiling beneath your feet, ready to burst any minute. The industrial segmentation plant makes you feel like you're surrounded by technology and traps that are prepared to kill you whenever you get near. Giant worm fights are backed with intense music that really make you feel helpless. But once you defeat it, you are rewarded with absolute silence to contemplate the victory you have earned.

Discovery is another big point of towerclimb. The game starts with no tutorial, and at first I thought it was a simple game, but I soon started to uncover the layers of complexity by just... playing. I didn't need to look at a wiki or anything like that. Some items took me a long time to find a use for them. I used to think the golden greaves were useless because they made me so fast that it was impossible to control. But eventually, after getting used them, I realized they are the most useful item in the game.

When I first found the bitchbane, and the game told me a quest has started, I knew I was going on an adventure, in real life. Anytime I wasn't playing towerclimb, I'd try to think about what the next step could be so I could try it out when I got home. For months, I didn't know what to do, until I discovered you can use the bitchbane to kill a giant worm to get the next sword in the quest. Then use that sword to get another sword. And finally get the last one, the Ascender. Keep in mind, at this point I already thought I had known everything that was in this game. Now here's 3 new items. I started getting more handy with their own individual uses, and eventually brought the ascender to the 101st floor to fully complete the quest.

2 years later, I still have one more quest to complete, and I try at least once a week to beat it. My experience with towerclimb still hasn't ended...",1442975444,1442975444,True,219,11,0.888656079769134521,9,False,False,False,False,,,

The SNES-era graphics work surprisingly well, with a lot of shader and bloom effects to flesh out the otherwise straightforward pixel look. The soundtrack especially is excellent. Lots of mysterious, dark, brooding melodies that help drive you on while helping to establish a brooding, oppressive atmosphere. The tower is not a friendly place.

Towerclimb is a very long and very replayable game. A single playthrough will take you through dozens of randomly generated floors, and due to the way that hazards and traps can interact with each other (ala Spelunky), you can end up in some very chaotic situations that require quick thinking to work your way out of.
