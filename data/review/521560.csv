This seems to be a game designed to play together with your little ones. 
If you don't have children, I guess it is perfectly serviceable as a quick, basic adventure for those who find themselves absolutely starved for a P&C game. If you're curious about it yourself, I recommend getting this on sale.

Let's get my major gripes with the game out of the way first:
-While I personally think the visual style is unappealing (like an old flash game), it does have enough detail and charm to not be [i]completely[/i] hideous. You'll come across plenty of problems with the layering of characters and environmental objects, which will break what little immersion there is to begin with.
-The characters are not deep or all that interesting (with one particularly weird exception), but distinguishable enough to remember. Most of them not by name though, I just finished the game and can't recall any of the names of the main cast. I simply had no reason to care.
-The puzzles are of standard P&C flavor, use items on things in your environment, occasionally combine them in your inventory and progress through some dialogue to trigger events. The latter aspect could use a LOT of work though:
Don't expect any bizarre and brilliantly written dialogues akin to the majority of Monkey Island games, what you have to deal with here is very basic and has humor which can either be described as childish or mind-numbingly dull.
-Speaking of dialogues, whenever a character has to say more than one line, there's a noticeable delay between the sentences being delivered. I imagine this may be by design, so very young children don't have to process all of it at once, but to me it simply seemed like a ""crap factor"" I had to adjust to. Made me accidentally skip lines, because I thought they were done talking and I wanted to continue exploring.
-While the game has a feature to point out interactables in a scene, it doesn't always work really well, because some of them are obscured by foreground objects and the player has to move to the corner of the screen to properly see them.
-I feel like there's so much wasted potential. I mean, your main cast consists of time-travelling scientists, who also happen to be a rock band! That premise alone opens up so many crazy and imaginative opportunities, but it doesn't really go anywhere meaningful.

With all these issues being present, what's there to redeem the game?

-This feels like a rather personal project. It felt to me like it gave an insight into the things the devs were personally fond of and the characters might be superficially based on themselves or people they know. I think it's kinda nice to get a little glimpse of that. Shout-out to the reference to the British claymation series The Trapdoor! Good stuff! c:
-It is mostly ""family friendly"" (but since the writing is quite sloppy, I wouldn't let a very young child play it alone, there are a handful of questionable aspects to it).
-While I played the majority of the game completely stone-faced, there are a small number of actually smart jokes.
-It feels, naturally, very British, which I did find quite enjoyable. Especially the aspect of rock band traveling in a submarine. We all know what this is a reference to! c:
-The devs seem to genuinely care about their game. Even now, many years after it's release, issues posted on the steam forums get addressed immediately! I was unable to finish the game due to a bug, I reported it and two days later the game received an update! Fantastic service!
-While it first seemed that the villain of the story was merely a one-dimensional afterthought, the ending changed that completely. In hindsight, the ending is pretty dark and twisted, which came as an amazing surprise, contrasting the overall flatness of the story. Not only does this open up the opportunity to have a somewhat philosophical discussion, but also the possibility to do so much more with the sequel, should there ever be one! Work on your writing, wait a few years until your current intended audience has matured a little and turn this into a heart-wrenching story coupled with some grey morality, but plenty of ""more mature"" jokes! Again, so much potential!

While I can't see myself ever playing this game again, it made me curious about the studio's next project, just to see where they improved.",1711194131,1711194131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Also dialog doesn't adapt to progress: If you do things in another order than the creators intended, it will sometimes say stuff that hasn't happened yet, or ignore stuff that's already happened.
And it's annoyingly unclear most of the time what is just decoration you can play around with, and what you actually need to spend time with to progress.
Like in most adventure games, if there's not enough subtle hints and good dialogue to make the player aware of the next necessary step to take, it too often comes down to haphazardly trying everything in the inventory.
The in-game storyline is OK, and mostly enjoyable to play. Some of the puzzles like the rope duel and the dream sequence are great new ideas and really well done!
But if I'm given a crew of five, I would have much more enjoyed to make use of their special capabilities, instead of making the whole game basically about tricking them to come along at all, and then having them hang about uselessly.
Also, the background lore is utter rubbish. Allegedly those guys are some sort of famous rock band? But nobody seems to recognize them. But their logo is senselessly plastered everwhere. But it actually is a symbol for time travel. And none of the alleged musicians ever makes any useful sound at all...

-Tells you exactly what you you have to do and item hints are very clear. Like saying looks like Auto so it's one of the keys to get him back
-As amateur as it is, I find the art style charming
-Has a final boss.
-The voice acting. While voices like Garland and Roland were good, other's like Auto and the evil witch were just bad.
-The dream sequence. Not that it was bad but felt the most like filler.
-Tilda is just Penny Proud from the Proud Family but with a adult British voice.

As for changes or updates since I last played it, well they steam lined the adventure a bit by cutting the minigames for the main quest. Most of them are still there but they aren't mandatory anymore like the friendship bracelet is on the arcade cabinet when you interact with it and the text adventure has been cut entirely.

They also made things more clear like the how to win the rope game and have redesign some sections since the creators seem to be replacing word based puzzle with picture ones like the Dream section is no longer a scrabble puzzle but just match pictures to the room. Although I prefer the original version of the section, I understand the change since not everyone uses our alphabet. Also they change the song the Colins Brothers sing and it’s way better.

Unfortunately, that leads to the biggest issue currently in the game, and that’s the changes have broken the game in places. I work as a tester so I understand if a change may break something and luckily, the serious game-breaking ones seem to be dealt with as I manage to get to the end but there a few issues with the presentation like Chandi’s body being missing during Garland’s speech on the way to the base of the mountain or the ending voiceover before the credits starting to skip after the 3rd sentence.

I think it just needs a bug tester or two to look through the game with a fine tooth comb as the developers really want this to be the best it can be as they’ve been responsive when I was reporting the game breaking Dream Section.
