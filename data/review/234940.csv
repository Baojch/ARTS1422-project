Embark on a thrilling journey through John Buchan's classic adventure novel, The 39 Steps, in this interactive experience. However, be prepared for a unique adaptation, as this game leans more towards a visual novel format than a traditional adventure game.

The narrative unfolds through beautifully rendered still images and voice acting, faithfully capturing the suspense and intrigue of the original story. Players primarily take the role of Richard Hannay, a man thrust into a world of espionage and murder, by making choices that progress the narrative.

While the immersion is generally strong, the experience is occasionally disrupted by minigames. These simplistic puzzles and action sequences, while attempting to add variety, feel out of place and detract from the game's core strength: storytelling.

If you're looking for an interactive experience brimming with suspense and classic adventure storytelling, The 39 Steps delivers. However, those seeking a more traditional adventure game with extensive player agency might find themselves wanting.

I have played this on Linux using proton, and with cups of tea as another reviewer put it, although the scottish undertones have made me yearn for some uisge.

Now go read the book, then watch the multiple film and TV adaptations of this amazing story.",1709162881,1709162966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

During all this time, the novel has gone through many film adaptations, the most famous of which is Alfred Hitchcock's version, released in 1935. Only in his film, the legendary director, most likely in a fit of inspiration, went far from the original source and made a very tense thriller out of a spy story. The developers from The Story Mechanics decided to make a game based on the book. They decided not to follow in Hitchcock's footsteps and embody the entire plot of the book in their game, including even quotes.
But did they succeed? It is very difficult to answer this question. First of all, it is worth noting that this is both a game and a book at the same time and your task is to lazily sip coffee from a mug and follow the plot. In The 39 Steps, you have no influence on the subsequent plot. You don't even have the right to choose. You simply follow the written plot clearly, reading the written dialogues. But if the developers decided to do just that, then perhaps the plot in the game should be amazing?
It looks very interesting that all the characters, including the main character, are presented in the game in the form of translucent silhouettes. Probably, the developers decided not to distract the players from the plot, hoping that their imagination itself would draw the proper images. But in reality, these yellowish perfumes are damn distracting from the perception of the plot and look a little strange.

But the main problem with The 39 Steps is that the developers loaded their work too much with unnecessary details. Against their background, the whole essence is lost. But it’s very cool that classic literature is moving into such a non-standard format. We can only hope that this is not the last book to become a video game.

Instead, this is just a story told with a combination of reading, watching (mostly still images), and listening (where it is more like a radio play than an audio book).

With that being said: I quite enjoyed it, and was pleasantly surprised by the high production values. The voice acting is good, and there are a surprisingly large amount of images made just for this.

I have neither read nor watched The 39 Steps so I cannot comment on how faithful an adaptation it is.

I didn't feel like the interactive elements added a great deal but I'm not generally someone who will seek out VNs, so your experience may well differ. 89p at full price is exceptional value.

I have two minor criticisms. First, there isn't complete checkpointing, so if interrupted you may need to go through short passages (2-3 minutes at most) again. Second, I encountered some minor startup bugs where I got the main screen music but a black screen on launch. These were fixed by a simple restart of the program, but it's slightly jarring at least.

2 Поставим казан на плиту, выложим в него ножки и зальем холодной водой. Накроем крышкой и доведем до кипения.
3 Когда бульон закипит, снимем накипь и добавим 3 лавровых листа, смесь перцев, кориандр и одну столовую ложку соли.
4 Накроем крышкой и будем варить 4 часа на маленьком огне. Бульон должен быть наваристым.
5 Выложим в бульон с говяжьими ножками рубец, доведем до кипения, уменьшим огонь до минимума, накроем крышкой и будем варить ещё 2 часа.
6 Хаш готов. Это можно проверить, по мягкости ножек - они должны быть как холодец.
7 Теперь можно приготовить заправку для супа: в ступке разомнём несколько головок чеснока в кашицу, зальем чеснок бульоном из хаша (несколько половничков) и дадим заправке настояться.
8 В готовый хаш добавим чесночную заправку и зелень по вкусу.
Готовится хаш долго, но это того стоит - очень вкусное блюдо.
Приятного аппетита, друзья!

Готовить - это просто =)

O jogo o transporta de volta para o Londres de 1914, onde você joga como Richard Hannay, um homem que foi acusado falsamente de um assassinato que não cometeu. Conforme você navega pela história, precisará usar sua astúcia e inteligência para limpar seu nome e descobrir um plano sinistro.

Um dos recursos mais marcantes de The 39 Steps são os incríveis cenários pintados à mão que fornecem um pano de fundo impressionante para a história. A atenção aos detalhes na arte é verdadeiramente impressionante e realmente o imerge no mundo de Londres do início do século XX.

Outro aspecto do jogo que se destaca é a dublagem. Os personagens são trazidos à vida por algumas performances fantásticas, o que realmente acrescenta à experiência geral de imersão. O design de som também é excelente, com uma trilha sonora melancólica e atmosférica que ajuda a definir o tom do jogo.

Em termos de jogabilidade, The 39 Steps é classificado como um jogo de ficção interativa, o que significa que é essencialmente como ler um livro, mas com certa interatividade. 

Em geral, se você é fã de ficção interativa ou thrillers, The 39 Steps definitivamente vale a pena conferir. O jogo é lindamente criado, com visuais deslumbrantes, ótimas dublagens e uma história cativante que o manterá na ponta da cadeira. A sensação de jogar o jogo é semelhante à de ler um livro de maneira descontraída, mas com a vantagem adicional de poder participar ativamente da história.

If you like VNs, espionage, and mysteries, this quick work (it'll take a few hours to go through) is worth your time.

Anyone unfamiliar with The 39 Steps should note there is an antisemitic character early on, but the story doesn't follow in that vein.

""Interactive Fiction"" isn't quite what I'd call this adaptation--there are no branching paths, no text parser, no commands or dialogue options, no puzzles to solve in-game. You can reason out the mysteries alongside Hannay, the protagonist, but there's little other gameplay for you as a player. You can choose to view all the items in ""interactive scenes"" or skip them, and you can do some tracing during a few sequences, and that is all.

The novel adaptation is well-presented, and the voice acting of dialogue overall good--solid job on dialects and the German. The illustrations and music are also pleasant and set the mood and tone very well in each scene.

Regrettably and predictably, at almost 10 years old, the software has some trouble on modern systems. Nothing game-breaking, but you may need to force-quit and restart the app a couple times, and it tends to minimize unpredictably on left-clicking. Fortunately the game has pretty generous checkpointing, you can insert ""bookmarks,"" and generally successfully pick up where you left off any time with the Continue option which seems to autosave the last screen you were on.

It's a shame The Story Mechanics didn't seem to release anything else. I would've liked to have seen them refine their vision for adapting older fiction.",1672088159,1672088159,True,1,0,0.511111080646514893,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1] Story [/h1] Das Spiel basiert auf einen Roman. Wir spielen einen Mann namens ""Richard Hannay"" und leben an sich ein recht Normales, langweiliges Leben in England. Eines Tages steht ein Mann vor unserer Tür der unbedingt mit uns sprechen möchte, wir bitten ihn herein und er erzählt uns seine Geschichte, das er verfolgt wird und nun Angst um sein Leben hat. Er bleibt in unserem Haus/Wohnung für ein paar Tage und wir finden ihn plötzlich mit einem Messer erstochen vor. Angst das wir beschuldigt werden, schnappen wir uns sein Tagebuch und begeben uns auf die Flucht durch das ganze Land

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es ist wie gesagt eine Interaktive Geschichte (Spionage Thriller). Wir lesen und hören den Sprechern zu. Die Story ist in 19 Kapitel/Level aufgeteilt. Zwischendurch müssen wir etwas anklicken oder mit der Maus einige Zeichen nachmachen. Gespielt wird nur mit der Maus und zwar brauchen wir lediglich die Linke Maustaste. Es ist kein Visual Novel aber es hat schon Ähnlichkeiten. Voice Acting is völlig ok und auch die Musik ist passend

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 20 Erfolge. Alle sind Story basierend also muss man nur das Spiel komplett beenden

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Gute Story
+ Gute Musik
+ Günstig
+ Voice Acting ist völlig OK
+ Spannend
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein gut gelungener Spionage Thriller. Es ist spannend und die Erzähl weise fand ich gut gemacht. Wer gerne Story Driven Adventures mag, kann sich das hier ruhig mal anschauen, mir hat es sehr gut gefallen

[b]Description:[/b]  
The 39 Steps is the digital adaptation of a novel, a thriller written by John Buchan that also has a movie adaptation. Personally I never heard of this book and played most of the game without knowing it, but I decided to watch the intro video and this is explained there. The story is captivating and the text is presented in short paragraphs, most likely abridged from the original and it’s never too much to read. Besides being an interactive book, divided in several short chapters, it also offers other materials that enrich the experience and set the historical period, like newspapers, maps, photos from archives and also a few short cartoon animations for certain side stories.

The paintings used as backgrounds and illustrations for the story are very well made, with pleasant colors and contrast, and depict both indoor and outdoor scenes realistically and meticulously. Sometimes they are complemented with small animations and effects over them, like light rays or smoke.

The voice acting is also top notch in all characters and you can easily notice the dialect differences between characters, and I could barely understand some accents like the Scottish one. The historical rigour is also noticeable in some words that are used and are not very common today, most are related to the closing used by people at the time.

When it comes to gameplay, this is mostly an interactive book, but does have a few short parts of finding objects like in a HOG and some parts where you have to draw figures with the mouse, similar to Detroit Become Human. To move the text you can make circles with your mouse, but using the left and right arrows is faster and easier.

[b]Achievements:[/b]  
[b]How many:[/b] 20 Achievements, all story related.
[b]How much time:[/b] Around 3,5 hours, calmly reading and checking everything.
[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Very Easy, the interaction is minimal and you can’t really do anything wrong.
[b]Achievements’ Difficulty:[/b] Very Easy, just finishing all scenes should be enough but to be sure, find all objects in the parts where you have to.

[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  
The 39 Steps is an interactive book, with a bit of hidden object and mouse drawing parts, that was a very pleasant surprise and a great experience, especially if you like reading and thriller novels.

As such, it's somewhat dated by modern standards - it's a fairly slow moving story that doesn't really get interesting until about half way through. The second half is pretty interesting though.

Pros:
- Very well voice acted
- The art is pretty good

Cons:
- Whenever you open something (door, window, book, etc) you have to do these mouse movements. Straight lines, circles, etc - nothing even remotely difficult. This seems to serve no purpose beyond making sure you're still awake
- Instead of clicking to advance the dialogue, you move the mouse in a circle
- The first half of the story is pretty boring - as previously mentioned, this isn't a criticism of the game, but comes from the age of the novel it's based on
- I have some Scottish family but there was still quite a bit of dialogue, slang, etc, I didn't understand. Having some sort of reference would have helped, both for slang and dated terms

Ne ho provata una di VN tempo fa, si chiamava The Letter. L'esperienza mi ha lasciato sconvolto. 
TONNELLATE di testo ridicolo con un environment ripetitivo e characters dalle tinte cringe. Le scelte e i bivi di narrazione non erano all'altezza di quello che mi aspettavo dato che parliamo di prodotti totalmente narrativi.
Un vero e proprio click simulator che sembrava senza fine.

Avevo paura per The 39 Steps, ma gli ho dato una possibilità come la darò ad altre VN in futuro.
I ragazzi di The Story Mechanics ci introducono ad un genere nuovo denominato ""Digital Adaptation"" ossia l'adattamento interattivo di un'opera esterna, in questo caso il libro ""I 39 scalini"" di John Buchan.
L'opera segue di filo la storia come viene raccontata nel testo (pertanto nelle DA non ci sono scelte o finali alternativi), con una divisione in 16 brevi episodi. Tranquilli, non avrete da leggere tanto testo quanto ne porta il libro, non ce n'è bisogno dato che le immagini e l'audio fanno il grosso del lavoro.

C'è molta varietà di location e le arts non sono male, sono ben esplorate durante la narrazione e il ""lettore"" potrà interagire con vari oggetti di scena. Le gesture del mouse interagiscono quando servono azioni meccaniche come l'apertura di una porta o... l'accensione di una miccia ;)
Ho adorato come gli sviluppatori siano riusciti a mantenere lo stato di tranquillità e tensione che ogni scena suscitava, sia con l'audio che utilizzando accorgimenti grafici e di interfaccia.

Purtroppo credo che The 39 Steps sia unico nel suo genere. Non ho trovato altri adattamenti dello stesso tipo e se l'esperimento è fallito...peccato. D'altronde è un incastro troppo stretto tra l'avventura grafica e la Visual Novel, che forse non ha permesso di inquadrarlo bene nel panorama in cui voleva crescere. In poche parole non è stato capito, soprattutto essendo uscito in un periodo dove la Visual Experience era agli albori.

The Story Mechanics ci dimostra ancora una volta come gli Indie hanno le palle di esplorare terre sempre nuove dell'intrattenimento.

It's been adapted many times across several mediums, including film, radio, theater, and television. As far as I know, this is the only video game version of it so far. 

The story follows Richard Hannay, an average British man who has returned from abroad just prior to World War One. At home, he meets his new American neighbor who turns out to be a spy working against a mysterious German cabal planning to destabilize Europe. Wacky hijinks ensue and Hannay goes on the run across the UK to stop the evildoers. The plot feels like a forerunner for Ian Fleming's works with James Bond and spy fiction in general. 

I think the best thing to ask yourself before getting this game is ""do I like visual novels?"" There aren't really any choices and the game leads down the same path. There are some light gameplay elements, but nothing overly major. You can look at old newspapers and sometimes have to move your mouse in certain directions to interact with objects.

I personally enjoyed it, but I can understand why some people couldn't get into it.

It is an experience, not a game.
It is not a ""Visual Novel"" as some keep calling it.
It is an Interactive Novel.
There is a difference.
Based on a real boo, this is a blending of an e-book, partially voiced, partially read, partially interacted with to advance the story.

The art is gorgeous. The voice acting is amazingly good. The music and audio is good, appropriate, fitting the scenes and the atmosphere the art places you in.
The story feels a bit cut-off, a greatly shortened version of the actual book it is based on, but including every word and detail from the book would cause this experience to be far too long for enjoyment.
Very little ""gameplay"", clicking on things to interact, swiping in shapes to indicate actions.
Linear, no real ""replay value"", unless you enjoyed the story and want to go through it again to see the gorgeous artwork and hear the wonderful voice acting.  The historical photos give a look at what things looked like back then, and the mock-up newspapers and handwritten notes are quite good, with an option to read the ""important"" parts in bold plain text.

Each event can be played one at a time, making this good for short sessions. 100% achievements are gained by simply going through all events, and watching the credits at the end, to get to the final bit of story after them. 
5.0 hours for a full playthrough. 

Worth the price if you like reading, enjoy immersion into the story with the lovely artwork and audio elements, and enjoy historical fiction. It was a nice experience for me, and i will have to go to the library to see if I can find the actual book to read it again.

Dall'omonimo libro di John Buchan che ha ispirato il James Bond di Ian Flaming e numerosi adattamenti cinematografici, arriva questa trasposizione videoludica che ci catapulta in un intrigante spy-thriller ambientato nell'Inghilterra del 1914.
Tra inseguimenti e colpi di scena, siamo chiamati a scoprire il significato dietro le parole "" The 39 steps"" (tra l'altro lo stesso numero di capitoli in cui è suddiviso il gioco) per arrivare alla conclusione e risolvere il mistero.
Inutile dilungarsi troppo sulla trama, perché si parla di un classico dei thriller, quindi basta solo dire che è coinvolgente, vi terrà col fiato sospeso dall'inizio alla fine e probabilmente, proprio per questi motivi, qualcuno lo completerà in una sola sessione.

Trattandosi di un gioco che si presenta come visual-novel di un libro, non è molto articolato nel gameplay, giusto qualche enigma ed interazioni disseminati in uno svolgimento del tutto lineare (quindi non aspettatevi scelte e conseguenze).
La grafica è composta da disegni statici che ben ricreano l'atmosfera della storia raccontata e dell'epoca in cui si svolgono i fatti; la musica potrebbe risultare un po' ridondante per qualcuno, ma per me è assolutamente gradevole e si sposa bene con le varie situazioni narrate.

Credo sia un gioco che, più che intrattenere, si prefigga lo scopo di rendere lettore anche chi non si è mai avvicinato alla lettura, specie di classici, e a mio parere ci riesce molto bene.
Ho molto apprezzato la possibilità che offre nelle impostazioni di scegliere ""Testo originale"" comprensivo di termini dialettali come opzione di lettura, perché ho sempre preferito i testi integrali agli adattamenti.

Consigliato a tutti, meglio se conoscitori della lingua inglese poiché è prevista solo la traduzione in gaelico ed anche in lingua inglese alcuni termini sono di stampo arcaico.",1625509645,1654218853,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are some stylized animated segments, but most of the graphics are stills (usually with a digitally painted style) that fade, pan, and zoom in sequence. 

The player has a lot of control over the the pace of the story sequences, but there is no fast forward button or rewind button for some sequences. There are limited elements of a hidden object type game that is usually easy, but on occasion the player might click on the object that triggers a change in scene before everything was fully explored.

I did find a few voice acted sequences in the middle chapters that had voice sequences initiating twice, making a slightly annoying echo effect, in what must have been an unintentional bug (at least on my install).

-至少我玩的时候游戏疯狂崩溃。而且本游戏没有画面调节选项，默认全屏+置顶，分辨率和桌面一致，alt+enter可以调成窗口模式，但是会引发当前页显示不正常，跳到下个画面恢复。一旦玩家没有调成窗口模式而游戏崩溃了，由于游戏画面是置顶的，除了电脑注销或者重启别无他法！我的游戏时长包含了很久的试图不注销电脑关闭游戏的时间，然而根本没有用，令人抓狂。务必调到窗口模式再游戏。
-无中文。本游戏毕竟是小说改编，生词非常多，非语言专业的大学四六级词汇量是远远不够的，花了很多时间在查字典上，因此这游戏放了几年都没玩完，每次都是开了-放弃-重开-放弃-重开-放弃。。。终于这次干脆忽略生词硬啃，至少玩完了，剧情知道个大概，也不纠结细节了哈哈哈。
-剧情悬疑性一般。开头讲故事的起因，中间一大半都在讲如何如何逃跑、被追杀，唯一的推理只在结尾三幕出现，而且推理内容也并没有什么特别精妙之处。",1607248225,1607248225,True,3,0,0.548563599586486816,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[/b]

[h1] 🎤 Вступление [/h1]

С развитием цифровых технологий в сфере развлечений появился жанр графических новелл. Кроме повествовательного элемента, в них также есть стилистическая составляющая, благодаря которой, можно погрузиться в произведение, в том числе и визуальным методом. The 39 Steps - это графическая адаптация оригинальной книги Джона Бьюкена, взявшая из неё самые основные моменты и события, но в более сжатом виде.

[h1] 🎬 Cюжет [/h1]

Англия, Лондон, 1914 год. Главный герой - Ричард Ханней, возвращается с прогулки домой. Неожиданно в дверь стучится человек и просит о помощи. Представившийся Бенджамином, незнакомец, говорит о том, что его преследуют какие-то люди и хотят убить. Ричард соглашается на какое-то время укрыть Бенжамина у себя. Спустя пару дней, оставив гостя одного и вернувшись к нему позже, Ханней обнаруживает уже его труп. Понимая, что все обвинения падут на него, хозяин дома быстро обыскивает место преступления, находит блокнот убитого, несколько улик и пускается в бега, попутно пытаясь разгадать шифр в записях жертвы, что возможно приведёт его к разгадке личности убийцы.

Не скажу, что сюжет меня зацепил. Сильно произведением я не проникся, но если брать в целом, то это неплохой короткий детектив с политическим подтекстом того времени.

[h1] 🎮 Геймплей [/h1]

По сути The 39 Steps это не игра, а графическая визуализация романа. Всё, что необходимо делать, это слушать диалоги и читать текст, наблюдая за сменой статичных декораций в виде акварельных рисунков.

Непосредственное участие  заключается здесь в том, чтобы переключать диалоги, перелистывать страницы, переходить на следующие главы нажатием на соответствующие иконки. Иногда предлагается поискать в кадре предметы и объекты, активировав которые, можно изучить тетрадь, газету, какие-то записки, фотографии т.д.

[h1] 🚧 Остальное [/h1]

Очень понравилось визуальное оформление новеллы. Качественные рисунки достаточно сильно погружают в детективно-триллерную атмосферу романа, прекрасно дополняя историю необходимыми иллюстрациями. Круто передан антураж Англии и Шотландии, быт и культура времён начала 20го века. Художниками было создано более ста изображений, в каждом из которых, можно найти много интересных мелочей, деталей и сюжетной информации.

Интересная задумка у авторов получилась с персонажами произведения, которые здесь представлены в виде призрачных силуэтов. Читателю предлагается самому дополнить и представить визуальный образ и эмоции людей, встречающихся в романе.

Проделана отличная работа со звуком. Кроме приятных авторских мелодий, статичные кадры дополняются различными звуками окружения и тематическими шумами, что позволяет больше погрузиться в интерактивное повествование и происходящие в сценах события.

К сожалению перевода на русский нет, поэтому рекомендую поставить русификатор. Без хорошего знания английского, здесь можно упустить общий смысл истории и многие детали.

[h1] 🏁 Итог:

Графическая детективная новелла по сюжету одноименного романа Джона Бьюкена. Если вы любитель подобного жанра, то вам должно понравится. [/h1]",1606338878,1670157376,True,49,3,0.795034289360046387,22,True,False,False,True,,,

Some would argue that the one man vs everyone on the run genre from Mission Impossible, the Bournes, North by Northwest, The Fugitive, Minority Report, etc was hatched from Buchan’s novel that this game is based on.
Now I use game in a very loose way here.  This is a visual novel you can drink a cup of tea in one hand while you advance the scenes with your other.  There are a few quite silly QTEs but mostly you will just be taking in the beautiful artwork and following the voiced conversations and reading the occasional newspaper or scrap of paper.  The story is the real reason we are here and the game is just a vehicle for that.

[h1] PROS [/h1]

[list]+  authentic.  Whatever faults you find with this game, you cannot fault them for authenticity.  This game is a direct lift from the book unlike the multiple movies that have been shot.  Also the voice acting is incredibly real.  Real enough to the point that you will need subtitles if you are not from Scotland.  I’m from Scotland and there were even points where I had to tilt my ear to the speaker and pay full attention.[/list]

[list]+  artwork.  There are so many beautiful backdrops in the game.  Nothing in the game is animated to move but the artists have really put it all into gorgeous natural vistas.  I took a fair amount of screenshots.[/list]

[list]+  voice acting.  As noted above the voices are very authentic but not only that, they are well acted too.  Hannay our main protagonist is a suave citizen with a knack for espionage and assumes the identities of a bunch of different walks of life in his efforts to evade his pursuers.  Other characters in the game are equally voiced and this made the game way more enjoyable than me just clicking through walls of text.[/list]

[h1] CONS [/h1]

[list]-  convenience.  Now, I did say before that The 39 Steps was the genesis of this genre but at the same time I need to call out the plot for its hugely convenient moments where things just seem to fall out of the sky for the main character.  In a bit of a pickle?  Don’t worry, here is a case of dynamite.  Need a quick alibi?  Don’t worry you just made a new friend who will cover for you.  There are plenty more examples of this but it would be anachronistic of me to fault the story.  I imagine this was totally fine back in the day.[/list]

[list]-  oh, about those QTEs.  They are not even Quick….or even Timed.  That makes them just, I don’t know, E’s.  I do not need a QTE to make a cup of coffee or to get dressed.  It’s almost like the devs said, “There’s no game here.  It’s just a story you click through.  Shall we just add a dozen random QTEs?”[/list]

[h1] THE CONCLUSION [/h1]

[list]The 39 Steps is a great story to mouse over while you unwind at the end of the day and don’t want to think or move too much.  It is an easy 100% cheevo too if that’s your thing.  If you liked this game then Simon Meek went on to form his own studio The Secret Experiment after this and they released a game called Beckett, which I already own but haven’t played yet.  So I suppose I know what I will be trying next.[/list]

Öncelikle bu bir point & click ya da macera oyunu değil, kitabın interaktif bir şekilde görselleştirilmiş bir adaptasyonudur ki oyun yapımcıları da aynen bu şekilde tanıtıyor. Görsel ve interaktif romanları sevdiğim için The 39 Steps'i araştırdım ve John Buchan'ın yine kendi ismindeki bir casusluk hikayesi tarzındaki (espionage thriller) kitabına dayandığını gördüm. Zaten ünlü Alfred Hitchcock da filmini bile çekmiş. Eser 1914 yani Büyük Savaş öncesi üzerine cinayet suçu yıkılmaya çalışılan ve Büyük Savaş'ın çıkmasını engellemek için uğraşan Richard Hannay'in hikayesini anlatıyor. 

Sesler muazzam ama müzikler çok zayıf. Sadece ufak melodiler var. Görsel anlatım çok güzel. Kitaba dayandırıldıdğı için seçim yapıp da hikayelerde sapmalar yapamıyorsunuz. Sadece bazı yerlerde örneğin kapıyı açarken belli şekilleri ardardına doğru bir şekilde çizerek ufak challenge'lar şeklinde kapıyı açmış oluyorsunuz. Merak etmeyin hiç zor bir yapısı yok. Sadece sizi sıkılmaktan kurtarmak için düşünülmüş sanırım ve de iyi olmuş. Karakterlerin görünüşleri ve tipleri gözükmüyor. Bu aslında güzel bir şey çünkü nasıl ki kitap okurken karakterleri kendi aklımızda canlandırıyorsak burda da insan şeklindeki beyaz silüetlerin tiplerini siz kendi hayalinizde dolduruyorsunuz. 

Olumsuz yanı olarak belki pat küt oyunlardan kazandığım İngilizce altyapısına rağmen anlamakta çok zorluk çektim. Oynarken bir elimde Google Translate bir elimde fare öyle oynadım. Ama anlayarak ilerlediğim için de zevk aldım. Yoksa ardardına tıklayıp geçecekseniz hiç almayın daha iyi. Dolayısıyla biraz İngilizce ve biraz Google Translate gerektiriyor. Eğer hiç İngilizce ile alakanız yoksa hiç tavsiye etmiyorum. Ona göre alın. 

Bu görsel romanın bazı yerlerinde donup sekmeler halinde size bilgiler veriyor ama bir süre sonra bilgi karmaşası oluyor ve 'yahu bu kimdi', 'şu nereden geldi?' gibi soruları kendi kendinize sormadan edemiyorsunuz. Süreyi kısaltmak adına yapılan bu adım bence akılları daha da bulandırmış ve okuyucuyu sıkmış. Bu ara bilgiler okuyucuya daha iyi ve etkili bir şekilde aktarılabilirdi bence.

It's a visual novel, but in the very strict sense - you are literally watching/clicking through a story. There's no puzzle or adventure aspect, it's just John Buchan's 1915 thriller adapted to be run through on a computer.

My first experience was the game launching in 1080p, black barred, on my 1440p monitor. ""No matter,"" I thought, ""I'll just change it once this intro finishes."" The intro finishes, and I'm presented with a save/load screen, and no settings menu. At all. The only setting for this game is the language, although that does at least include disabling subtitles, V/O, and [i]Gaelic[/i]. A Google search later and it turns out the only way to fix the resolution is by editing the registry. So far, some... interesting technical decisions, but it did at least run at 3440x1440, 144fps with no issues.

The ""gameplay"" has some interesting mechanics. It borrows some point and click elements, but they're obviously very linear and mostly unnecessary; they're almost there to check you're still paying attention. It features some abstract use of the mouse to progress through the story, you have to make clockwise or anti-clockwise motions to advance/backtrack through the story text appearing on screen, or complete some quicktime-esque sections by drawing shapes to perform actions (such as opening a door). My favourite element of the game is where one character will be telling a story to another, which is condensed into a comedic animated silent film format. Some elements of the gameplay felt very unnecessary, where sections would be presented as topics on the screen, on which you'd have to click and then read through.

The story itself is set in May-June 1914, and focuses on our protagonist Richard Hannay, a bored, middle-class former mining engineer who gets caught up in the affairs of an American anti-semite. Most of the story feels very forced and [i]too[/i] unbelievable (I mean I get that it's a thriller but come on), and the fact that it's all based around a Jewish conspiracy is very much a [i]yikes[/i] - anti-semitism is only mentioned once, as one of the ""biases"" in Scudder's work, though, looking into this further, apparently the book does more to dismiss/criticise this element of the story, but this adaptation seems to omit that... The story progresses at reasonable pace until the end, where everything feels like it wraps up rather quickly and abruptly. I'm not sure if it's the digital adaptation or the book, but I'm not going to read it to find out.

While most of the story is presented through text on the screen, conversations are voice acted. The voice acting is good overall, though it mostly sits on the extremes of the represented accents - from very posh Imperial British, to harsh Scots, to Cockney London, guv'nor. Scotland is home for most of the story, though despite this most of the characters we meet are still very posh, received pronunciation types.

Generic spooky thriller music accompanies most of the story, though it is broken up by a sick techno breakdown in the credits - I couldn't stop laughing when the glitch noises and bass kicked in. It's a VIP remix of the main theme by Si Begg, available on their Soundcloud.

Overall, I'd say this is reasonably enjoyable if you're into the interactive storytelling thing.",1598528079,1598528079,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The 39 Steps – это своеобразная интерактивная книга, выступающая в роли адаптации приключенческого романа шотландца Джона Бакена “39 ступеней”.

Коротко о сюжете:

Действия игры разворачиваются в Лондоне начала двадцатого века. Наш главный герой Ричард Ханней оказывается обвинен в убийстве, которого не совершал. 
И Ричарду ничего не остаётся, кроме как сбежать из города и скрываться от полиции. 
В то же время он пытается найти настоящих убийц, чтобы доказать свою правоту и добиться истины.

Геймплей:

Как и во всех визуальных новеллах, на протяжении всей игры нам придётся прочитывать текст, слушать диалоги или аудио, кликать на мышь, чтобы пролистать дальше и тд. 
Также присутствуют мини игры, например : найти вещь на сцене или рисовать мышкой фигуры, чтобы сделать конкретное действие.

Музыка и звук:

На мой взгляд, в этой игре прекрасная музыка, погружающая в атмосферу Великобритании 1914 года. 
Также на некоторых сценах есть звуки природы, звуки проезжающих машин и тд, что тоже погружает в атмосферу игры. Кроме того, немаловажным компонентом погружения игрока в этот мир является то, что есть возможность слушать диалоги и повествование на чистом английском и с акцентом шотландского.

Картинка:

От прекрасных рисованных пейзажей в «The 39 Steps» порой попросту захватывает дух. 
Все они выполнены очень и очень красиво.
Также присутствуют черно-белые вставочки а-ля старая кинохроника. 
Очень интересно то, что все персонажи выполнены в виде прозрачных расплывчатых силуэтах. 
И это очень даже необычно, ведь это заставляет нашу фантазию работать на полную катушку, чтобы представить облик героев.

Краткие итоги - 

Достоинства :

+ Прекрасный сюжет
+ Чудесное музыкальное сопровождение
+ Полное погружение в атмосферу Великобритании 1914 года
+ Красивейшие пейзажи
+ Профессиональная озвучка
+ Возможность улучшить свои знания английского
+ Легкие достижения ( Достаточно пройти игру и все достижения ваши )

Недостатки :

- Скучноватый геймплей
- Отсутствие русских субтитров
- Требуется хороший уровень владения английским, чтобы понять сюжет

The 39 Steps – очень необычная и интересная адаптация книги. 
Лично мне очень понравилась эта игра. 
Поэтому однозначно рекомендую к покупке лингвистам, любителям детективов и красивых пейзажей, а также любителям получения легких достижений в играх.

P.S.: Иногда обидно, что редко говорят о играх такого плана, как 39 Steps. 
И зря!

Главное - Это не просто обычная игра, а скорее повествующий детектив с отличными картинками и разнообразными пейзажами, где изредка, щёлкая, приходиться что-то выбирать или больше узнавать информации. 
Игра сделана по книге Джона Бакена - 39 Ступеней. 
Так же есть фильм Хичкока, который, к сожалению, мне так и не удалось посмотреть. 
Она стоит все свои 5 баксов, а сейчас даже меньше 30 - СРОЧНО БЕРИТЕ!

Игра не для всех, т.к даже с субтитрами иногда сложно разобрать почти чистый английский. 
Наикрасивейшие рисованные пейзажи, честно. Хоть бери и в рамочку вешай. Сюжет, как раз для типичных детективах, не говорю о русских.
Рекомендую, тем кто замешкался в сюжете игры, прочесть книгу.
 
Я не мог разобрать, что происходит ближе к концу и мне книга помогла. 
Отличное игра на выходные, чтобы скоротать в ней пару тройку часов, для удовольствия.
Хочу сказать, что игра не пойдет, для тех, кто вообще не любит такого жанра игры - без геймплея. 
Знание английского хотя-бы чуть выше базового. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513477694

[h1] Game Summary: [/h1] 
Apparently, this is a game recreation of a book by the same name, written back in 1915 by John Buchan.  I looked into the story more after finishing the game, and people seem rather captivated by it, as it's been made into a few movie adaptations and a play.  This may stem more from how this was the theoretical first story centered around fleeing from the police and ne'er-do-wells, which is now a fairly popular sub-genre of thriller movie (man on the run).  


If you're like me though, you never heard of anything about this story in any form before seeing this game.  I'll admit that I'm not really sure what motivated anyone to take a novel and make a game out of it.  In essence, it's simply a visual novel, with a small scattering of things for you to interact with, as you progress through the story.  Seemingly it's so much like other visual novels that one would think it'd be perfectly fine, but I'm not sure that it succeeded overall.  


[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
	• The accompanying background music seems well-suited for the story and game.  I can't speak with any expertise as to whether it's period-specific though.  
	• I appreciated the inclusion of black and white photographs of people to give more life and authenticity to the era of the game.  
	• The text was clear and large enough to be easily read by most people.  
	• May scratch an itch for devoted fans of this story or older literature.


[h1] Cons: [/h1] 
	• Infrequently, the game puts in a few sections where you have to move the mouse in specific ways, following a pattern, in order to complete an action and progress.  This may have helped break up the monotony if it were used more often, or for more interesting actions, but the most common use of this mechanic was to open doors.  It's so unusual that it's more hilarious than engaging or interesting.  
	• In the tutorial, the game instructs you to rotate the mouse to either advance or scroll back through the text.  However, you can actually just click the left mouse button to advance text, as would be expected.  The game doesn't tell you this though; I only found out by accident.
	• Characters aren't actually given a full image.  Aside from a small scattering of black and white photographs, you never get to see what Hannay or anyone else looks like, other than as a vague silhouette.  The VN is short-changing you on the visuals.  
	• Some of the driest parts I had to read through were the newspaper clippings.  They really dragged the pace down with uninteresting text bombs.  
	• Occasionally, certain areas of the game are voice-acted, but I never saw any sense on what parts were or weren't.  
	• I don't think the story is very well-written, and I didn't like the protagonist.


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
I'll always acknowledge that VN games don't tend to be my cup of tea, but I think this one was doomed to failure from the start.  For those who'd want to read so much already, they may as well pick up the original novel and go through it the old-fashioned way.  Others would have the option to watch one of the movie adaptations, which provides much more stimulus, without the need for actively scrolling through so much text.  Even if creative liberties need to be taken for it to be film-friendly, deviating from the story somewhat, I'd have much rather simply watched a movie version of this instead.  The medium of a VN provided me no comparative benefit to observing this story another way, meaning the five hours I spent going through the game could have been spent on watching a couple of the movies.  There's no reason for me to recommend this game, when retelling this 100 year old story has been done better elsewhere.",1567446401,1608657796,False,15,1,0.659137964248657227,1,False,False,False,False,,,

So I know what thrillers are, it's a genre I really enjoy. This... well I'm just going to call it what it is. It's a kinetic novel, not a game. You don't make choices or do anything really. The only interactions the game gives you is clicking or rotating your mouse through text (a strange choice), occasionally he'll stop and you can click on a few things in the room to look closer at them or read them if you'd like to, then there's the odd rotating your mouse or pushing it forward to open a door or box for no reason other than interactivity. 

A fan of the books would love this game, the details go above and beyond to the point where you can read every word of every newspaper if you'd like to. There's also a ton of unnecessary details that the player doesn't, will never need to know, and will forget after playing. It's clear that a fan of the novels made this ""game"", but they took no consideration for people that have never read the books. If you're coming in blind then it's not thrilling in the slightest, it's long winded and doesn't know a quote I enjoy a lot, ""A conversation should be like a short skirt. Long enough to cover the important bits, but short enough to leave them wanting more."" This is a good philosophy for story telling too. The reader or in this case player needs a reason to stick around, and they simply don't give you one.

If your a fan of the source material, go nuts, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. A newcomer won't find much for themselves here though.

-Long winded, it doesn't keep you engaged or wanting more
-Not thrilling at all
-Pointless interactivity just for the sake of being interactive
-A lot of the times it wouldn't let me click to go forward on the dialog, I don't know if it has trouble switching between cutscenes and kinetic novel but it liked to tell me no when trying to advance through dialog.

One thing I will point out is that many games will ""dress up"" a story on rails by trying to convince the player they're in the scene by finding interaction points, choosing dialogue options, etc - but The 39 Steps doesn't waste time with that. There is stuff to investigate, but they will clearly highlight it on the screen.

Apparently, this game is based on James Buchanan's 1915 novel of the same name, which also influenced the James Bond series. Go figure. I've never read the novel, but maybe I'll give it a whirl someday. Regardless, I enjoy a good piece of interactive fiction from time to time, and I feel like I got what I was looking for with The 39 Steps.

Being more of a visual novel, you can expect to do quite a bit of reading; however, that's made enjoyable by the eye-catching graphics/art style, excellent voice acting, and lovely soundtrack. From walking around foggy London streets to hiking through the Scottish countryside, the music and art combine to really enhance the overall mood. Aside from the reading, most of the game's action sequences revolve around relatively simple scene searches and mouse movements. The latter can feel a bit silly, especially when you're just going through the motions to open a door or something, but it's what you'd expect from a visual novel so I wasn't particularly annoyed. Each scene is also relatively short, which offers the player a break from the ""action"" (reading).

Perhaps more appropriately categorized as a visual novel, it tells a very solid story through on-screen text, narration, dialogue, and artwork in a surprisingly varied amount of styles.

While the main gameplay interaction is simply pressing the right arrow key to cycle lines of text (*see note below), this is broken up with occasional variations on point-and-click, such as scanning newspaper articles, selecting objects in a room, and drawing shapes with the mouse. If it sounds basic and uninteresting, well, it is - but that's not the point of the game. These mechanics only serve to add a bit of spice to the main intent of this experience, which is to sit back, relax, and enjoy a good story.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the plot of [i]The 39 Steps[/i] is well crafted, adapted from a novel written in 1915 by a Scottish author named John Buchan. It follows a simple three act structure, where the main character unwittingly gets tangled up in a political conspiracy, goes on the run from his enemies, and eventually tries to gain the upper hand. Richard Hannay, the protagonist and narrator, is crafty and intelligent, and it's a pleasure to witness how he handles several very dangerous situations through quick thinking and improvisation. Although the pace of the story feels slow due to the calm cadence of its text, it actually moves at a pretty brisk pace, covering a novel's worth of events in the span of about 3 hours. I imagine much of the writing from the book was copied verbatim here, albeit heavily abridged to serve the pace of a game. This is not an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but it's nevertheless an entertaining ride - perfect for a quiet evening or two at home with a cup of tea, enjoyed the same way one would enjoy a good book.

I won't include spoilers here, but my only complaint with the story is its ending - I am again assuming this is kept true to the novel. Story structure was much different 100 years ago, and the third act builds intrigue and mystery in a way that today's standards would demand some sort of interesting twist or confrontation but ultimately falls very flat, followed by an abrupt ending that offers no closure to the characters involved. It's a heavy dud at the end of an otherwise enjoyable tale.

The game's best feature is its historical setting - taking place in 1914 in wartime Europe, the writing and dialogue reflect a strong grasp on the English language as it was used and written at that time, delivered with some superb voice acting. All of the artwork is again period-accurate, mostly delivered in the format of painted stills of European environments in both the city and countryside. Although character art exists in the game, most scenes show people as silhouettes - this is to the game's benefit, since the real focus is on the voice work.

Similar to novels like Mark Danielewski's [i]House of Leaves[/i], the way the text is presented sometimes follows the on-screen action, adding to the drama of a scene in a minimalistic way. Animation is effective where it needs to be. And even though most scenes are composed of stills, there is a vibrant and lively sound effects track present throughout, emphasizing scenes with soundscapes like a bustling train station or a gentle river in a farming village, layered with surprisingly well-arranged music.

This isn't the type of game that can ever hope to receive a showering of praise from today's gaming audience. It's a small-scale, small-budget interactive novel that only takes a few hours to complete. But what it sets out to do it succeeds in doing very admirably. If you enjoy reading novels, there is a good chance you will appreciate the tone and pacing of this interactive story. Were it to have a more fulfilling ending, I would have considered it a near-perfect experience.

They make it sound like it's going to be a very interesting story - a thriller!

Graphics of the scenery were nice, but that's about all I can compliment. The voiceovers were okay but a lot of them had accents that were difficult to understand, with subtitles that were no help. There were parts of the story (usually the dreadful Scottish accents!) that I had no idea what was going on, thanks to the accents and use of dated language. The only ""interactive"" part of the ""game"" was doing some different movements with the mouse (to do things like open a door...) so you're not constantly clicking or rotating clockwise to progress the text. It took me three hours to complete, which I had to do in several sittings as I kept on getting bored while waiting for something exciting to happen, and there were no missable achievements.

The story itself, which is the main point of a visual novel, is good, as would be expected as it is based on a real novel.

That being said, since there is not much gameplay involved, the judgement of this ""game"" is then mostly on the technical execution side. Let's just go through my experience:

I launch the game, and dreadully I notice that it goes into full screen mode using 1920x1080 resolution, downsizing the desktop from the native 3840x2160, causing all open previously windows, Steam included, to be moved and resized. So the first thing in the main menu I am looking for graphics options to change the resolution, in vain. A bit upset of this setback, I start the story.

The game starts with a kind of a tutorial on the controls, telling to make a clockwise motion with mouse to progress on the text, and use left mouse click to progress at the end of a scene. A bit awkward way to do it. Then it explains that the game is mostly pointer-free and that if you see the mouse cursor, that's the cue that it's time to interact with it. And the first scene is to click on your Apartment to go in there.

At this point, since the wrong resolution is taking away the enjoyment already, I hit Escape in hopes of a in-game menu that might contains some settings to fix it. Instead, it brings a menu containing Events, Cards, Bookmarks, and Extras. I click through them but don't find any options to change the resolution, so in the Events screen I see one tile is unlocked, presuming that to be the start of the game, so I click on that, and choose to Play. Apparently doing that just skipped the rest of the tutorial and went directly to the first chapter of the actual story. Later I find out that completing the tutorial would yield one of the in-game awards, and there is no way to get back to the tutorial. So thanks, trying to fix a technical issue just permanently banned me from getting one unlockable on this profile. Whatever, let's continue the story.

Despite having missed the tutorial, I quickly learn the rest of the game mechanics, how to interact with objects, and how the story plays out. Not really a fan of the mouse movement to progress on text, I try to figure out alternative ways to progress and find out that simply clicking the left mouse button appears to do the same as the mouse movement, but unlike waving with the mouse, it also works for the end of the scene, for what it was for instructed in the tutorial. Still, not keen on keeping my hand on the mouse all the time for a game that's mostly about reading text, I tried pressing Enter (or Return, as they call it) and that seemed to work too!

Except, at some points I notice that if I press Enter, the game doesn't just progress to the next piece of text, but totally skips the scene. This seemed random to me, and there was even a part where using keyboard didn't progress forward but mouse click did. Too bad that the game is about the text, and this made me miss some of it! I didn't see an easy way to go back. Also, because of this random scene-skipping, I encountered a bug that after the end of an Event, skipping the final scene caused the event completion achievement not unlocking, and also the next Event tile stayed locked and black, even though the story itself progressed forward. Funnily, at the end of the game I got the achievement for completing all the events, even though one event completion achievement was still locked due to this bug!

At some point I had to Alt-Tab out of the game. On first try it worked all fine, just with the inconvenience of resolution switching back and forth, causing window sizing and scaling problems, but on the next try the game just froze and I couldn't go back in. Fortunately the progress is auto-saved constantly, so no progress was lost. At this point I went through the Steam Discussion for the game and found out that you can change the in-game screen resolution by editing Windows Registry. A bit cumbersome for such a basic setting, but at least I managed to make the game run with the native resolution now.

Also later on I found out that in the Extra menu there is a section explaining the controls, and there it says that Left and Right arrow keys are aliases for the mouse-controlled text progression, and Return is for skipping the scene. So it was somehow my fault for not finding this information first and only learning the hard way to refrain from reading the text using Enter (as it didn't always skip the whole scene...!) Also in the Controls section it told me that Backspace goes back to previous scene. Oh would that also have been handy to know at the times I mistakenly skipped something. I wonder why the keyboard controls weren't mentioned at all during the tutorial? (yes, I did then replay the tutorial with different player profile to see how that part goes through)

At least I managed to get all the Steam achievements, thanks to the ability to jump back to any scene from the Events menu, so I jumped back to the end of the event where I bug-skipped the ending, to unlock the last thing. Still I am missing some of the in-game unlockables for this profile, including the tutorial completion, which apparently is impossible to get if you happen to skip it by mistake. Normally I would go replay a game to unlock the rest of the collectibles, and in this case to read the scenes I missed because of non-explained controls, but the way the story is told is putting me off.

The actual story text is not that plentiful, to tell what's happening with the protagonist, usually a few sentences per scene, but then all the unnecessary text, such as newspaper articles that have nothing to do with the plot, can have many pages of text to be read. I would have expected the opposite, and would have loved to read more of the feelings and environment, as I presume would have been the case in the original text novel. I am only guessing that the authors of the game tried to minimize the text to the reader, and use the artwork to replace much of the environmental description.

So, since the way the story was presented was suboptimal, and due to all the technical issues that would have been basic to fix, I cannot recommend the game as it is.",1546800248,1546800312,False,4,0,0.546436309814453125,1,False,False,False,False,,,

- The bad part is that the story is nowhere close to good, every action has little to no consequence on the hero.
- Too bad they decided to use siluettes as characters, it tore away the personalities of them.
- Its unnecessarily slow, it kept me waiting for too long between cutscenes
- The chapter menu came out after every chapter (so every ~12 minutes)

I believe I received The 39 Steps as part of a bundle.  I would not personally pay full price for it.  It does not take very long to complete and I'd classify it more as a visual novel than a game.  The ""puzzles"" are nothing more than mimicking a few strokes, the plot is completely linear.

An adaptation of a historical adventure thriller, The 39 Steps is best enjoyed slowly, as it really offers no choices but plays more like an audiobook that matches your pace. The characters appear only as silhouettes, which seems hard to keep track of but nevertheless works effectively, allowing for the same expressive imagination as reading a book. There are several instances where the protagonist engages in investigation of his surroundings, which will manifest as close-ups to crime scenes or post Edwardian-era inspired newspaper clippings. The game is not terribly long, overall, but it struck just the right amount for me as I had been getting anxious to finish towards the denouement. 

[h1]✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* 　PROS　 *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧[/h1]

❧ Fantastic voice acting - very clever use of dialects all over the UK, and the fluidity of some characters' abilities to switch between accents really brings the feeling of a spy thriller to life. Really, worth it for this alone if you wait for a sale.

❧ Feels appropriate for the period, and takes an interesting approach into a believable, slightly alternate history.

❧ Decent variety of environments. Some are hand-drawn, others are stock photos with some photo effects to mask them. Nothing really stands out, but it's not unpleasant to look at for hours. Often very pretty, better than most cartoon styles in my opinion.

❧ Fairly atmospheric, between the sound effects, music and constant feeling of danger and mistrust. 

❧ I appreciate the writing and that the descriptive text tends to be much better than most visual novels - again, likely because this is an adaptation.

❧ Occasionally very thrilling - some scenes gripped me so much, paired with sound effects, that I really felt compelled to see the chapters through.


[h1]✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* CONS *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧[/h1]

❧ The protagonist, Richard Hannay, is completely odious and unlikeable in my opinion. He can be said to have a personality, at the very least, even if it is arrogant and entitled. It's tolerable, but mostly I feel I have to bear through him to appreciate the rest of the story.

❧ Periodically very tedious, even for the patient. Some scenes are unskippable, text speed and transitions are slow. Don't rush through. Enjoy it with a cup of tea, or you won't enjoy it at all.

❧ Perhaps it is because the game must necessarily lack the same depth as the book, the last half-hour felt distinctly unsatisfying, underscored largely because (endgame spoiler) [spoiler]the protagonist spends an egregious amount of time doubting something that should be obvious[/spoiler], although it does fit well enough into the spy theme. It just felt like a very slow end to an otherwise more exciting pace. [spoiler]Then again, the narrative always indicates that we should trust nothing, and such misdirections and disguises happen all throughout.[/spoiler]

[h1]✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* CONCLUSIONS *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧[/h1]

Likely not for everyone, including those who typically like visual novels. Still, it is a nice change of pace from the typical anime style on Steam, and at times thrilling enough to make me want to take a look at the original book.",1543729078,1543729715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Its strongest point is the story, but the story is based on a novel written over 100 years ago, so that's not exactly a compliment to the production of this game.

The ""gameplay"" is to a great degree a very passive and patience-testing experience. There is virtually zero animation and the text and scene transitions are slow. The game is minimally interactive and feels dead. They also tried to reinvent the wheel with the UI a little bit. Thankfully, everything was divided into chapters, which made it easier to play and finish. I suggest we add a new tag called ""Patience Training"" just for the sake of this game.

Also, giving out 100% achievements just for playing the game is very dull and unimaginative.

But nevertheless, if one can look past all this, overall the game did manage to have a good enough atmosphere (the voice acting and sound design were superb) and to leave a memorable impression. Having completed it, I can say that I have a fond memory of it and that I would play it again. But I would play it again in the same way I would read a book again, so it's actually a very confusing feeling.

The 39 Steps es una novela visual basada en la novela de misterio/suspense de John Buchan de 1915. La historia y el texto están intactos: poco antes del estallido de la Primera Guerra Mundial, el ex oficial del ejército Richard Hannay se establece en Londres. Su estado mental cambia literalmente de la noche a la mañana cuando un vecino, Franklin Scudder, se refugia en su apartamento y revela que ha tropezado con un complot alemán para asesinar al primer ministro griego y robar los planes de Gran Bretaña para el estallido de la Gran Guerra. Cuando Scudder es asesinado unos días después, Hannay cree que es el próximo. Él huye hacia el campo, esquivando varios intentos en su vida mientras trata de revelar el cifrado que utilizó Scudder para encriptar sus notas sobre la trama alemana.

La versión de The 39 Steps de Story Mechanics combina texto e imágenes para hacer que la historia de Buchan cobre vida. Te mueves de escena en escena, cada uno muy bellamente ilustrado. Los efectos de sonido hacen eco, incluyendo pasos, respiración pesada, traqueteos de trenes y apertura y cierre de puertas. Hay bits animados ocasionales que juegan puntos de trama. Algunos interludios presentan una actuación de voz de alta calidad respetuosa con los personajes de Buchan. Un punto notable es que sus personajes humanos están representados por siluetas. Nunca ves con claridad la cara de Hannay, o la de Scudder, que deberían ser buenas noticias para cualquier persona que no le guste las adaptaciones de libro a película porque estropean la visión del lector sobre los personajes del libro.

This digital adaptation worths every click of your mouse (it needs to be said, you won't be doing anything more complicated than this!). Visually, the hand-painted scenes carry the spirit of the book faitfully, and my recommendation is to enjoy this reading of the 39 steps under dim light, preferably in one winter, rainy night sitting. The developers have made a very thorough research in the historical setting of the novel, and a number of collectables during the game can be used as short but very informative references to the social and cultural context of early 20th century Britania on the eve of the 'Great War'. From imperial maps and local Scottish accents to the anti-semitism that unfortunately can be found in Buchan's and many of his contemporaries' worldview, this amazing visual novel will serve as a history seminar to those willing to discover its rich texture. Enjoy it as if every click is the turn of a page, and if you have not done so already try and grab a copy of the book. 
Achievements come naturally as you progress, and will pop up even when you are offline, but collecting and reading both sides of the in-game cards is far more rewarding and entertaining.

Story: 8/10

Based on the novel, the game has a really strong story which is told through fantastic voice acting. The chapters are broken up in neat segments which makes for easy saving and returning to the game at a later time. The story is gripping though it has it's downfall as you essentially have little choice or interactability in comparison with other point and click story-orientated games. For a game based on a novel, it makes for a great story and an enjoyable journey.

Mechanics: 4/10

Simplistic mechanics, similar to other games of the genre. As the story follows a linear narrative and offers little choice, the mechanics boil down to simple point and click, scrolling through walls of text and occasionally listening to the voice overs. Between reading and dialogue, there's little to do, not much for puzzles or interactability. The game leads you down a rather straigh path though the story makes up for it.

Aesthetics: 7/10

The art style is appealing and easy on the eye. There's not much eye candy or flashy scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, though combined with the strong narrative, the art work allows for a pleasurable experience which is easy to follow. Nothing too special but definitely a pretty game.

Overall - 8/10

If you can play a game entirely for the story and a simple but enjoyable journey, this game is great. Recommended.",1533217817,1533217817,True,2,0,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Assim, se você busca algo com escolhas, desafios e etc., não é aqui que você encontrará.

Além disso, existe a questão do idioma, porque o inglês praticado aqui é por vezes difícil. Quando se trata de escocês então, em que a transcrição ocorre com o sotaque, é melhor tentar escutar, porque da leitura surgirão enigmas idiomáticos.

Ultrapassadas essas considerações, gostei bastante do trabalho feito pelos desenvolvedores. A trilha sonora é envolvente, a história se desenrola rápido e é fácil se envolver na trama de espionagem e reviravoltas. A arte do jogo não é maravilhosa, mas detalhes como fotos históricas, reproduções de jornais antigos, desenhos de mapas antigos e até pequenas animações bem humoradas demonstram a preocupação em ambientar o roteiro e conduzir o leitor ao ambiente narrado.

TLDR: Worth a check but not a permanent collection spot. Good characters, well presented, but low interactivity, no replayability and very abrupt disappointing ending. 

Effectively presented historical thriller slideshow with quality voiceovers and sound effects. Very little interactiviity. Short. Ending felt abrupt and unsatisfying.

The 39 steps starts with three or four lengthier chapters, setting up the base of the story. There are enough plot hooks, characterizations and intense quality conversation to hold attention. The dialogue felt credible, historically credible, accents matched. The art was relaxing and transitioned slowly and elegantly between scenes. Very little use of animation was present, but on the rare occasions that it was present, it was done tastefully and it enhanced the experience.

The maps were well done and gave a good grasp of the location of the character along the journeying. However, the social maps, were not so well constructed. The journal was cryptic and decoding it was done through QTE's and a poorly described deciphering method. The newspaper were filled with details but could not be zoomed in comfortably enough to read any of them and summoning the text though the unsatisfying interface often led to seemingly pointless bits of political insight and rivalries being reported on about the paper.

This is meant to turn into some sort of TInker Tailor Soldier Spy scenario with the uncovering of spies, and a lot of disguises, psychological misdirection and the like. The game also has a very faint hint of cthulhu to it, with some of your antagonists being increasingly described as having certain odd quirks of behaviors, uncommon talents and whatnot.

The game ends very abruptly at the end of a chapter as you foil an intelligence leak outside the coutnry using the journal from the intro then the game cuts off to credits immediately. While the game did not leave a ton unexplained, it just did not feel like the buildup leading up to it, slow and detailed that it was, would simply fall flat anticlimactically the way it has.

This, in short, is a more enjoyable game than say Alter Ego. While Alter Ego had decent historical characters, arguably better looking environments, nice fluff art, and equally good if not better voice acting, it also had a lot of pixelhunting, grocery list crossing type detecting sleuth hunts that left you frustrated and in need of a walktrhough. In comparison the 39 steps was much more relaxing. The game might not had been very interactive but it concentrated on what it did and it did well at it. The problem is that it does not feel like a complete package either. While Alter Ego was just rushed out unfinished I am not sure what the deal is with the 39 steps. Perhaps this is in fact a whole story but with the slideshow presentation too many details were cut out from the book and it does not impact the same way. Or maybe it too was cut short. After all the chapters did seem to become shorter and shorter as the game progressed where by the end you just wondered why they even stuck with that structure at all anymore.",1530691473,1530723340,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This isn't a typical point & click with puzzles to solve. It isn't a hidden object game or a choose your own adventure story. It is quite literally a novel that has been digitally enhanced with a bit of sound effects, artwork, voice acting, and maybe the occasional mouse ""task"" like moving it a certain direction or clicking in a certain place. It isn't meant to challenge you, just to engage you more deeply as you read a really great story.

Now for my review:

Pros:
This is the most brilliant way I have seen a visual novel presented so far. I really enjoyed this. I thought it was very well done actually. To other devs who are looking to do a visual novel or as this dev has coined it a ""digital adaptation"" of thier novel or story, get this and learn from it. This is how you do it right. The art was beautifully done as was the voice acting. There was just enough movement and visualization to not take away from the text, and it wasn't just the reader left clicking endlessly through text like a lot of visual novels. 

At first I was a bit annoyed by the rotation of the mouse to progress the text but once I got used to it I quite liked it. It added a movement and removed the constant drone of clicks from my reading the story. Also, I found that if it bothers you that much you can still click instead of rotate and it will progress you through the same way as if you had rotated, you're just not able to reverse this way. 

The story itself kept me engaged. This is really going to be based on your personal taste. I love a good story about crime and espionage, if you need some romance and teen drama to keep you interested then this probably isn't the tale for you. 

I was very thankful to be able to read what the voice actors were saying, even when we maybe shouldn't have needed to. Some of the words and phrases took me a minute to figure out because the dialects and accents were so strong, but they were very fitting to the story and it just made it work even better, so that isn't a complaint. 

The artwork and visualization mixed with the sound effects were amazing. There was a point where I actually had to grab a blanket and cover up because the dreary London rain had made me chilly even though it's the dead of a hot muggy summer where I live. Really well done.

Cons:
In order to give some constructive criticism I will say that there are times in the story the voice acting echoes and glitches a bit, but other than that I completely enjoyed every moment of it. 

I will say I think the price point is too high. This is probobly the best visual novel I've experiences so far, but the most I've ever paid for one was $5, this at full price is 3 times that. The right audience still might be willing to pay that much for this though...it is really well done. I'm not even sure where I got this from, I'm thinking it was in a bundle of keys I bought or possibly one I traded for in a group I'm in, but I know I would have never paid full price for it and that's a shame because I would have missed out on something awesome had it not come my way through a less expensive route. I would have never been able to justify the cost to myself though knowing the genre, even though it is one I enjoy, having not ""played"" it first.

[b]What Is It?[/b]
This game is actually a book, in digital form.  It's an adventure game of the ""no choices to make"" variety, so don't come here expecting to [i]do things[/i].  It's based on a 1915 spy/mystery novel of the same name (also made into a movie in 1935, directed by Alfred Hitchcock.)

[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]
It's quite a good read.  If you're looking to get the same feeling out of a video game that you'd get from reading an [i]actual book,[/i] then this is it.  Only with beautiful artwork and decent sound effects mixed in to enhance the atmosphere.

The dialogue spoken throughout the story is fully voice acted - and quite well, I thought - whereas the internal monologue of the main character is just text on screen.  It creates an interesting duality, to listen to some things and read others.

[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]
The controls, as explained at the beginning, are a bit odd.  Rotate the mouse clockwise to advance the text?  Rotate counterclockwise to go back?  What?  Thankfully, you don't actually have to do that.  You can just left-click anywhere to advance the text, which is much more intuitive.  I'm not sure why the game didn't mention that.

[b]Will I Like It?[/b]
+ Classic spy thriller
+ A contemporary vision of 1914 England (the book was written in the time its story was set.)
+ Beautiful art
+ Decent voice acting

- Weird controls (not sure why they bothered, given the alternate controls make so much more sense)

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
The 39 Steps is the first in a series of novels by the same author.  Sadly, it doesn't look like any more of them are coming in game form, given that this game was first released in 2013 and nothing new has been heard since.  I would've liked to have seen them, but I suppose I'll have to settle for reading them on paper.

Der Roman des Schotten, der es im britischen Weltreich bis zum Generalgouverneur Kanadas schaffte, gilt als Weltliteratur. Zumindest so, wie es in dieser Adaption rüberkommt, kann ich dies nicht begreifen. Für mich ist der Roman eine hanebüchene, billige Geschichte, die zudem den Staub von über 100 Jahren so erfolgreich angesammelt hat, dass es besser gewesen wäre, ihn allenfalls noch literaturhistorisch zu betrachten.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1404546637

Dabei beginnt es relativ spannend mit einem Mord. Aber die Verschwörung, die da aufgedeckt wird, konnte ich bald nicht mehr ernst nehmen. In dieser Geschichte wimmelt es von unglaublichen Zufällen, die der Hauptperson, Richard Hannay, mal so, mal so widerfahren. Selbst in der Einsamkeit Schottlands begegnet er genau immer den Leuten, die von Bedeutung sind. Die fast übermächtige deutsche Agententruppe, die, wie für Deutsche üblich, immer nach einem genauen, finsteren Plan arbeiten, und am Vorabend des Ausbruchs des ersten Weltkrieges wichtige Informationen erbeuten wollen, finde ich ein übles Stereotyp. Aber dieser Plan war so absurd, dass es eigentlich nur für einen Groschenroman gut ist.

Sehr interessant gemacht ist die Darstellung des britischen Lebens von 1914 mit dem Obrigkeitsdenken, dem Gentlemangehabe, dem British-Empire-Überlegenheits-Getue.

Das Buch wurde auch von dem berühmten britischen Rgissuer Alfred Hk. (dessen Name Steam uns nicht schreiben lässt) 1935 verfilmt, wo es aber wesentlich unterhaltsamer zu sein scheint.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1404548065

Wie dem auch sei, ich fand die ganze Sache bald mehr als mühselig. Die wenigen Interaktionen können kaum als Interaktion bezeichnet werden. Man muss vielleicht mal 2, 3 Sachen auf dem Screen finden oder soll Mausbewegungen durchführen.

Künstlerisch haben die Entwickler allerdings eine gute Leistung abgeliefert. Es sind offenbar alles gemalte Bilder von oft sehr schönen Landschaften und Häusern. Aber Handlungen werden nur angedeutet und die Personen sind nur als Schatten dargestellt, was ich nicht so toll fand.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1404547380

Für uns Deutsche anspruchsvoll sind die unterschiedlichsten britischen Akzente, die die offenbar sehr guten Sprecher, an den Tag legen. Meist konnte ich aber gut erahnen, worüber gerade gesprochen wurde.

Die Musik ist recht passend stimmungsvoll.

Die Steuerung ist sehr einfach. Warum man nun aber kreisförmige Bwegungen machen muss, um bei Text zurückzublättern, ist mir ein Rätsel. Vorwäts kommt man glücklicherweise auch mit einem Mausklick.

Es gibt viele Errungenschaften, die alle automatisch freigeschaltet werden.

The 39 Steps — это текстовая игра, с элементами поиска предметов, даже, мы должны брать вещи и рассматривать их. 
Основой для игры послужил роман Джона Бакена, который он написал в 1915-м году. Позже, этот роман был экранизирован Альфредом Хичкоком, известным режиссером той эпохи.
Сюжет рассказывает нам историю канадца Ричарда Хэнни, который приезжает в Англию и знакомится с девушкой, которая представляется, как Аннабелль. Хэнни становится ""козлом отпущения"", ведь на него скидывают убийство Аннабелль, которая оказывается секретным агентом. От нее, Хэнни узнает секрет ""39 ступеней"" и начинает своё путешествие по Британии. 
Если говорить про игру, то она очень хороша. В игре очень красивая и атмосферная графика, и прекрасная музыка той эпохи, напоминает трилогию BioShock (для меня все старые композиции - ностальгия по Биошок).
Рекомендовать я игру буду, но только тем, кто не прочь посидеть вечерком и почитать шпионский роман. На момент написания обзора, цена на игру составляет 29 рублей, действует скидка в 90%.",1527160914,1549172681,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I thought this was really well done.  It's kind of like part audiobook, part point-n-click, and part Ken Burn's PBS documentary.  It's telling a well-written story with voice actors for all the characters and you read just the descriptive narrative lines.  And while the voice actors read to you, the still scene slightly shifts or characters fade in/out.

And while this may sound boring, it's not.  It's a very intriguing story that is presented in a very simplistic, but appealing way.

There's a few scenes where you also (albeit minimally) interact with the scene.  Such as clicking on the location where the character is proceeding, or clicking on various objects in a room to get more background information on items, events, and characters, all to progress the story along.

Several times, other characters tell stories of events and these are presented as (animated) old-timey silent films complete with the ubiquitous flickering light and smudged filmstrip debris.  Very cool.

The mixture of sound and imagery really makes a great experience, even (or especially) for someone who hasn't read the original book.

The player (reader) most of the time experiences Hannay's inner monologue, (which is seldomly more than one sentence at a time which makes it quite an easy read), the pacing is good and the well thought-out usage of visual effects on some sequences adds up to the experience of Hannay's feelings.
The audio work for dialogues and backgrounds really stands out and may certainly match the quality of a well directed radio drama. There's even been decent work put into stereophony for in- and outdoor scenes, which I really appreciate. The voice actors did a swell job giving their characters specific and recognizeable personalities and the accents sounded really convincing to me (as a non-british/scottish speaker).
Some little audio bugs can occur however, the background audio sometimes loops longer than it's supposed to or (very seldomly) cuts out entirely. It's worth mentioning but not too grave - also, a quick reload of the chapter usually fixes the issue.
The painted backgrounds are pretty decent most of the time and they manage to catch the atmosphere of the ongoing scene. They sometimes vary in quality and even art style and the SFX are nothing to ride home about. But again, it's nothing too dramatic. I respect and appreciate the work put into them.

Eli periaatteessa tässä vaan painetaan nappia, jonka jälkeen tulee tekstiä ruutuun, joka luetaan ja sitten taas toistetaan tätä samaa. Kappale kappaleelta edetään kohti loppua. Tarinankerronnan tueksi on lyöty kasaan läjä taustamaisemia, hahmokortteja, pieniä videopätkiä sun muita. Nää on kaikki ihan kivaa bonusta, mutta tekstiä on välillä vaikea erottaa taustasta, joten se päähomma, eli lukeminen on joskus ihan uskomattoman työlästä ja raskasta hommaa.

Pientä Point & Click -henkeä on luotu peliin sillä, että pari kertaa tarinan edetessä tulee vastaan semmoinen ruutu, missä voi tutkia muutamia esineitä ja asioita. Tämän lisäksi pelissä on muutama pieni minipeli. Tämmöisiä ovat muun muassa lukittujen ovien avaamiset. Niissä käytännössä vain piirretään käsketty kuvio, mutta noh, onpahan jotain tekemistäkin heh heh.

Tarina on siis hyvä ja ehkä tää ois ollut parempi ihan full hd e-kirjana, koska noi interaktiiviset osat on vähän niin ja näin, mutta kyllä tää varmasti tarinan puolesta vois sopia aika hyvin vaikkapa junamatkalle tekemiseksi. Tai sitten vaan ostaa kirjan ja lukee suorilta sen kokonaisena.

I was wrong, it is much more. It is a totally new take on an already marvelous book. In short, it is a pretty straighforward graphics novel mixing lots of different gameplay mechanics to give a somewhat interactive storytelling experience using rich, vibrant, and elaborate scenes that are true to that period in time. On top of that, a wonderful soundtrack and carefully placed sound effects bring the scene to life. IMO, it is not a perfect implementation of the idea and does have its fair share of flaws, but for a first take, it is very good.

On the plus (+) side:
[list]
    [*] Rich and vibrant scenes with enjoyable sound effects to match. Great attention to detail.
    [*] Scenes have a certain depth to them which can be seen when the camera moves as for example the background moves more than something in the foreground such as a window.
    [*] Collectibles exist that give more information on characters and none can be missed as they are automatically acquired by progressing in the story.
    [*] Scenes that should be voiced are voiced and narration, thoughts and actions are not voiced.
[/list]

On the negative (-) side:
[list]
    [*] Nothing much to interact with except mostly pieces of importance. No short wonder upon meaningless interaction with a seemingly background object, such as either a bird that flies away or a flag that flutters when the cursor is put over them.
    [*] I haven't read all the newspapers in detail, but important storywise, I have only seen one typing ""error"", or more accurately the word 'in' was repeated once right after it was used. (I was hesitating between putting this in + or -) 
    [*] Stopping to read the collectibles (or cards) is a must as soon as they are obtained as they give useful information to understand the characters as well as a photo of them (the characters are not shown during the story at all, only shadows).
    [*] Personally, I think that the narration should have been voiced. So, expect to read a lot and have a love to read to get through this.
    [*]  Again, personally, the real life photos broke immersion for me and I did not particularly like that, and if one thing should be changed, it's those. But then again, purely my opinion.
[/list]

NOTE (absolutely read before starting):
[olist]
    [*] The game introduces a clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation mechanics for progressing in the story, but left and right arrow of the keyboard works fine and is definitely less frustrating.
    [*] The menu can be quite confusing at first but it really is simple, have some patience. Also, do NOT right-click when it introduces the pause feature during the tutorial, it is frustrating especially as you might skip the tutorial. Feel free to experiment with right-click menu as soon as the tutorial ends and the first event (chapter) starts.
    [*] The Extras menu is confusing and is not just a statistics page. At first, I didn't realise that the options on the left side could be clicked on for further details as it does not look that way.
    [*] When an event ends and you are directly taken to the pause menu, just right-click to move on to the following event.
    [*] Easily put bookmarks (save games) by pressing 'A' at any time and in the bookmarks page, a very convenient % shows how much of the Event had been covered when it was created.

for most of the time i have played this game i started and restarted the game from the begging. using the right click for pause and not stating that it is also a menu button through me off.
so you click pause it does not pause the game and state itsapused it goes straight to menu where i kept restarting my game.
after a few attempts at this game i have given up on it.
i might try this again in a few weeks. months or when ever and revisit this review but for now i am not interested.
dissapointed as i have ALOT of point and click games and the one i really liked the story of i cant even get into the game due to trying to rember that my right click is pause and i need to click again to click again to unpause and not go back to the first square and resetting my whole game.
i hope this review helps people. please feelfree to tell me if i am able to change my in game settings because that would help me get further than the starting dialog.



I have revisited this game, and using the help i got from comments below i have found it actually easy to get into, it is simple to navigate and the story follows the book so well. 
i have changed this from unrecomened to recomended as i managed to get further into the game, i have just opened the second chapter.
thank you to PhantomEcho327 for your much needed help.
i am happy to say that i left my orignal review as other people might have the same troubles which i fell in with :)

Inspirado na obra literaria de John Buchan's: The Thirty-Nine Steps. 
O jogo possui uma ótima ambientação e é bastante envolvente, possui uma imersão considerável para o jogador e desfruta de uma boa hitsoria.

Pros: (Creio que citei tudo acima)
+Ótima historia
+Alto nível de imersão
+Trilha sonora e efeitos sonoros condizentes com o que está acontecendo
+Possui uma campanha complexa, porém curta. Isso é bom para não cair no ócio.

Contras:
-Uso exagerado de Cutscenes.
-Gameplay lenta e não muito dinâmica.

Recomendo? Sim, porém não com o valor atual (R$24,99) recomendo que espere entrar em promoção.

This is a Text clicking game.


[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

There are 3 different profile slots available.
There is no options available.
There is subtitles which you could toggle.

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

The game may look confusing at start but it's really easy game. You will have the option to read the text and you could click it away for some new text. Sometimes you will have to explore around a bit to find more text, or clues which will probaly give you more text. There is almost no actions. Only Texts.. Walls of text.

Interesting story if you pay attention to it.
There are subtitles if you have turned it on.
The subtitles has been voiced-over.
The game plays on low speed.
You are not able to skip cutscenes or dialogues.
It's pretty boring as you will only sit on your chair.. click, read, click and read.
Has different chapters.
Price tag is too high for what the game has to offer.
Low replay value.


[h1]Other things.[/h1]
Sometimes clicking on ""continue story"" will reset the story.
This is a game? I thought it was a bad movie.

The 39 Steps is a beautiful visual novel, with very subtle game play elements. It is based off a paper back novel so needless to say it has a great story. I started playing The 39 steps for something to relax with. A bedtime story that I would read my self. By the second chapter I realized I would not be going to bed until I finished this story.  

Talk about amazing screen shots, the 39 Steps provides them. Page after page of jaw dropping visual stills, newspaper clipping and old timely photos will keep your eyes entertained. The presentation of the story its self intrigues me, you have the option to be as involved or not in the actual interpretation of the story as you want. Some parts are voice acted others fade onto the screen in the form of text and lastly you can dig around for newspaper clipping and note pads that contain even more information. It is up to you if you read any of it, listen to the story, or just aimlessly click through.

That being said there is some game play mechanics, like moving your mouse in circles to open doors, or up and down to search a box. Most your thoughts will go into reading and listening. It is not a CSGO  trainer that is for sure. 

 I have not previously read this story, as I mentioned above I intended to put my self to sleep with The 39 Steps. Well here we are 2hours and some coffee breaks later, writing a review because it was that great. I  shame my self for not having read it before, and deep down makes me ask, what is it about video games that keep me entertained for hours while the thought of reading a short 300 page novel makes me dread life? As another user mentioned in there review, there should be more books converted into “games” like this. 

I know this one is not for everyone, but for those of you who like to read, like history or epic screen shots I recommend this one for you. 

P.S I got this in haste thinking it was The Running Man by Richard Bachman a.k.a Stephen King. It seems I mixed the characters name and the authors to read Richard Bachman.  The 39 Steps is just as good. I am still happy with the purchase. FYI this is not the Running Man.",1505105391,1505105391,True,7,0,0.612298488616943359,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This is a breath of fresh air in the visual novel genre that is abit too saturated by anime offerings. Dont get me wrong plenty of good ones but few really rise to more then copy and pasted back grounds and  paper doll characters that all look mostly alike right down to poses.

This one does some different things. You dont really ever see your character. They mix it up with narration, dialogue and reading bits yourself. As well as a few fun little cut scenes that all add to the atmosphere imo.

Some of the backgrounds and sound effects are so enjoyable Ive been on more then one occassion happy to leave the game on one while doing other things just to enjoy the art and soothing sounds.

I really cant see any cons unless you just dont like classic turn of the century writing in general or spy plots where the main character isnt some super unbeatable spy type.

The story is set in 1914, at England, at the eve of WW1 where the main protagonist, Richard Hannay, has gotten himself involved in a plot to start a war between Germany and Russia.
The story itself very intriguing and the artwork is beautiful...but this game is a missed opportunity.
The game could be more: it could use more animation, free movement to explore the different locations, read more interesting texts from the era, interact with items that where unique to the time and get more info about them (interesting trivia, who invented them and what were they commonly used for).
The game lacks player interaction with the world and what it is in the end is just a regular book with pretty pictures that could have been on a PDF file.
I get it that they wanted to tell just the story but you could also add some more freedom to the player, more interactivity with the world like another game called The Last Express did.

Its hard to review a novell without spoilers, but lets see what i can tell about it:
Our hero is framed for a murder so he need escape and solve the case to prove his innocence. The story involve murder, drama, treachery! All these mixed with suitable music, realistic sound effects, decent voice acting and nice artwork.

W grze tej nie znajdziemy interfejsu znanego z typowych przygodówek Sierry czy Lucasarts, nie ma łamigłówek, przy rozwiązywaniu których można poczuć frustrację lub satysfakcję - po prostu kilkając (czy też kręcąc myszką) przechodzimy przez kolejne rozdziały tej ""książki"". Historia w niej przedstawiona jest ciekawa, choć z racji ograniczeń gry - pewnie dość okrojona względem oryginału. Mimo to chce się wiedzieć jak się dalej potoczą losy bohatera i z czym przyjdzie mu się mierzyć.
Technicznie gra jest wykonana z dużą starannością, lokacje cieszą oko, są zgrabnie wykonane, zwłaszcza kwestie mówione są dobrze dopracowane. Na plus można tu wymienić to, iż w grze mamy okazję posłuchać kilku różnych akcentów i dialektów angielskiego.

Czy gra jest warta polecenia? Według mnie raczej tak, aczkolwiek trzeba mieć na uwadze fakt, iż nie będziemy chcieli pewnie do niej wracać po raz drugi. I jeśli ją kupować to raczej po obniżonej cenie.

PLUSY:
+ ciekawa fabuła, skłania do poznania książkowego oryginału

I did not feel a sense of thrill or immersion in the story. 
I did not like the time or location setting, the only parts that were somewhat interesting to me was when they were talking about a war between themselves and Germany before it had happened and if it was possible. 
The story just felt so dry and the whole middle of the game was just him running through the country side and going from house to house, all the interactions seemed copy pasted and the bad guys had UAV or something because they always seemed to know where you were which makes no sense because you need 3 kills to get UAV unless you run hardline and even then we were only shown 1 kill so I don't get it. 

The visual novel itself felt so inconsistent. 
Switching between audio voice overs and text you have to click through to progress.
No video, only image switching. 
Random parts which allow you to search through things for no point other than lore maybe? Like newspapers.
Pointless mini games for opening doors and windows and doing some tasks by drawing lines on the screen.

The only con I can think of is the fact that the in-game achievements aren't appearing on Steam even after completing a playthrough. It's rather frustrating, but otherwise there really isn't anything unfavorable about The 39 Steps.  Like any great novel that's worth re-reading, The 39 Steps is an interactive novel worth replaying.

I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys more fun, interesting ways of reading. (And, if anyone's looking for the most story-faithful adaptation of Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps, my friend, this is the game for you.  You will not regret playing it.)

This is what ""The 39 Steps"" feels like - the so-called ""digital adaptation"" of a Scottish novel by the same name. 

The ""game"" shows us texts telling us the story of Richard Hannay. One picture follows another one; when watching these we hear the corresponding sound effects: horse carriages moving in front of Richard's house or the sound of a stream just under the bridge where he's having a conversation with a stranger. This is an interesting genre - I do not know what to make of it but 39 Steps was a good example to give it a try for the first time.

The plot revolves around an expatriate who returns to London and meets a strange fellow who starts babbling about a plan to assassinate the prime minister of Greece. Apparently, getting rid of this person can result in such a chaos that may bring World War I forward (historically, we are just before when the actual war broke out, in the spring of 1914). Richard takes in Scudder who is later found dead in his room. This comes as a surprise as Scudder explained it to Richard in detail how he actually arranged his death a while ago so that nobody would come looking for him (since he already knew too much of this plan to create anarchy).

So, Richard is on the run and while doing so he meets quite some people and uses a couple of aliases in order to hide. As mentioned, you essentially read texts to follow his story - these do not appear all at once but as you move your mouse clockwise you receive your next batch of sentences on the screen. As you complete certain sections (the game calls these events) you earn achievements; this is an easy way to get 100% since you just need to complete the game. 

Occasionally, Richard finds himself in a room that he can investigate. This simply means that some objects are highlighted and once clicking on them the corresponding (explanatory) text appears. Diamond symbols in the lower-right or -left corner of the screen indicate how many items we can find and interact with. I do not know if they are a must for the achievement but since you rarely get more than 3 or 4 it is really easy to find everything.

If I remember correctly there are 19 chapters altogether and bookmarking any section within a chapter is possible so that you can pick up right where you left it off. There's some great voice acting done here and also I liked the accompanying music. The story was also interesting - mainly because I was eager to find out what exactly the 39 steps meant. 

Like I said this is an interesting genre to pick - some might say it's best to just pick up a book and read it. Since I like the concept and the execution (casual gameplay and simplistic, but great looking menus and beautiful artwork) I give this one a thumbs-up. Unfortunately, upon checking if there were more from this developer I did not find any but this novel was already released 4 years ago.",1492532630,1492532793,True,22,0,0.724964380264282227,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Сюжет мне так же не близок по душе, и все события происходят в 1914 году и нашему персонажу приходится скрываться от ложного обвинения в убийстве, об этом подробнее немного позже.

Читать нам придётся много, полностью на английском языке, попутно просматривая типо красивейшие арты событий, и слушать ну очень качественное звуковое сопровождение, голосов, и фоновых звуков, как например поезда, щебет птиц, реки, голосов на заднем плане и всех всех всех остальных событий, которые были ранее описаны в основной книге Джона Бакена “39 ступеней”.
Так же, нам будут более подробно описывать каждые события, и давать информацию о разных местах, событиях и например о том как выглядели жандармы того времени.

Если не знать на четвёрку,ну или хотя бы на троечку Английский язык, то мы с трудом сможем разобрать по сюжету все основные заметки и догадки о том, как наш главный герой, разгадает замысел подставы, и то кто именно его решил убрать, и в каких целях. И это повлияет частично на мою отрицательную оценку о игре.

Основная часть сюжета расскажет нам весьма доступно и понятно, основную суть и роль главного персонажа и его новых знакомств. Если же совсем будет не понятно, то в руководствах возможно найти Краткое содержание истории.

В игре достойные АРТы, и не менее достойное звуковое сопровождение, но в целом получился своего рода типа фильма состоящего из картинок, где нам рассказчики озвучивают аудиокнигу.
Сказать честно, игру можно было бы разбавить элементами поиска предметов, и хотя бы вставками три в ряд, хотя сама книга о серьёзном, и вряд ли бы это было бы уместно!

Вот почему мне трудно её рекомендовать для большего количества игроков, предпочитающих тока русский язык.

И так, кратко о сюжете, и основная причина Отрицательного мнения:

Ознакомившись ближе, нам повествуют о событиях проходящих до первой мировой войны, кратко говорящих о Европе, народе и о разных событиях разных людей.
Но самым основным остаётся наш Главный Ричард Ханней, который проживал в Лондоне, пока не пришёл неожиданный гость в его дом, и рассказавшем о страшных событиях, а именно об убийстве и предположении того, кто мог это сделать.
И вот в один из моментов, вернувшись домой наш герой видит, что его гость убит с торчащим ножом в сердце. Все подозрения лягут на Ричарда Ханней, и тому приходится бежать через всю центральную Европу в Шотландию. Из всех подсказок об убийстве ему остаётся лишь неизвестная книга с записями, лежавшая в коридоре.  Из неё мы узнаем о Чёрном камне и других членах банды, а остаётся пока лишь бежать.

Вот тут то, как мне показалось, всё самое интересное и закончилось,
путешествия не впечатлили, а второстепенные персонажи, были на столько второстепенными, что не успев с ними познакомится как читателю, приходилось привыкать к новым второстепенным персонажам. И каждому доводилось рассказывать свою трогательную историю о предательстве,обмане, алчности и в конце концов подставе с убийством!

И так до самого почти конца книги, пока мы не встречаем самого лидера Чёрного камня.

Чем всё закончится, и кто подставил нашего героя, и как раскроют преступление, узнавайте сами,
В целом мне было бы приятно играть, если бы это была истории более подобающего для меня писателя,
а не детективное приключение о бегущем через Европу герое. А моё не богатое знание английского, не позволило в полной мере насладиться историей.


В общем, если вы не фанат английского языка, детективный историях с убийствами, и просто не фанат игр без гемплея, то обходите стороной!

Verdikt: Určite si pamätáte hru Dear Esther. Ok, označenie hra je asi prisilné, ale to isté platí o The 39 Steps. Skôr než hru ju možno označiť za interaktívnu knihu. Kto čakal akciu, ten bude sklamaný. Naozaj sa jedná skôr o knihu s krásnym dizajnom, artworkami a dobovými fotografiami. Tematicky je prispôsobená aj audio stránka hry. Dobová hudba a audio efekty príjemne dotvárajú atmosféru jednotlivých častí príbehu. Naopak, čo už nebude pochuti väčšine hráčom, je doslova neinteraktivita danej hry. Až na pár pohybov v podstate len sledujete príbeh po dobu približne štyroch hodín. The 39 Steps si taktiež neužijete, ak nie ste dobrým angličtinárom. Áno, toto interaktívne dielo je určené veľmi špecifickému publiku, čiže jeho prípadnú kúpu, si poriadne premyslite.

This is quite unexpected. I didn't know anything about this game until not even halfway through. I thought the gameplay was boring and the interactions felt forced and plain. That was until I realized it was actually just a digital adaptation of a famous novel [b](shame on me)[/b].

Gameplay was just about clicking your way through like any other single-route visual novel. The text transitiions was pretty delightful and varied. There was also some [i] quick time events[/i]-like moments, only without time limit (maybe for the sake of variation).

Soundtracks were pretty satisfying, at times enhancing the atmosphere especially the thrill of the last chapter. Still can't get the main OST out of my head though :p

Arts were very pleasant, if not beautiful. What was exceptional was the maker's attention to details. When you inspect a newspaper's page for just one or two canon article, you can see that every single obligatory article stands on its own context. [strike]If only I had time to read them all.[/strike]

All in all, it was a quite an amazing ride. Not an expert myself, but I'll say it was a well made literature digital adoption.

The voice acting, as I've mentioned, is very well done. The scenes also change often, and, each new scene offers more beautiful art to look at. It was overall an extremely satisfying experience.

Un thriller dallo svolgimento molto interessante, accompagnato da un design grafico particolare per un punta e clicca e una colonna sonora davvero azzeccata ed immersiva. 
Il gioco si porta a termine nel giro di poche ore però rappresenta un'adeguata pausa da titoli più frenetici ed impegnativi.

It's a ""digital adaptation"" of Buchan's espionage story [i] The 39 Steps, [/i] and it's about as well-made as a visual novel can get. The voice acting is superb (performed by a real theater company, I believe), the gorgeous hand-drawn artwork really makes you feel like you're in pre-WWI Britain, and the overall interface is sleek without betraying the lovingly-rendered throwback aesthetic.

Unfortunately, the story itself is the main thing holding me back from giving this a more enthusiastic thumbs-up. It's essentially an innocent-man-on-the-run thriller, and the middle 3/5ths or so of the game basically have the main character escaping one sticky situation after another, with little in the way of actual plot or character development taking place. Because this is a straightforward novel with no player choice involved, this middle section really dragged for me as chapter after chapter of near-misses began to give me deja vu. The story picks up some momentum towards the end as the main plot finally begins to unfold (there's a global conpsiracy involved, which is always fun), but don't expect much in the way of action or suspense; the climax felt appropriately genteel for this most old-timey of British thrillers. (The original novel was written in 1915, so what do you expect).

With those caveats, I do recommend this game to visual novel fans, both for its production value and because the story does ultimately maintain some interest even during its repetitive middle chapters. 

[i] P.S.: [/i] This was the first project of a development team called The Story Mechanics, and it looks like their intention was to produce ""digital adaptations"" (their term) of various literary works, beginning with this one. I went looking for them online and was sorry to see that they appear to be defunct, which is really a shame given the amount of skill and obvious enthusiasm they brought into making this game. Hopefully they'll return in another form?

[i] P.P.S.: [/i] I've never actually read the novel this is based on, but I have seen the Alfred Hitchcock movie version, which is fantastic and you should definitely watch it regardless of whether you get this game.

Essendo su Steam ci si aspetta un videogioco.

Mi ha un poco riportato indietro nel tempo. Io reputo questo tipo di prodotti interessanti perché sostengono la lettura, gli danno una dimensione in piu senza perdere il gusto del leggere. Con illustrazioni su molti livelli di buona fattura e un soun design incredibilmente di qualità, questa storia si porta via in non tantissimo tempo. Per i non abituati alla lettura in inglese ci saranno dei passaggi, soprattutto quelli in dialetto scozzese, veramente ostici e in generale non è per l'inglese scolastico. Sarebbe meraviglioso che venisse tradotto in Italiano compresi i pochissimi doppiaggi. Sarebbe ancora più bello che in Italia, editori e realtà multimediali si unissero per trasposizioni digitali di questo tipo dei romanzi moderni. Secondo me sarebbe di incentivo alla lettura e all'approccio delle buone storie dato che oggi si legge veramente poco.

The story itself is really nice, but it's not presented in a way that it's easy to digest.

39 Steps is one of the worst good-games I played. The story is great, but because how the story, the era, the book is, the story is not the most pleasant to be experienced as a game. The story rather features classes, than real personalities, and focuses on the present - not even a hint what will happen, barely any reflection to the past than remembering the chasers makes the game enjoyable only if you're actively progressing in it - either the story lost parts when it got implemented as a game, or it's not exactly a type of story that works greatly as a game.
The language is a potential problem for a lot of non-native English speakers: the game features a really heavy load of English expressions, as the book of origin is from 1915, featuring well... a lot of fancy-talk between gentlemen and quite some part with really, really strong scottish accent. If anyone has trouble understanding a today's series without subtitles, I'm almost sure that they'll have problem with understanding this game.
The story of the game is interesting, the controls are easy (Click to progress, and mouse-gestures in some scenes) and the voice acting is phenomenal - but with all of this,  I think the story's pacing is off, the text can't really be urged to progress, and it's just slow. There is 19 chapters, and each chapter's title is on screen for 5+ seconds, then the location and date is on screen for 15+ seconds. The game has a lot of audio cues about what's currently happening - sounds of the city, a mass of people, car being cranked up and such, all with outstanding quality, but the majority of the game has no notable background music, or not at all. This turns the game somewhat tedious, as the story is action and progress-oriented. Just as a comparison: a good visual novel has good characters, interaction between them, and an interaction with the setting. In this story the protagonist is fleeing, and he's just states what's happening, whom he is meeting instead of reflecting to them. This is a storytelling VN-like story that focuses of what's happening currently and there are barely any reoccuring characters, and most of them have only a role, a rank, a class instead of a personality.  So in short: there is something happening, but there's barely anything to think about in the game, BUT the thing that's happening. And for me, this is the reason the game took me 3 + 11 hours to finish, while it's around 4h long. It's a really interesting piece, but the presentation's way and VN interpretation makes the game harder to be enjoyed, than the book would be.",1478168799,1478168799,True,14,0,0.662061154842376709,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Miután elolvastam magát a könyvet s megnéztem a filmadaptációt, bizakodással és izgalommal megtelve nyomtam rá a ""Letöltés"" gombra, és szerencsére azt kaptam, amit vártam. A játék már az első tíz percben lenyűgözött, teljesen átéreztem a könyv hangulatát (Thirty Nine Steps -  John Buchan tollából), a zenéi is valami zseniálisra sikeredtek, a szinkronról nem is beszélve. Egyszerűen nem tudtam letenni a játékot, első nekifutásra végig futottam rajta. Olvastatta magát, és a kevés mini-game gondoskodott arról, hogy aprócska izgalmakat vigyen a Visual Novel műfajba. Az irányítás először idegesített, aztán rájöttem, hogy a jobbra-balra nyilakkal is lehet navigálni, így már tökéletes volt a ""moziélmény"".  A The 39 Steps kötelező játék a krimi és a kémfilm műfaj kedvelőinek, és azoknak is, akik előszeretettel olvasnak intrikákról, mozgalmakról, történelemről. Nem győzöm hangsúlyozni, hogy valami elképesztően gyönyörűre sikeredett a játék. (Képek itt: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DB5/screenshots/?appid=234940] KATTINTS IDE[/url]). Percekig képes voltam bámulni egy-egy tájképet, ilyen, vagy ehhez hasonló részletességet várnék el minden műfajban alkotótól. Na de vissza a Miatyánkhoz, mint azt minden adaptációnál megszokhattuk, itt is vannak eltérések a két mű között, így ez sem kivétel. Aki nem ismeri a történetet, annak nem zavaró, engem viszont kicsit idegsetített, de messze nem annyira, hogy abbahagyjam.  
Megjegyzés margóra: A játék angol, így aki nem beszéli a nyelvet, annak problémái lehetnek a megértésével, ők az egyetlenek akiknek nem ajánlom.

[b] Pro:[/b]
- Gyönyörű, meseszép, elképesztő... nem találok rá megfelelő szavakat.
- A hangok valami fenomenálisak.
- Olvastatja magát.
- Könnyű teljesítmények (Csak végig kell játszanod hozzájuk a játékot, de a stáblistát várd meg!)
- Szinkronok. (Misztikusak, rejtélyesek, és ez teszi őket tökéletessé).
- Száz százalékos hangulatbomba, a rabjává tesz.

[b]Kontra:[/b]
- Az újrajátszása kétes, a könyv és a film sokkal jobbra sikeredett.
- Eltérések a könyvtől, filmtől.

- I liked how the chapters were broken up so I could play through the game at my own pace

- What was the deal with drawing the arrow shapes? I didn't understand the purpose of those parts.

Messze nem gondoltam volna hogy ennyire magába fog húzni a sztori. Főleg hogy volt egy pont ami után egy ideig nem is nagyon akartam hozzá nyúlni. Na de milyen műfajba is sorolható ez a ""játék"" ? 

Egy vizuális novellával van dolgunk a The 39 Steps képében, így nem kifejezetten nevezhetjük játéknak a szó szoros értelemben. Viszont ennek ellenére érdemes rászánni az időt. Egyrészt a képi világa valami elképesztő, kicsit festményszerűen vannak a terek-helyszínek ábrázolva, ami elégé stílusosra sikeredett. Magukat a szereplőket nem látjuk sosem, csak szellemképeket ami elsőre egy kicsit furcsa megoldás, ennek ellenére abszolút ötletes. Hiszen megadja azt a szabadságot amit egy könyv is ad, hogy nekünk kell elképzelnünk a karaktereket a leírtak alapján. Amit nagyon kihegyeztek még az a hangok voltak. A hangeffekteket valami eszméletlen jóra sikerült megcsinálni, sokkal jobban a helyzetbe tudjuk magunkat élni. Plusz a voic acting is igazán jóra sikeredett.

A történet alapjában egy men-on-the-run thriller (""menekülő ember""), ami szinte majdnem az első pillanattól kezdve pörög, folyamatosan az utolsó percig. Egyedül egy rész van benne ahol kicsit lelaposodik a dolog, de ha azon túl lendül az ember akkor utána ismét folytatodik a pörgössége a történetnek. Spoilerezni nem fogom a történetet, maradjunk annyiba hogy köze van az I. VH-hoz. Plusz mivel ez egy könyv adaptációja, így ne várjátok azt hogy a sztorit befolyásolni lehet, mert nem. 

A játékmenet kimerül annyiban hogy olvasunk, kattintunk a bizonyos tárgyakra, szövegekre. (Pro tipp: Az egérrel való lapozás helyett használjátok a nyíl bill-eket, könnyebb). Néha egyszerűbb motivumokat kell az egérrel rajzolnunk (nyílak), de ennyiben kimerül az interaktívitás.

Egyedül a karakter visszaemlékezések megvalósitása nem tetszett. Itt ilyen kisebb rajzos ""filmeket"" láthatunk, amik szerintem nem nagyon passzoltak bele ebbe az egészbe, kilógnak teljesen belőle. Ha csak simán szöveggel elmesélték volna a szereplők jobbak lettek volna mint így. Az újságokért meg plusz pont, mert nem csak a számunkra fontos szöveget tudjuk elolvasni, hanem akár az egész oldalt is.

Bonuszként vannak achievementek, amikért csak végig kell játszani a játékot. Illetve kapunk kártáykat is.

Vizuális novellák között szerintem az egyik legjobb, az ára viszont megegyezik egy könyv árával, így érdemes megfontolni hogy megér-e egy 5 órás történet ennyit nektek. Fele ennyiért abszolút must buy lehet, bár aki kedveli az ilyen jellegű műveket annak megérheti a teljes árat is. Az árazás és videós részlet miatt nem tudok 10/10-et személy szerint adni rá.

That being said - it's not ""bad"" by any means. For what it is, it's incredibly well done, and a means in which I would love to continue consume various forms of classical fiction.

Based on the original espionage thriller ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan, you can definitely see where modern day spy stories came from - predating popular fictional characters like James Bond by at least 30 years. This story takes place on the verge of WWI and introduces a character named Richard Hanny, a man on the run after a young American spy divulges sensitive information to him. The game is presented mostly in beautifully painted backdrops, fuzzy silhouettes and the occasional shadow puppet show (of which are quite entertaining). These backgrounds take you from inner-city London, to the moors of Scotland and back again. There isn't much gameplay to be had (to my slight disappointment), but what is present is likened to that of a game like ""TRAUMA"" - drawing shapes and clicking on things to carry through the cutscene-like chapters.

Simply put - the game is awesome for what it is - but it really needs a bit more interactivity. There is one part that involves the character decoding a notebook. I got really excited, thinking that I'd at least have a mini-game or a puzzle to figure out the code, but alas - the game just carries on like the book. They allow you to zoom in and out on objects you see in the environments - here I am, thinking that I'll have to do some Sherlock Holmes work and pick out clues from the zoomed-in objects, but alas - there isn't much to discover but a few timeline-appropriate advertisements and newspaper articles.

I would love to digest all sorts of fiction this way. From Sherlock Holmes to H.P. Lovecraft to Franz Kafka - I would love to have this sort of artwork and voice acting and sound effects, mood, pacing, attention to detail, and the ease of taking it in via separate chapters (just incase I need to leave and come back to it) - albeit, more interactivity would be preferred",1475237110,1475237110,True,2,0,0.496908277273178101,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I love reading, I love reading physical books. The 39 Steps is a book, and it's one of my favourites... so there

The 39 Steps is a digital adaption (visual novel) of John Buchan's classic of the same name. Developed by The Story Mechanics and published by KISS Ltd. This game has gotten a lot of mixed reception with gamers, however the game has gained critical acclaim with reviewers and critics across the board and I can understand both sides of the picture

The 39 Steps is a very faithful adaption of the book, you experience the story through beautifully designed landscapes and good voice acting with very little interaction

It can get boring and yes the length of the game is extremely short (I finished it in over three to four hours and in one whole sitting) and the asking price is a bit too steep, however, The 39 Steps' story, although not originally written by the developers, and visual recreation of the novel are nailed perfectly in the game

I can understand the mixed responses from gamers about The 39 Steps and I can also understand why critics and reviewers gave this game a near perfect score and to me personally I really enjoyed playing through The 39 Steps. Yes, I have read the novel before and yes it is one of my favourite books but that does not effect the way I play the game. True, the length of the game is ridiculously short and you hardly do anything just listen to a story, however, John Duchan's novel is so well written that I just wanted to continue playing it to the end

The 39 Steps will and has mixed reception but if you are reading this review, then you are dying to know my recommendation. The 39 Steps is a game everyone should try and play and finish in one whole sitting even if you don't like reading books (which you should!) and would like another way of seeing this interesting story, then the game is the other option, however, for the retail price it is offering, I would not recommend it at its full price and rather wait for a price drop or a sale

The 39 Steps is not the game for everyone, but a majority of gamers should at least give it a try and see John Bucahn's vision come to life

I cannot wait to see what other digital adaptations The Story Mechanics have in store!

The 39 Steps - не просто игра, это книга. В основу игры заложен роман ""39 ступеней"" Джона Бакена. На этом уже можно отсеять добрую часть геймеров. Не любите читать диалоги (а игра состоит только из них) - брать игру не стоит. Ну и об игре:

[h1]Геймплей:[/h1]
Как я уже сказал, игра состоит из диалогов, и некоторых действий (к примеру, нужно повернуть ручку двери и войти, для этого рисуем полукруг и вертикальную линию). Диалоги можно пропускать.

[h1]Музыка:[/h1]
Музыка ""The 39 Steps"" передает всю атмосферу того времени. Музыка, звуки, диалоги - всё на уровне.

[h1]Графика:[/h1]
Великолепно! От некоторых пейзажей просто дух захватывало. Поля, поезда, горы, огромные замки - вы только взгляните на скриншоты. Да, сами персонажи здесь показаны словно тени, что добавляет игре атмосферности.

[h1]Обобщение и мелочи:[/h1]
1) Нет русского языка. Я бы не сказал, что в данной игре это минус, ведь слушая чистый английский, читая диалоги на английском, смотря на виды того времени, мы словно оказываемся там. Для погружения самое оно.
2) Достижения. Всего есть 19 глав, 19 достижений + одно за полностью просмотренные субтитры.
3) Коллекционные карточки.
4) Сюжет. Я не стал описывать сюжет выше, ведь это значит, пришлось бы просто проспойлерить всю игру. Того, что игра сделана по роману вполне достаточно.
5) Низкая цена в 29 рублей по скидке.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Игра на любителя, и если вы такой любитель, то игра вам понравится. Сборщикам достижений игру тоже стоит приобрести. Остальным - по желанию. Лично у меня от игры остались только хорошие впечатления. Рекомендую!

Der Roman war auch Inspirationsquelle für Alfred Hitchcocks (sorry Steam Textfilter, er heißt nunmal so^^) gleichnamiger Verfilmung, die allerdings recht frei mit dem Stoff arbeitete. Dieses Spiel folgt dem Roman, nicht dem Film.

Wir sind Richard Hannay, ein Ingenieur, der lange in Afrika lebte und sich nun in London langweilt. Eines Tages, wir schreiben das Jahr 1914, werden wir von unserem Nachbarn in eine unglaubliche Geschichte eingeweiht. Eine Geschichte voll Verschwörung, Agenten, Geheimdiensten, Attentaten Politik und Morden. Eine Geschichte, die möglicherweise in einen großen Krieg münden wird, einen Krieg, in den wohl zum ersten Mal die ganze Welt involviert sein wird...

Der Roman ist hochspannend und reflektiert intelligent und unterhaltsam den Weg zum ersten Weltkrieg als Räuberpistole und gehört damit unbestreitbar zu den großen Werken des letzten Jahrhunderts.

Die vielen Negativbewertungen scheinen daher zu rühren, daß manche etwas anderes erwartet haben. ""39 Steps"" ist kein Adventure, auch kein Game, es ist die Visualisierung eines Romans auf dem Medium Computer und als solches sollte man es auch bewerten.

Und als Buchumsetzung ist es herausragend. Intelligent, stilsicher und erwachsen. Das Artwork ist qualitativ hochwertig, die Grafiken liebevoll und gekonnt, das historische Setting realistisch und überzeugend umgesetzt.

Aber was macht man jetzt eigentlich. Nicht viel, meist klickt man nur weiter oder schaut sich Briefe oder Zeitungsausschnitte an. Unspannend? Gameplaytechnisch sicher. Aber die Zeitungen sind realitätsnah und auf einer Zeitungsseite kann man auch andere Artikel als den relevanten lesen oder die Werbeanzeige für die neueste Hutmode betrachten. Die Story hält dabei alles zusammen, treibt vorwärts und nimmt einen mit. Erinnerungen werden durch grandiose, liebevoll kunstvolle Scherenschnitte erzählt. Und noch ein Kniff: die Protagonisten sind auf den Screens nur als Geistschatten sichtbar, bleiben schemenhaft und können somit, wie im Buch, vom Rezipienten mit seiner Vorstellung gefüllt werden.

Besonders zu erwähnen: die Akustik. Teile der Texte sind (englisch, teils auch mit stark schottischem Akzent) vertont, mit richtig guten und professionellen Sprechern. Dazu sind Sounds hochatmosphärisch und tragen wesentlich zur Immersion bei. Das Akustische des Spiels könnte leicht auch als eigenständiges, qualitativ hochwertiges Hörspiel durchgehen.

Die Macher von ""39 Steps"" sind nicht nur kunstvolle Könner, sondern man hat den Eindruck, daß sie stets genau wußten was sie tun, stilistische Entscheidungen weise hinterfragten und durchdachten. 

Nur Lob? Nein. Denn im der Mechanik haben sie zuwenig an den Benutzer gedacht. Oft dauert es ermüdend lange bis Screens abblenden oder aufblenden, das Erzähltempo ist provozierend langsam und die Bedienung per Maus ist gern mal hakelig.

Dennoch: die vier bis fünf Stunden Lese- und Erlebniszeit sind fesselnd und bleiben einem im Gedächtnis.

I would not recommend to buy this ""game"".

So it would be way more enjoyable to do nothing at all then all of a sudden have to click again or move your mouse in a specific way to progress.


The game itself is done quite good, has a good atmosphere with the artwork, voice acting and music, but thats not enough to make me recommend it.

Not really a game but rather a ""digital adaptation"" (as the developers put it) of a novel. It's narrated by the protagonist, whose shoes you step into when you play. There are no choices to be made; only simple mouse gestures (e.g. clockwise movement to unlock doors, left-right movement to run, etc) which are non-time sensitive, and some clicking on objects in certain scenes to examine them more closely. The story is split into numerous chapters, and you progress linearly through them. Any completed chapter may be replayed at any point of time.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Intriguing story about a man involved in a WWI conspiracy
- Gorgeous artwork:

- Highly immersive (mainly due to the beautiful art & excellent audio)
- Convincingly voiced
- Nicely presented
- Historical setting is effectively conveyed
- Good mix of various media (text, voice, illustration, photos)
- The story takes you through a variety of different landscapes, from urban to rural to coastal

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Clicking to backtrack text requires an anti-clockwise mouse rotation. Why not just right-click or some simpler action, ffs?
- Cannot fast-forward voiced parts, therefore painfully slow at points
- Game intro very tedious to sit through (please, let's just [i]start[/i] already, ok?)
- Language subpar on occasion (e.g. bad spelling, grammar, etc)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
A pretty good VN to accompany a meal or snack, since you don't have to do much except sit back, relax, and click to progress through the story. The mouse gestures and game system take a while at first to settle into, but once you know what's expected of you, getting through the game is a fairly smooth and fuss-free process. The sound and music are immaculate. A large part of the story takes place in - and therefore features - the Scottish countryside and its folk. If this is something you enjoy or would like to experience, then I highly recommend this title.

First, for me its not a game. Its a graphic novel. To put it into the Point & Click genre is way generous cause, you dont have to think, you dont have to combine things you dont have to do anything just click the glowing 3-5 Objects on screen and read a short info or start a monologue. Thats it.
Its not interactive, you are just an observer and its like youre pressing play and pause on a remote to watch the next scene of a movie.

Dont be mistaken, I liked the voice acting, music, the sound effects are lovely, the art, which mostly contains of stills, which are zoomed in or out and the story is nice. Some parts are really good and leave you with a bit of tension. 

I would not recommend it for the high price of 10bucks on 90% discount sure even if it was a lot of work but you can get browser games for free that are better than this. For what it is, some kind of walking simulator without walking, the price doesnt fit. 

If you enjoy graphic novels without choices and without much effort and just want to witness a story cause you dont want to pick up a good old book, go for it, you still have to read a bit tho.

Saddly, cause its a finished story, it has absolutely no replay value, play it, enjoy it, get achievements, uninstall, done.

Visual/interactive novels are usually shovelware (if the writing in these was any good, they'd be published in print), but the 39 Steps isn't quite one of those, it seems to be unsure of what it wants to be.   As a result, the gameplay, such as it is, is a confused muddle, distracting you from advancing the story, which is the primary focus of this game. 

The graphics are quite good, a lot of attention has been put into the imagery which complements the story well.  Thematically it's excellent.  Unfortunately that's all there is to it.

Gameplay is a real let down - of course in a visual novel, the objective is to move from one ""page"" to the next but they picked a really convoluted and confusing set of interfaces for this which serve to distract rather than enhance or engage the ""player"".   In some stages you have to swirl the mouse around hopefully, in others you have to point and click, in others you're making bizarre silly mouse gestures.   That really doesn't fit with the visual novel theme. 

Technical - no graphics scaling, you're stuck with the resolution they give you, and you have mouse cursor windowing control problems which doesn't help considering the gameplay is mouse driven - and they  hide the pointer deliberately so you can't be sure if you're advancing the game or if your mouse pointer has fallen off the edge of the poorly scaled game fullscreen window.

A dry story and a distracting and annoying control scheme makes this game too hard to recommend for gamers or visual novel fans.",1468841473,1612783840,False,0,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So if you don't want read on I will say this here is a 7.5 out of 10 for me only being knocked down points for some things that would not bother others.  Also this to me is an audio/visual pc book experience.  It is clearly not a game. Still a really worthwhile product and it has me hoping for more things like this in the future.

I have always said no to audio books but this here is what I will say yes to.  I am totally caught up in the story and having imagery plus audio and information on the characters to refer back to as you play is just thrilling especially if you have a poor memory like I do.  I also like the artwork thus far.  Simple but perfectly fitting this.  As for the opening door mechanic where we use the mouse to do different actions I think something different would be better but it isn't taking away from the fun I am having.  Also in going through this story on Steam/pc unlike with an audio book or regular book you get achievements which are a nice little touch and looking back at them will also help remind you of what you did or are doing.  Anyway for some reason tonight I decided to start from the top of my gaming library and when I saw what this was going to be early on I thought I would quit but no it is 3:35 am and I am going to continue on.  This so far has been like a good book which is very hard to put down.  So far through almost an hour of this I recommend it to others.  As for what to pay for it well if you think the game will make you happy then it is worth buying at whatever you think a reasonable price is.  Now back to the story for me. : )  

Update #1: In my second session playing this game I found a few things odd that need fixing and that is some lines of audio are repeated twice when they are not supposed to be.  It took away from the experience I was having as it had been perfect up to that point.  Also when the one chap, Marmaduke Jopely. had his car stolen and is let go he says, ""I'll get you!""  It didn't seem to fit how he would act.  It just seemed out of place. Also not sure if this was in the second session I played or not but there was a part where the audio didn't match what was said in text.  Continuity is important and this is something that can easily be fixed.  Hopefully the developer will take a look at this.  Now on a plus I have to say in regards to the menu music I like it.  Also in regards to other audio the sound effects in the game are very good too.  I am referring to the rain falling, the sound of feet scampering, etc.  You don't get this in a regular book or audio book.  Again I really like this story telling format.

Update #2: Well I have completed the game and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I liked one part of the ending where the main character, Richard Hannay, whom I played said he was joining the war but he felt he had already contributed the most he could to anything related to it. I chuckled at what he was saying because part of me initially thought he was probably right but then again with his new ranking giving him more influence and if it and the thing he did with it helped win the war in any way well that might top what he previously did as he did not stop the Germans from assassinating the target they set out to get. Also in regards to the ending the music well it just seemed out of place so I got to knock this down a notch for that.  Finally instead of talking about a next story and thanking us for playing the game it should have ended differently.  I like how you rolled the credits and then saved that last speech for the end but then to put up what you did after it just seemed wrong and cheesy.

The 39 Steps is a ""Digital Adaptation"" of the classic early 20th Century spy novel of the same name, by John Buchan.

The game closely resembles a visual novel in form, although rather than offering dialog choices or decision trees often seen in visual novels, the 39 Steps instead offers a number of different methods of interaction and multimedia presentation of the different scenes.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics in the game are quite beautiful in places. In my opinion they get better in the second half of the game, with outstanding painted landscapes mixed artfully with what look like computer drawn sections.

The game makes clever use of different visual effects throughout, with moving backgrounds, animated portions, photographs, short videos, and textual effects. The graphical presentation is excellent.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The characters in the story are all fully voiced with convincing English and Scottish accents (unsurprisingly, given where the game was made). I'm not an expert on the period so I don't know if they're historically accurate, but they are definitely professionally done.

The game features occasional sound effects to emphasise actions and events in the story to good effect. Music, too, is atmospheric and suits the storyline well; the music in the closing credits deserves a special mention, reminding me of ""The Dead Eyes Opened"" by The Severed Heads. It's very cool, indeed.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game plays similar to a visual novel, but with much more variation in presentation. Unlike most visual novels, however, there are no real choices for the player to make. It is possible to skip some of the text and investigation sections, but I don't know why anyone would want to do that.

Interaction with the game is also different from any other visual novel that I've played, with different sections requiring mouse rotations, clicks, and gestures. It felt a bit weird at the beginning, but I became used to it quickly and it worked well enough.

Not having read the original novel I don't know how closely the in-game text matches it, but the story kept my interest throughout. I wouldn't play through it again, although that's more a consequence of the type of game, rather than the specific content. I did notice a very small number of grammatical errors; I'm not sure if these are present in the original novel text.

The 39 Steps is not so much a game, as such, but rather a multimedia interactive experience -- a digital adaptation, as the developers claim.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]

Pros:
+ An interesting story presented in an original manner
+ Beautiful art
+ Atmospheric music, professional voice acting, and good sound effects
+ Clever use of visual effects to enhance interaction with the story
+ Steam achievements and trading cards

Cons:
- No replayability to speak of
- A very few grammatical errors
- Retail price seems a bit high

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
I'm very impressed with the 39 Steps and I'm glad that I took the time to play it all the way through. Given that it only took a little over four hours for me to complete it and I don't plan to replay it, at full price it doesn't pass my own personal value test, but it's often available at deep discount or in a bundle, and at only a few dollars at most, it's a real gem.

Edit after finishing the game:

This is a novel digitalized. It is very well digitalized, the art and illustrations are great, the voiceacting is very well done too. Sound effects and music are great too. 

What are the negatives then? Well the game is boring. There's just no point in making such a game out of a novel. The ""puzzles"" you have to solve are made of arrows you have to draw. You only click around a tiny bit, most often you just read and read. Parts of information about the environment, characters and the story. 

The game itself is.. pointless. It doesn't feel like a game, at times it feels even more tedious to go through than it would be to just read a thick book.

This is not normally my genre of game, but the plot sounded interesting so I thought I'd check it out. I later read the book and I have to say, this game is very true to the story, and it presents it in a fun and interesting way as point and click minigames.

As for the story itself, if you don't play this game, at least read the story (if you like books). The author did a very good job at putting together a captivating espionage thriller (not my normal book genre either) about a man that ends up on the run from some dangerous people because he helped a stranger.
The main character is very resourceful and has quite the interesting adventure being on the run, and is not too long into the story accused of murder and on the run from the police as well.

I wouldn't likely play this game again unless I wanted to recount that adventure, but I could also read the book if I wanted to do that.

I mean, I could see how it might be fun to play on a laptop during a long flight or something.  But honestly I played this game for 10 minutes and was so bored out of my mind I had to quit.

I'm not saying it can't be a good story, but for someone who likes to read (a fast reader at that) this is an incredibly slowly drawn out story with crappy navigational mechanics that involve swirling your mouse around clockwise and counterclockwise to either skip or go back a previous line in the dialog (of which there is no shortage). 

Also this game goes waaayyyy too far into detail with the setting and the background of the characters.  When a new character is brought in you literally have to hear their entire lifestory before continuing.  Personally I have no idea how the developers of the game were able to see development of this game through - and there were a lot of people in on this project something that is made abundantly clear in the title sequence.  

On a positive note, I really like the simplistic art style and theme.  It makes it stick out and deserves a good storyline. A+

To really quantify it, what really ruined this game for me was the unnecessary overabundance of character and setting detail and also how slow it plays.

My advice to the game devs?  Go write a book.  It'd be great :)

As a visual representation of a novel, it's sublime. As a ""visual novel"", it's subpar.

I've never read the novel nor seen the movie/stageplay/etc, but I now understand why this tale has been adapted in so many forms. Trapped in an intriguing espionage narrative, the protagonist must use his wits and fists to solve the mystery... and, more immediately, to survive. All the while you experience the dread of a man on the run, not knowing who to trust or where to turn. The ending is anticlimactic (though it may have been mind-blowing a century ago), but this story is focused on the journey and that it delivers well.

Of course, if you just wanted to hear a good yarn, then you could read the novel, so the developers accentuate the tale with gorgeous visuals and terrific voice acting. Nick Underwood (portraying protagonist Richard Hannay) is the standout, seamlessly moving from accent to accent as Hannay adopts disguises to flee from his pursuers. The lighting effects, the haunting score, the use of shadows all blend together to create a perfect atmosphere of tension.

Unfortunately, only the character dialogues are voiced, but the rest of the text regularly serves the mood, appearing quickly during sudden revelations or rotating slowly during moments of panic, for example. The developers did a wonderful job incorporating several forms of storytelling, including humorous silent film-esque animated segments to relate stories-within-the-story... which makes the gameplay missteps all the more frustrating.

As I said earlier, The 39 Steps greatly succeeds as a visual presentation of a novel, but spectacularly fails as a game. The worst part is that the developers were clearly trying to play up those aspects. There are quicktime-like events requiring you to move your mouse in certain directions, allowing the player to share in the experience of... washing up... opening a box... opening a door... but not during any of the action-driven sequences, missing a prime opportunity to enhance the immersion.

For every room with multiple hotspots, there are a dozen transition screens with only one button. It says ENTER or DOOR, but it might as well read ""click to continue"". Meanwhile, much of the side content is presented as white text on otherwise featureless black screens. Tie those details to objects or characters in the room and you have the framework of an adventure game. Instead, the ""player"" receives an unfiltered info dump, followed by the opportunity to click CLIMB (and only CLIMB) in order to progress the story. Obviously it's impossible for real choice to exist within a set story structure, but a little more of the illusion of choice would go a long way.

In the end, I recommend The 39 Steps for what it is - a visually and aurally pleasing piece of high drama - and warn you about what it's not - a game. That said, with only 5-6 hours of content and the ""replayability"" of a novel, the $15 price point does seem a bit high.",1465276242,1465276242,True,2,0,0.52392345666885376,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Визуально-интерактивная адаптация книги Джона Бакена - ""39 ступеней"".

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
¥ Красивые фоны.
¥ Полная озвучка диалогов (с субтитрами) на английском языке.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Минимальное задействование действий от игрока. В основном мы просто слушаем и читаем, редко отвлекаясь на кликанье мышью.
¥ Нет русского языка (без отличного знания английского в игре вообще нечего делать).

[h1]Достижения:[/h1]
Я полностью понимал, что не смогу проникнуться в сюжет и запускал и проходил игру исключительно для достижений. Достижения получить довольно просто главное не пропускать диалоги (Enter) и выполнять все интерактивные действия - мини игры со стрелками, все действия на поиск предметов (кубики в правом нижнем углу) и чтение всей информации (клика достаточно). Все, что пропускается левым кликом мыши смело можете пропускать. Если случайно не получили достижение за одну из глав, можно в любой момент вернутся через карту глав. Для получения секретного достижения - просто посмотрите титры до конца без пропусков.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Красивый визуальный ряд, приятная музыка. Молодцы ребята, что делают по своим популярным книгам такие игры... Наши бы начали лучше также делать, а не клепать чудо игры сделанные за вечер на коленке. Для русскоговорящих не знающих английского на должном уровне эта игра будет чужой... Оттого и палец вниз. Оценивать игру не имею права, я не смог проникнуться ей так как хотел автор... Но обещаю посмотреть фильм по книге.

Visual novels are usually not my cup of tea, so I might be biased here.

In any case, I don't find this one particularly good. Neither the story, nor the actions that have to be perfromed in order to progress with it.

Particularly, I don't get the concept where you have to make some specific mouse movement to open doors or perform any other trivial task. It seems as that was the only way the developers found to catch the ""player's"" attention. Completely unnecessary.

No need to fret however, since there is much to praise over its graphics, music and most importantly – plot that would hold you on suspense for its entire duration.

While I avoid spoiling the story for you, I can safely say The 39 Steps revolved around a conspiracy, set in a turbulent era just prior to World War One. As Richard Hannay, you’ll have to negotiate a passage through treacherous terrain, along with an equally treacherous world of espionage to uncover the truth. Since this was written by John Buchan and not some contemporary hack, I have yet to find someone who thought the plot was boring.

This adaptation however, held an odd twist, a bigger conspiracy hidden. I believe the developers had laden this game liberally with subliminal messages, telling me to eat and drink excessively at every given chance. I did not place this accusation lightly and I’ll list out my observations as evidence. Throughout the game’s duration, the protagonist would: -

Palate the many palettes of fine whiskey.
Cure a hangover with full English breakfast.
Discuss the merits of brandy while travelling light on train.
Savour fresh organic produce in an idyllic farm.
Sample various Scottish cuisines by a road side inn.
Show a fierce steak no quarters in a noble’s hunting lodge.
Devour a traditional sandwich upon the Scottish highlands.
Scoff down ginger biscuits under a star-lit sky.
Valiantly vanquish a pork pie while fooling the main villain.
Learn that muffins go well with marmalade.
Puff up to cloud nine over an assortment of cigars and pipes.
And that it is always a good sport to interrupt your enemy's dinner.

The pace of Richard Hannay was literally set by meals and the man will eat at every opportunity available. While the game can be strangely patriotic in British culture at times, I was taught first hand to never mess with a Scotsman on a full stomach. Seriously, playing this game made me hungry more than anything.

Jokes aside, I was very impressed by the level of art presented in each scene, of which all seemed to be drawn by hand and occasionally animated too. It was definitely a higher standard than what I was used to in other visual novels. Same goes for the music, which is just as suspenseful as the story itself, the two complimented each other very well.

If you are looking for a good distraction that will last around six hours, you should look at this underrated gem. As for me, I enjoyed every minute of it. I will recommend you to play this with a full stomach however, or you’ll end up depleting your stock of snacks as precariously as I did.",1463178584,1463178942,True,4,0,0.574457705020904541,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Basically, it walks you through a dramatization of John Buchan's book, ""The 39 Steps"".  As stated on the store page, this is a precursor of a great amount of more recent spy fiction, and I'd both read the book and seen a movie production (Hitchcock, as I recall) before buying this one.  This notwithstanding, I finished it because seeing how the developers fleshed it out was addictive in itself.  The game aspect (such as it is) comes from ensuring that you pick up  all the ""point and clicks"" -- although the disclaimer says correctly that it not point and click oriented.  A few comments more:  first, there is very little video per se, and the sequences, while well done, are flat and cartoonish.  Second, you will never see the characters except as semi-transparent, ""ghost"" images, and in well-done protraits that appear on a few screens.  Third, there are are a number of ""follow the pattern on the screen"" instances that on my system called for me to hold down the mouse button and crudely mimic the pattern, which really add nothing to the experience.  In summary, I DO recommend the production, but describing it as a game will, in my view, raise expectations that won't be fulfilled in many gamers.

Из близких сотоварищей по жанру можно назвать Analogue: A Hate Story, но если там приходилось принимать решения, от которых зависел финал, то в The 39 Steps сюжет идет четко по книге; здесь нет ни разветвленных диалогов с вариантами ответа, ни возможности выбрать, куда пойти и что ответить. Разработчикам стоило слегка адаптировать историю для более удобного чтения.

I'd like to have a chat with you about modern life, if I may. There's a really good point to all this, I promise.

There's way too much content out there right now. And no matter what it is you're in to, you'll never be able to get through everything you want. Whether you're a TV show enthusiast or a movie lover, you're high on sound or big on gaming, an avid fan of all the latest comic books or works of highbrow literature, or just a dedicated follower of the art scene or certain, ummm... specialist videos found throughout the internet, whatever's your bag, there's more going on than any mere mortal would ever be able to keep up with. And that's even if you're only into one of these things. If you're into a few then, well... yeah, you're basically boned.

There's more content to consume now than ever before, and that statement will only ever continue to be more and more true as time goes on. There used to be a time when content creation was something reserved for the elites, for people with access to the proper equipment and money needed to produce something then distribute it to the masses, and we pretty much had to be content with whatever scraps we were given. But now, the doors have been blown wide open for just about everyone. No longer do you need a big expensive studio to make music or record film. Even amazing games can be created in a bedroom then reach a global audience more easily than ever. All you need is a microphone or a camera and a computer with internet access and you already have the basics to get started for so many things. I don't know about you, but I think that's pretty bloody mind-blowing.

The great thing about that? We're now spoiled for choice for how we want to pass the time and entertain ourselves. The bad thing? We now have to be incredibly fussy about what we consume and time now becomes one of our most valuable commodities as we have less of it to decide whether something is worth sticking with or if we want to move on to the next thing. And that's before even in factoring real life into the equation. We might have family or relationship stuff to deal with, or work or education matters to attend to. There's a lot going on for everyone. The result is that we now have to decide pretty damn quickly if we want to spend time on something. If it doesn't grab us immediately, then there's a million and one other things all screaming for our attention. Personally, I've never read a comic book in my life because the sheer volume of history there has essentially made that medium impenetrable for me at this stage. I used to play music but those days are far behind me now. Even TV and movies are fast dwindling in my life. I've made my bed with videogames, and now I'm lying in it. So, ""Just what in the name of Jiminy Christmas does this have to do with The 39 Steps?"", I hear you ask. Well, I don't read books either. But his made me realise gaming is the perfect gateway into so many other things.

More visual novel than game, The 39 Steps is based on the book of the same name, a tale about a prospector and war veteran who leaves his African adventuring behind in the early 1900s and returns to his original home of England for the quiet life, only to soon find himself embroiled in an international conspiracy set to plunge nations into war with each other. What unfolds is a spy thriller as the hero, Richard Hannay, must avoid the clutches of the conspirators whilst also trying to gather proof to expose them and clear his name of a crime they have set him up as the perpetrator of. And so he goes, on a merry chase across the highlands of Scotland, meeting a colourful cast of characters along the way, as he tries to outwit his pursuers and do his best to stay one move ahead along the way.

The presentation is beautiful, as an array of backgrounds are presented to us throughout every scene, and ambient audio sets the mood for us, along with the occasional splattering of music and voice acting. The art style can vary depending on the scene, cleverly introducing us to the tone of a particular character or scenario, before then returning to the more traditional, realistic, painted look for the rest of the story. There are occasional moments of interaction beyond clicking a button to read the next piece of text, such as examining the setting in a room or flipping through newspapers or assembling items that progress the story, but for the most part it's a pretty passive affair as you'll largely be reading your way from one part to the next.

While it wasn't perfect, and some parts of the story felt like they were either meandering or getting repetitive in parts (I swear some of it felt like it was just an advertisement from the Scottish Tourism Board, dwelling on how stunning the scenery was or basking in the charm and generosity of the locals) overall I really enjoyed reading this - and that's what I found so amazing about it. Were this simply some pages and ink, or some text on a screen, I don't think I would have been nearly as involved as I was. But add some nice art and production values to it, gamify it a [i]little[/i] and throw in some achievements for me to get, and I'll play the hell out of it. It made me realise this could be the way to get gamers into so many other things, a Trojan horse of sorts to expose us to more great literature or art or to be used as a tool for learning.

There's so much that could be done to exploit the medium of gaming to branch it out and reach wider audiences than so many things might by themselves. I mean, of the people who played/read this, how many would have actually sat down with the novel of their own volition otherwise? Provided it was based on the right source material, and handled with as much reverence and style as it with this, then they really could be onto something here. So, while this shines as a great example and starting point for what could be done with other pieces of media outside gaming, it's also a really great experience in its own right. I'm really glad I took the chance on it (and hope lots of others do, too) and look forward even more to seeing what else I'll be introduced to in future.",1462130501,1462130501,True,14,0,0.644528627395629883,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gra umożliwia włączenie napisów z ujętym dialektem szkockim lub bez. Dla nieobeznanych z ich gwarą radzę od razu wyłączyć dialekt.
Oprócz tego gra nie posiada żadnych innych opcji. Jest od razu pełny ekran w maksymalnej rozdzielczości, czyli jak masz podłączony kabel HDMI do monitora 16:10 chociażby, to będziesz miał Full HD, przez co proporcje będą lekko rozjechane.
Jako fan VN brakowało mi bardzo kontroli nad tempem opowieści, które w parze z tym, że domyślnym klawiszem pauzy jest PPM a kliknięcie np. ESC, backspace powodowało też pauzę, ale i też reset rozdziału, przez co trzeba było poświęcić do 10 minut na powrót do momentu, gdzie skończyliśmy. To samo, jeśli grę zminimalizowaliśmy (radzę od razu wyłączyć inne monitory, klikniesz na pulpit i gra się minimalizuje).
Dźwięk - gra aktorska jest w porządku, ale niejednokrotnie zdarzały mi się nagle urwane tła muzyczne, zdublowane głosy czy gdy właśnie od jakiegoś momentu rozdziału wznawiałem, np. od filmu, to nie było tej muzyczki przez cały okres jego trwania. Zastanawiam się, czy jest to wina nieprzystosowania do Windowsa 10, bo sporadycznie brakowało tekstu w dialogach, co nie przeszkadzało, bo ze słuchu jeszcze można było to zrozumieć, ale w rozdziale o tym samym tytule co gra pod koniec nie wyświetliło mi 4 zdań, które się wyświetlają na środku ekranu. To już było troszkę niemiłe (reset nie pomagał, było to samo).

Even with the majority of the game consisting of still images it still felt somewhat of a movie to me as each change in events involved a cinematic transition. But again, it's still technically just an E-book. Don't get too excited kiddies, although I stated that this game's interactivity is higher than other novels, it still has as much interactivity as a vending machine.

Follow the steps of Richard Hannay who was framed for a murder he didn't commit as he embarks on a suspenseful adventure evading the law and ultimately attempting to get to the bottom of his case. A truly immersive story even for a novel where you don't really do much besides read. With superb voice acting, wonderful visuals and a intriguing story, ""[i]39 Steps[/i]"" will definitely have you pulled in.

This is also a visual novel where choices do not matter. In fact, you can't really make your own choices. The ""interactive"" part only comes in periodically where you can click certain things that trigger events to visually demonstrate what the story is telling. You will not make choices that will ultimately decide the fate of the ending or what certain characters will do. It is merely an interactive visual novel where you listen/read from start to finish with little things to do here and there. I myself have lost track of time reading this novel and don't regret a second of my time getting lost in the story.

All in all, ""[i]39 Steps[/i]"" is a truly remarkable interactive visual novel and is perfect for readers who are into mystery novels who don't mind a little activity here and there.

In almost every way this is the same a picture book being read to you. This should be the mindset you go in with. If you're a fan of that, I think it does a pretty good job of telling the story and making exploration of the screen rewarding. It is also point and click. If you demand your digital people run around and do digital people things, this is not your game.

The major issue with this game is its interface. As I gather, this is/was a test for adapting novels into video games. Admirable, but you might want to try and hire someone who can make the interface easier to use. Buttons sometimes take a while to register as clicked, keyboard functions are unintuitive, and if you hit Esc at the title screen, you just exit the game, which is pretty generally accepted these days to be a lazy way of quitting a game.

There's also achievements and picture cards of different characters that, while I enjoy the cards, the achievements are really bad in that they never show you your progress through them. I was lucky to have clicked everything to qualify for one of them.

图绘不错，声效不错，可惜音乐不太好，几处喜剧插入地不是很合时宜。游戏性也几乎是完全没有。
而且剧情……怎么说呢？有几处的确是神来之笔，但有更多的地方，连小时候的我都不忍直视啊。牵强，过于巧合，倒像是大叔给小萝莉小正太们吹牛随口随的故事。

Well, I was half right... I picked it up alright, yesterday, and stayed up until about 4am until I fell asleep, then picked it up again at 8am this morning to get the story finished.

It's not that I haven't read the 39 steps.  It was required reading at school, and having seen many BBC adaptations, and the hitchcock movie, I am quite familiar with the story.  I remember being at school, reading the passages about when Hannay is cowering in the hayloft (in my memory, may have been the mill), desperately waiting for the pursuers to move on, my heart pounding along with his....

It's only many many years later that all the coincidences pile up and make me think ""Hmmm"".  The game doesn't help the coincidences, instead accentuating a few of them, which might make someone who hasn't read the book think ""Uhhh.. that's highly unlikely"".  Either way, if you can suspend disbelief, The 39 Steps is still a fantastic story, and I'm sure the base for many other stories.  

So, I was very pleasantly surprised to find a game which managed to condense the book into a game, but seems to have somehow managed to maintain all of the feel and pacing of the book.   Wonderfully, all of the adaptations vary from the base text, so every version you read or watch will be different in some way, so there's always a little freshness there.  The version I watched on TV the other day had him being chased by spies just after his speech for the MP... which differs from the story somewhat...

So, even if you know the story inside out, the game is a good, faithful adaptation. But, is it any good as an experience?

Well, the artwork is beautiful.  Created using something like Black Ink, I guess, the settings are all wonderfully rendered, smattered with little bits of black and white photography, period references, and quaint technology.   The game designers opted to omit any live action, and instead went for a 'shadow puppet' approach, where the main actors would occasionally appear in silhouette to describe action.  It works okay, and actually you start to really appreciate the simplicity.

The little 'puzzles', which amount to clicking in the right place, or swooshing the mouse,  give you a little something to do rather than just clicking the mouse to 'turn pages', which is really nice...

The voice acting is excellent.  The accents are all just a wee bit off for the period.  They're ""modern posh"" rather than ""georgian posh"", but you'd have to be a real BBC drama officionado to notice.

The merging of graphics, the music, the artwork, the voice talent, and the story are all excellently done too.   At points, when there 'context' information to present, it's given as a nonlinear 'wheel' of words, and you can delve into whatever you like.   You know that you don't REALLY need to read any of it.  In the book it would have been incidental padding, so it is faithfully recreated as such in the game.  

I really enjoyed this, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a spy novel.",1456059200,1456059200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The 39 Steps is a digital/visual adaptation of an adventure/crime novel by 
John Buchan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Nine_Steps .

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=616520995

✓ Excellent story and narration.
✓ Excellent voice acting (even though I'm not a native English speaker, I had a couple of good laughs listening to some Scottish side-character).

The 39 Steps is a very very very very very good digital adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 novel of the same name.

Also the game mechanics, while simple (this is a book after all, there are no alternate paths in the story and there is no fail state) are enough to keep the player engaged with what is going on.

The 39 Steps – это своеобразная интерактивная книга, выступающая в роли адаптации приключенческого романа шотландца Джона Бакена “39 ступеней”.

Коротко о сюжете

Действия игры разворачиваются в Лондоне начала двадцатого века. Наш главный герой Ричард Ханней оказывается обвинен в убийстве, которого не совершал. И Ричарду ничего не остаётся, кроме как сбежать из города и скрываться от полиции. В то же время он пытается найти настоящих убийц, чтобы доказать свою правоту и добиться истины.

Геймплей

Как и во всех визуальных новеллах, на протяжении всей игры нам придётся прочитывать текст, слушать диалоги или аудио, кликать на мышь, чтобы пролистать дальше и тд. Также присутствуют мини игры, например : найти вещь на сцене или рисовать мышкой фигуры, чтобы сделать конкретное действие.

Музыка и звук

На мой взгляд, в этой игре прекрасная музыка, погружающая в атмосферу Великобритании 1914 года. Также на некоторых сценах есть звуки природы, звуки проезжающих машин и тд, что тоже погружает в атмосферу игры. Кроме того, немаловажным компонентом погружения игрока в этот мир является то, что есть возможность слушать диалоги и повествование на чистом английском и с акцентом шотландского.",1454529441,1454529441,True,0,0,0.455087125301361084,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The only thing to distrust is the normal.” ― John Buchan, [i]The 39 Steps[/i][/b]

[i]The Thirty-Nine Steps[/i] is originally an adventure novel and an ancestor of the spy thriller genre, written by the Scottish author John Buchan in 1915 - the first year of the World War I. It has long been reinterpreted into various other media - including Alfred Hitchcock's famous 1935 silver screen interpretation. But it is the first time we see Buchan's famous action-hero, Richard Hannay in a video game, thanks to Story Mechanics' initiative with a project of reinterpreting literature as narrative video games.

Here at the start of his adventures, Richard Hannay is a wealthy and able English gentleman with considerable social standing. He was raised in South Africa, became a successful mining engineer and took part in the Matabele Wars. He also served as an intelligence officer during the Boer War. He is realistic, self-sufficient with a diverse set of skills and means. Just before the events of the game, Hannay returns to London, only to find the routine life of a Londoner to be devastatingly boring. Just as he was about to give up on the capital, he is visited by one of his neighbors at his apartment in London. The neighbor reveals himself to be Franklin P. Scudder, a freelance spy and asks Hannay's help with a dangerous political plot. Finding himself in a web of lies and intrigue, Hannay quickly becomes the target of a manhunt, and starts his escape towards the Highlands of Scotland. Will he ever be able to clean his name and prevent a dangerous plot that would spell doom for all Europe?

[i]The 39 Steps[/i] is a retelling of the original novel without nearly any content cut down. The atmosphere is a wondrous success weaved out of water color environments, characters displayed as foggy silhouettes and tales that belong to characters reenacted by shadowy silent motion pictures. The display is wholly elegant and thrilling, appropriate for the tone of the narration. Voice acting is marvelous - with nuances, accents and even vocal exclamations. For the part of the presentation, you are in for a feast.

As for the gameplay, on the other hand, the same cannot be said. Yes, the game is basically a visual novel but the player's participation in the narration is close to non-existent. The game could even be categorized as non-interactive considering all you actually do is some clicking to do to reveal environmental details or some mouse movements to draw certain shapes for Hannay to interact with things now and then. There is nothing you actually do, decide or participate in. You click and watch as the story unravels. On that part, one could actually prefer reading the novel rather than playing the game, but the amount of labor put into display is certainly admirable.

For the last verdict, I'll bite and recommend [i]The 39 Steps[/i], considering newer generations prefer watching the story through a screen rather than actually reading it. You just have to know what you are getting yourselves into before buying it. [i]The 39 Steps[/i] is not a game; it is a beautifully arranged digital story book, and one that I can safely recommend if you are unfamiliar with the novel and/or bear no intention of reading it.

这款游戏用主要运用图画附加对话等形式将整个故事描述的淋漓尽致，真是当之无愧的名著╰(￣▽￣)╮

原来，在某些国家的政府和军队的背后，都还有大规模的地下间谍活动，由一批包藏祸心、极其危险的人物在操纵、运作着。他很偶然地发现了这些间谍活动，觉得好奇、蹊跷，于是追踪了下去，然后就陷在了里面，脱不出身来了。据他说，参与这个阴谋活动的多是些受过良好教育的无政府主义者，他们总想制造动乱，发动革命。除他们之外，还有一拨儿想藉此发财的金融家。这些聪明人在世界大乱、市场崩溃时总能获取丰厚利益。显然，欧洲各国火拼起来，打起仗来，正符合这两拨人的目的。然而我们的主人公是一个在非洲生活多年的英国人汉内被意外卷入间谍案，挺身而出与敌人周旋的故事。⊙﹏⊙   [Interesting]

1915年出版之后马上引起轰动，之后被四次拍成电影或电视。
有趣的是，每次改编，编剧们常常借用上次改编中出现的经典场景，以至于一些反复出现的情节其实并非出于原著。
而“三十九级台阶”的含义也被改来改去，到2008年，还是回到真正的“台阶”上。●▽●

<(￣︶￣)>好吧 ，描述故事了这么久，回到游戏上来，游戏中玩家沉寂在那一张张唯美的油画中，跟随着故事发展情节一步步深入，时不时玩家还能在游戏中互动观察各种线索了解他国文化，真是有趣无比。●︿●

the text itself, over a century old at this point, has not aged favorably either. those who appreciate highbrow literary concepts such as ""character arcs"" and ""themes"" will not find much to be engaged with here — this is pure thriller fiction, focused solely on the protagonist staying one step ahead of those dastardly germans whilst conceiving a way to stop their nefarious plot. it honestly wouldn't feel out of place in today's AAA video game market.

for something that's supposed to be suspenseful, the meat of the story falls into a sort of trite cycle as well, mostly consisting of the protagonist putting on disguises just clever enough to fool his would-be captors and/or chancing upon the most trusting and kindhearted people he could possibly meet to aid him at the exact right moment, only for him to be discovered again and forced to repeat the process. perhaps back in the day the suspension of disbelief was a little easier to uphold, but as of today i'd hesitate to call the haphazard feats of the protagonist anything but hilariously miraculous.

allies regularly pop up for a scene or two before never being seen again, and i honestly can't even remember if the villains have names or not, because they barely had presence outside of being bad and scary. events that feel like they should be shocking revelations fall flat because i have little to no investment in any of the characters or their motivations. even the final confrontation, which should have been climactic, was over and done with within seconds, the epilogue equally as rushed.

However, the casual interactivity is more than made up for with the excellent story; I wasn't aware of John Buchan's novel previously, as I'm normally not one for espionage tales, but I was thoroughly engaged by this on-the-run spy thriller. The game follows the story of restless gentleman Richard Hannay, who forges a new friendship which rapidly plunges him into a world of deception, cover-ups and murder. The artwork throughout the game is attractive, with decent music and ambience, and great voice acting.

The 39 Steps – это своеобразная интерактивная книга, выступающая в роли адаптации приключенческого романа шотландца Джона Бакена “39 ступеней”.

Коротко о сюжете

Действия игры разворачиваются в Лондоне начала двадцатого века. Наш главный герой Ричард Ханней оказывается обвинен в убийстве, которого не совершал. И Ричарду ничего не остаётся, кроме как сбежать из города и скрываться от полиции. В то же время он пытается найти настоящих убийц, чтобы доказать свою правоту и добиться истины.

Геймплей

Как и во всех визуальных новеллах, на протяжении всей игры нам придётся прочитывать текст, слушать диалоги или аудио, кликать на мышь, чтобы пролистать дальше и тд. Также присутствуют мини игры, например : найти вещь на сцене или рисовать мышкой фигуры, чтобы сделать конкретное действие.

Музыка и звук

На мой взгляд, в этой игре прекрасная музыка, погружающая в атмосферу Великобритании 1914 года. Также на некоторых сценах есть звуки природы, звуки проезжающих машин и тд, что тоже погружает в атмосферу игры. Кроме того, немаловажным компонентом погружения игрока в этот мир является то, что есть возможность слушать диалоги и повествование на чистом английском и с акцентом шотландского.

A mogła być z tego fajna przygodówka, gdyby była bardziej dopracowana i gdyby zaistniała emocjonalna więź z głównym bohaterem gry.

Plusy:

+ obiecujący pomysł na grę
+ zabawny szkocki akcent części bohaterów
+ ładne rysowane statyczne grafiki
+ detaliczne udźwiękowienie
+ czas akcji w 1914 roku i fabularny pomysł związany z rozpętaniem I wojny światowej
+ dobrze oddany klimat wysp brytyjskich (angolstwo aż wylewa się z ekranu ;))

Minusy:

- słaba interakcja (de facto jedynie ilustrowana i udźwiękowiona książka czyli audiobook)
- bardziej thriller niż detektywistyczny kryminał (Angol ucieka przez Szkocję przed zabójcami)
- w grze nie ma ani jednej postaci na ekranie (wszystkie osoby są w formie duchów)
- grafika w grze to niestety tylko statyczne obrazy (ładne, ale statyczne)
- kompletny brak emocjonalnej łączności z bohaterem gry
- irytujący, podręcznikowy angielski akcent głównego bohatera
- niezbyt dobrze przemyślana mechanika gry (np. te otwieranie drzwi)
- słabe, niby zabawne filmiki mające ożywiać statyczną rozgrywkę
- brak wciągającej muzyki
- dość przewidywalna intryga
- gra strasznie przynudza

Komu polecam? / Komu odradzam? 

+ polecam miłośnikom interaktywnych literackich oldskulowych thrillerów szpiegowskich
+ polecam zwolennikom angielskich klimatów (tudzież filologom brytyjskim;))
- odradzam graczom szukającym identyfikacji z głównym bohaterem
- odradzam graczom szukajacych ciekawje postaci w przygodówce
- odradzam tym, którzy nie lubią gatunku visual novel

Rada: 

Jeżeli chcecie dobrą grę detektywistyczną związaną z wywołaniem I wojny światowej z mocną fabułą i dobrze zaprojektowaną interakcją, to kupcie sobie znacznie lepszą szpiegowską przygodówkę The Last Express.

PROS:

- Moderately interesting story
- Moderately nice visuals (static scenery only - people are white silhouettes and interactive elements are average)

- Boring gameplay, barely anything to do
- Sound design is underwhelming
- Voice actors don't do the source material justice.
- Everything takes forever to get through
- Lots of reading

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When I got The 39 Steps, I was expecting a visual novel adapted into a point and click type adventure game. What I got was various blocks of text I had to click with small bits of ""click here to read this"" and ""do this to open that"" type gameplay. Needless to say I became bored VERY quickly. I like casual games, and I like to do things at my own pace, but this snail's crawl was too slow and uneventful for my liking. I actually fell asleep at my keyboard twice during a 1 hour session.

The sound design is mediocre and the voices are too similar - it's overall very disjointed and not cohesive as a whole.

Adjust expectations before starting this game and I think anyone who just wants to read a story in small bits will enjoy The 39 Steps. If you expect any sort of action, you will likely be disappointed!

If The 39 Steps would have had a narrator instead of the player needing to click for each paragraph, I may have enjoyed it more. I feel like they should have chosen to go 100% visual novel instead of 90% visual novel and 10% gameplay. It makes the whole experience unsatisfying.

Sit back, get warm and grab a cup of tea or coffee because you will only need to move your mouse every now and then. You play as Richard Hannay, a man from London during 1914 with a boring life whose fate changed after a certain event. Now, he’s being chased by a crime he didn’t commit. And that’s when the story gets interesting. 

The game reads like a book, and you won’t have any choices to make like, say, a Telltale game. You just explore your surroundings, read some descriptions, and move on with the story. The game does not lie about this, their premise is really honest and you should know what you are getting into, you will be reading a digital book with some clicks here and there. As the story goes, tension will go up as things may get troublesome in the road making Hannay finding different means to get what he want weather by escaping, stealing or using his wits and words with strangers. The visuals of the game are calm with vibrant colors. They are hand painted with minor movements like the wind and it will remind you of some old point & click adventure games. During your play through you will also find some collectibles by explorations. These are very hard to miss, especially if you are playing the game carefully and take your time to look at the scenario before being done with it. 

After 4 hours I finished the game and I do not find any reason to play it again. It’s a different experience and it was something I rather enjoyed. The final chapters make the conclusion satisfying and I was engaged in the game from start to finish. When I finished a chapter I just had to go to the next one as I was too curious to know what was going to happen or how Hanney is going to find a solution for his current problem. Because there’s almost no gameplay mechanics involved this games ended being quite relaxing. You can be very tired after a long day at work sipping your hot beverage while playing 39 Steps and it’s going to be a nice experience.

Este jogo tem um quê de Sherlock Holmes (inclusive faz referência ao personagem, à saga e ao autor Arthur Conan Doyle). A história é bem interessante, mas demonstra faltar alguns pontos chaves com elementos não tão detalhados e simplificados (subjetivos).

Sobre a jogabilidade em si, você não precisa fazer muita coisa. Basta ler tudo o que o narrador-personagem vai contar (que é o protagonista) e clicar em coisas brilhantes que te chamam a atenção e que o personagem vai notar e usar junto aos seus conhecimentos para dar continuidade à história (semelhante a um Hidden Object). As cutscenes do jogo mostram ambientes bonitos e bem feitos (que parecem telas pintadas ou fotos antigas de lugares a céu aberto ou ambientes bem mobilhados). Você ainda tem a possibilidade de fazer desenhos com o mouse (nos momentos em que o personagem vai abrir portas - normalmente, nada de arrombar - ou abrir janelas, garrafas. O jogo indica no canto da dela a quantidade de coisas que você pode encontrar no ambiente para ajudar seu personagem e a quantidade de parágrafos que você também vai passar por . Além disso, a história contada pelo personagem só dá continuidade quando você dá um clique com um mouse para ela passar ao próximo texto narrado. No mais, a história segue seu curso e você não faz muitas interferências (no máximo pular as cutscenes e entender nada da história e perder conquistas do jogo por causa disso).

A OST do jogo, apesar de não ser tão diversa nos diferentes momentos da história é boa. Acho que se encaixa bem no que o jogo propõe e os sons utilizados também. 

Por fim, eu gostei do jogo, porém acho que ele foi pouco explorado. Ele tem uma proposta muito boa (pelo menos para mim) e poderia ter sido mais legal ainda com poucas mudanças. Mas entendo que a proposta talvez tenha sido essa desde o início, e é um modo de contar uma história.

Итак, перед нами годный инди-детектив на подобие Rooms (только если учесть что у нас не одна коробочка для того чтобы ее открыть, а нечто большее, включающее эти самые комнаты и различные мини-игры, плюс сюжетные вставки), созданный по довольно таки старому британскому фильму 1935 года выпуска (Да, да фильму на данный момент уже более восьмидесяти лет). Итак, разберемся с сюжетом:

""Ричард знакомится в Лондонском мюзикхолле с Аннабеллой, которая просит укрыть ее от идущих по ее следу убийц. Ричард не воспринимает это всерьез, но разрешает ей переночевать у него. Той же ночью девушка вваливается в его спальню с ножом в спине… Бегущего в панике Ричарда принимают за убийцу-маньяка и полиция всей Англии начинает охоту. Чтобы доказать свою невиновность, ему придется пройти все круги Ада…"" и вот тут то и начинается ""веселуха"" и наше похождение, а дальше играйте сами, не буду спойлерить.

Итак, как уже было сказанно игра очень даже не плоха в своем жанре, да и со скидками цена очень даже привлекательная.",1450360036,1452200320,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[b] Главное [/b] - Это не просто обычная игра, а скорее повествующий детектив с отличными картинками и разнообразными пейзажами, где изредка, кликая, приходиться что-то выбирать или больше узнавать информации. Игра сделана по книге Джона Бакена - 39 Ступеней. Так же есть фильм Хичкока, который, к сожалению, мне так и не удалось посмотреть. Она стоит все свои 5 баксов, а сейчас даже меньше 30 - СРОЧНО БЕРИТЕ!

Игра не для всех, т.к даже с субтитрами иногда сложно разобрать почти чистый английский. Наикрасивейшие рисованные пейзажи, честно. Хоть бери и в рамочку вешай. Сюжет, как раз для типичных детективах, не говорю о русских.
Рекомендую, тем кто замешкался в сюжете игры, прочесть книгу. Я не мог разобрать, что происходит ближе к концу и мне книга помогла. Отличное игра на выходные, чтобы скоротать в ней пару тройку часов, для удовольствия.

As someone who hadn't previously read the book or seen the play/movie, I have to say this definitely made me want to read/watch. 

It started off pretty slow, (again I'm sure someone will pick up this game having no prior knowledge of this story) I had a problem where whenever I would alternate to a different window to do something, even when pausing the game, it would not let me continue, instead it would restart the chapter I was currently on, which can get annoying as I'm a very easily distracted person. Nonetheless, solving that would just mean putting your undivided attention into the game, at least until the end of that chapter (which is a good thing as this is more of an interactive story rather than a game, you wouldn't want to miss precious plot)

Anyway, the water colour landscape art is absolutely stunning, and added suspense in a way that really made you listen to what was being said and at times forced you to visualize the situation yourself, with the help of some awesome first person narration. I bought this game a while back on a third person game bundle site for a few bucks at most. Would I spend $15 on this game? No. But I am broke so I'm speaking from the stance of an empty walleted person.

All in all this game is relaxing, suspenseful, and to a degree educational. I'd recommend this game to those who want something that they can casually unwind to, without much effort on their part.",1450108934,1450114815,True,7,0,0.616263806819915771,1,False,False,False,False,,,

И я бы рекомендовала ее другим, но все же для себя я нашла больше минусов, чем плюсов. 
Начнем с самого главного - сюжет! Сюжет основан на новелле Джона Бакена с одноименным названием, а именно 39 ступеней. И если честно, сюжет нисколько не интересный. Хотя это произведение входит в топ 200 по версии ВВС, но на лайвлибе, например, у книги оценки около 5-6 из 10. Я к тому, что изначально для игры разработчики взяли неверное произведение. Оно скучное и нудное, полное диалогов, за которыми следить неинтересно, мне надоело где-то к середине. Если уж хотите ознакомиться с произведением, лучше саму книгу почитайте. Может, на меня оказало влияние то, что мне не понравились ни главный герой, ни атмосфера 1914 года. Не хватает этой игре экшена и действий, а то действительно ""никакой это не триллер, а просто невнятный шпионско-приключенческий бред. Большую часть книги герой скачет по сельской местности, прячась от полиции и злодеев. Логики в его действиях нет вообще. Зато он суперкрутой горный инженер, маскируется лучше Шерлока Холмса и ловит подброшенный нож за ручку зубами"" (это обзор на книгу с лайвлиба, но я с этим полностью согласна). В общем за сюжет минус!
Далее, геймплей. Навязывание каких-то ненужных движений мышкой совсем не к месту. Чтобы игроку было не скучно? Чтобы время потянуть? Чтобы оправдать отсутсвие геймплея? Непонятно... Да и вместо героев какие-то призраки без лица, как-то теряется вовлеченность в процесс игры.
Из плюсов, очень богатый язык. Определенно помогает развитию английского языка. Многие слова редко встречаются в современном разговорном языке, что весьма интересно. Хотя порой в диалогах реплики довольно быстро сменяются, но в общем это не критично. P.S. Шотландский акцент это ад, но субтитры к нему нормальные.
Еще плюс, игра очень красиво нарисована, она радует глаз, и я сделала довольно много скриншотов. Порой, на некоторых кадрах в помещении чуть ли не фотореализм, а пейзазжи как будто акварелью нарисованы. Здорово!
Кроме того в игре очень легкие ачивки, нужно просто пройти игру и всё. а проходится она довольно быстро, у меня ушло около пяти часов. Не нужно даже все внутриигровые ачивки выбивать, достаточно лишь пройти сюжет.

В итоге для меня, несмотря на все плюсы, минус за сюжет стал самым главным. Но, как известно, на вкус и цвет все фломастеры разные, кому-то сюжет вполне может понравиться, так что я рекомендовала бы глянуть сначала книгу, и если уж заинтересует, спокойно играть в игру. А я ей ставлю 5 из 10.",1446306768,1446306768,True,3,0,0.566411614418029785,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Европа как никогда близка к войне, обстановка накалена, повсюду шныряют шпионы, но в старой доброй Англии все так же подают на завтрак яичницу с беконом, а порядочные джентльмены все так же пьют чай из фарфоровых чашек.

Вероятно, любому такому джентльмену не очень бы понравилось, если бы у двери собственной квартиры его схватил за локоть полузнакомый человек и истерично зашептал: «Я — покойник, помоги мне».

Но наш главный герой и по совместительству рассказчик, Ричард Ханней, не благовоспитанный денди, он совсем недавно приехал из полной приключений и опасностей Южной Африки и в уютном Лондоне ему изрядно скучно. Поэтому он соглашается выслушать нежданного гостя, предлагает ему кров, постель... и совершенно неожиданно для себя оказывается втянут в хитросплетения интриг, обвивающих Европу не хуже щупалец гигантского кракена.

Любопытно, что все персонажи, включая самого Ричарда, представлены в игре не портретами и не живыми актерами, а полупрозрачными силуэтами. Вероятно, разработчики решили, что фантазия игроков будет работать на полную катушку и каждый сможет представить себе действующих лиц так, как сочтет нужным. На практике же дымчатые призраки, появляющиеся на фоне старинных квартир и переулков Сити, вызывают недоумение и изрядно отвлекают от сюжета.

Разработчикам стоило слегка адаптировать историю для более удобного чтения. Многие фразы кажутся нарочито обрубленными, описания — чересчур короткими, а самых внимательных игроков заденут опечатки и периодическое отсутствие точек в конце предложений.

Способ подачи сложно назвать изобретательным — простые статичные картинки. Хотя стоит сказать, что они неплохо справляются со своей задачей: изображения, похожие одновременно на фотографии и на акварельные наброски, полноценно передают атмосферу и обстановку. Кликать в поисках активных зон здесь не нужно, крупная стрелка или круг покажут, куда надо нажать, чтобы перейти на следующий... этап?

Пожалуй, скорее — на следующую страницу. Это все-таки не игра, а книга. Книга, безуспешно притворяющаяся игрой. Даже сохранения здесь зовутся «закладками».

Разработчики попытались разнообразить неторопливое течение рассказа с помощью карикатурных роликов и приемов из Heavy Rain. Здесь тоже есть возможность в некоторые моменты просмотреть мысли героя о том или ином событии, а все его действия — открывание дверей, наливание виски или бритье заросших щек — необходимо «рисовать» мышкой. Только вот даже в игре Дэвида Кейджа подобные рутинные задачи раздражали, хотя там требовалось крутить геймпад в воздухе, трясти его и зажимать разные кнопки, а не просто елозить манипулятором по коврику.

Главная проблема The 39 Steps в том, что разработчики попытались представить свою игру такой, какой она не является, введя совершенно лишние функции, и где-то приняли странные решения (те же привидения). Но мы все равно рады тому, что литературная классика перебирается в видеоигровой формат. Было бы неплохо увидеть больше хороших книг в нестандартном изложении.",1446296581,1446296581,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I wrongly thought that was enough to make me completely familiar with the story that inspired the creation of James Bond. I was very surprised when I played this and realized how vastly different it was from the film. I’ll give some examples. In the film, Richard Hannay is Canadian. In this game, he’s a Scot. In the film, the agent he encounters at the start of the story is a mysterious lady. In this game, he meets a male American spy. In the film, he eventually encounters a love interest. In this game, he does not. Also, the entire enemy plot in the movie is different. Upon doing some research, I learned that the movie took many liberties with the story (possibly to make it more entertaining for movie audiences at the time). This game is supposedly more, if not completely faithful, to the book. 
However you should know that while this story is of historical note, it was only innovative because of the era in which it came out. It’s hardly a masterpiece. It is just a simple man-on-the-run story, in which the hero lucks his way through numerous tricky situations and eventually defeats the rather cliche villains at the end of it. There are also some ridiculous coincidences that you’ll just have to suspend disbelief to accept. Then it ends somewhat abruptly. I could see why Hitchcock made certain changes for his movie.
Still, despite it’s flaws, it is rather enjoyable. The character of Richard Hannay is extremely likable and his voice actor in this game is spot on. The Story Mechanics present scenes with beautiful art and offer enough variety in their storytelling to keep the player engaged. This is a great way to experience John Buchan’s novel. I personally got it during a weekly Steam sale at 90% off, so it was almost free.

The downsides are that at several moments the game didn't seem to register my input to continue, which is something that might be worked out with a future patch, and that the replay value of this already very short game is almost non-existent.

PROS:
-Great background score and event specific sound
-Immersive hand drawn scene sketches
-Great combination of reading and voice acted scenes
-Quite a great adaptation from original novel, covering great many details
-A nice fleshed out 4-6 hours gameplay time (If you are not trying to rush through events merely for achievements)

CONS:
-A little more of interactive elements would have been great
-Even better if some interactive choices would have led to a little different path taken
(A scene where you could write ""Thank you"" on a piece of paper to the landlord of the INN seemed non-consequential I was expecting it to have some impact on game)
-Gameplay seemed a little sped up and missing on details from the novel after Hannay meets Sir Walter and gets his title cleared, before that the game was going so much in depth with each emotion he goes through and describing each little character in detail (like the old shephard in the train). I wish the level of immersion was continued after the point he meets Walter.

All in all an excellent adaptation, I am really looking forward to get my hands on any other novel adaptation from this DEV.",1444028291,1479945934,True,1,0,0.487136214971542358,0,False,False,False,False,,,

At first I didn't really like this game. But it really sucks you in. The story is gripping and amazing.

In the beginning I didn't understand the $15 price.. now I understand that price is a deal! If you can get for less I would jump on this one.

Worth the full price. On Sale for less than $2

Situé dans la Grande-Bretagne de 1914 (le tout très bien retranscrit, entre multiples références à l'actualité et aux personnalités existantes, le cadre, les coupures de presse, les images d'archives, de petits films animés parfois et même jusque dans les accents parfois très appuyés), ce jeu bénéficie d'une très bonne mise en scène ainsi que d'une direction artistique plus qu'honorable.

Cross-media experiments are always risky, and this unique adaptation of ‘The 39 Steps’ is a good example to show it. There was a lot of thought and care put into it, but in the end it just didn't succeed. It’s a shame, really.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
If you didn’t know already, ‘The 39 Steps’ was originally a serialised pulp novel published in 1915. Its protagonist, an involuntary adventurer, Hannay, gets caught in a web of German conspiracy against the power structures of Europe, only to be chased through half of Scotland, eluding his pursuers only by his quick wits and a few friendly locals. It was sort of a forefather of the spy thriller genre that was so popular in the 1970s.

This adaptation tried to do something other than the numerous others by being a cross between a visual novel and an audiobook. Sadly, it fell between the two stools.
For a radio drama, it is good, and the actors are especially adept at portraying all the various British dialects, but there are so few recorded sections that you sometimes forget that these characters have voices.
For a visual novel, it is just dull. Everything is a still image background with an occasional grey silhouette. The drawings look spectacular, but their stillness completely fails to capture the supposedly fast pace of this century-old action thriller.

I wish I could give a better rating, because the amount of work put into this adaptation is more than admirable. But in the end, I must say that if you are interested in ‘The 39 Steps’, just buy the book instead.",1443434316,1443434316,True,6,0,0.573495745658874512,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It presents the perfect blend between video games and books. The game is essentially a visual novel, but a rather special one. It's a digital adaptation of a espionage thriller, where the main character is Richard Hannay, someone who is put on the run due to certain events to which I won't spoil for you. The story is engaging, and the way it's told is creative and original. Besides the beautiful hand drawn art design, the sounds effect are splendidly united with the phrases you'll be reading throughout the main events. The progression is linear, something expected. Simple actions are executed by dragging your mouse in certain directions (such as trimming Hannay's beard, for example), and those end up adding immersion to the game. The voice acting is remarkable and the only problem I had with it was due to the not understandable scottish accents, but that was easily fixed by turning on the lyrics. Various objects can be explored and viewed from different angles, and The 39 Steps, at times, even is educative in a way that it provides information on the history at that particular time, around 1910. The achievements are easily obtainable, as they are completed by finishing event after event, which function like a chapter in a book.

[h1]Conclusion: The 39 Steps changed my perception of how this concept of digital adaptation of a book to a video game can be astonishingly enjoyable. It is rather unique amongst this genre, and I expect more of these by the same developer. Absolutely worth your money!

本作改编自1915年John Buchan的同名小说《The 39 steps》，讲述了一名平民被卷入英德谍战之间的悬疑故事。同时1935年由导演阿尔弗雷德·希区柯克翻拍为同名电影上映。

谈谈游戏本身，说白了一部电子小说能有多大游戏性……？相对于GALGAME还能有妹子CG看亮点，本作出众之处只能在于剧情。剧情就不剧透了，为了作对比我还去把电影下来看了一遍。不过可以确定的是电影改编得太多，基本就不是原作样貌[spoiler] 但是电影有未经PS的女主和脱袜秀腿福利我会和你说么？[/spoiler]……

В строгом смысле The 39 Steps, это не игра, а укороченная и адаптированная интерактивная вариация книги с одноименным названием, в русском переводе ""39 ступенек"", за авторством старого шотландского писателя John Buchan`а (в русском варианте, фигова туча транскрипций от Джона Бъюкена, до Бухана, Бучана и так далее). По книге кстати снят хороший детектив за авторством Хичкока, ну и много других киноадаптаций. Кому интересно, можете все это посмотреть в интернете, благо там все доступно и на русском. Ну а далее про игру:

1) Сюжет: книга была издана в 1915 году перед началом Первой Мировой, сюжет поэтому во многом строится на шпионских скандалах связанных с ощущением грядущих бедствий. Главный герой оказывается втянут в шпионскую историю связанную с загадочной группой Black Stone, которая с помощью хитрых манипуляций и убийств хочет приблизить начало войны. Героя подозревают в убийстве, и поэтому он вынужден скрываться от полиции, и в то же время он пытается разгадать заговор, информация о котором зашифрованна в книге убитого в его доме человека. 
Книга считается одной из предтеч жанра шпионских триллеров где главному герою приходиться убегать от властей в попытке доказать свою невиновность\добиться истины\покарать злодеев\подставить нужное. 
Посему самое ценное в этой игре, как и в книге это сюжет. И именно ради него игру стоит пройти. Ну или перечитать книгу, кому как нравится. ;)

2) Геймплей: любителей сложных головоломок или быстроты реакции я огорчу. Весь геймплей в игре сводится к прочитыванию текста, прослушиванию аудио, кручению мышки по часовой стрелке чтобы пролистать текст дальше, или против часовой, дабы пролистнуть назад. Изредко это разбавляется поиском нужных вещей на сцене, но тут все линейно ибо это не ""hidden object"", все предметы четко видны, и более того подсвечены. Другое редкое развлечение это рисование фигур - лево, право, вверх, вниз, часовая стрелка.  Так что кому важно именно действие в игре, видимо стоит выбрать что-то иное нежели The 39 Steps.

3) Графика: в игре довольно красивые сцены срисованные судя по титрам с реальных фотографий. Периодически встречаются вставки с винтажными фотками (очень интересно посмотреть как выглядела Великобритания в начале прошлого века), и анимированные вставки с закосом под старую кинохронику. В целом довольно симпатично и эстетично.

4) Звуки: в игре очень хорошая музыка создающая нужную атмосферу, присутствуют звуки мира (проезжающие машины, звуки игры в теннис и так далее), плюс есть возможность послушать замечательную озвучку, на чистом британском, на кокни, а также плохом английском диалекте шотландского разлива, любителям лингвистических вещей должно понравиться.

5) Язык: во многом смотрите выше про звуки, книга была написана в начале прошлого века, весьма образованным товарищем, поэтому в игре присутствует как весьма хороший английский язык насыщенный идиомами и образными выражениями, так и диалект лондонских рабочих, и весьма специфический шотландский говор. Все это ведет к тому что если Вы не знаете английский хотя бы на уровне Upper Intermediate, а лучше Advanced, то большая часть игры для Вас пройдет мимо.

Игра на самом деле является очень хорошей адаптацией шпионского триллера, но вот порекомендовать я её могу только узкой прослойке тех кто: a) любит литературу, и готов воспринять игру как упрощенную книгу (потому что именно игровых моментов в ней особо нет), b) очень хорошо знает английский, ибо без знания оного, в этой игре делать нечего.

It's not an actual GAME, though, it's more of an experience, a new way of storytelling. There's not a lot of interaction - you just have to use your mouse every now and then to keep the story going, and that's pretty much it. However, the game manages to never get you bored by delivering the story in different ways: sometimes you get dialogues, sometimes you have to explore around a scenario, look at a newspaper, watch a small movie (I loved those!), etc. The BEAUTIFUL landscapes, accompanied by great music and sound effects will do the rest to keep you in the right mood. 

I finished the game within a weekend, and it really felt like reading a good book. Whenever I wasn't playing, I was thinking of it, wanting to get lost again in the lovely Scottish glens.

I enjoyed this game experience!
At first I was a little put off by the clunky controls (rotate mouse counterclockwise...), but this turned out to be easily mitigated.
Its an interactive novel, of sorts...
With that I mean that while its you, as a player/reader, that control the pace of the story, you have no influence over what will happen, you simply uncover the next step.
This means that game has no replayability, that is unless you have a somewhat bad memory or are very fond of the artwork in the game. Because the art work is at times very pleasing to the eye, several of them (a monoplane at sunset springs to mind) would have been nice to have had as backgrounds, but alas.
I thought the voice acting was more than decent too.

So, if you are looking for a good story, don't mind games that are good for one playthrough, and you don't demand action every minute to be entertained, I'd recommend this game. I got mine very cheaply indeed (thanks Indiegala), but its worth a few £/$/€.

[i]The 39 Steps[/i] is a unique interactive visual novel, developed by [b]The Story Mechanics[/b] and first released on Steam in april 2013. The game is based on the novel with the same title by John Buchan, which got quite well-known thanks to its being the inspiration for Ian Flemmings [i]James Bond[/i] books. The novel tels the story of Richard Hannay, a bored-to-death gentleman who all of a sudden finds himself in the eye of an espionage storm. Buchans story has its flaws: some plot-turns come across as unbelievable, but the characters are drawn very fine indeed, as is the time period against which the plot evolves.

Buchans novel is followed very closely in the game, which does an excellent job in transferring the overall feel and atmosphere of the period and place during which the action takes place: London, Scotland and the English countryside early summer 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War. The developers achieved this by using a brilliantly designed and executed visual style, with a lot of hand-drawn images.

Actually, the story is told in several different ways, all with their own level of interaction. The narrative part of the novel is being projected on the screen, with the player having to click through the different lines. But the game manages to introduce variety even in this simple mechanic: the tempo of the clicking varies: sometimes a screen is held onto longer, while at other times clicks has to done much faster. Dialogues are being voice-acted in a very convincing way, some self-contained stories are even being projected as short movies. There is some point-and-clicking too, although this is allways clearly indicated and not designed as a challenge or puzzle. All in all, the variety in interaction between player and game helps a lot to draw one into the story.

The awesome visuals and interesting storytelling are accompanied by a soundscape that mostly stays in the background, punctuating some important actions without drawing any attention to itself. A bit more of these, and a more convincing musical envelopment would have painted the period even better I believe. But this is only a minor quibble. More problematic are the click-and-drag actions one has to perform to unlock doors or achieve other minor tasks. These feel tucked on, and do not integrate well within the overall concept.

The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is spot on as well. This is like reading a book, but you interact ingame with a mouse at certain situations and click objects on screen such as newspapers or items of interest. There are also times where you have to imitate real movements with a mouse ( sort of like in Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy if you have played that game).
There are also cards to collect and awards to unlock while playing the game, which is a nice touch for all those people like myself who enjoy collecting things.
All in all:

+ Great story
+ Beautiful art design
+ Good sound effects and acting

- If you dont like reading a lot, this game is not for you

If you are looking for a great thriller story accompanied by great art design and acting, you are going to enjoy this game. 9 / 10",1441388688,1441388688,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

这款游戏，或者称之为，小说，改编自1915年发售的同名小说，《三十九级台阶》。作为早期以及畅销的悬疑类小说，三十九级台阶的剧情确实可圈可点。
故事开始于一次偶然的遭遇，主角被卷入了一起惊天的间谍计划之中。为了逃生，同时也为了揭发这起阴谋，主角踏上了一场与敌人斗智斗勇的旅程。其间的各种突发事件，时常将主角推向危险之中，而主角则总是能找到一线生机，光怪陆离的剧情展开，不仅在1915年，即使现在看起来也相当地令人过瘾。
本作应该归类为电子小说，不过与时下盛行的日式电子小说不同，这款作品更像是插图丰富的纸质小说。画面更加直观地表现了剧情的展开，而作为主体的文字同样引人入胜，两者相辅相成，这部百年的作品也由此如获新生。
当下正是电子媒体发展，纸质媒体日渐式微的时代，那些古老的文学作品，是否能够在这样的时代生存下去？我想，是的，至少三十九级台阶这部作品的成功证明了，小说类文学能够乘上电子媒体这阵东风。
科技产品与文学作品并非是不可兼容的。《三十九级台阶》是如此，《去月球》亦是如此，《6号设备》更是如此。希望在今后，也会有更多的作品为游戏行业注入不一样的血液。",1437840365,1437840365,True,40,7,0.815321564674377441,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Doch die Neugier hat gesiegt, und obwohl ich bis dahin noch nichts von Buchans Geschichte gehört hatte, war meine Vorfreude groß.

Mein Englisch ist zwar nicht perfekt, aber das Spiel nutzt seine visuellen Elemente geschickt, um die Geschichte auch denen zugänglich zu machen, deren Sprachkenntnisse vielleicht nicht die besten sind. Schon nach dem ersten Kapitel war ich überrascht, wie gut ich der Handlung folgen konnte und wie sehr ich wissen wollte, wie es weitergeht. Es hat mich wirklich erstaunt, dass ein Spiel, das im Wesentlichen ein Buch ist, mich so fesseln konnte.

Auch Wochen nach dem Abschluss des Spiels lässt mich die Geschichte nicht los, sodass ich mir sogar die Taschenbuchausgabe bestellt habe. Diese ist glücklicherweise auch auf Deutsch erhältlich und auf Ankaufportalen zu einem sehr günstigen Preis zu finden. Für alle, die sich für Agentengeschichten begeistern, die spannender sind als so mancher Bond-Film, kann ich ""The 39 Steps"" wärmstens empfehlen.

But there are the exceptions- games that push the limits of what it means to be a game. And I personally think ""The 39 Steps"" pushes the boundary the most, because it's hardly a game. Does it have fine points about it? Sure! It's got a great soundtrack, excellent voice actors, great background sounds, and well-done backgrounds. But I feel like how I felt with playing ""Over the Void"". All of this seems to be covering up how little the game actually has to offer. I played the game in roughly 3 hours because that game made me move at that pace. If I was in full control of the speed of the story, I bet I'd be done in roughly less than an hour. All the gameplay is melted down into clicking. Nothing complicated. Nothing at stake. Which really undermines the purpose of the achievements of the game. Oh, you clicked 15 times in this game! Ding!

I don't mind point-and-click games but usually if you have some control of choice over the game. And choice over a game doesn't have to mean the way the story turns out. Sometimes the choice could be how you handle a situation, what steps you take to get somewhere, what items you use on an object. And 39 Steps takes all choice away and turns the game into a tourist ride of fun places around Scotland... PowerPoint Style. But it's a well-designed PowerPoint, I'll give it that!

The story is decent. I never had read the 39 Steps, but I knew what to expect from older novels and this one's no different... the pacing is about as slow as a turtle trying to swim through maple syrup, and it doesn't help with the gameplay being slow, either. Sure, slow stories can be just as effective and the story in 39 Steps has it's moments, but there are a lot of long drags, and one particularly occurs with so much repetition you forget what's supposed to happen in the story. But the story, the good and bad parts, I feel I should give no credit to the the designers or the game's total score. I feel like it'd be better placed in a book review, since the designers just cherry-picked their favorite quotes of the story and threw the words in while an intense chase scene in occuring, undermining any slight tension the player might have been feeling.

If you want to experience the 39 Steps, or you're a connoiseur of PowerPoints, this is perfect for you. I happen to be a gamer that prefers to actually play a video game, rather than watch it with short intervals of clicking.",1434166620,1441765857,False,1,0,0.502572894096374512,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The 39 Steps ist eine interaktive Geschichte, die auf dem gleichnamigem Kriminalroman 'Die 39 Stufen' basiert. Kurz vor dem Ausbruch des 1. Weltkriegs entschließt sich der Army Offizier Richard Hannay dazu nach London zu ziehen und wird von Tag zu Tag gelangweilter, wenn nicht sogar lethargisch. Bis eines Abend Franklin Scudder, ein Nachbar, ihm einen Besuch abstattet und ihn um Hilfe bittet. Scudder ist einer Verschwörung auf die Schliche gekommen und befindet sich nun selbst in Lebensgefahr, nach einem ausführlichen Gespräch entschließt sich Hannay ihm zu helfen und verstrickt sich Tag um Tag immer mehr in die verbrecherischen Fänge.

○ eine interaktive Geschichte, die vollkommen eigen und anders präsentiert wird
○ liebevoll gestaltete Settings
○ sehr viele detaillreiche Gespräche
○ gute Vertonung -> gute Darstellung der verschiedenen Dialekte

[-]
○ alle Figuren werden als Silhouetten dargestellt (mich persönlich hat es nicht angesprochen)
○ Belohnung für den Abschluss eines 'Kapitels' gibt es, hat aber nichts mit Eigenverschulden zutun, da die Storyline so linear ist, hätte man den Erfolg so oder so bekommen - man bekam nicht wirklich das gefühl etwas geschafft zu haben und hatte damit kein Erfolgserlebnis.
○ sehr linear - lässt keine Entscheidungsfreiheit zu.
○ mehr interaktives Hörbuch/Geschichte, als ein tatsächliches Spiel.

● Mein Fazit:
Ein gutes aber vorallem erzählendes Point and Click-Adventure. 
Das Spiel ist bisher nur auf Englisch erhältlich, aber die Stimmen und der Art-Style des Games, haben es mir leicht gemacht mich dennoch überzeugt.
Wobei sich eben alles um die Story dreht und weniger um eigene Handlung im Spiel. 
Es ist ein ungewöhnliches Spiel, ein Kauf lohnt sich aber trotzdem!

The addition of  authentic archived newspapers was a real bright spot for me. Certain parts were highlighted as relevant for flavour and the story, but equally interesting (if not amusing at times) are some of the ads for health tonics, men's moustache grooming products and the like.

Aqui, você acompanhará a história de forma linear, podendo explorar determinadas situações e interagir com alguns objetos e cenas, mas sem fugir da história do livro.

é um conceito diferente de acompanhar um bom livro, afinal, a arte é muito bonita, a música é impecável, e o trabalho dos atores nos faz realmente entrar no clima de suspense.

The gameplay was subtle and propelled the story while involving you as the main character.

My only quibble with the game was sometimes the music did not loop perfectly which took me out of the moment.  However, the next flick of the mouse brought me right back into it.

After learning of this conspirary the protagonist, Richard Hannay, ends up falling into a journey that he never imagined. 

The main thing you need to know about The 39 Steps before you go into it is that it is not a game of puzzles, collectibles or skill, it is a interactive game that tells a story and you are there for the ride. You click through Hannay's thoughts, then sit back and watch/listen to the character's dialogue as they reveal new clues and hints that keep you guessing through 20 segments that are nicely broken up. You can leave off at any of these points or just leave a bookmark if you need to leave in a hurry. Sometimes there are sections where you click around a room to look at objects and various texts, some of which are incredibly detailed and could probably take a good amount of time to read. There are never that many moments where you feel like you are in control of these ""investigation"" parts though, usually the only things that are interactive in the rooms are the objects that need to be clicked on, and there are is an indicator on the bottom that lets you know how many objects there are left to see in the scene or that you have already looked at. 

The fact that you are never controlling Hannay's thoughts or making important character decisions is never a problem in The 39 Steps though. The text is excellently placed and animated during certain scenes making it tense at one moment and beautiful at another. The choices made such as there never really being a full image of a human character while they are speaking to one another makes you think about who these characters are and why the developer decided to depict them that way. 

For those that are intersted in a good story in the form of a video game The 39 Steps is incredibly interesting and thrilling throughout.

Es spielt im Jar 1910 und fängt die Stimmung des Buches sehr gut ein, begleitet von guten Sprechern und schönem Soundtrack. Da es sich um eine Visual Novel handelt, beschränkt sich der spielerische Part eigentlich nur auf klicken und ab und zu die Maus in bestimmten Mustern zu bewegen um zb eine Tür zu öfnnen.

Hauptaugenmerk ist natürlich die Story die sich sehr eng am Orginal hält. Da ich sowhl das Buch als auch die Verfilmungen kannte, war die Story natürlich nichts neues. Aber durch den Grafikstill und die Soundkulisse hat es doch sehr viel Spass gemacht.

Absolut empfehlenswert, aber mann muss sich natürlich im klaren sein, das es mit einem Computerspiel im klassischen Sinne nichts zu tun hat. Es gibt keine Rätsel und ist absolut linear. Zu erwähnen ist noch das es nur eine englische Version gibt.

That needs to be made clear because someone expecting a game of some sort will be disappointed. It's not even a point and click that requires any thinking. This cannot even be compared to Phoenix Wright. This is a book with digital pictures and voice-work and rare animation. It is aptly described as a digital adaptation. How do we set it apart from a book with pictures? Sound, voice-work and interactive page-turning.

That said, here's the review: WHAT IT DOES, IT DOES VERY WELL. The sounds are crisp and very effective, the voice-work is professional level and well cast, the artwork is beautiful, the pictures (i think they are retrieved from actual existing sources of non-fiction, such as newspapers, museums, etc.) go the distance and the work put in to get them shows, to me, the passion with which this work was made. The soundtrack is also excellent and hightens the mood.

I enjoyed the craftsmanship here.

The thing is, it does harm to both the worlds it draws upon: 

- as an interactive game, it never challenges you, never makes you think, never puzzles you, nor does it require any skill to advance.
- as a book, since you don't go through it at the rate you read a book, at the pace the author envisioned, it ends up not being as thrilling. Plus, it gives sound and image to something that never lives up to the reader's imagination, a common complaint in film adaptations.
You could say that, like a film, that's bound to happen. The difference is, when you're making a film, no matter how faithful to the source material, it frees itself from it because the author of the film knows it's a new medium and that, in that respect, it's something new. It's the film's author approach.
Here, since it's just a helping visualization, there's never that approach. Just images, sounds and transitions.

To sum up, this is a very well made digital adaptation. Go through it and you'll see the passion about the project and the tremendous respect for the book. I loved this because i spent every second appreciating the level of craftsmanship (my hat's off to thee, Simon Meek. I'll buy the next one) and the fine words of a great book, but, since i'm on Steam, i'd suggest either reading a book or playing a game.

That means there are no real puzzles, no real gameplay, and it is just the story. If you like point and click adventure games, a visual novel isn't a big step backwards from that sort of thing. You just don't get the puzzles that come along with the adventure genre. So when you want a totally relaxing time of just visualizing a story a graphic novel will succeed in doing that without making you have to think much about solving any puzzles. The 39 Steps is probably one of, if not the best visual novels I have ever played. It adds a lot of extra background and lore to explore within this as well that most visual novels don't contain. 

The 39 Steps is a classic thriller novel that has been adapted to this medium in such a way that it feels like a big time studio was behind it rather than an Indie team. This political thriller takes place in Europe, mostly in England and Scotland, You are a man that stumbles into a bit of a political conspiracy by chance, which forces you to eventually run for your life and solve the mystery before your life is ruined. 

The quality of the artwork is superb. The menus and user interface are clean and slick. There are no bugs, no glitches, and everything is done in a professional way. You can ""add a bookmark"" at any place in the story to the point that you can do this after every line of text presented. Making it simple to navigate back to where you were. The story is also broken up into about 20 segments so you should never find yourself lost along the way. You can have 3 profiles as well. I think it would be difficult to play this without feeling like this is how a visual novel SHOULD be done. It is as good as it gets for this genre. Adventure fans not familiar with the visual novel genre may just find that this will convince them to try more due to how well made it was. 

It has hand painted watercolor artwork that looks extremely realistic, and is a wonder to gaze upon. You feel like you are inside the rooms the story brings you to, the landscapes outdoors that you are stomping through, and they are so well done that you may even feel the sun shining down upon you while you are lying in a field trying to hide from your pursuers. Behind all these backdrops are well placed sound effects to give the right atmosphere. Things like horse's hooves clacking away, the coughs of patrons in a restaurant, and the footsteps of a cobblestone street. Combine that with a perfectly toned musical score to crank up the tension when it is needed, or simply set the stage for some mystery, all aspects of a well done story are in place from a technical standpoint. 

The game is mostly done in written text, as all visual novels are, but there are many scenes of the story that give us voice acting. The voice acting is professional. Believable for all times voices are used, accents feel genuine, and the characters all give the right inflections for the tone they are trying to convey. It is some of the best voice work I have heard in a game, and spectacular considering that it is an Indie title. 

Besides the voice acting, there are even a few video scenes done in that old time English cartoon way of film and presented in the silent film format. The solid black characters on solid colored backgrounds riding a horse and carriage, or an old Model-T, where you only see the whites of their eyes and teeth. Showing stories being told as they take a trip from one area to another as they are recounted to other characters. There are 3-4 of these and they are an amusing break from the reading. Between these and the voice additions you feel like you get to take some breaks from just reading quite often. 

Besides the presentation being top notch, The 39 Steps has an interesting view into the time period in which this novel takes places (1910's). You are able to click on scenes that give you closer looks at objects where you can read letters, look at objects more closely to give you the more intricate details of their design, and most importantly you can read several newspapers from the time period. These newspapers aren't all fictional either. The relevant articles for the story purposes are highlighted, and can be read from an easier view text form, but there are dozens of interesting historical stories and advertisements from the historical time period. You can find articles on politics, the era's fascination with the new flying “aeroplanes”, and I even spotted an article talking about the aftermath of The Titanic in which passengers had taken them to court trying to retrieve lost belongings from America. 

The 39 Steps offers an intriguing tale in a visual novel format. Professionally made, great design, and quite satisfying. Achievements are simple to get as they are given by following along with the story so it is an easy 100% game. I would recommend this to any adventure fan looking for a casual story experience. I believe you could finish this game in a few hours (My playtime is way off it didn't take nearly that long). Possibly around 5 hours or so if you spend any time reading the many newspaper articles that are presented for you to browse. Hopefully this group makes more classic adventure titles in this format because they have done a superb job with this one!

NOTE: I had never read this novel before playing the game so I cannot tell you how much you might enjoy it if you have. I enjoyed it immensely having not read the book prior to playing the game. I can only assume it would be less enjoyable to someone that has already read the source material beforehand, as it is to me almost every time I watch a film after reading the book first. ;)",1422249573,1422252857,True,151,3,0.871610522270202637,19,False,False,False,False,,,

I like what they are trying to do here, however I did find the mouse gestures pretty much pointless and a waste of time.  I did like the moments of exploring the immediate vicinity for extra information but again not wholly necessary and they were few and far between.

As much as I liked this I do wonder how much I would of enjoyed if I knew nothing about the book.  Taking a step back this is a very shortened version of the story and I feel the some of the gaps could make it uneasy to follow without prior knowledge.

I am still not fully convinced this is a great way to get to know a book. Clearly,  actually getting the intended story and reading is far better but I would like to try this with a book I have no knowledge of and see how it plays out.

And yes, it is a visual novel, if you had any doubts about it, let go of them now. Visual novel, full time.

First, let me hit the up sides, just to get them out of the way. The graphics are gorgeous. Paintings of London, and Scottish landscapes, mountains, tiny villages, all of them absolutely stunning, screenshot worthy to say the least. Once in a while, when one of the characters tells a story, you get a cutscene animated in the cutest, old time cartoon style. Those were really enjoyable, and slightly funny.

Music is delicate, simple and very suitable for the story. Exactly the sort of music you would expect to play in an espionage thriller. 

I am kind of torn on the voice acting. On one hand, can't deny it's pretty much perfect, professional on all aspects. On the other hand... it's theater style acting. Which I'm not a fan of in games. It's over the top, exclaiming shocking findings in a fake, obvious tone and such. I feel theater style voice acting should stay in the theater.

But now... The down sides.

The mechanism for progressing the text is definitely original, if somewhat redundant, and in a while gets really annoying. The necessity of doing little circles with your mouse to progress the game quickly gets boring, and before you know it, you start clicking away, trying to hurry it the hell up. 

Game also bugged out on me a couple of times in pause menu, forcing me to replay whole chapters, clicking even more furiously, as I've already read all this stuff.

But the real pain is... the story. Perhaps the book originally is way better, more detailed, shows more depth and simple logic. But what we see in the game is an extremely far fetched story, where everyone believes everyone for no apparent reason, where people entrust the biggest, life threatening secrets to strangers they barely met, where all a person needs to do, is change their attitude, to suddenly become unrecognisable...

The amount of ridiculousness, lack of logic and pure stupidity of the story, and its main character, were more than I could bear. After a short while I couldn't enjoy the witty cutscenes, gentle music, or lovely landscapes. I just wanted to be over with it, finish this thing... 

If only the graphics, cutscenes, music, and even voice acting were used with a different story, it might have been truly impressive. Perhaps the story requires too much detail to be squeezed into a visual novel, but it didn't work with it, and wasted good resources on something, that ended up being a real pain to get through.",1422058088,1422058088,False,14,1,0.635715246200561523,0,False,False,False,False,,,

That said, it is also not a book.  And therein lies the source of most of the negative Steam comments.  Yes, it is slower than a book, but does that necessarily make it tedious?  I am inclined to say, ""no"".  Today's super-hero immersed, action thrillers, contain so little plot, it could be contained by one written page, maybe half a page.  And yet, they are consistently called, ""fast-paced"".  A painting talks hardly at all, does this mean it does not say anything?  I think a better may to approach this new art, for art it surely is, is to consider it as an interactive-comic-book-movie hybrid.  The reader sets the pace of his exploration.  If one wants to explore the beautiful moorish vistas, he may.  If he wants to read every letter of a simulated 1914 newspaper, he may.  If he simply wants to hurry through to the end, he may do that too, to his own detriment.  The pace is not slow, as much as it is metered.  The interactive-comic-book-movie, or icbm as I shall now so intelligently dub it, can not be completed in an hour, although one could surely read the text in this amount of time.  It slows the pace, to a line, or even a picture, at a time, giving the viewer time to reflect upon the work, and, for me at least, time to become immersed in the story.  Where a Marvel movie might have me bored to tears, and a novel by Dickens might encourage me to speed read past my tedium to my have-done list, I found the icbm totally engrossing for its duration.  Considering its often discounted price, I found it well worth the money.  Currently the price of a comic book or movie rental, it provides about 5 hours of enjoyment.  Not only is it a better bargain for entertainment, it leaves a sense of intellectual satisfaction.  Having bought it as part of a Humble-bundle, it also sated my frugal-pride.  On a side note, while I enjoy Hitchcock as well as film-noir, I could never get myself to appreciate the confusion of his film adaptation.  This version I loved.  It taught me to forget about the movie, and enjoy the icbm.  To finish, I would encourage anyone with an interest in books or art, to check this little number out.

You get to choose in which order certain events are told, and you get to look for information that's clearly there. Also, a superfluous ""mini-game"" where you must do the motions of certain actions with the mouse. Like a clockwise turn for opening a door. Honest.

But, apart from that, it's a really well told story, with gorgeous hand painted scenarios and interesting characters and developments. Of course, the story hook comes from the fact that the... game? adapts a famous novel, but since that's a hard trick to pull off and they do it well, it's a point in their favor. There are a lot of terrible adaptations out there to confirm this. You can see that a lot of love and commitment have been put into making this.

It must be said also, that the 39 Steps is a novel that has a particular old-fashioned flavour: As many works of the same period, it is full of national -British in this case- pride, is filled with not too politically correct stereotypes about foreigners (basically Germans) and can be even funny because of its naivitée in many aspects.

It is more digital adaptation than video-game, playing very much like a click-lite adventure on rails.  That is there are no puzzles and no decision-trees to take you on potentially different paths.  The objective is singluar, to experience all chapters of the story in order to discover the significance of The 39 Steps.  

You take on the role of the protaganist; Richard Hannay who must journey across England and Scotland in order to uncover the significance of The 39 Steps, by uncovering a sinister plot against the leader of another country, while on the run from the law and chased by agents of an unknown group hell-bent on stopping him.

What you can expect to experience is a excellent story told and visualized in a great way using a number of graphical vehicles such as canvas paintings, old projector style moving pictures, newspapers, letters and maps, all crafted by passionate hands.  While I would in no way call it a Triple-A title; art, voice-acting, music and sounds all add to a generally foreboding atmosphere, while encouraging you to continue through each scene.  The voice-acting in particular is wonderfully done, reeling you in to what is a well paced thriller with sporadically placed scenes of action.

The 'game' works as a whole because it transforms the words and pages of the book into visually evocative scenes capturing the essence of the narration.  Really the only interaction is two-fold: a number scenes where the player must examine items to gain more insight into the story and, a few places where the player must draw using the mouse to emulating performing a task.  As you play you gain access to cards which outline important subjects from the book which can be examined whenever you wish.  

Being a fan of the original book and a number of movie adaptations the purchase of The 39 Steps on Steam was a no-brainer.  For someone who doesnt like to read or listen to a story being told and would rather play a video game in the traditional sense, I would urge them to go play something more action-oriented.

Not a video game in the traditional sense, as there are no possible 'Fail' states.

With that said, this is a fantastic retelling of John Buchan's epic novel 'The 39 Steps'. A beautifully-rendered feature, with some good voice acting. You effectively play your way through fictitious events leading up to the Great War. You follow the story of Richard Hanny - who has led a very interesting life, but finds himself in London, bored, with little to do, despite sitting on a pile of money.

Then, events transpire, a murder is committed, and Hannay is framed. Puzzling out the clues left behind by the unfortunate victim, Hanny retraces the poor fellow's steps, and vows to complete what the man alas could not.

What follows is an adventure to rural Scotland, a story of a man on the run, from the law, and from the mysteious 'Black Stone' - an organisation out to stop Hannay by any means necessary!

A really great story, and one that encouraged me to read the book. That - in my opinion - is enough for me to hit that 'Positive' button.

This game isn't for everybody, as it is a slow-burn, with no critical elements to deal with. But if you're fond of interactive novels, this is a must-have.

As it happens, I recorded my playthrough - so do please feel free to have a look for yourself before deciding!

I would play the game in the evening, with the lights dimmed in my living room, using my TV as a display to a PC running SteamOS.  Thanks to the developers for porting this to linux / SteamOS for I would not have had as enjoyable experience sitting so close to my main PC in my computer room.

An early 20th century adventure novel by Scottish author John Buchan. The first of five novels it follows protagonist and narrator [b]Richard Hannay[/b],  an upper class toff, retired officer from her majesty's armed forces and expatriate of South Africa.

Not so much a game but an interactive book with some lovely artwork, you enter the story bored and lonely in London, a man waiting for life to begin again. The basic controls are introduced as you are encouraged to explore each scene. The amount of detail available, through the likes of newspapers and maps, had me entertained for sometime and helps to remind you of the social, economical and political differences between now and what most consider a short time ago,

After the first chapter I began the ""game"" again with my partner and found the experience even more rewarding. We continued on a few more chapters and went to bed. The funny thing is the next day I found myself thinking about Hannay and his predicament and we couldn't resist returning that evening to see what was next.

http://thestorymechanics.com/digital-adaptations/

I bought it out of curiosity when it was on sale. I haven't read the book myself in real life, but I know someone who has and she has practically told me every explicit detail of the book itself. This digital adaption remains true to the original work, while the movies are notorious for taking liberties in every kind of direction.

Each backdrop is a hand painted background. This makes me wonder how long this actual production took to make? Also when you see the list of people's names in the credits at the end, your jaw will drop with the sheer army of people needed in creating it. This therefore makes me question, especially in this day and age, if this style of entertainment and the amount of money which is needed to create and publish it, will honestly be wasted when trying to sell it to the gaming community at large? 

The interaction which is needed to propel the story forward is negligible and while the story has it's moments of suspense here and there, there are still large blocks of moments where nothing much is really happening. The digital adaption will largely play out as an audio book decorated with backdrops, however there are also significant parts which require you, yourself to read or click to skip it entirely. The option to have it all acted out for you is simply not there, which since it most of the time plays out like a movie, I was disappointed that it did not do this all the time.

Most gamers today are conditioned to want constant visual stimuli at high octane speeds, to be entertained every millisecond. This type of production does not do that. Having said that, I still enjoyed it myself as something different. Though they have given birth to a new form of entertainment, this concept while it is still in it's infancy stages it does have a lot of room to grow and mature and it will be interesting to see how this concept flourishes. Might be a worth a look if your into classical literature. Definitely a wait for a sale.

先说好的地方。

游戏画面相当精美，游戏音乐也很到位，特别是语音，是为数不多的冒险类游戏的良心作品，这一点直逼日本GAL。特别是场景的转换，利用多卷轴造成的速度差，可以明显感觉到一个立体的空间。漂浮文字的淡入淡出和过度特效的模糊处理，让人感觉真的很赞。

再说糟糕的地方。

如果作为一款小说游戏，这游戏原著相当多的内容，在很多时候，都是以文字浮空讲故事的形式来一笔带过。不免有些遗憾。

如果作为一款文字AVG（Gal），其中操作系统也过于蛋疼。首先对话不能跳过，如果按enter，那么就会跳过一整段对话或者好几段文字。如果你按鼠标左键，就会出现一个禁止图标，而这个禁止图标，不偏不倚正好覆盖在字幕上。

最让人难受的是，游戏中的特效处理相当的耗时，可以说，一段文字，你用10s来阅读，然后又用5s去等待特效的过度，而且语音部分也相当让人焦躁，为了体现出很好的语音带入感，对话中有很多都是带感情阅读的，而这个信息量，你甚至是5s的时间来阅读文字，然后用10s的时间来等待文字读完，而且你在这个过程中完全不能跳过。

当然，游戏中存在着一些小QTE，虽然没啥时间限制，但是这个QTE很多时候真的有点莫名其妙而且累赘。

对于游戏的搭配，更是让人头疼，有时候甚至会在人物对话中飘出浮空文字，而这个浮空文字是存在于任何地方的，也就是说，你经常看着下方的字幕来理解对话，然后又在画面中上，上左什么的地方飘出一段浮空文字，短时间这么看挺好，但这是一部文字游戏，时间累积长了，真的非常非常累人。

总结一下，这是一款画面异常精美，效果十分到位，但是操作体验感差到爆表的游戏。这更像是一个非常有实力的游戏工作室第一次做的AVG，然后努力的把各种系统穿插在整个游戏中的作品。",1415070748,1415070748,False,27,2,0.703768491744995117,2,False,False,False,False,,,

In The 39 Steps Richard Hannay, the protagonist of the story, learns about an anarchist plot to destabilise Europe and initiate a large war. The setting at the beginning of the story is London in May 1914, so there are spies everywhere even where it is not expected. Hannay has to leave his home in a hurry when he realises that he is about to be framed for murder, or alternatively be murdered himself, and travels to Scotland to hide for a while.

The 39 Steps is not a game; it is a digital adaption of the well-known novel by John Buchan. The “player” makes no real choices in the game, but is instead allowed to uncover the story at his/her own pace. I found that I preferred to go through the story slowly, in order to fully enjoy the combination of the stylish game art and the moodful theme music, even though I found the voice acting sometimes very poor.

The art is really the selling point of this game. A large number of well made digital painting provides the backdrop of the story. These are all made without showing any living humans which provides a certain emptiness to the art. It feels as if life itself has abandoned the world during the build-up before the great war. When people are added to the art, they are only in the form of fuzzy ghostlike outlines adding further to the feeling of desolation. However, when the characters tell stories, they are in the form of quite funny-looking animations similar to clips from silent films.

The 39 Steps is an interactive crime story adapted from a book.

So you might be not challenged clicking through a text adventure, but otherwise everything is well made. The graphics are painted nearby realistic landscapes uncommon to other comic adventures. There are several historical pictures included. The story takes place in 1914, a few weeks before WW1 breaks out. You are searching for a conspirancy that leads to the upcoming events.

There are rarely search screens during the whole story, but sometimes also a nice gesture function is used. Mostly it's very atmospheric. Only the characters are shown as outlined ghosts. I liked the most when somebody was telling yarn. Then an artistical silhouette movie appeared.

There are no animations, except for some story-within-the-story segments presented as a puppet theatre, very entertaining, sadly in short bursts.

Some sound effects help to set the scenes, and the soundtrack is very engrossing and does the most to add thrill to the experience.

Even the characters are not shown; you'll only see static silhouettes. I really didn't like that. Maybe it was meant to not impose an image of the character upon the reader. But combined with the rest of the static experience, it just felt lazy.
Besides, you unlock character cards as extra content viewable in the main menu, and the characters are illustrated there, in full detail. So why not expand it to the rest of the adaptation?

-------

[i]The Thirty-Nine Steps[/i] (the 1915 novel) was important because it was one of the earliest examples of the man-on-the-run thriller. As such, it is held in high regard, and has been the subject of many adaptations in film, radio and theatre.

But let's face it; for today's reader, it's a pretty dull story.

And seeing how this is a digital adaptation of the novel, it's impossible to view the two separately. It's inevitable that you'll experience some boredom due to the source material. So the question now becomes, what does this adaptation add? Does it present the story in a way that enhances the experience? Is it immersive? Does it expand your view of the story's setting and details?

I'd say yes. I read the novel for the first time, right before playing this. And putting aside the vague boredom I felt both times, my understanding and immersion was definitely higher while playing this.

This being England and Scotland, and the 1914 version of both at that, seeing them illustrated before me certainly helped me be transported there, since I'm so separated from the story's setting by both time and space.

Unfamiliar terms and objects now made sense because I could see them (e.g. [i]dovecot[/i]) Certain sequences now played correctly in my mind. Etc.

It could have done more. It could have shown characters in full detail rather than as silhouettes. It doesn't have to become a cartoon, but animations for important actions would have greatly improved the storytelling.

------------

Personally, I would have preferred a completely different way to present this novel. I would love a proper, 3D first person experience of the whole thing, think [i]Dear Esther[/i] or [i]Gone Home[/i]. Even if it was still entirely linear. But I understand how that would be difficult, even impossible (how do you present a linear story if the player can run around London and the moors of Scotland?)

For what this sets out to do, it does a very good job. Not perfect, but a very good job indeed. I look forward to more adaptations from [i]The Story Mechanics[/i] and I hope they improve their formula.",1413124293,1413124504,True,4,0,0.567575275897979736,0,False,False,False,False,,,

텍스트 표시 방식과 줄거리의 흐름에 따라 화면이 변하는 진행 방식이 참신하다. 덕분에 나름 생동감이 느껴지기도 한다. 중간중간 포인트 앤 클릭 형식으로 직접 물건들을 관찰하는 것도 가능하고, 마우스의 드래그 앤 드롭을 활용한 액션도 아주 쪼끔 참신하다. 그럴싸한 2D 배경 속에 포즈 똑같고 표정만 바뀌는 캐릭터들이 떠드는 일본식 비주얼 노벨만 보다가 이런 걸 보니 꽤나 참신하다. 이 쪽은 반대로 사람 얼굴 구경하기가 어렵지만. 게임으로 구현하기 어려운 드라마나 소설 같은 걸 이런 식으로 게임화하면 어떨까 싶다. 혹은 인기 드라마 시리즈의 외전격 이야기를 이런 식으로 풀어 나가는 것도 참 괜찮을 것 같다.

게임 자체는 줄거리의 템포가 꽤나 느린 편이고, 가뜩이나 영어인데 심지어 스코틀랜드 사투리도 빈번하게 나와서 뭘 도저히 알아먹기가 힘들다. 어지간히 영어가 되는 사람이라도 사투리 때문에 게임 이해가 난해할 것으로 보인다. 

그리고 실은, 게임의 줄거리도 별로 재미가 없다. 줄거리 흐름을 끊는 불필요한 부분이 지나치게 많이 보인다. 전후 상황의 개연성도 조금 떨어지고. 덕분에 스킵을 안 쓰면 굉장히 지루해지기도. 이런 노벨류 장르에서 엄청난 비중을 차지하는 ""줄거리""가 재미 없다면, 당연히 게임의 평가도 좋을 수가 없겠지. 게임 자체의 진행 방식은 참신하지만, 정작 가장 중요한 줄거리가 재미가 없기에 나는 비추천을 누른다.

아, 그리고 이 게임의 숨겨진 특징이 한 가지 있는데, 바로 도전과제 따기가 스팀에 존재하는 모든 게임들 중에 가장 쉬운 편이다. 실제로 100% 도전과제 그룹에서 '어떤 게임 도전과제가 제일 쉬웠어요?'란 질문에 가장 많이 보이는 게임이 바로 이 게임이다.",1412769828,1412769828,False,5,0,0.572689831256866455,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This PC version of the story is doing it great justice (I have followed the first 7 chapters of 19 so far). The mood captures the novel perfectly and the location graphics are beautiful and very real. 
What I particularly have loved so far is all the period settings and the newspapers of the time. We are shown newspapers with parts of the story embedded among authentic pages of the day and I have been on a kind of side quest to look up some of the places in the advertisements, such as shops and hotels. It has been very interesting to read advertisements for places such as the Empire Hotel in Buxton (to name just one of many) and then do a google search to find out more, like when it was built, when it closed and what happened to the buildings in subsequent years before demolition. Amazing stories and pictures. A few of these places still exist today, but not many. Britain was a very very different place 100 years ago and we have lost a lot in the process. Gone is the British Empire and what an Empire we had, with the map in an earlier chapter showing this.
The sounds in the scenes are also spot on.

Therefore the game itself hasn't a great deal of anything interactive added to it. 

The real quality added to the story itself is the mode of delivery, because both the visuals (hand painted landscapes) and the overall good voice acting add a value to the game, which otherwise is merely a travel through checkpoints with no chance left to the player. Does this completely make up for the whole game being not truly interactive as one could imagine? No, there are plenty of things (including animations, which are non existent) that could have been done to achieve a better ""vision"" and overall a better implication of the player.

Although I can't really praise the game makers for the story, I can say that it is beautifully exicuted. 

My one complaint is a really daft set of sequences where you need to draw shapes with the mouse in order to make Hannay do things like open doors and windows, or run. They feel awkwardly shoehorned into the game and also make it feel much more like it should have been developed for a touchscreen device.

However, this minor complaint does not take away one jot from the overall experience.

Occasionally, you have to perform some very simple searches of a scene in order to get all the exposition provided.

And then there are the silly mouse movements that you have to follow in order to do things like open doors, make telephone calls, or create explosives.  These consist of following the on-screen instructions and matching your mouse movements to the graphic - up, down, left, right, clockwise circle, counter-clockwise circle.

The graphics are 95% static, the only movement being the occasional smokestack spewing smoke, a flag flapping in the wind, or falling rain.  The artwork is lushly handpainted, not your typical computer game graphics.  There isn't much music, but they do a fine job with the voice acting and a few sound effects.

Even if you take your time and read every word carefully, you can reach the end in 5-6 hours.  There are achievements, but they are for completing chapters.  So if you finish the ""game"", you will get every achievement.

It is 100% impossible to get stuck on this game, because you've got to left click through text or objects (with a big diamond-shaped icon right in the middle of every objects), or simply do a series of left, down, up, right, clockwise or counter-clockwise mouse movements for every single puzzles in the game.

The only part of this game I liked, are the voice acting and graphics, especially the graphics, they are truly amazing! Though, the important aspect of a virtual novel is the story and in the case of ""The 39 Steps"" I didin't understand much of the story, it kinda ruined it for me. Now i've got to say, my first language isn't english, but I really couldn't understand the beginning of the story. I also couldn't understand any british dialogues, because they were all slang. Some parts were also in German, with no translation what-so-ever.

Another complaint about this game, is how the game is saved. The ''chapters'' takes about 15 minutes each, but if you want to alt-tab (probably a bug) or quit the game, you might have or might not have to restart that chapter all over again. This made me replay at least 3 chapters (which, by the way, you cannot skip any text or cutscenes) and effectively made me watch all of the dialogues and cutscenes again.

Occasionally you can inspect scenes to find objects relevant to the story but they have no impact on the story itself.  Nearly all the interaction feels like it was included as an excuse to call this a game rather than simply packaging it as a movie or other form of digital story.

Lets be clear right from the start, this is a faithful adaption of a book, you can't change the outcome, you don't become the main character, and there are no headshot bonuses. So what do you get?

First off each scene is depicted in a beautiful hand-painted style. Given that you lose most of the scene description when you adapt in this manner it's very important that the artwork properly conveys each scene, and they really hit the nail on the head. You get voice acting on at least half of the text, most of the conversations or internal monologues, as well as atmospheric sound effects to add depth to scenes without voice acting. Generally the voices are unique and well done but the ""heavy breathing while a character runs"" was a little off-putting, at least for me. The final piece to the adaptation is the interactivity. Mostly you simply control the pace of the story but scattered through out are more interactive moments. Completing actions by drawing simple gestures with the mouse and selecting various objects of interest out of a scene make up the most of the interaction. While simple, these moments are well placed and definitely help with immersion. The later also lead to how most of the backstory is delivered. When you pick the objects out of the scene it brings up context and filler for the story often accompanied by historical photographs or newspaper clippings that add depth to the world.

As someone who has not read the original text I felt like I got the whole story and it was much smaller time-sink. The balance between reading, listening, and interacting is precise and kept me interested and engaged.

The 39 Steps by The Story Mechanics is the first in what they call ""digital adaptations"", which fall somewhere between a visual novel and a radio show. The idea if simple, but the execution highly stylized and the pacing tightly wound to make what could have been a dry collection of text a surprisingly compelling and intense narrative piece.

I shouldn't have to tell you what The 39 Steps is about (as I imagine most should be familiar with the classic novel and numerous film adaptions and spin-offs), but as a refresher it follows Scottish man Richard Hannay, recently retired and now lost in a series of humdrum days and occurrences. All of this changes when a stranger barges into his life and revels a German plot that if carried out could throw the world into a war the likes of which it had yet seen. Shortly thereafter the man, now revealed to a spy known as Scudder, is found dead in Hannay's apartment, leaving him the only one alive with the knowledge of what is soon to unfold, and the only person who could possibly prevent it.

While the narrative of The 39 Steps is as intriguing and thrilling as ever, it's the way that it's told in this instance that makes it worth revisiting (or checking out for the first time) as opposed to numerous other formats you could choose. The Story Mechanics haven't settled for a simple text format in retelling Josh Buschan's tale, instead using a collection of visual tricks and clever insertion of backstory to create an brilliant interactive story that far exceeds the simplistic adaptations that have been experimented with in the past. Fantastic use of camera angles, deliberate placement of text to draw your eye toward parts of the watercolor backgrounds, and excellent voice acting from all parties make it incredibly easy to get swept away in the plot even during the slower, some may even call mundane, moments.

The only real instances where The 39 Steps falls a tad flat are the awkwardly implemented gestures that sometimes accompany moments like opening doors or reading letters. They were obviously intended to make the game feel more like, well, a game, but they're shoehorned in in such a way that feels tacked on an unnecessary. Thankfully they're infrequent enough that they never amount to more than a bit of a bother nor take but a few seconds to complete.

Though some might scoff at the emphasis on exposition and almost complete lack of traditional gameplay, those that can appreciate The 39 Steps for the bit of interactive fiction it is will be rewarded with an exciting and wonderfully paced tale of spies, murder, and more than a few close shaves. Having no real idea what to expect, I was very pleasantly surprised with the end result of The Story Mechanics's first attempt at a ""digital adaptation"", and it has gotten my mind spinning thinking of so many other books I'd love to see turned into future games. Hopefully this is only the first to come.

As critics might say, ""its a text adventure with background graphics"", I strongly recommend to view some videos and get some information about the game before buying it.

For there is a thrilling espionage plot to discover which speeds up after an hour. Interesting characters to meet along the journey from whom one does not know which side they are on. A hunt that begins at London, moves on to Scotland, to go back to England and has its dramatical final at the high circles of politics in London.

In all, given the the modern interactive novel of this type is mostly newly broken ground, I highly recommend this simply to experience something a little different: a compelling narrative set to beautiful hand-painted visuals, with some very capable voice acting.

Genau wie bei ""Dear Esther"", ist die Umschreibung für dieses [u]-Gaming Experiment-[/u] sehr schwer ...
Was lässt sich im allgemeinen über ""The 39 Steps"" sagen?

Das Game, basierend auf eine Novelle von John Buchan, fesselt einen ab der ersten Minute,
mit einer sehr interessanten Story, wenn man mutig genug ist sich auf diese einzulassen.
Um was es geht, ganz einfach: [spoiler]**SPOILER**[/spoiler], mehr nicht.
(Spoiler = spielt es selbst, traut euch einfach xD)

Man macht eigentlich nicht viel, man klickt hier und dort, untersucht per klick, 
klingt langweilig, ist es nicht!!

Denn was viel wichtiger ist, man soll und muss zuhören, lesen, das gezeigte visualisieren!!

Wieso?!

""The 39 Steps"" überzeugt, mit einem tollem, der Novelle entnommenen, Setting.
Lässt einen in ein London des Jahres 19.. eintauchen und zeigt einem ein sehr tolles Schottland auf 
und schafft durch den grafischen Stil, sehr zu begeistern.

Aber was mir bei weitem mehr gefallen hat, war die extrem gute Vertonung, mit erstklassigen Sprechern.
Vorausgesetzt man ist des englischen mächtig :)
Sie schaffen es mit jedem gesprochenem Wort, die Geschichte lebendig werden zu lassen.

Was auch dem Game entspricht, dass einige Erzählungen, in einem, der damaligen Zeit üblichen Wochenschau gezeigt werden
und somit die Atmosphäre weiter abrundet.

Vielleicht sollte ich erwähnen, dass einem die vorkommenden Personen als Rauchgestalten vorgestellt werden.
das ist nicht blöd, sondern ein sehr guter Trick um sich in die Story einzuarbeiten, ein Teil von ihr zu werden.

Selbstverständlich bekommen die Personen, durch im Game zu sammelnde Karten, später auch ein Gesicht.
Und ich muss zugeben, dass die von mir ausgebauten Personen meist ihren Karten sehr nahe kamen.


Tja, dies ist mein kleiner Einblick zu ""The 39 Steps"" ....
mit abschließender Bewertung .... jedenfalls mir hat ""The 39 Steps"" sehr gut gefallen 
und würde mich über ein weiteres Game von The Story Mechanics freuen.

The music really helps set the mood for each scene and the voice acting is mostly spot on (exactly the right about of cheesy stereotypical early 1900s British accents, but they didn't do their homework well enough for the German ones, I felt). The UI was odd at first, but after a while I realised it was much more involving than just left-clicking all the time.

One word of warning to anyone who expects to be able to be allowed to work on breaking the code that is given to you: once you get the ciphertext, don't play on or the game will just give you the key without any obvious warning that it's going to do so. That was the one thing that I was sure that they would have worked on with this game, which was a tad disappointing.

All in all, good for a few hours of entertainment and bit of a nostalgic kick for me.

Essentially, there are parts where you have to click and drag the mouse up, down, right, or left and in a clockwise and counterclockwise manner.  In addition there is pointing and clicking similar to point and click adventure games but without any puzzles.  This undoubtedly sparks a debate as to is it a game or not?  In my opinion it is, because you do have some interactions and you can miss achievements if you don't try to experience all of the options in the game.  If this lack of gameplay does not sound good to you, I would recommend avoidng this game.

Story - The focus of 39 Steps is the story which is set right before World War I in England and Scotland.  It is a spy thriller, but feels close to Sherlock Holmes in my opinion.  Much like in Dickens, there is a lot of happenstance or good fortune that you don't see in modern stories, but I think that is part of the charm of a story like this.  I love many things set in World War I and appreciate British literature so for me this was a very enjoyable combination.  The story starts a little slow, but once it picks up, it is really good and I had trouble not wanting to play through the whole story as fast as I could to find out what would happen.  There are some thick Scottish accents and a few British words that Americans don't know or use, but overall, if this story sounds at all appealing to you, then you will enjoy the story.

Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - There are a few simple cut scenes, but most of 39 Steps is painted background images with text over top.  Fortunately, these are all very attractive and help you ""see"" the story.  There are also authentic looking maps and pictures from this era of history which was also appreciated.  The sound is really solid and the voice acting is well-done.  Hearing the protagonist pant after running or yawn after waking up makes the story come to life.  For an Indie game, I thought the presentation of the game was very good and it enhances the story.

Overall - The 39 Steps may have limited appeal because of its lack of gameplay and historical setting, but I loved the four hours I played and thought it was totally worth buying on sale.  If you're looking for perfect games, the achievements are very easy to get and only require that you play through the game and look at/inspect every item or option as you go through the story.  It doesn't get any easier or quicker than this.  If you think this game sounds fun or interesting, then I highly recommend buying it because I really enjoyed it.

The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is spot on as well. This is like reading a book, but you interact ingame with a mouse at certain situations and click objects on screen such as newspapers or items of interest. There are also times where you have to imitate real movements with a mouse ( sort of like in Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy if you have played that game).
There are also cards to collect and awards to unlock while playing the game, which is a nice touch for all those people like myself who enjoy collecting things.

В основу игры лег сюжет одноименного романа Джона Бакена ""39 ступеней"", который до этого был не раз экранизирован в кино, в том числе Альфредом Хичкоком. История довольно интересная, несмотря на скомканую концовку, и представляет собой шпионский детектив в лучших его традициях. 
Большую часть геймплейного времени составляет чтение, которое изредка разбавляется вставками для действий (поиск предметов в помещении, рисование стрелок для открытия замков и прочие простейшие действия).
Радует художественное оформление - иллюстраторы постарались на славу и смогли создать отличный визуальный ряд, который гармонично дополняет чтение.
Также порадовало озвучивание диалогов - прекрасная передача английского и шотландского акцентов.
Подводя итоги: игра явно на любителя, но я не могу дать ей отрицательную рекомендацию, так как разработчики выполнили все на должном уровне. Если вы не знаете английского и/или не любите читать, то вам не стоит брать эту игру. Если же вы с английским на ""ты"" и не прочь разбавить свой игровой опыт подобным произведением, то, возможно, вам стоит обратить внимание на The 39 Steps.

That aside the scenes in this are gorgeous and immersive MOST OF THE TIME.

They've taken a good book, and turned it into a great experience.  From the beginning straight through to the end the player is grabbed by the collar and pulled into the world and lot of Richard Hannay.  

The 39 Steps is recommended to anybody who likes adventure games, but also loves a good story.  The latter being important as there is not much in terms of 'gameplay' in this experience, rather the player is providing a helping hand in forwarding the story at their own pace.

An excellent example of how a book can be turned into an interactive experience.  An experience that should not be missed.",1391900814,1391900814,True,6,0,0.568702280521392822,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you've played any, this game is probably most like playing Visual Novels, except the story is on a set course and there are no choices to be made. Instead interactivity comes from other places: You preform certain actions that have no real impact on the story, and get to choose exactly how deep you get into details and backstories. 
If that sounds a bit boring, it's really is a lot more like reading a book than playing a video game based on one, and I suggest you approach it as such.  

Visually, it's very impressive. The text is accompanied by beautiful backgrounds mixed with old photographs and very fun animations, directed in such a way that really makes the text dance.

Fair warning though, this game is quite obviously really aimed for touch devices, the mechanics would work a lot better there than on PC, and it lacks real customization options, so if you have the option go play it on one of those, if you don't it won't bother you too much though.

All in all, I'm definitely looking forward to their next work. This is a very unique and new way to experience books, so if you like reading I'd definitely check this one out. If you don't, keep in mind that this is not a video game in the traditional sense, and this might not be for you.

You are Richard Hannay who has been framed for murder and are now on the run. You are being chased by a group called the Black Stone because you know their secret. It’s your job to expose them.

I thought the story was decent and somewhat thrilling but I would tend to fall asleep playing the game. There isn’t much interaction except for periodically clicking the mouse button and some small gestures once in a while. Most of the time you are reading words placed over some nicely drawn scenery with some small spoken dialog sections which is well done. 

You could probably finish the game in one sitting if you are able to stay awake the whole time. I’ve played a few other VN games so I know they aren’t like your typical game, but this one was just not exciting or very interesting. There are some cards and awards to collect but those are pretty much standard unlocks by playing the game. Nothing special to them at all.

I can’t really recommend this game unless you are a diehard VN person or really, really love espionage stories.

You have a story about running, disguises, lying, code books, and you don't let the player do anything with any of those? Come on now. When They Cry works because it's essentially observational and relationally complex (and even then, I'd hesitate to recommend them idly). 39 Steps is an espoinage thriller, flat out. Our protagonist is driving the action, and the action is fairly active. This is not a thoughtful story, this is not an explorational story about human nature, it's a man-on-the-run tale.

Pros:

1. Interesting Story

2. Suspenseful Music

3. Good Voice Actors

4. The game is based on a real book

5. Good art

Wobei ""Erfahrung"" hier besser passt, als die Bezeichnung ""Spiel"", denn das ist The 39 Steps nicht.

The 39 Steps ist eine so genannte ""Visual Novel"", also eigentlich die digitalisierte Form des gleichnamigen Buches. Die meiste Zeit ist man also nur am lesen bzw. zuhören -die Sprecher sind wirklich spitze, das Ganze wurde mit viel Liebe zum Detail umgesetzt-. An dieser Stelle eine Warnung: Wer der englischen Sprache nicht mächtig ist, wird mit The 39 Steps keine Freude haben, da sowohl die Sprecher, als auch Texte und Untertitel NUR in englisch verfügbar sind. Die Unterschiedlichen Akzente machen das Verstehen nicht grade einfacher. Zusätzlich wird das Geschehen durch stilechte Stummfilme aufgelockert und hin und wieder darf man selbst aktiv werden... das beläuft sich meist jedoch nur auf einfaches Klicken mit der Maus, hin und wieder muss man auch bestimmte Bewegungen mit der Maus nachmachen, aber nichts wirklich relevantes... Auch die Hintergründe sind echt schön anzusehen (die Screenshots auf der Shopseite vermitteln schon einen recht guten Eindruck, wie das Ganze aussieht).

Die Story ist auch wirklich spannend, verraten möchte ich aber nichts, da die Story nunmal den Hauptanteil des ""Spiels"" ausmacht. Die Dauer beträgt gut 4 Stunden, insgesamt gibt es 19 Kapitel, die je ca. 10-15 Minuten dauern. Zusätzlich zu der Kapitelauswahl, kann man sich auch jederzeit ""Lesezeichen"" setzen, mit denen man jederzeit ab einer ganz bestimmten Stelle fortfahren/wiederholen kann.

Das einzig Negative, was ich anzumerken habe, sind Soundbugs, die bei mir etwa 3-4 Mal während eines Playthroughs auftraten. Dabei hat sich entweder die Musik immer wiederholt, oder ein Sprecher hat einen Satz mehrmals wiederholt. Insgesamt aber nichts allzu schlimmes.

Die Achievements kriegt man übrigens auch alle beim ""durchspielen"".

And even for those games that have short/moderate game completion time, some of these games you just have to play at least couple hours in one sitting.  So, this is where I think this game shine, 19 chapters, each chapter is under 20 minutes.  And I managed to finish a chapter everyday, and also get a Steam achievement everyday, one of the reasons I like this game. 

This is probably the first and only digital novel I've finished playing.  I personally don't think I like the story itself all that much(I don't think I dislike it too), but I like every little things in the game, like the main theme music of the game, the voice acting(which is superb I think), and all the artwork of it.

If you are like me who are too lazy to read books, and feels guilty of never really do much actual reading; perhaps, this game will help.  I'm looking forward to the next game like this by the same developer.

For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the story. I would sit down and play one of the 20 or so ""chapters"" at a time. Having them broken down into 10-15 minute chunks like this helped and allowed me to play at my own pace.  The art is very well done, though there is really no actual animation. The voice acting is well done and the ambient sounds and music are a plus.

Being that the story is set prior to WWI (and that I'm American and this is set in the U.K.), some of the dialects and terminology were a bit tricky to follow, but not so much that it detracted form the story itself. Other than that, my only real complaint is that the ending seems somewhat . . . abrupt.

That being said - it's not ""bad"" by any means. For what it is, it's incredibly well done, and a means in which I would love to continue consume various forms of classical fiction.

Based on the original espionage thriller ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan, you can definitely see where modern day spy stories came from - predating popular fictional characters like James Bond by at least 30 years. This story takes place on the verge of WWI and introduces a character named Richard Hanny, a man on the run after a young American spy divulges sensitive information to him. The game is presented mostly in beautifully painted backdrops, fuzzy silhouettes and the occasional shadow puppet show (of which are quite entertaining). These backgrounds take you from inner-city London, to the moors of Scotland and back again. There isn't much gameplay to be had (to my slight disappointment), but what is present is likened to that of a game like ""TRAUMA"" - drawing shapes and clicking on things to carry through the cutscene-like chapters.

Simply put - the game is awesome for what it is - but it really needs a bit more interactivity. There is one part that involves the character decoding a notebook. I got really excited, thinking that I'd at least have a mini-game or a puzzle to figure out the code, but alas - the game just carries on like the book.

HA!

cough, so yeah it's an adaption of something constantly adapted. there ain't much here to dissect besides the story and literary analysis ain't really my thing unless I'm impressed. so let's just go with a classic: the game is fun. awww yea boy you know what that means. it's a regular good game that's what. what we got, what we got, we got some painted scenery. gog DANG have you seen the artwork. it's bleeding brilliant, it spills all over the screen. the attention to detail is always impeccable. and that doesn't just sit with the art! the writing is mindful of the time while adeptly conveying background without awkwardly hamfisting the narration. the segways and different menus that pop in and out while you're playing to convey different information is delightful. also those newspapers, the freaking perfectly accurate newspapers. man I could write paragraphs on those newspapers

the newspapers are not only written in the language of the time but they always include timely articles and adver

yeah just kidding about writing paragraphs on the newspapers. but they're representational of the game's quality if anything. the game also delivers in sound. we got your moody soundtrack, we got your professional sound effects, and seriously the voice acting is amazing. hannay just popped, ""DEAR GOD"" to quote my favorite line. what, that's not really a line? gameplay involves moving forward to the next page and then reading it. le hurrdurr not a game, but wait! you get to click and interact with things! the silliest moments in the game are like OPEN THIS DOORKNOB BY DRAWING ARROWS and SERVE DRINKS BY DRAWING ARROWS basically you get to do things by drawing arrows. sometimes you get to investigate things too, but it's all so clearly marked the discovery part is soiled. they didn't want you to miss any of their precious story which is just as well

so the story? well, it rips. it ain't nothin more than a blockbuster (granted one that's nearly a hundred years old), but I'm still turning the final sequence around in my head. hannay is a proper action hero in all meanings of that phrase. if you like reading with your vidya, are interested in new and exciting directions for the medium, or are just in the mood for some good 'ole storytelling, I say play this game. it ain't a heartsopper but man is it exciting.",1386209388,1387177922,True,7,0,0.600514054298400879,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The texts are not the best, not nearly enough to create immersion. Not only that they are short, this being because they needed small paragraphs for a more fluent reading, while listening to the effects, and watching the very basic animation. These paragraphs are just not good literarywize. I haven't read the original novel, so I cannot say wether it's anywhere near the original text, but I do not belive it to be so.
The charachters are not really portrayed visually except in collectible cards outside the main campaighn, inside they are mere specters that appear only during dialogue sequences. Although the audio effects, the voice acting and the music are fine, they alone are not enough to bring the story to life.

I did like the news papers that were used in the game, I'm not sure wether they are authentic, having a national library in the credits raises this possibility, but they convey the feeling of the era. I'd wish there were more details like that, things that brought that time more to life.

So... if not a game, what is it? A ""Digital Adaptation"" is what it calls itself. It's essencially an adaptation of a book into a more visual format, with a little more interactivity. 
I've got to say, I'd rather read a book most of the time, than ""playing"" one, unless there's something to take from it that I wouldn't from a book. Well, in regards to that, this is a much shorter form of a book, focusing on the essential only, and at the same time, giving some additional insight into the story's time and world through journals and such, for those interested... and, again, not a game. 
I usually play games for more interactivity than this has given me, at specially choice and consequence, which is something that I can't really get from a book, and which this still doesn't provide. 
So, all things considered, I don't think it surpasses a book for those who tolerate/like reading. 
BUT, it was still really well done (for what it was), and I'd say it was a totally positive experience, with lots of potential for the future. The story was really interesting (although the pacing was too slow, at times), and the whole art design helped a great deal, it was highly stylised, in a good way.
For the developing team: I'd love to see this done with a ""Choose your adventure"" type of book, I think that would be the format where it would shine! Maybe do some research into old Text VideoGames and try to adapt them as well. Who knows? But experimenting is the way to go, and, for the first ""Digital Adaptation"", I think it was pretty good. I'll follow you closely and see what else you can provide.
Oh, and also, a little bit more exploration, maybe with Diary Pages or Audio Logs spread throughout the places one can explore to provide more information about the story and the era it's set in.
Bottom-line: Not a game, still not quite as content-full as a book, but a nice experience overall, with fitting Music and Art Style. I'm interested to see where it goes! If you think you'll take some enjoyment out of something like this, go ahead and buy it, it's pretty good!",1385758737,1385758737,True,2,0,0.483141064643859863,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But the way this 'game' has been executed is done in a terrific way. 

I was actually talking with my girlfriend about how I'd love to read books like this, with beautiful high res pictures and dynamic text in it, and the voices recorded like you're listening to an audio book, with each person doing his/her part instead of just one and the same person.

So, basically, this is an interactive novel. Reading this novel should take you anywhere between 3 or 4 hours. Short enough to keep you interested and long enough to tell you its story.

One thing I didn't care for was the fact that there are a few Scottish conversations in it, sometimes being spoken with a certain accent. It was hard to follow at times, so it would've been nice if there were extra subtitles for those parts. I really had to concentrate to understand it. It's the only flaw I can think of, so if you're an avid reader you might want to give this a read.
