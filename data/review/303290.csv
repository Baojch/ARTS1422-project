Por un lado, mi ruta favorita ha sido la de Caramia, me parece simplemente una greenflag con patas; la ruta de Kyrie me perturbaba por momentos ya que es un sádico; la ruta de Axel me ha gustado porque él es increíblemente mono, aunque por momentos se me hacía un poco lenta. Los triángulos amorosos me han gustado, aunque a veces sentía que los problemas que surgen para que quieras cambiarte de pareja son un poco forzados, sobre todo los de Caramia. Fuera de la familia Oz, me ha gustado mucho la ruta de Caesar aunque es un poco corta para mi gusto, hubiera preferido más desarrollo; la ruta de Sho me gustó mucho también, probablemente la ruta con mayor misticismo de todo el juego; la ruta de Scarlet la adoré por la trama pero me perturbaba que fuera un niño, como que parece que tiene 13 años, ojalá el personaje fuera más adulto la verdad; la ruta de Pashet no fue lo que esperaba, creía que sería un bonito romance entre dos chicas pero es una ruta llena de una hermosa amistad entre ella y la protagonista, la verdad no me molesta que la ruta sea así pero hubiera sido bonito un romance; la ruta de Robin Hood no me ha gustado, si bien el personaje se ve super bien físicamente es un señor atado a un pasado y lleno de traumas, no es que eso esté mal pero no creo que haya suficiente desarrollo como para justificar el romance con la protagonista; la ruta del brothel es...algo diferente a lo que solemos ver en los otomes, y tengo sentimientos encontrados, si bien el final bueno me gustó el final malo me traumatizó de por vida. Para finalizar con las rutas, la ruta oculta, por así decirlo, me gustó pero apenas comparten tiempo la protagonista y el nuevo interés romántico, lo que la convierte en una de las rutas más apresuradas del juego. 

Por último, no me ha gustado mucho el desenlace común del juego, tras acabar con todas las rutas y alcanzar como mínimo el 98% del juego puedes jugar el final de la historia común donde ningún romance se desarrolló, y si bien lo amé porque vi otro lado de Kyrie que me hizo amar al personaje en cierta medida, creo que el misterio alrededor de la protagonista no es suficiente, vengo a decir yo sabía quién era ella desde el principio y la resolución que le dan me pareció floja y un poco desconectada del resto del juego.

The oz brothers, Scarlet, Pashet, Ceasar, Soh, and Hamelin are generally safe routes with very little graphic things. However, the brothel and Dr Robin Hood have some graphic and/or concerning things that can be jarring compared to the lighthearted (fairy tale-like, one might say) feel of some of the other routes. Although the premise is a town ruled by the fairy tale mafia families so I guess it should not be as surprising that there are some very dark moments as I found it.

Spoiler warning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The game plot is really interesting because in every route, you only get a little bit of the real plot of the story, and which one you see depends on the ending. Beautiful art work and good music

Now the character:

Caramia: 
The Don of the Oz family and part-time cook. He was kind of not what I expected. He is nice and charming, but it left a lot to be desired. 5/10 because it didn't have the lovey-dovey that I expected.

Kyrie:
He was HELLA MEAN. Offf, honestly, I was mad at him at times, and then he turns around and says something nice. I just wanted to strangle this dude. But his endings were sweet, not gonna lie, 7/10 because I was pissed off most of the time.
The Grand finale made me sad :((( +1 point. 8/10.

Axel: 
Such a cutie! He is so nice and sweet that I got diabetes from him (in a good way). One of the endings made me a bit sad, but it was still really good. 10/10 best boi Axey. You can depend on this man but a bit clingy. 

Pashet:
Don of the Boots family NOT A YURI ROUTE! I liked it; it's more of a best friend or girl boss thing. We still have a little bit of love sprinkled in there, but not too much. 6/10 because it is good, but not that good, and SPOILER! She was going after my best boi. :(

Scarlet:
Stand in Don of the Grimm family. Matrue, but at the same time, he has an inferiority complex about his height. A good stroy, but if you think you get a kiss scene with him, then forget it. Honestly, we did a lot more with the others, if you know what I mean, and we did not get anything from him. 6.7/10 because, come on, at least give us a kiss scene or something like that.

Ceasar:
Don of the Wolf Gang (kind of) Man is drawn hot, but thats about the only thing you get with him. I was so hyped about his route, but it left me a bit disappointed. Going Prey, I'm going to kill you. Prey, I will rip you to pieces. Like come on, I was hoping we could go on a date or something. After a while, that will happen, but it was a bit too short, in my opinion. 7.8/10 because damn, he looks good.
 
Brothel: 
On this route, I was SCREAMING. Like what the actual fuck is happening here. How and why are these the only options that we have in this situation, What the hell? My mouth was open the whole time when I was playing this. 3/10, and I am being generous here just because of Manboy. Hella graphic.

Robin Hood:
He was not bad, but I didn't like him that much. You might be wondering why, ah, yes, because SPOILER! He is still keeping his half-dead wife in a casket-like thing. Bro, wtf, move on. And he still had the audacity to sleep with us. 5/10. I don't like him, but it's not as bad as Dorian Gray.

Soh:
He was fun and sweet, and then you see the grand finale and think, Wow, did you really have to do that? His endings confused me, but when I read the epilogue, I understood what was going on. Because man is a dog (literally). 8/10. I still like him, but he should have just stayed nice the whole time.

Hamlin:
Former Don of the Grimm Family UFFF You will hate him if you see him on another route, but damn, he stole my heart. He was soooo cuteee. I wish his route was longer. He really deserves better; even his endings suck for him and what he had to live through just because he wanted peace. 9.8/10 best boi beside Axel, a good rival. I loved him honestly.

So after getting to 99%, you will be able to see the grand finale, and honestly, it's kind of bittersweet, which made me tear up a bit. 9/10 because she and Scarecrow deserved better. :,( 
I recommend it, but it's not the best game. It's a bit overpriced, but I bought it when it was half off, so maybe you should do that too. Well, everything I mentioned here was MY OPINION so take it with a grain of salt. Good Day!

I kept with it because just need something to distract me during a week I have to heal from an injury and always wanted to play the game after seeing that some people loved it. Also I kept waiting for the quality of story to improve, and by the time it hit me they weren't going to I felt too deep. 

What I liked: Pretty. Fun character design. Some unexpected and wild routes. Like the brothel one THAT was over the top and ridiculous, loved it.

What I didn't like: 
-None of the routes are particularly satisfying from a romance or story point of view, especially not the major ones. 

- The melodramatic Maximilism that makes the brothel route so fun isn't on display 90% of the rest of the time which is tragic, since it's a very melodramatic story and idea. I just felt like ""....okay."" 

- a lot feels like a massive slog

-The routes or chosen romances etc have no bearing on how the end plays out or the big picture. 

-The main chara is not very smart and is constantly reminded of this by many of the relationship targets. She puts up with a lot of abuse with a smile.

- speaking of abuse, there's some noncon played as romance in a way that's especially disturbing on one route that I'm still trying to wrap my head around, and I'm fully conversant in the quirks of Japanese romance tales, especially older ones. Despite that this felt ESPECIALLY very wrong. 

- Super choppy feeling at moments, and that gets worse into the endings who don't feel connected to all that went before

Big resounding MEH with a side of WTF for a lot of points. Not worth the time investment for me, and I have a lot of tolerance for big over the top crazy romance; this actually needed more insanity to be closer to enjoyable, either in the love stories or just in the world and execution.

BEAUTIFUL ART! <3 Satoi sensei unproblematic and best artist in otoge imho!
(You might have heard of diabolik Lovers. - Anime ""bad/fanservice"" games ""gud"".)

Nice story, felt a little repetetive at times. At least for some main cast.
That said: I still need to finish all routes!
Sad that there's no achievements. (But cards.)
Music is good and didn't get on my nerves after playing for a long time.

There's MANY routes and characters you're in for a long run and many nice characters!
It's cute that it took inspiration from the wizard of Oz.
It's made me smile quite often.
(Green haired characters outta the window. lol)

Recommended! <3
Will update if I finish all the routes. :D

(On that note: Can we PLEASE get DiaLovers on steam? :3)

To those who were like this is ""problematic"" it is a MAFIA themed game! What did you expect? O.o It has death, bad guys and typical otome elements where I'd kick them in the shins in real life. This is a game. It has routes you needn't play. It has MAFIA themes and guns. Hory sheet. :V

Le jeu est plutôt agréable à jouer, cet otome game possède plusieurs qualités que la plupart des jeux de ce style n'ont pas :
- Il y a beaucoup, beaucoup de personnages qui possèdent une route avec plusieurs fins.
- Etrange, mais original, vous pouvez décider de changer de route sur certains personnages ( il y a des versus à certains moments de l'histoire qui nous laisse le choix de changer de personnages alors que étions déjà entrain de sortir avec l'un des personnages, le jeu nous laisse le choix de sortir avec autre. )

Certains artworks sont très jolis, notamment les personnages. Néanmoins, les décors qui ne sont pas souvent utilisé sont affreux... Surtout qu'il y a un effet "" fresque "" par dessus l'écran. Vous pouvez trouver ça joli, mais quand le décor est déjà hideux, ça n'arrange rien.
Mis à part pour la vraie fin du jeu, il n'y aucun développement de l'histoire, le protagoniste s'en ficherait presque d'être amnésique. D'ailleurs il s'agirait, je pense, du protagoniste le plus débile que je n'ai jamais vu. ( Ce que je trouve personnellement hilarant. )

Certaines fins sont extrêmement difficile à obtenir car rien d'indique ou laisse envisager qu'il faudrait faire tel ou tel choix pour avoir une illustration. Même avec une soluce, il reste compliquer de toutes les obtenir. Par ailleurs, elles sont très jolies mais je trouve qu'elles se ressemblent énormément ce qui est dommage.

伏笔铺垫回收，フーカ、索和凯撒的真实身份一并揭露，有刀也有感动，本作我最满意的一条线。

-I bought this game & initially gained interest bc I instantly noticed Satoi's distinct style as I am a longtime fan of the Diabolik Lovers series. That being said!! Personally I lean more toward horror/psychological side plots and themes, making parts of this game idea for what I look for in the series.

-The play style is incredibly,,,unique. Let's go with that. I think the concept of the love triangle routes is awesome but maybe not ideal if you are trying to get to the meat of the story. Most of it feels like fluff outside of the pure turmoil some of those side paths in Kyrie's route put you through. Points for creativity but I'm not the biggest fan since it can be confusing, especially to newer otome gamers. Sincerest apologies to those who played this as their first lol. 

-I really love the overall storyline and concept! The side characters are so lovable. 

-My personal favorite routes were Kyrie, Scarlet, Sou, and the Brothel Route. Unpopular opinion on that last one, I know, but the writing is just *chef's kiss*. It's so true to the disturbing feeling that Dorian Grey's source material creates.

-Alfani is my favorite character, yall can be mad about it! Scarlet and Kyrie are runner-ups. I find Axel, on the other hand, to be insufferable but hey that's just me. I never really like the megane types. 

-Main low point in the game for me is the music being realllyyy repetitive and never really striking me if I'm honest. The limited music variety can make scenes feel awkward or not properly set at times. If this bothers you, of course, you can always turn music off. Just a picky point. 

I think I'd give it a 7/10 for ingenuity and creativity. It's worth giving a shot and has a lot of the elements of old school otome gaming I can appreciate. If I could go back and do anything different I think I would have bought this for PS Vita rather than PC just for ease of access and because of how frequently you need to save to get all the CGs and whatnot. If only the vita store were still open, huh? The ending made me cry a little. Most games have that effect after I spend about a year slowly working my way through em.

The ending didn't have to be a 'happy ending', but most of them are just kinda-Meh or have me saying 'Is that it?' and looking up a walk through to see if I got the 'bad' endings (Or it the game glitched and took me to the end screen).

i mean first off, theres Kyrie, who i ABSOLUTELY despise because of his awful personality. maybe ill force my way through his route someday but he constantly talks about either killing us ( despite being in the same familia)  or ... hinting at doing inappropriate stuff, as well as trying to pursue us even when we are in a relationship in some routes. his character is awful and honestly ruins 60% of the dialogue and game for me.

while i love the cliches and love a mc who is sweet and aloof at times.. THIS ONE IS SO DUMB. the MOST you can get of her standing up for herself is an option that says ""Be annoyed"" at a remark the familia says towards her.. BUT THATS IT. if you want a character who is sweet, cute, aloof, but can still make her own decisions and show a form of personality.. this one is not it. 

overall, i love the art and designs and the music. i think those three factors truly make the game as great as it is! but if youre looking for characters with personalities and backstories that make you want to learn more, this game just doesnt  make you feel that way. you finish a route, and then move on giving little to no thought.",1678567372,1678567470,True,4,1,0.54048842191696167,0,True,False,False,True,,,

What i did not like about the game is that Hamelin's route was pretty rushed and lacked the romance a bit. He should have been the ""locked route"" of the game and get more screentime as a good guy and not villain.

It sucks that you can't romance Pashet because you eventually find out that she likes Axel so that was underwhelming for me :( Robin's route made me feel a bit uncomfy despite him being like the prettiest one of them all because it felt like NTR ngl..And for the brothel route, I did not expect it at all it was so explicit in writing, the CGs were suggestive but it's nothing too NSFW, it's not that obvious.

We get saved by strangers and while trying to introduce ourselves we notice we have amnesia (and maybe even lost personality cuz honestly this game is a bit outdated with the small, helpless girl next door).

pros;
- stunning visuals. i am really in awe with this artstyle even tho the game was made in 2013
- beautiful japanese voice acting (main character excluded ofc). the more you progress with the story the more inconsistent the voice acting gets sadly. it still happens a lot.. it just sometimes randomly stops
- a little repetitive music but the sound effects for objects were fitting (a moving chair, something being thrown, steps when someone is walking, ...)
- all of the guys had their charms when you are able to not take them too seriously. even the other characters were extremly unique and therefore amusing
- i really enjoyed the style of writing (third person and main character excluded *cough cough*)

neutral;
- in my opinion they could have included more routes (and achievements) but they give you a variety of endings tbf
- I was about to say that Axel was the most relatable since he didn't trust the main character blindly.. but.. ""If the don ordered me to marry you, I would obey. ... Understand?"" No, I really don't?!?!?! Q_Q
- also the irony when Axel reminded Gretel his name is Axel (instead of robot) but he keeps calling the main character ""guest"" :')
- love how no one cared to fill the main character in when she said ""us girls"" while actually adressing a guy
- not Hansel saying ""So, I'm curious... Can you actually speak for yourself without being prompted?"" Why even write her like that if you are just going to make fun of it ahhhh

cons;
- this game doesn't look like it was made for the pc. fullscreen is hella blurry for me
- i am not enitrely sure why the main character isn't bothered with this (i highly doubt she even got it) but they literally checked her body for a mark while she was passed out
- the main character is really nice but sounds a bit like a npc. constantly repeating certain phrases someone else said and kinda unbothered when people are being rude and ofc she's absolutely naive. a little quote about her: ""I mean, you lied about it at first because you wanted to hide it, but now you're spilling your guts to me... and I'm someone you've only just met.""
- since it's written in third-person it made it even harder for me to relate to the main character. i really don't understand why anyone would want to date her but hey, who am I to judge

The Dorian Gray route is the most controversial. Minor Spoilers, Dorian Gray route takes place mostly in brothel. You willing go, you're not sold or something akin. You do become addicted to what happens at a brothel. It's a fun route, but it might be too much for some.

去脑可食，我说的是屏幕外玩家的脑

美术：感觉画师钱没给够，杂线有点多，很明显偷懒想少画点cg，但是体感不细看是可以一玩的，精度是魔鬼恋人降低一档

剧情：目前看来是弱智，太弱智了，无力吐槽

公认雷点（NTR、3P之类）：长得都挺好看的，没有特别让我真情实感的，所以我觉得我可以，我都可以，不如说有什么线可以全泡的吗

=============

OzMafia通了于是说一句：有点拉，让我花钱我是不愿意的。

一是连全配音都没有，呃呃呃，你原价一百…你本子本来就一般，画面也不是最精美的，还没有全配音，配这个价格吗你…

二是剧本幼稚。真的很幼稚…这剧情纯是小孩子过家家啊？哪有敌对势力笑嘻嘻登门扔炸弹，事后当家的带人来滑跪，完了惩罚是什么跑腿扫大街，给对方花销掏钱之类的？你们这些黑手党，是来保护世界和平的？

三是美术好中带糙。画师是画魔鬼恋人的，画风一眼可辨，但是精度真是天差地别啊！个人感觉比魔鬼恋人的立绘、CG精度低了一个半档次。一些特写一看就没有好好画诶！到底给画师什么价格啊！指甲都画歪来真是笑死人了…头发上面杂线非常明显，有时候会有比较明显的人体崩坏，甚至有的地方没有CG，只有半屏幕特写来以假乱真。

简单来说：穷！按道理来说，一百一份的游戏，没有全语音，那画面得好点吧？看起来也没给美术这方面拨多少钱。全语音没有，画面也一般，那本子得有深度吧？本子像刚出道的小说家练笔作一样肤浅。你们这白花花的钞票是花到哪里去了啊？

四是感情线问题。重中之重的问题，前面都能忍，毕竟也有不少日乙是这样的。只有这个，堪称乙女里的一朵奇葩。

简单来说就是很突兀的NTR。

NTR！也不是不能接受，如果剧情安排得当合理的话，角色的选择改变能理解。但是不能说服玩家的话就是不可原谅的了。

你说二人共线这也不是很少见，呃，但是俩情侣都表白了定情了，事后被人撩拨一下就说其实不是真爱跟谁都无所谓啦然后就美美换对象了是什么操作啊…前后没超过两章诶…是想教导玩家“纸片人没有真爱”然后投入现实吗…好狡猾啊…

加之个人CG一条个人线1v1是拿不完的，必须得当一把黄毛（ntr名词）才能拿全，这就意味着——想拿到一个我推的全CG，必须要先推一遍我推纯爱线（有另外一个角色虎视眈眈随时可能抢人）看我推和别人搞一波雄竞，再打一遍（两遍）其他角色的移情别恋线，前期和其他男主搞对象，后期换对象到我推——如果策划确实要这么搞，为什么要把前面的剧情写得那么纯情啊！前面那些感情的流露都是演的？或者在其他地方女主对其他人其实也这样？好像骗一般纯爱玩家进来杀似的！看不起专偶人是吧！就算要搞取向开放的，普世道德还是相对赞同专偶的（抛开性资源之类的严肃话题不谈），这样当螃蟹趴开走路，路走窄了呃。

说到底，你他娘的一个童话背景题材，不让玩家追求童话一般一生一世永不变心的纯爱，反而乐颠颠地跑去搞三角恋：要是我需要这种剧情为什么要来玩你游…不是，哪有人需要这种啊！

平心而论，几男争一女的游戏还不少见吗？看看人家兄弟战争？看看人家魔鬼恋人2？哪有被骂成你这样的？人家也不搞告白后换对象这烂活倒是。在我看来，告白后换对象就有点像在告诉一般普通玩家：女主其实没那么爱这个人，换个人也行，你（玩家）喜欢的角色根本不是独一无二的。打个游戏，乙女游戏，不让我脱离尘世纷扰，放松身心，享受纯粹的感情，或者因为剧情伤情到痛哭发泄，反而要狠狠打我的思想观念一巴掌，这谁不生气啊…

何况我还要为这一巴掌花100块钱（打折50）。

就我目前玩到的剧情里面，前有苦主痛苦地说你跟我不会幸福不如去跟黄毛吧我是废物你跟他过比较好，后有黄毛说没事你先跟我在一起，感情是可以培养的，再然后女主就真答应了，让推倒让摸让抱的，好吧，你这ntr剧情挺丰富，有点没想到哈…

个人而言NTR其实无所谓。主要是很扯啊。第二点加上第四点让这个“创新”变得非常致命，喜欢的人和不喜欢的人根本没法互相和解。NTR的要素没有让这个故事变得深刻，变得现实，反而让这个故事更加丧失逻辑，所有人都丧失逻辑，都沉浸在一种莫名的愚蠢的爱欲中，毁掉了这个故事最后的一点点好处。

它不配我为之花100块，真的。也不值得任何人花这100块来找不痛快，如果你不是那么喜欢ntr并且不会奔着ntr来的话。就算半价50也不值。",1669184085,1669230873,True,23,1,0.762687504291534424,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Some of the routes seem like normal, funny otome game routes, while others are either boring or disturbing.  
- The main character is probably the worst ""ignorant of the world and incapable of taking care of herself"" type of character I have ever seen. The only thing this girl can do is laundry. She can't cook or fight or sing well or do any job or talent. When characters insult her, it's kind of like ""Well, can't argue with you there. She really can't be trusted to do anything.""

- The audio is very bizarre. Within scenes, dialogue cuts in and out of being voiced or un-voiced. I would have preferred those scenes to not be voiced at all over the weird hybrid version. 
- I did not like being forced to play the brothel route or the love triangle routes to finish the game, I wish there was an option to skip those. 
- The game is very long and some of the routes dragged on.

Indo direto ao ponto: o jogo em si não é exatamente uma obra prima dos deuses, mas não vou dizer que é um jogo ruim, também. Ele tem seus pontos positivos e seus pontos negativos como qualquer jogo. Pessoalmente falando, é um jogo que me entretém bastante (acho um jogo gostoso pra passar o tempo). O plot em si é uma salada de temas que são um tanto comuns de se verem jogos do gênero sendo produzidos (máfia, contos de fada... é basicamente um combo desses dois). Alguns personagens têm aqueles arquétipos clássicos que, se você assiste anime (ou lê mangás) ou já jogou dating sims japoneses, vai identificar meio fácil. O jogo tem . . . MUUUUITAS rotas. E se você pega pelo menos um final de cada, você desbloqueia o Grand Finale do jogo, que é o encerramento de tudo + esclarecimento de certas coisas que você vai descobrindo enquanto joga as rotas (eu ainda não consegui, retomei o jogo recentemente pra conseguir porque a esse ponto, virou questão de honra).

De todas as rotas que joguei até o momento (eu só não joguei a do Scarlet, nem a da Pachet e estou jogando a do Soh), diria que só uma REALMENTE não me agradou: a do Robin Hood. A do Brothel é . . . . . . bem. O propósito dela certamente não é o mesmo das outras. Mas aviso de antemão que tanto a do Brothel quanto a do Robin Hood lidam com uns assuntos bem pesados e podem ser desconfortáveis de serem jogadas. A do Robin Hood, especialmente, foi uma que me deixou bem desconfortável, ouso dizer que até mais do que a do Brothel (mas essa eu joguei sabendo que era bizarra, então eu já esperava bizarrice). 

Acho que uma das minhas críticas gerais em relação às rotas é que algumas delas são beeeeem curtas em relação às três principais (Caramia, Kyrie & Axel). E algo que é meio chatinho no jogo é que há uma repetição de cenas e eventos constante no jogo depois que você joga ele pela primeira vez sem ter lido nenhum diálogo: e eu diria que foi essa repetição, inclusive, que acabou estragando um pouquinho a Brothel Route pra mim. Porque parecia que o que tinha acontecido meio que não importava muito (?), cortava completamente o clima tenso e a imersão que estava sendo construída nas cenas de foco da rota. Além disso, lembra que eu disse que as rotas que não são as três principais são meio curtinhas? Então... Elas são curtinhas justamente porque tem toda essa repetição de eventos da história antes. Acaba que as cenas de foco na rota são poucas, pelo menos até chegar um ponto do jogo onde ele tá focando 100% na rota que você escolheu. Also, o jogo tem muitas transições que eu considero um pouquinho desgastantes. Especialmente em cenas que deveriam conter ação ou algo assim. Ou às vezes numa cena comum mesmo em que eu gostaria de mais um pouco de desenvolvimento, aí cortam do nada e mudam pra outra totalmente diferente, sem concluir a que passou.

Quanto à protagonista... Bem. Tem vezes que eu quero dar um berrão com ela e tem vezes que eu acabo rindo com ela justamente por ela ter dois neurônios funcionais. E também por ela realmente meio que nem se importar quando alguém fala na cara dela que ela é meio tonta. Incrivelmente, eu não tenho exatamente raiva dela, nem acho ela uma péssima personagem, porque já meio que vi heroines piores nos outros jogos do gênero que eu joguei... Mas entendo que não é todo mundo que aguenta, não.

Enfim, o jogo é divertido, devo dizer isso. Eu pessoalmente gosto do plot, acho ele criativo, e sou uma cadelinha de contos de fada. Pessoalmente não ligo muito pra plot de máfia, mas eu acho meio engraçado como isso foi encaixado de um jeito meio aleatório na temática. Não acho que é o melhor jogo que já joguei, mas não acho que seja o pior também. A arte é bem bonita, gosto da dublagem, tem momentos bem fofinhos e românticos, clichêzinhos bem gostosos... Mas é um jogo que acaba te enganando um pouco ou te pegando de surpresa às vezes, porque tem uns vários momentos bem sombrios ali. Completar as rotas de pouco em pouco acaba sendo até que fácil por conta da repetição de eventos (incrivelmente, embora eu não goste disso de repetir demais os eventos por, justamente, querer um desenvolvimento diferente pra cada escolha tomada na história, essa repetição acaba ajudando em alguns pontos), mas diria que leva algum bom tempo aí até você ir completando tudinho e ""zerar"" o jogo.

 as a disclaimer I've only played thru Caramia and Kyrie's routes fully, so I'm definitely not like, an expert on this game yet.
1) Don't treat this game TOO seriously. Honestly I've been treating it as just something chill to play when I have nothing else to do, so don't come into it expecting the most mind boggling plot you've ever seen in an otome game.

2) The story (at least what I have played) can be a tad repetitive, and also seems kind of fragmented at times just because of how the game kind of splits the story up into ""scenes"". It's not so fragmented that you can't tell whats going on though.

3) the route tree can be kind of annoying to navigate. There's a bunch of routes and each have two endings (which i'm gonna be honest, unless i'm really messing something up, both route endings are almost exactly the same with a few minor differences) and there's stuff like love triangles to navigate so it's a bit overwhelming at first. Also the game isn't exactly obvious at times when it comes to which ending you got or are heading towards.

4) You'll want to save a lot, preferably at the beginning of every route split. This mostly just applies to the three Oz boys because there's love triangles and you can transfer to a different love interest than the one you're currently pursuing, and again sometimes the game isn't helpful with figuring how to stay on certain routes. Some are easier to figure out than others, in Caramia's route it's pretty easy to figure out how to stay on his route and not get onto the transfer route, but in Kyrie's route I had to start over 4 times because I kept accidentally ending up with Caramia. 

5) Fuka is about as dumb as a box of rocks. Like if you absolutely hate dense MCs you will not like this game haha. I kinda brush it off as her just being clueless because of amnesia, but you will be yelling at the screen sometimes at how stupid she can be. 

So all in all, as much as it has it's flaws, I do like this game, but also just come into it with caution if any of the above points set you off because I can recognize it's not for everyone haha. I also wouldn't recommend as a introduction to Otome games, because as simple as the plot is, as far as the route structure goes there's a lot going on that might get overwhelming if you're not used to it. But if you are a fan of Otome game's already and are ok with something a little less riveting plot-wise, you might find this a fun game.

Ozmafia has great art, music and story telling. It wont make you cry as other otome games, but it will give you that nice fluffy feeling of playing a fun Otoge. This game has a huge variety of love interests and i love how their personalities and looks are unique.
There's also a unique feature here which is allowing you to swap routes ongoing for the 3 main ML's, which is gold and gives you a more Adult vibe and Hilarious dialogues.
The translation is clean of typos and greatly adapted. There was a great work of the localization team here.

I have played for roughly 7 hours, finishing 5 endings spread across 3 character routes (Caramia, Hamelin, and the rent boys). 

I would be hard pressed to describe the plot to you because it doesn't really have one, but here goes. A nameless young woman awakens in an alley. She can remember nothing. A man appears who is trying to kill her. She flees, only to find safety when she encounters the three chief members of the Oz family, one of several fairy tale themed mafia organizations trying to control the city. Caramia (the cowardly lion), Kyrie (scarecrow) and Axel (tin man) offer to let her let live in their base. 

From here, the heroine interacts with characters. Events happen. But nothing feels like it has structure or cohesion. Scenes are short, most can be cleared in about 5 to 10 minutes, and are often choppy, with the scenario ending in awkward places like fading to black in just as a fight scene is starting or making a big deal about a beauty pageant only for the next scene to be the aftermath of the contest. 

It seems this may be one of those games where the true ending ties everything together after you've seen every character's route, but the game has a ton of characters with most of them having at least 2 endings. I don't have it in me to replay a game that is only so-so at best that many times to see if it has some kind of a point. And I can not fathom that any true end would feel less piece meal than the rest of the game. 

Another thing that annoys me about it is that it is one of those ones that are partially voice acted and which sections get spoken dialogue is arbitrary at best. Some scenes will start out silent, only to gain voice acting in the middle while others are the complete opposite. There is no consistency.

This is not the worst otome game I've ever played, but it's close to it. It is limp, lifeless, and meandering.

I'm still trying to decide about this one. But since I was on the edge of my seat for a little while there, I'm going to recommend it. The voice acting is very good, and the story-book-esque art grows on you. It's not repetitive in the way that many VNs are when you have to go through each route skipping all the read text, and that's a huge bonus. I prefer to experience a different story with each new route, and you do that in Ozmafia for the most part. 
But there are a couple routes that were--unnecessary? They didn't really add anything to the story and in retrospect were downright disturbing. And not in a cool way.

Uhm to be honest the artstyle is really cute but I am still cautious when it comes to the characters I don't know I feel like I can't trust them. Soh and Scarlet are the ones I immediately thought like: Yeah they look nice!
I also slowly began to trust Caramia(?)  more and Axel is just a softie which I really liked.
I am not far with the storyline yet so I will mention the things that really caught my attention and also somehow bothered me.
First of all the MC looks really cute but she is so.. dumb? I know she has amnesia but I generally don't like it when the MC isn't really that smart, but many otome games sadly have mcs like that, newer ones get more confident ones now which I love. It just makes women seem more natural and not that weak

Mhm what else. I think the intercourse scenes triggered me the most because I didn't expect that they would be a part of it. Especially the brothels one was hard for me to digest, I know it's my fault for continuing but I just wanted to play all routes and kind of regret playing that one. So to asexuals or people who get really uncomfortable with  things such as these, I recommend you to skip that part

All in all I am still pretty neutral but I like Soh the most so far because he seems like the softest.
I hope I will open up to more characters soon I really don't feel that comfortable with them yet",1647124656,1647124656,False,5,0,0.560089945793151855,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I personally quite liked this game. There are a few boring points in the story and it can get a bit repetitive when doing multiple routes, The MC is annoyingly stupid but after playing so many Otome games I've become able to ignore that for the most part. My biggest complaints lie in the Robin hood and Brothel stories. Brothel was creepy in expected ways considering the context, [spoiler] The ending where she takes over the brothel is a real Girlboss move [/spoiler], though it was still incredibly unsettling. Robin hoods route really threw me though. His actions were unacceptable and the fact that they got a pass is absolutely disgusting. 

Despite ALLLLL of this I still am saying I recommend it. Though there are many flaws I did quite enjoy the humor and the art was utterly gorgeous, and as long as you don't play the two aforementioned routes the characters are all quite enjoyable. The final story brings everything together pretty well giving at least some kind of glue to the weirdly loose plot of the game. Overall, I give it a 7/10.

OZMAFIA是一部取材于童话的游戏，整体故事基于《绿野仙踪》的基础设定开始，加入了格林童话、安徒生童话、王尔德童话、海蒂、穿靴子的猫等耳熟能详的童话人物元素，并在此基础上进行了二次创作，是我个人很喜欢的创意。

但整体展开不是很合我的口味，一是过场太多太多（多到让人崩溃，过场可以按ctrl跳过），把剧情分割得有点零碎，再加上攻略人物是采用选择和他/她见面然后进行下一步的这种日常聊天模式，玩起来有种不连贯的感觉，在真相线之前的一些剧情冲突往往让人有点摸不着头脑，可能玩着玩着就觉得“啊？怎么突然这样了？”这种感觉。抛开这些的话，优点在于一些日常的细节描写还挺有趣，人物的前后反差也有萌点。在走完所有角色的线之后，真相线和最后的结局线的故事也增加了不少游戏体验。（对故事的感受因人而异~）

当然最喜欢的还是砂糖太太的画风，CG绝美！！女主的对话框头像一如既往画得超级超级可爱！

游戏的特色换乘玩法还挺新颖的，对换乘玩法的三个攻略角色除了可以单独走纯爱线到底之外，还可以走到一半时排列组合式地劈腿，每条线都可以劈腿另外两个角色。相信很多人都是被这个玩法吸引入坑的。关于换乘玩法有两点想吐槽下：
1、每个人物在另外两人的线掺和一脚时剧情基本一致，其实这里根据被劈腿角色的不同可以丰富一些人物和剧情的细节。
2、每个人物在自己的线比较矜持，在别人的劈腿线却分外火热（？）
我的内心：野啊宝贝，还有两副面孔呢？

除了OZ三人组之外的其他角色线相对而言比较短小，因此感情进展感觉和坐飞机一样快，但还是可以狠狠地get到一些角色的可爱，喜欢索，猫姐还有哈梅尔（哈梅尔CG画那么帅居然剧情如此短小实在是太可惜了）。
[spoiler] 猫姐不能百合我太伤心了 [/spoiler]
娼馆三人组线比较另类，看这个名字大家心里应该也有数了，请做好心理准备再玩。

Pros:
- Most characters are fun and I love learning more about them, including the side character.
- Interesting isekai mafia theme.
- Beautiful art, CGs, & bgm.
- Many options & route. All got different ending & epilogue. Plus a grand finale ending explaining the world setting.

Cons:
- typical otoge no brainer heorine. I really meant it when I said no brain.
- The fighting scene aren't that satisfying.
- Super long common route.
- Got some weird a&& route but I will take it (I AM LOOKING AT YOU ALFANI, you scammerboi).
- Loading Scene: whoever idea is this, I hate you. The color is so blinding. There are so many of it and consider the story super long length, it became sooooooooooooooooo painful to look at. Specially, from the 2nd playthough onward cause it takes forever to skip.

Route review:
- Caramia: Always a gentleman/likable in every route.
- Kyrie: I hate him at first since I was playing Caramia route, but I find him likable in this own route. His sarcastic tone kinda fun to read.
- Axel: Tsundere sweet lover guy with sweet personality <3
- Scarlet: somehow cannot look at him in a romantic way, he's more like cute a guy friend.
- Caesar: I don't like him so I find his route quite boring
- Soh: Thought he's a yandere but guess not. He's sweet.
- Pashet: cute nekomimi girl friend, why not?
- Robin Hood: got some tragic past, but he's sweat and kind. A bit surprised by what's behind that door though.
- Brothel: so weird that I find it funny so I'll take that (I MEANT THE GOOD ENDING ONE, the other is meh).
- Hamelin: OTOGE loop of every game always made me like the secret character and give me a short route but I enjoy it thoroughly .

The world and the characters are painfully blend, the lack of depth makes it very difficult to fully immerse yourself in the story. I can appreciate an amnesiac but only if i am given some sort of ways to recover the memories or at the very least understand what the MC is doing in that world. In this particular game, not only is the MC suffering from amnesia, she doesn't even seem to be part of the world initially (no house brand), she has no particlar skills and her amnesia is so complete that it's truthfully a miracle she even knows how to speak and read. 

The story is blend, there's no action, no drama, no ways to further understand this whole Mafia thing. Where did MC come from? The main antagonist arrives like 5minutes before the end and is put out just as quickly. MC just goes with the flow, has no ambitions, no desires, no redeeming qualities or even the IQ to survive unless someone is accompanying her.

OZMAFIA is a charming game, despite it's mishaps. The art itself makes it worthwhile playing through, the voice acting is good, and the soundtrack is decent. The characters are in depth and well written, but it is the story, events, and MC that makes the game falter. Despite this, I still recommend this if its on sale. 

...A main concern from potential players is TRIGGERING CONTENT. But this can be easily avoided as the game warns you multiple times to avoid certain routes. Several routes (Axel, Caramia, Pashet, Soh) have explicit consent and healthy relationship, but completionists may feel uncomfortable.

And for those who are planning on playing, I'll outline some game info since the game explains 0 mechanics. 

Whats a TRANSFER end and a PURE end?: In the Oz family, and ONLY the Oz family, the two men with the most affection points will attempt to court you. TRANSFER means that you start with someone, but decide going with another man. A PURE end means you commit to a man for the whole game. 

LOADING SCREENS. They're slightly annoying, but there is a reason for them. An icon with the whole gang with a GOLD trim means a normal time skip, an icon with the gang with a BLUE trim means new content (when you are replaying) and a loading screen with the Oz family means a love triangle. When a character is highlighted RED, it means you will pick their route in the love triangle.

ANSWERING CORRECTLY: To get a good end, quicksave and click on the answer that gives you a jingle sound. If you don't hear a jingle, it means you either picked wrong or the answer didn't count for affection points. When in doubt, reload your quicksave.

I loved OZMAFIA, and I'll probably pick it back up later for other routes. But as an otome game goes, its strikingly beautiful with loveable characters, which is enough to make my buy it.

Видит Мерлин, я мечтала поставить Озмафии хорошую оценку. Ради новых отомэ в Стиме и ради прекрасных переводчиков, благодаря стараниям которых я не мучила мозг тридцать часов. Но… не получилось. 

Сперва о хорошем:

❤️ В игре чудесная графика. Исполнение некоторых CG кривовато, но дизайн персонажей просто волшебный. Их спрайты вы точно ни с какими другими не перепутаете. 

❤️ На выбор дается целых десять сказочных героев, с которыми можно строить отношения, в том числе и  неромантического характера.  В-основном, диалоги с ними живенькие, особенно в моменты повседневности – а именно они и занимают львиную долю игры. Озвучка неплохая, хотя слышно, что не все актеры стараются.

Если вышеупомянутых пунктов вам достаточно, чтобы хорошо провести время, то от прочтения можно получить удовольствие. Что я и делала в те моменты, когда не было нервирующих факторов:

💔 Главная героиня – фееричная тупица. Подобный тип протагонистов меня не раздражает, но в данном случае это проблема, так как глупость Фуки – чуть ли не единственная вещь, которая пинает к финалу коматозника, гордо зовущегося здесь «основным сюжетом». Когда же ей это удается, того так сильно скрючивает от нелогичности и скомканности происходящего, что к пятому часу начинаешь мечтать пристрелить его собственноручно, чтобы не мучился.

💔 Среди романсабельных персонажей есть несколько неплохих рутов, которые мне понравились. К сожалению, к таковым не относится основное трио долб… кхе-кхе… трио Семьи Оз. Сами по себе они славные ребята, но кому-то из сценаристов пришла гениальная идея сделать любовные треугольники обязательным пунктом их программы. Затея, конечно, интересная, но в итоге получились лишь неправдоподобные привязанности, высосанные из пальца конфликты и часы перепрохождения. Спасибо, что есть гайд, а то в сказочную страну верхом на огненном тайфуне улетела бы уже я сама.

💔 Не знаю, проблема это игры или перевода, но часто у меня было ощущение, что диалоги прерываются слишком уж внезапно. Учитывая структуру новеллы, это не баг, а фича, но было странно.

Вердикт: В стиме нет оценки «мэйби», но если бы была, я бы поставила именно ее. У игры есть, чем развлечь – неплохо проработанные характеры, диалоги, юмор. Не самая ужасная отомэ, все-таки я прошла ее полностью, но и очень хорошей ее назвать язык не поворачивается. Если и проходить ее, то только из целей прикоснуться к классике.",1637444981,1637445947,False,8,1,0.60152900218963623,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Lo bueno:
El arte es precioso, creo que de todos los otomes que he jugado hasta ahora es el que tiene los mejores CGs. El diseño de los personajes también es bellísimo, representa a los personajes sin ser cursi/estereotipado. Normalmente no suelen llamarme la atención más de 2 personajes en un otome pero en el caso de Ozmafia hay solo un par que NO me llaman la atención. Todos los personajes se ven muy bien. Hablando de personajes, es muy divertido verlos interactuar entre sí, algunas escenas sí que me hicieron reír, como todas las peleas tontas de Caramia y Kyrie. El juego es claro al mostrar la dinámica entre los personajes de las distintas casas y es una de sus características más positivas.

-Lo malo:
Poca continuidad en la narración. Las escenas duran muy poco, a cada rato hay una pantalla de carga que al cabo de unas horas ya cansa mucho. Lo peor es cuando hay una escena de pelea, queda en una parte importante, te meten una pantalla de carga y luego otra escena que nada que ver. Esto hace que por momentos resulte muy confuso el paso del tiempo y el orden cronológico de los eventos.
Las rutas pueden sentirse apresuradas y cortas. Tienen un buen inicio, la ruta de Axel es preciosa, pero el final resultó algo decepcionante. La otra ruta que hice fue la de Caesar y esa sí me decepcionó mucho, fue muy apresurado el romance y por eso siento que también se quedó corta. 

Opinión final: Vale la pena comprarlo si está en oferta. Es entretenido, es bonito visualmente, los personajes son divertidos... y no hay mucho más que decir. De todos modos lo recomiendo porque si vas con pocas expectativas, lo vas a disfrutar. :)",1637109795,1637109795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Overall, the game has been very enjoyable. It's the only otome that I find myself able to 100% due to the fact that for most routes (see edit above) there are no Awful endings, just a Sweet/True Love ending and a Bittersweet ending. The writing is...Dated. There is a heavyset woman who is voiced by a male and we as a consumer should laugh because 'haha fat', especially because she finds everyone who isn't fat to be puny. [spoiler] There's also a beauty pageant scene where the MC gets bodyshamed because her chest is more on the smaller side. [/spoiler] But other than that, the writing for the actual routes has been sweet.

I have had to stop running the game in full screen due to the game randomly closing, and my save files (particularly the save file in the second slot down, on the first page for the save files) would randomly get corrupted.

纯爱战士打NTR的时候好难受，然后发现NTR换线了之后比纯爱还甜更难受了
一边吃糖喊香一边哭为什么纯爱不这么甜
为什么纯爱牵个小手都那么害羞，换人了当晚就可以共度夜晚，why
这就是失去了才懂得珍惜吗（邓瑶
御三家的爱情线最丰富，这就是正宫三家吧，加上NTR可以理解当作有三个HE。NE其实也可以看做HE，也没什么真正的BEpoi的结局。
其他角色就不保证了哈，哈哈，我的hameln（哭
小红帽太可爱了！！好想和他贴贴啊，都没什么贴贴CG！也是一个被hameln伤了心的主。
狼崽本来以为是谐星，看完真相发现真是人间良心！呜呜呜狼崽！！
猫姐姐中途有点雷到我了，我一开始和姬友喊老婆老婆，半路发现她喜欢上了axel我说我失恋了我老婆居然爱上了别人，打到最后发觉原来是友情线，啧。喜欢个路人就算了为啥要喜欢上可攻略角色也是有点放飞自我……虽然他俩还挺合适（？
虽然有人觉得chang线刺激带感但是我不行我太雷了，如果这是分在BE的END我可以，但是HE和NE都是被内啥了我是难以接受的，如果是HE和manboy两人远走高飞，nebe分支现在的两种结局我觉得ok。正统线写这种结局我真的佩服剧本娘……
我真的超级讨厌chang线，加上因为画师也是砂糖让我越看那個大叔越觉得他是皇阿玛，我真的好不喜欢他！！
我只想和manboy远走高飞，aru就当个吉祥物吧x
医生线也是有点背德，也是个大雷。比起让女主和他一起我更希望他能和妻子在一起（。 我并不想插足，我只想看你们幸福.jpg
so本来觉得是个超级小天使，心疼，等打完真相发现这人不能用一个腹黑就能概括的。天使和恶魔并存就是指这样的人吧，我都不知道他在hameln线是以什么样的心情去做饭送饭的，我二周目hameln线的时候真的很无奈。
虽然很想讲hameln但是我怕我泪崩。一周目打的时候就泪崩了，打完真相回来二周目再通一遍哭的比一周目厉害好几倍，真的太痛苦太心疼了。全作最好最善良最温柔的男人被洗脑亲自毁了最好的朋友的人生还伤害了自己的家族，这不完全疯已经很厉害了。稍微疯一点已经很好了……没打真相之前还在想是不是有双重人格，因为别的线他一直像個反派。
然后真相线看了之后hameln厨真的不能发自内心的喜欢soh，虽然他真的是小天使吧，也有苦衷吧，自己的线也挺惨的吧，但是也是个万恶之源啊，hameln也没有幸福啊，比他更惨啊！！！！崩了崩了。至少soh还能在阳光下和fuka一起，那hameln呢？导致我对so真的不能发自内心的喜欢。觉得他可爱，觉得他惨，但是不能喜欢上他，他对hameln造成的伤害真的是无法弥补的。也有剧本娘不给hameln写出一个he的因素，但是可恶，为什么会这样.jpg
加上大团圆也没有给hameln一个好结局。不应该用魔法帮个忙吗，居然还是坐牢，我的天。我不要再体验铁窗爱情了，白石景之一个人就够了（突然乱入CM，因为我是個白石推），我没有想到时隔四年我又推了一个铁窗爱情的角色，我和铁窗有孽缘吧，88。
キリエ也是心疼的不行，就他所有都记得，只有他记得多萝西，我都感觉官配不应该是卡拉米亚而是キリエ了，这完全就是官配吧2333
不过也可能是因为性格，官配一般都是要卡拉米亚那种的。

Different character routes are okay to play through the first time around, but if you're a completionist like me and was to see every ending, this game is far too repetitive to enjoy that. It also really feels like there isn't much of a plot when you're playing, the game feels like it's just dragging on because there's no real progress being made towards any big picture goal.

Making strategic save files will help save you the trouble of going through the whole thing, but ultimately you will have to go back and pick all the opposite choices to get another separate ending. The skip button is also rather annoying to have to turn back on again after reaching new content automatically turns it off (which when playing through a route again, will end up being a few extra lines scattered during each playthrough that you didn't get to see before). 

Don't get me wrong, it's not totally horrible. I did at least find the story and characters somewhat interesting, and there are some unique features that I haven't seen anywhere else. I especially liked the concept that allows you to switch characters after romancing one, but also thought it's a little weird that the character you were dating before doesn't seem to care or be salty about it later on after their confrontation. These alternative endings allow you to see another side of the characters and get entirely separate endings from their main routes.

Si bien el comienzo es un tanto cliché, chica que sufre amnesia, tiene el encanto de que viajar a una ciudad un tanto especial donde hay personajes salidos directamente de cuentos: Mago de Oz, Caperucita Roja, etc, (bueno, hay un caso en especial que precisamente ""de cuento"" no es).

Un punto muy fuerte de este otome es que gracias a la gran variedad de personajes hay muchas rutas a escoger y, de cada una de estas, distintos finales, por lo que en duración no se le puede poner queja alguna.

Por contra a este punto favorable, es que he encontrado las historias un tanto superficiales en líneas generales, además de que hay una ruta un tanto... desagradable puede decirse. Eso ha hecho que, si bien he disfrutado de la novela visual, no me haya llenado tanto como en un primer momento parecía ya que creo que podría haberse aprovechado los personajes y sus tramas un poco mejor. 

En definitiva, Ozmafia!! es un otome que disfrutarán todo amante del género con sus virtudes y sus fallos con personajes atractivos y unos diseños absolutamente preciosos.

Como pequeño extra, os dejo mi recomendación personal del orden de rutas que creo que hará disfrutar aún la experiencia:

Caramia>Scarlet>Axel>Brothel>Pashet>Robin Hood>Kyrie>Hamelin>Caesar>Soh

[u] Bones I’m Throwing Before I Slaughter This Game: (i.e.: What I Actually Liked) [/u]
[b] >An Abundance of Routes! [/b] There are a lot of routes and range of characters to date. 
[b] >Art. [/b] Art is beautiful in this game. Some CGs have odd angles, but overall it's really well done. 
[b] >Lengthy. [/b] Actually, it's TOO lengthy (which I’ll get into below) but it earns its price point for the overall amount of content and time it takes to play. 
[b] >Some Genuinely Funny Bits. [/b] The humor lands relatively well throughout the game. In fact, I may go as far to say, it's the game’s most redeeming quality. I would name some specifics, but I think they would qualify as spoilers. In general, Kyrie is an abundant source of humor in this game. Gretel is also an absolute charm. But everyone has some moments of very funny content. 
[b] >Great Minor Characters. [/b] Perhaps even more interesting than the main characters…
[b] >Creative and Interesting Setting. [/b] The world is very unique and the concept interesting. For those wondering, the characters ARE inspired by The Wizard of Oz, as well as other well known Fairy Tales (and also The Picture of Dorian Gray… which I guess is sort of a fairy tale? Except I wouldn’t read it to a child…)

[u] Just What IS My Problem? (i.e.: What Ruined It For Me)[/u]
[b] >That Godd@am Loading Screen. [/b] Easily the worst thing about this Otome is its godforsaken loading screen. You don't notice how present it is in your first or second playthrough, but after that, it is an utter BLIGHT to this game. It pops up with it's stupid little jingle after 4 lines of dialogue. Constantly and needlessly haunting you to no end. It's BEYOND annoying.
[b] >Tedious. [/b] If The Loading Screen of Death wasn’t enough to make you scream from how it grinds action to a halt, the game in general is slow and repetitive. I can’t figure out what the ultimate story goal of this Otome is. It's certainly not plot heavy. Overall very little happens. It’s not character-development heavy. Most characters are exactly the same in the end as they are in the beginning— with Axel and idk… maaaaybe Pashet and Scarlet being (weak) exceptions of having personal growth. The protagonist certainly doesn’t evolve. My best guess is that the goal was mostly “world building” and the world IS interesting, but what we’re given is spread way too thin across way too many routes. It definitely has bright moments throughout, but by my 4th route, it felt like a slog. I’ll also add that some CGs (and all are needed to get to the Grand Finale) are really difficult to get. I wasted a lot of time doing what I thought was the “obvious direction” to obtain them, only for it not to work. Save yourself the annoyance by following walkthroughs. 
[b] >Nightmare Protagonist. [/b] Lord, where do I even start with this woman…  I’ve played enough Otome games, that I understand the point of making the protagonist dumb and bland. She needs to be naive & curious enough that she falls into foolish situations, and vague enough that people can filter their own personalities into her— thereby relating her to the players and complimenting whatever personality of the lover she is in pursuit of. But listen… there is no one alive…. as dumb as this protagonist. Need an example? This woman is literally so dumb, that one of the characters has to explain the concept of death to her! ""BeCaUsE oF hEr AmNeSiA!""-- cry the game developers! Homegirl can remember how to READ, and can remember the meaning of fairly complex vocabulary words, but doesn't remember what happens when someone is ""dead""? It’s even more ridiculous when you consider that it is established, within the first five seconds of gameplay, that she is fearful of dying. C'mon. It just makes no sense. And there are routes where she actively gets MORE stupid as the game goes. How?!?! While her absolute stupidity can add to the humor of the game, the real problem it creates is that she ends up being suited to NO ONE (imo, imo). I don’t buy that any of these dudes are, or would be, in love with her. She does nothing— action, thought, or personality wise— to earn their affection. I guess the exceptions could be Axel (who matches her in social ineptitude) or Soh (who matches her in child-like earnestness). But all of these love stories are so unearned and thus feel utterly unsatisfying. I cannot say that any one ending felt fulfilling to me. (In hindsight, Axel’s route probably would have, had I played him early on. But he was like #6 for me, and I was kinda over the grind by then.) I will also add that the game, in the epilogue, tries to explain why is so dumb, but the reason is weak and does not save you from how miserably she behaves in the rest of the game.
[b] >The Edgy ""Dark Themes"". [/b] I don't mind dark themes in my Otome, but I'd like them to be taken seriously if they're going to happen. And I'd like the game to at least insulate, in one way or another, that they, the game developers, understand that something morally wrong has occurred… that did not happen in this game. It's additionally odd, because characters in some routes very specifically ask for consent from the protagonist to kiss/get-down with her while others straight-up drug her. It’s dealt with very poorly and never addressed after the fact.
[b] >Hetrosexual as Hell. [/b] Whatever excuse you have, I don’t care about it. NOT GAY ENOUGH FOR ME, FAM. The game made me believe I could end up with Pashet, but I could not. Also, I wanted to be with Gretel. And I could not. I am bitter about it.
[b] >Not-So-Grand Finale. [/b] I sure went through hell and high water and 40 hours of gameplay just to desperately get to the grand finale annnnddddd I was disappointed. Not so much in the content of it, but it's VERY short. Like 5 minutes. The Epilogue is longer than the Grand Finale. 


Overall, did I utterly hate the game and regret playing it? ...To a point, YEAH! I definitely regret some of it. I would have been far happier if I played a single route for each character, did the epilogue, and then just looked up the grand finale ending elsewhere. It definitely wasn’t worth the time crunch of getting every ending and seeing every itty-bitty cut scene. It took way too long, and ultimately, while some of the characters are enjoyable— no one earned my overall affection. If you asked who my favorite dateable character was, it would only elicit a noncommittal shrug. My ultimate suggestion is that if the game is on sale, you have an abundance of time to burn, and you’re not new to Otome games (therefore not letting this define what you think of the genre)...Then maybe try it out. 

But that’s a lot of ‘ifs’. 

There are better ones out there, folks.

This game fully immersed me in it's story despite it's slow start. It not only has many routes and endings, but many characters you can get to know, love and hate. I will admit, the game does have a few holes in it's story line, though I believe the amount of emotion you will feel from playing this game to its entirety will cause you to overlook the mistakes.

The characters for one can be either extremely loveable or extremely hateable. However you feel about them, they are almost guaranteed to make you laugh, cry and most definitely want to pull your hair out at times. Some characters definitely deserved more recognition than they got, (Scarlet, Pashet, Soh, Manboy). I felt like their routes could have been more plentiful story-wise. Soh's route simply doesn't make sense either until you reach the epilogue, which makes me a bit uneasy for those who only want to try one or two routes of their favorite characters. Though overall, the characters are enjoyable and serve their purpose in the game.

The art is flawless, Satoi never fails to disappoint.

- The game twists innocent plots and characters with sudden heavy content, from sexual exploits and BDSM, to brutal murders and such, it's a mind fuck. Neither here nor there, none are really enjoyable.

This was such a whirlwind of a game but like in the best way. Of course I really enjoyed the romantic routes [spoiler](there should have been some better endings for scarlet, soh - yes i forgive him- and manboy/alfani, oh my god dont get me started on how much i hated what manboy had to go through)[/spoiler] i also just really liked piecing the over arching  plot together based on the info given in the routes.

After playing through for yourself one time i recommend using a guide because oh my god there are so many endings and routes this game has so much replay value- even after you finish some routes you get extra scenes based off of them in your next playthrough.

Of course the art is beautiful like stunning although some CGs were much better than others. The voiced voicelines were also really good- even though they were in another language they really captured the emotions and personalities of the characters. 

I'm very very tired and don't have much else to write but just honestly? This otome was amazing i definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre- although it is very dark so if you're not into that don't be fooled by the fairytale aesthetic lmao

Игра раскрывает себя не с одной концовки, если вам тяжело - дропайте, это не ваша игра, нечего грызть этот кактус, милые мышата. Оставшихся же ждет куча концовок, без этого никак. От абсурда некоторых, я смеялся, как гиена. От других пробивал лицо фейспалмом. Третьи - подпалили седалище. Четвертые - ввели в отчаянное положение, похрустывает на зубах просто великолепно. Основные руты вызвали кучу эмоций за раз, не то, чтобы особо положительных. Решайте сами для себя ""правильные"" концовки, где не так жуется стекло, именно так я и сделал - игра заиграла другими красками.

Отдельно хочется сказать о главной героине. Терпите. Ее тупость объясняется в конце. Вам от этого легче не будет, но, видимо, чем круче прописано окружение, тем тупее мейн.

Маленькая девочка телом, но уже довольно взрослая внутри, Дороти после своего великого путешествия в страну Оз, о котором, вы все, наверняка, так или иначе знаете, стала ведьмой, начиталась книжек и создала содом и гоморру для своих друзяшек по странствию. Только не учла, что сидеть в башне одной скучно, поэтому решила присоединиться к тусовке внизу, не предусмотрев некоторые вещи. Применять на себя магию - большое ата-та, поэтому наше золотко поделила себя на части, одна из которых (в виде ее души) попала туда, куда и задумывалось, с одним огромнейшим ""но"" - стала нулевой версией Пугала в терминальной стадии. Тупее пробки, душа исследует все вокруг и познает мир: мутит с Оз-никами, теряет их важные вещи, устраивает тройничок с пристом, общается с кошкодевочками и другим населением городка. Все это творится под малокомментируемое офигевание того, кто помнит Дороти с детских времен. В перерывах между действиями за тупой душой бегает магия (еще одна часть Дороти) и хочет ее сожрать, и это отдельный повод для гэга. [/spoiler]

It took a while to come back to this game because I was worried that all the routes would be like the first route I read. After talking to some people who had played the game there are better routes and I just started the game with one of the worst routes. 

I first played this game with a friend who streamed the game over discord and we played the common route and the good ending for the brothel route-my friend wanted to date Manboy because his name was funny. So my hours played are not reflective of what I actually play because I skip through the parts that we read together and did the ending we did together quickly.

I love the common route of the game where you get to meet all of the different characters and was great the first time you read. But, the common route got tedious the more you had to play it because there are just so many routes and you need to do the common route for almost every route except  the triangle route if you save at the right point. 

So the order I played this game was:
Brothel>Caramia>Kyrie>Axel>Hamelin>Pashet>Scarlet>Robin Hood>Soh> Caesar 
I really don’t recommend playing the Brothel route first and if I could go back I would play the Brothel route between Hamelin and Pashet’s route as I think there are elements of Hamelin’s route that link into the Brothel route and Pashet’s route is good mind bleach after a certain brothel route ending. 

The brothel was the first route I play and I really don’t recommend it as a route to start the game with. You have elements of BDSM, drug use and sex positivity. You get one satisfying ending which I think would have had a better impact if I played this route later in the game and another ending that made me nope out of the game. 

Caramia’s route was the first route I played coming back to the game after not playing it a while and if definitely a route that if you want to play the game that you should start since he is the don of the Ozmafia. His route was wild and I loved it and this route actually made me want to continue playing this game. 

Kyrie’s route was not one of my favourites and some of that has to do with me not like his character because he appeared in the brothel route. His route changed my mind on hating him to feel indifference towards him and the route was just as wild as Caramia’s route so I was happy to continue reading it. However, there were a few points where I wanted to stop reading for the same reasons I didn’t like his route so much, but with some encouragement from other otome fans I continued reading his route. 

Axel’s route is my favourite route out of the three OZ boys. I think he’s very much a tsundere character which I love but he also has elements of a kuudere- so if you like characters of either of those tropes then you might love his route. I adore his route so much and seeing his blushing sprite was so cute.

The transfer route were okay- I like more than other and also one of the transfer route is glitched for some reason which is Kyrie prue love Vs Axel. These routes were something different that I haven’t seen in otome games before. I felt they were very meh as the transfer endings were very similar and didn’t really add much to the story- though it did give me the satisfaction that I could leave Kyrie mid route for Axel. 

Hamelin’s route was interesting so he is a good example of yagire trope. His route links into the three oz boys routes and gives you a different perspective on things that you saw in the previous routes- make sure to have tissues nearby because both of his endings might make you cry. 

Pashet’s route I went in hoping for a female love interest because me bi/pan heart really wants to romance at least one female character, but sadly it is just a platonic/friendship route. I didn’t actually mind this route once I played one ending as other endings were cute and I love that you get to play matchmaking and help a female friend find love instead of you finding love. 10/10 would recommend this route as mind bleach to play after any route that is too much. 

Scarlet’s route exceeded my expectations, I went in thinking awww he’s so cute and adorable and came out of it shipping the MC with him and thinking he is the best guy for her out of the guys so far. His route made me see the Oz boys in a different light which I enjoyed- I love it when otome games make you start to see different characters differently.

Robin hood’s route was the second route that got me to nope out from this game- it was only for a few days this time as one of my friend kept reminding me I needed to do caesar’s route. Robin Hood’s route was just a no but it did answer some questions from Hamelin’s route. Just be prepared that this is another route where there are some heavy subject matter involving drugs and that Robin Hood is a worse version of Mr. Freeze. 

Soh’s route I originally was going to play this route last but was talked out of it by some friends and I was glad I did because the overall route is great but both endings are just pain and left me with more questions about the world that the game was set in. Soh is a cute character but don’t leave him for last- he makes a good penultimate route. 

Caesar’s route was a great final route and out of all the character routes that you can play his route feels like the cannon route. I love him so much in the story and he can so tsun at some points and caring at other points in his route. He is best boi of this game for me (closely followed by Axel). 

The Great final and Epilogue broke me because characters I loved turned out to bad and characters that I hated turned out to be damaged. This ending messed with my head a lot but I did enjoy reading it and I really didn’t see some of the things coming- a lot of the time I’m quite good at predicting what might happen but this ending I couldn’t. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this game but I do think you should do some of the routes in a specific order (and don’t start with the brothel route).

Comparing Ozmafia to other otome, I find the storyline pretty interesting, but at times it can be quite anti-climatic, and cause me to zone out :D I'll admit that I found it interesting that the creator took inspiration from one of my favourite stories, The Wizard of Oz, and its pretty obvious. The intermission showcases the original cast of the story, and the three main love interests are tailored after the Lion, Scarecrow and Tin Man ((I secretly wish that at the end of each route they had a scene of the heroine saying ""there's no place like home"")), that would be *chefs kiss* AHEM. Ok so, I'll strictly discuss the main routes (haven't done any side routes). I find Caramia to be charming, he's a typical paternal love interest, shows affection easily, and is fairly transparent. Uhm Kyrie (-.-) he's my least favourite, he's a tsundere, but its to the the extent that he's incredibly obnoxious and inconsiderate. The man blatantly tells the heroine he loves seeing her suffer, and always belittles Caramia and Axel. His route was painful. So far, Axel has been my favourite, he's the most complex, as he represents the Tin Man. Axel has the ability to be sympathetic, and makes himself really vulnerable around the heroine, always trying his best to comfort and consult her. Yet, he's also the physically strongest member of the familgia, and he's quite skilled in combat. I find it pretty cute that he waves around his shotgun like an axe, and his sprites are the most breathtaking.

➱ El juego tiene algunos problemas técnicos y a veces se queda colgado. Vas a tener que ser una maniática/o del guardado porque igual pierdes la partida. Además, no puedes hacer screenshots.

➱ En este otome sustituyen muchísimos CGs por texto. Es decir, en muchas situaciones describen lo que pasa en lugar de poner alguna imagen. Esto hace que pierda ambientación, porque pasa en prácticamente todas las rutas y los CGs los han dejado mas bien para los finales de la ruta y demás.

➱ Al menos el 70-80% de la ruta de los 3 bachelors de Oz es casi lo mismo. (Lo bueno es que cuando te has pasado una ruta de esas la primera vez y te la re-juegas, añaden escenas extras que te hacen pensar ""ahhhh, por eso era..."").

➱ El juego sólo tiene voces en un 70%, eso quiere decir que igual de un momento a otro los personajes dejan de hablar (voz) y vuelven a hablar a los 10 minutos.

➱ La estructuración de la historia es... A ver, sí hay cosas que están relacionadas entre sí, pero otras son muy confusas, a veces los bachelors te sueltan una bomba (o sea, te dicen algo potente o que te deja alucinando) y ves que la escena se corta ahí y amaneces en otro día, eso es un poco extraño, porque te da a entender que ""por detrás"" los personajes han tenido más interacciones pero tú nunca las ves y la MC tampoco lo sabe.

➱ Como he dicho por ahora he hecho 4 rutas y sin hacer spoiler, 2 de esas 4 me han parecido un poco ""wtf"", pero wtf por parte de la MC y por parte del propio bachelor, cosas como ""te conozco de hace dos días, vámonos del pueblo juntos porque te amo"" y la MC en plan claro, sí, por qué no. Amiga, date cuenta. Esas cosas hacen sentir que la ruta no tiene ni pies ni cabeza y ni siquiera parece una ""ruta"" en sí.

Pero por otro lado sí lo recomiendo porque, como todo, es una historia que te puede gustar, es bonita, hay personajes de cuento de hadas como Pedro, Caperucita Roja, Heidi, etc., con los que la verdad te echas unas muy buenas risas, y te puede distraer un poco del día a día que para eso está.

(Eso sí, yo lo compré de rebajas y sigo pensando que si lo compras, debería ser de rebajas por los problemas técnicos, lo malas que son algunas rutas y el poco contenido visual que tiene).",1613407585,1613491988,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ozmafia was my very first otome game and while it's not perfect, I did enjoy it overall. The OP and ED song slaps, I listen to it regularly. At first I was skeptical on whether I should buy it or not since it is pricey and a lot of people criticized it, but I'm glad I did buy it in the end. I fell in love with all the characters (except a few:| you know who you are >:|), the main and side. 
Some things I would say were a bit annoying was the cutting scene or whatever you call it with that cursed jingle, I wanted to scream every time it popped up lol. It was also a bit time consuming having to skip everything in the common route since it was a bit longer than others but thank goodness for that skip button, I worshiped it every time TT I enjoyed the extra scenes you can encounter on your second play, but oh dear was it annoying when I skipped it but had to stop at the perfect time so I could read those extra scenes lol TT It did make it worthwhile to go through it again though so I guess it was a smart move? The CG's and character design were amazing of course, sooo beautiful, you can never go wrong with Satoi. The art, the aaaaaart. The romance was good but not the best. We got a lot of cute scenes but I didn't really think it was written as well as it could have been. Sometimes the romance felt a bit forced I guess? It was still enjoyable though.

For the characters individually:
Fu ka: I liked Fu ka. Was she the best heroine ever? No. Was she strong and very expressive? No, but we can't forget that she had amnesia this whole time. She didn't know who she was, nor where she came from. I wouldn't expect her to be this great heroine. She certainly had her very irritating moments [spoiler]Not a huuuuge fan of the NTR but I guess it was tolerable? Idk:|[/spoiler] but well she was an ok heroine.
Caramia: Caramia was cute and I enjoyed his story. He wasn't really that memorable for me bc well, he was cute and kind and that was basically it lol. He was your typical perfect good boy I guess? Not that it means he didn't have anything else to show, just that his personality was pretty basic. 
Kyrie: Oh dear. Where do I start lol. Kyrie was, again, the mean flirty character that always teases the MC and stuff. I liked his character on the other routes where we can go to him but I didn't enjoy his own route thaaat much. I still liked him, though he did get me quite annoyed at times. I might've punched my screen a few times while playing his route but it's tolerable? [spoiler]Didn't really like the fact that he technically never even loved Fu ka lol? He pretty much just liked Dorothy the whole time and we were more of a replacement since he couldn't have Dorothy. The route shows he loves us but I felt like it was kinda forced lol. Not my favorite[/spoiler]
Axel: MY BABY. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. MUST PROTECT. As you can tell, I loved loved loooooved Axel's route. I guess it's because I love making the serious and stern ML's fall in love with the heroine, and him blushing was the cutest thing ever like aaaaaaaaaaaaa. Some parts in his route did make me quite irritated, you can guess which ones lol, but thankfully it didn't drag on for too long.
Pashet: :( Just :( We need a route for her, and not a friendship route >:| Maybe that's just me, but I really wish we could've had something more with Pashet, but I'll take what I got since I love her oh so much TT Her CG's were sooo cute, I love her.
Scarlet: Again :(. I was kinda disappointed with Scarlet's route, I LOOOOVED his character so much and I thought his back story was very interesting to read about, but I just felt like more could've been done yknow? I wish we could've gotten more lovey dovey scenes, and [spoiler]WE DIDN'T GET A KISS SCENE LIKE WHY.WHY.WHY.WHY[/spoiler] Ahem, yeah I loved Scarlet but I wish we got more with him :( [spoiler]His second ending was just:( so bittersweet, I'm going to imagine we ended up getting together and having cute babies:( Also Fu ka was so irritating in his route like girl, stop making my baby suffer>:|[/spoiler]
Robin Hood: :) [spoiler]I HATED HIM. He was the one I was most excited to play and I now hate him with a passion. End of story. Go marry your dead wife and leave Fu ka alone. Fu ka, get some brain cells and stop pinning over some dude who doesn't even like you and just thinks of you as a replacement. Kyrie 2.0. It was a PAIN to get through his route, I'll never replay it.[/spoiler]
Hamelin~: My baby, my ball of cuteness, my little munchkin, I love you <3. Hamelin sadly didn't really have a proper route, but he was one of my top ML's. I'd pay just to have a proper route for him:( I love him. H deserves better.
Soh: :) [spoiler]When I first played his route, I LOVED HIM. I cried in his route, his route was like one of the only ones that made me cry. Then we play the grand finale and :| Go throw yourself in a hole.[/spoiler]
Caesar: I enjoyed Caesar's route and him blushing was so so cuteTT Kinda wish we got more out of his route but oh well, I'll take what I got I guess:( He's also my baby<3
Brothel: Oh boy, here we go:) Uhhhh, yeah. I didn't highly enjoy this one. I'm used to dark things so this wasn't a lot to take in, but I didn't like how some things that were done to Fu ka were handled:|? This could be your guilty pleasure I guess? [spoiler]Getting to rename Dorian was amazing though, I was having a field day with that lolololol I liked dominant Fu ka but idk. Not the best route.[/spoiler]

So yeah, if you don't buy this game then well you're not going to miss out on like a masterpiece, but I think it's a nice game with some good points :) Honestly I'd say it's worth playing just to get to the Grand Finale, that was a nice ending. I'd say buy the game when it's on sale, but if you wanna buy it with the full price then go for it my dude. That's what I did, though I kinda wish I would've waited for a sale lol TT (also had to space out fu ka's name cus it censors it?)",1613356578,1613356703,True,3,0,0.537447929382324219,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story sounded interesting and right up my alley, I hesitated initially because of the price. However, after reading the other reviews I decided to take the plunge. Was it worth it? I'm not entirely sure. I wish the character routes were a bit more exciting. There really isn't all that much action in the grand scheme of things, at least I don't think so. There are so many characters in this game, but you only have the choice of 10 routes. Whilst that is more than a lot of otome games, there are still many that would have been fun to explore. Also, the repetition drove me slightly mad, even with all the saving and the skipping.- there really isn't all that much variation. I would say the route which deviates the most from the others is the Brothel route- it is kind of brutal. The Brothel route is, I would say, unique in that it is unlike the typical otome dynamic and I did appreciate that, even more so because I didn't expect it. On the up side. I really liked Pashet's route, I thought the friendship between the MC and Pashet was sweet. I also really liked Caesar's route but felt there were some plot holes with his relation to the story; though his origins are revealed in the Epilogue, it does not really explain why he was obsessed with killing the MC upon meeting her even though his apparent hatred of her contributes to much of the story. Scarlet's route was lovely too, as was Soh's though his was bittersweet. I enjoyed Robin Hood's route, though it is a bit weird. Axel's is one of the more romantic routes and I really liked his character. I enjoyed Hamelin's route as well but I do wish it was longer- there is so much that could have been explored with him to make a fully developed route but he has only like 3 cgs. Likewise, the Brothel route, despite it's dark themes, has only maybe 6 cgs and little character development. The Brothel route has basically no romanceable characters- you don't get to select Manboy/Dorian/Alfani as individual routes which I found disappointing. Furthermore, the story I felt was a bit messy- because of the constant back and forth, everything felt jumbled. Whilst the Epilogue does answer some questions, I felt it could have been fleshed out a bit more. Even after playing all the character routes, you don't get any answers until the Epilogue. Personally, I think it would have been better to have the character routes hold a few more revelations and the Epilogue should have tied everything together, along with the Grand Finale. My last note is that the MC really annoyed me because she was useless, though you could argue her amnesia had something to do with that it is only a small part- she did nothing to help herself and very little to help anyone else. However, in spite of my issues with the game, I did enjoy it for the most part. I liked the original concept, the humour, the art work is lovely and the game offers a lot of content. And though I felt at times the Epilogue and Grand Finale was a bit anit-climatic, overall it was the part of the story that had the biggest emotional impact.

If you want romance, friendship, comedy, tragedy, angst, love triangles, something a little more mature, you'll be able to find them all here. 
The MC has her own personality which can simply be described as that of a child. It can be both endearing and frustrating, but if you acknowledge that as a fact, then you'll be able to finish the game without any problems.
There will be a lot of repetition and scenes that fade to black sooner than you think, but I implore you to endure it. It'll be worth it in the end.


[b]My tips on how to enjoy the game more: [/b]
1. Before you start, check the settings. Put the skip feature on ""Read"", adjust your volume and etc. When you finish your first route, the CG gallery will be added to the Title Screen.

2. Always create a save file for the day after the Meteor Shower Gathering Festival. The story usually branches from there. Some routes have love triangles, [spoiler] (namely those from Oz. Each boy has 4 endings each: 2 from their pure love, and another 2 for their transfer ending. The color red will show you which one has higher favorability) [/spoiler], create a save file when the choices begin to imply it so you can go back to it later. You'll need to finish all the routes (which is 20+ based on the game description) to be able to unlock the epilogue and grand finale. I recommend you complete your CG Gallery until only a handful are left before seeing the end. 

3. My recommended route order: Caramia, Axel, Pashet, Kyrie, Robin Hood, Scarlet, *Caramia-Transfer , Manboy, *Axel-Transfer, Caesar, *Kyrie-Transfer, Hamelin, Soh, (ending 2 for last).
* = love triangle ending, not the pure love ending


You can start with anyone you like, or who you think the MC will like [strike](if you think she'll like everybody, you're not wrong, but please don't do that for your first route)[/strike], and just work your way with this:

-Scarlet and Robin Hood should come first before Hamelin's route
-Keep Soh, Hamelin, and Ceasar's route for last. Their routes involve a lot of the other characters. 
-Manboy's route is quite stifling. You're free to skip though things you don't like, but you'll have to finish this route either way to complete your CG Gallery and access the epilogue. Keep his route somewhere in the middle.",1610257431,1610257699,True,10,0,0.64556962251663208,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Well, before I get into anything (especially the criticism) let me say that this was one of the better otome games in my opinon, but certainly not one of the best I've seen. In fact, I feel kind of conflicted. I just wanted to get this review out there because I know how confusing this game is to me and I will probably run from saying what needs to be said later on.

""OZMAFIA!"", huh? I stumbled into the world of Oz (etc.) a while ago and I have experienced a lot of different things throughout the months of playing this. As I've already mentioned, I am slightly unsure of what to think about this game, which makes reviewing it quite tough for me. Generally speaking, it's a game that includes some adorable romance options (naturally, seeing how this is an otome game), humor and a lot of dark topics. It's not as sweet as you might think so it's surely not for everyone.

I will start by saying that the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and fits the whole story extremely well. The soft colors underline the ""fairytale world"" we enter as the heroine and the backgrounds and characters are drawn very well. It is pleasant to look at and even after having spent almost 40 hours in this game, I don't get sick of looking at the art.

The voice acting (despite the fact that not every line is voiced) is good as well and I thought that every character had a voice that genuinely fit them. The voice actors did a great job at conveying the different personalities, emotions and moods according to every singular situation.

The characters are lovely for the most part. Caramia is my all-time favorite. I was happy to see someone with a sincerely kind heart who did not mess with you at every chance they get (people who've played this game will understand, which character I'm referring to). Caramia was such a sweetheart and I keep coming back to his route because I enjoy it a lot. Axel was another heartwarming character that was just too adorable to be true. He might be one of the most caring love interests I've seen in an otome game. Kyrie... Had a certain charm to him, I will admit that. However, I ended up liking him the least of the Oz trio. He was a horrible person in so many routes and the fact that he constantly manipulated others was a big ""no-go"" for me. I understand why he is liked by others but honestly, I'll exclude myself from that. Though I will add that Kyrie had the best fashion sense. His outfit is on point (especially his hat, I love that).
As for the other characters, I liked a lot of them like Scarlet, Pashet (best girl) or Caeser (who is my second favorite love interest in the game). The side characters also are interesting for the most part and improve the game's quality quite a bit.

Moving on, I would like to mention a few aspects that did not bode well with me. There are things included in this game that might trigger a lot of people like sexual abuse, drug abuse (etc.). The brothel route might be the best example for that. It is absolutely disgusting and I really had to force myself to go through it in order to get every ending. I don't mind that ""OZMAFIA!"" has this dark side to it (like how some routes dove into really difficult/controversial topics like Robin Hood's) but a complete route build on that stuff? [b]Definitely not.[/b] Though my opion is also influenced by the fact that I am not a fan of sexual content at all. Perhaps others have less of a problem with this.

Another issue I had was the whole ""love triangle-aspect"" that was part of all the Oz love interest routes. I despise love triangles in general but the way you just straight up betray/literally crush your first love interest's heart is utterly painful to do/witness. I felt horrible every time I had to go through with that. I honestly can't imagine how anyone would enjoy this (though I guess some people might think it's nice to see another character getting jealous?). I won't judge but in my opinion, it kind of ruined the main routes for me (not too much though).

The story was intriguing and enjoyable, especially the final conclusion helped a lot. The storytelling seemed a little off at times and there were a few plot holes but most of the problems were explained by the ""epilogue"". Thumbs up for that.

The MC is... Incredibly stupid. There is a reason for that, yes, but it still was kind of hard to watch from time to time. I don't really know what to think of her, I understand both sides, yet I know that this might annoy a lot of people and I seriously don't blame them. I guess you could say that she's your typical ""sweet and utterly naive (to a point where she's straight up stupid) girl"". It's up to you what to make out of that...

So would I recommend this game? Definitely. I very much enjoyed the story idea and liked most of the characters. ""OZMAFIA!"" has a few issues (most of them are minor), yes, but it's still a very well-rounded otome game overall. I definitely got a lot of enjoyment out of it and if you are not too sensitive to certain topics mentioned above (and in other people's reviews) then you will have a good time with this game as well.",1607166042,1607166042,True,19,0,0.72523653507232666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has gorgeous art style, nice music and interesting (a bit weird) story. All main characters here are characters from fairy tales.

Game has a big variety of love interests to choose, some story lines have love triangles [spoiler](Ozes)[/spoiler].

Story lines have 2 endings: good and bad. Game doesn't tell you if your choice contributes to good or bad ending, so naturally good ending is harder to find. Game has gallery for every character so you can look where some endings are missing. ""Bad"" endings are not often cruel, but they are more sad for sure. However, there is a character where both endings were sad for me...

Every playthrough starts with the same sequence of events, where weekdays you play the same story and weekends you can spend with your man of choice. Weekdays have some choices to play with, but eventually I was bored with replaying the same events. Good thing game has ""skip"" button for situations like that. 

Weekdays choices impact love triangles story lines, though.
And on weekends you can get to know your love interest better and it depending on your choices it leads to good or bad endings. 

Unlocking one ending for character will also give extra-scenes after every weekend with him, so you'll have some new content on the second playthrough if you feel like it.

Да рисовка красивая, да музыка неплохая, но на этом плюсы данной вн заканчиваются. 
Вы конечно можете сказать, что тут много рутов, да много, но только в паре из них есть хорошая концовка и не все они романтические. И из-за афигительной системы это огромное количество рутов сразу превращается в минус. А что это за система такая? Если вы хотите открыть истинную концовку, вы должны пройти игру на 99%, то есть недостаточно пройти все руты на все концовки, вам надо их перечитывать и перечитывать концовки тоже, чтобы открыть доп. сцены в них, которые не несут сюжетной ценности 95% случаев. А еще у нас тут есть возможность уйти от одного мужика к другому (но только у основных трех мужиков) и это тоже надо перечитывать!!!
Истинная концовка не стоит всего того потраченного времени и сил. Такого бреда я давно не читала. Вообще сюжет здесь плох, гг смазливая, тупая и в некоторых рутах лицемерная тварь (я сейчас бордель имею ввиду) Не говоря о том, что она ничего, абсолютно ничего не умеет и не стремится что-то делать и учиться (она начинает работать полноценно только в 2-3х рутах). Фука (гг) только говорит о том что надо учиться, но ничего не делает. С ней все сюсюкаются и няньчатся, ведь она такая особенная и милая. Честно, уж лучше бы она была простым бревном, чем все это. 
+ повествование просто отвратительное, просто какие-то зарисовки\сценки, которые выглядят как детский сад. Просто детям дали оружие и сказали что они мафиози. (ничего от мафии тут толком нет, тупая романтизация, да еще и плохо сделанная)
Ну и если вы хотите почитать сюжет, то нет, вы не будете читать сюжет, пока не начнется разветвления на концовки, до этого читайте недо-сценки. 

На счет истинной концовки для людей, которые не хотят тратить на это говно время:
[spoiler] Дороти с компашкой пришли к волшебнику Оз и тот рили подарил Льву - смелость, Дровосеку - сердце, а Пугалу - мозги. То есть эта вн срать хотела на одну из главных идей первоисточника, а именно то, что все эти  вещи были у них с самого начала. Но Дороти не смогла отправится домой и стала ведьмой. Да, именно ведьмой! И с какого-то перепугу появилось правило, что Дороти должна жить одна и не использовать магию для себя. Хотя почему-то с ней остался Тотошка. 
По итогу она превратила Пугало, Дровосека и Льва в людей, создала их город, населила его сказочными персами и стала жить в башне посередке без возможности контактировать с миром. Вам уже не тошно от этого? Дальше лучше.
Дороти создает Фуку из своей магии идеальный образ взрослой Дороти и отправляет в мир. Из части магии рождается Цезарь, с желанием вернуть Фуку. Но, главным злодеем оказывается Со, который является ВНИМАНИЕ БАРАБАННАЯ ДРОБЬ фьюзом Тотошки и волшебной башни. Бам. И оказывается, что это он раздал всем оружие, свет с ума перса и строил все козни, чтобы Дороти не хотела попасть в их мир и чтобы Фука вернулась обратно. Эпик фейл. [/spoiler]

В отличие от других новелл, все концовки в той или иной мере - хорошие.

Вкратце без спойлеров:
Руты истинной любви - в какой-то степени ваниль, с довольно чистыми отношениями.
Руты любовных треугольников - это та же ваниль, но с метаниями от одного к другому и наличием интимной жизни.

Цезарь - к этому руту я осталась особенно неравнодушна, волк был воистину прекрасен.
Со - очень милые отношения, детские и чистые. Концовки заставили пожевать стекла и были совершенно непонятны, пока я не прошла эпилог, открывающийся после прохождения всех рутов.
Робин Гуд - интересная история, местами смешная, а где-то и жутковатая. Оставила тепло в душе.
Паше - становимся подружками с девочкой кошкой, в руте нет романтики и отношений, что мне показалось довольно необычным для жанра отомэ.
Скарлетт - так же, рут без отношений и интима, было очень интересно, но обидно, что мы просто завели союзника.
Бордель - это настоящий бдсм и групповухи с откровенными сценами. Собственно, ничего странного.
Гамельн - этот рут прямо настоятельно советуют проходить последним, мол много он спойлерит по сюжету. Но, на мой взгляд, не так уж и много он открыл, т.к. каждая ветка намекает на нечеловеческое происхождение, многих персонажей. Подумать о тех же героях страны Оз (очеловеченные Пугало, Дровосек и Лев), отсылки на известные сказки и прочие пасхалки.

Эпилог - после всех хэппи эндов игры, завезли полный холодильник стекла и заботливо угостили, раскрыв весь бэкграунд происходящего, объяснив кто-есть-кто, расставив все точки и объяснив происхождение амнезийной главной героини.
Гранд Финал - чтобы смягчить полученный шок от эпилога, нам подарили все таки глобальный хеппи энд. Недовольна я только тем, что в нем не видела полюбившегося мне Цезаря.

Минусы:
- Суждения и решения героини порой казались излишне инфантильными. Допустим, что это потом объясняется глобальным сюжетом, но все равно - нельзя же настолько не знать какие-то вещи и не понимать двойных смыслов...
- Глобальный сюжет, честно говоря, мог быть лучше. Я не слишком довольна бэкграундом произошедших событий.

Плюсы:
- Рисовка, не то чтобы гениальная, но местами довольно приятная. Не то, что я привыкла видеть в играх, но свой шарм все же присутствует. Особенно понравилось как нарисован Карамия в финальной сцене наилучшей концовки, очень симпатичен Со (кроме огромных розовых глаз), не могла порой оторвать глаз от Робина и Цезаря.
- Музыка очень отзывалась настроению сцен и очень напоминала музыку из горячо любимой Паровой Тюрьмы. Это был меткий выстрел в мое сердечко.
- Разнообразие рутов и дополнительные сцены при перепрохождении. Да, были руты с некой недосказанностью, где-то хотелось больше романтики, где-то был перебор постельных сцен. Но, видимо такие контрасты, чтобы попасть в наибольшее количество аудитории. В любом случае, каждый рут было интересно читать при всей линейности.
- Длительность прохождения. Я люблю, когда в игру можно погрузиться на долгие часы, прочувствовать и просмаковать ее сцены. Как и с чтением книг, после пройденной игры, сложно взяться за новую, потому что ты сам еще в прошлой. 

Не поставлю игру на одну полку со Steam Prison, над которой я несколько ночей заливисто смеялась и горько рыдала. Но, внимания она конечно же заслуживает. Это довольно легкое чтиво, вызывающее преимущественно теплые чувства и немного слез с Со и Эпилогом. Цезарь ван лав!",1596265179,1596265179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Non è privo di pecche, perché ce ne sono, ma queste non mi hanno impedito di godere della storia e dei suoi personaggi.

CONTRO
- Doppiaggio solo parziale (per il prezzo intero del gioco mi sarei aspettata un doppiaggio completo)
- La storia principale devi ripeterla tutte le volte: ogni “settimana” sceglierai che personaggio incontrare, ma gli eventi principali sono sempre quelli. Se si considera che ci sono almeno due ending per personaggio e che per il terzetto di Oz parliamo di praticamente sei finali, direi che la cosa risulta essere un tantino seccante alla lunga.
- Assenza di vere bad ending – il che può non essere un vero punto a sfavore se non piacciono - [spoiler](se escludiamo la route di Soh, dato che sia la good che la bittersweet mi hanno fatta piangere come solo una bella bad ending può fare. Forse anche la route di Robin Hood rientra nelle bad ending mancate)[/spoiler]
- Fuka, la protagonista, per me è stata caratterizzata un po' male. Certi atteggiamenti che mostra in alcune route le trovo completamente fuori dal suo personaggio per come ci viene mostrato in tutte le altre route[spoiler]in particolare nella route del bordello[/spoiler]. A tratti sembra troppo ingenuotta, in alcuni momenti invece l'esatto opposto, e non per un discorso di evoluzione/crescita. Per il momento, fra tutti gli otome che ho giocato, è quella che mi è piaciuta meno. In più, il suo essere banderuola nelle route principali mi ha fatta storcere il naso.
- Non esiste un vero e proprio “Good choice indicator”, inoltre non è possibile accedere, come accade spesso negli otome game, né a un archivio musicale, né a quello dei vari capitoli (o delle scene – alcuni giochi come Amnesia o Hakuouki, permettono tramite l'archivio delle immagini, di rivedere la scena della CG all'interno del gioco).
- Non è un vero punto contro, ma non è possibile fare screenshot tramite i tasti rapidi (l'unica è usare lo stamp e andare su paint o simili).

PRO
- Doppiaggio fantastico (adoro Caramia, Kyrie e Caesar *^*, e anche gli altri non scherzano)
- Varietà di personaggi con personalità diverse, alcune magari un po' stereotipate, ma non vedo come questo possa essere un problema. Essendoci un'ampia scelta, è quasi impossibile non trovare almeno un paio di personaggi di proprio gradimento.
- Grafica e CG splendide, sono una vera gioia per gli occhi!
- Ottima musica di sottofondo (alcune di queste verranno riciclate anche per Steam Prison, e in entrambi i casi hanno fatto il loro lavoro)
- Non abbiamo solo storie con lo sfondo romantico, prima fra tutte la route di Pashet, e per certi versi anche quella di Scarlet [spoiler]dalla quale almeno un bacetto me lo sarei aspettato T_T. La più deludente è comunque la storia di Robin Hood IMHO[/spoiler]. 
- La storia di base non è originale (tema fiabe, tema amnesia...), ma il tutto è stato trattato in maniera coinvolgente. Ci saranno route più interessanti di altre, ciò è legato ai gusti, ma una volta arrivati alla fine non ci si può non ritenere soddisfatti dell'acquisto fatto.
- Nella Homepage verrete sempre accolti dalla voce di uno dei protagonisti.
- L'aggiunta delle Triangle Route. Sorvolo sul comportamento di Fuka che per me è stato gestito un po' male, anzì, è stato gestito malissimo, ma l'idea in sé era buona, era una cosa nuova.

Questi sono i punti a mio modestissimo parere.
Io ho approfittato dei saldi estivi, e ne son felice: il gioco mi è piaciuto molto, ma trenta euro son tanti, e la cosa del doppiaggio parziale ammetto che mi è rimasta un po' sullo stomaco ^^”.
A parte ciò credo che sia un buon gioco con una bella storia e un'interessante rivisitazione dei personaggi di alcune delle storie della nostra infanzia.
Caramia l'ho amato prima ancora di comprare il gioco, essendomi vista anche la miniserie anime (son 12 episodi della durata di soli 4 minuti, in versione deformed dove il protagonista è Scarlet), hanno scelto un doppiatore fantastico e la sua dolce personalità mi ha conquistata.
Axel è un po' freddo all'inizio, ma quando si scioglie è un pasticcino ^^.
Caesar, che è una sorta di antagonista, nella sua route si rivelerà essere poi un ottimo personaggio, preparatevi anche per l'epilogo (la sua route è una delle mie preferite in assoluto).
Soh... per lui armatevi di kleenex, e tanti!
Scarlet ha una route molto carina, che ci sta, anche se avrei preferito un po' più di romance XD.
Pashet si è rivelata una buona amica, mentre Robin Hood mi ha lasciata un po' – un po' tanto – contrariata. Hamelin non ha lo stesso spazio degli altri personaggi (a livello di route personale, per il resto compare praticamente in quasi tutte le altre storie), mi è piaciuto, anche se entrambi i suoi finali rientrano nella categoria del Bittersweet (il che non è necessariamente un male, ma avrei preferito in un vero Happy ending).
Manboy, Dorian Gray e Alfani hanno tre personalità interessanti, e non posso dire che la loro route (sì, questi tre hanno un'unica route) mi abbia lasciata insoddisfatta, anche se certe scelte di Fuka mi hanno fatto dire “Ma che, davvero?!”, o anche un “No, ma sei scema o mangi sassi?”. Alcuni risvolti erano anche parecchio inquietanti ad un certo punto, ma ho letto e visto di tutto, quindi ce ne vuole per scandalizzarmi.
Ho lasciato per ultimo Kyrie nel mio elenco per un motivo ben preciso: ha una personalità un po' particolare, che se da un lato coi suoi “Baka Lion” e altri insulti, rivolti al povero Caramia, mi ha fatta sorridere, dall'altra mi portava a provare pena per i poveretti che dovevano averci a che fare. La sua route mi è piaciuta soprattutto nel finale (la CG è un qualcosa di super tenero, con Caramia sullo sfondo in versione deformed), anche se certi suoi comportamenti non mi piacevano molto (tende a scherzare un po' troppo e a insultare neanche troppo velatamente la gente che gli sta attorno).
Arrivata all'epilogo e alla grand ending ho completamente rivisto il suo personaggio, se già prima mi piaceva, adesso ha superato sia Caesar che Caramia. Per me è il miglior personaggio del gioco, e uno dei migliori dei vari Otome che mi son passati fra le mani. 

Ozmafia me lo aspettavo un pochino diverso dato il titolo, ma già dando un occhio alle illustrazioni, e leggendo qualcosina a riguardo, avevo intuito che non sarebbe stato così crudo (anche se non mancano i momenti che mozzano il fiato). È un ottimo gioco e mi ha intrattenuta parecchio, mi ha divertita, indispettita, intenerita ed emozionata.
Alcuni passaggi forse sono un po' frettolosi, la scena col personaggio di riferimento e la storia principale a volte non è poi amalgamata così bene, ma, per quanto mi riguarda, a fronte di tutto il resto, si finisce col passare oltre godendosi comunque la storia.
Grazie ai saldi l'ho pagato solo 20 euro, e mi sento di consigliare l'acquisto soprattutto in frangenti come questi. Merita di essere giocato, ma ritengo che il suo prezzo di partenza sia un pochino alto.",1594074334,1594074334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It looked so well produced, it looked so promising. However... I ended up very disappointed and even a bit insulted... if you are a more mature otome, who likes deep, immersive VNs with intriguing story... this prob is not for you. Am I getting too jaded/too old for this? I dunno, maybe, but hear me out here. 

To start off, the soundtrack was just so cheesy. They actually went and played Amazing Grace during a sad scene!!! The intro alone is already super cheese/boyband-y. 

Another annoying thing were the cuts between scenes, that were almost like commercial break cuts in anime, but occured wayyyy more often. Every single time you cut between scenes, you'd be greeted to the same still image, with a little jingle playing, that is unskippable, and lasts for a good ~5 seconds. It's not so bad, until there's quick scenes between you & your boy that last maybe like 3-4 minutes, and they just keep cutting that in and bringing you to you & your group again, it gets so tedious and tbh it's also super cheesy.  

So the first scene was promising, it seemed tense and eventful, but after that, everything goes down to a boring halt. You have amnesia, where did you come from? Does anyone care? Nope. Do you care? Nope. Just live your carefree life and have fun, you amnesiac darling you.  

Gameplay wise, it was so boring. The game feels like a slice of life anime almost, where each day is a different event that does not play into an over-arching story, theme, or mission. A beauty contest one day, shopping in town another day, a random attack that resolves itself fine since all the mafiosos are on silly amiable terms anyway, etc, but nothing that connects the events together or gives them meaning. 

The art style is lovely, airy, and delicate, but I guess that made it difficult for me to get immersed. I couldn't really figure out a character I liked anyway, they all seemed very odd and unrealistic.

I played Dr. Crow as my first route, since he seemed the less cringey to me. I kind of enjoyed it once it finally started to pick up a tiny bit and go down his story route, but it had a pretty unsatisfactory ending and was a big let-down of a route anyway. He admits that he doesn't love you, and there's no romantic scenes with him, unless you count the time he drugs you and sleeps with you out of nowhere before using you to help with his own twisted relationship issues. I replayed picking opposite choices but all it did was give me the same ending (there's only like 6 CGs in total, I got 5 so I'm sure I didn't miss anything too drastic), but you could see some of his thoughts the second go around (each time, ofc, is after and before another stupid cut and jingle commercial break). Interesting, but nothing that I couldn't have imagined already, considering he made his interests and thoughts pretty clear. 

I might play again to do the Wolf guy since he's kinda cute and also seems to know who you are. Maybe it'd give me some intriguing story and maybe something more interesting, but I think grinding through this game again would only confirm that I actually hate myself a bit, so maybe not.",1593805990,1593806958,False,33,5,0.732855856418609619,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is not for everyone. The routes all start off rather tame, but then quickly shift to WTF. Several endings have dubcon and noncon (implied and described), and can be rather graphic in their descriptions of violence and sex. 

If you are interested in knowing more about the specific characters and routes, then continue reading below as I go into more detail without giving too many spoilers. If you want a surprise, well, just start playing and good luck! (I really recommend a guide though, there are just too many endings)

[h1]Overall Impression[/h1]

To start with, the heroine is SO DUMB.[spoiler]This is eventually explained.[/spoiler] At first, this greatly annoyed me. But after playing for awhile I've come to the conclusion that this is intentional for comedic effect. 

Despite the fact she's dumber than a box of rocks, she never lets it get her down or deter her. She's well aware of just how stupid she is - and she seems to embrace this. [spoiler]In fact, it's why Kyrie even falls in love with her.[/spoiler] She doesn't mope and whine and sit around acting confused and lost - instead she actively tries to learn and do what she can, even if that just causes more trouble. Her simple and earnest nature is often the punchline for jokes, but at the same time makes you love her. 

After accepting the fact that the heroine is so unbelievably stupid, and understanding the sort of humor present, I was able to enjoy the game for what it is. Don't take it too seriously (at least not in the first half). [spoiler]It's worth it for the Grand Ending![/spoiler]

[h1] Game play[/h1]

The story itself is broken up into small, short scenes that give you a chance to interact with the different characters in the game. Each ""week"" of in game time, you select a new character to visit. As a result, the game gives off a very ""slice of life"" type vibe and can feel rather disjointed at times. It doesn't have a good flow, so this may be very aggravating for some people.

Each route needs to be played through twice (route, not ending) because new scenes open up on the second play through that reveal some crucial information about what was going on behind the scenes.

All of the routes follow the same pattern, with Caramia/Kyrie/Axel having a love triangle element to their story in the middle-

 1) Common/shared route. Character specific scenes depending on the route you are trying for. This portion of the story is rather lighthearted. Innuendo abounds. It's fun and there isn't really anything too serious or important occurring (though you do learn a lot about the characters and setting through multiple replays). Yes, there is some violence, but nothing like what happens in part 3. Your choices here determine the route you will take.

2) (Caramia/Axel/Kyrie only) Awkward love triangle phase. Your chosen partner has some sort of personal crisis that leads to them questioning whether or not they are good enough for MC. Honestly, this was my least favorite part of the entire game. SO.MUCH.WHINING. [spoiler]Caramia wasn't so bad - but I HATED Kyrie during this part and wanted to smack some sense into Axel.[/spoiler] Your choices determine if you continue on the original partner's route or ""transfer"" to the other character in the love triangle. 

3) The Ending part. We finally get to see some more intimacy (usually) between MC and the chosen partner. This is also where the story finally progresses and where things often take a very abrupt, very dark turn. You go from joking about the MC's breast size to watching the love interest choke on his own blood so fast you get whiplash. It often gets graphically violent. [spoiler]Thankfully the love interests are blessed(?) with immortality and crazy healing abilities, so no one dies. Though they do go a little crazy at times.[/spoiler] Your choices determine if you get the happy ending, or the ""bittersweet"" ending. 

[h1]The Guys[/h1]

Oh boy. 

[b]Caramia[/b] - the leader of the Oz group. He's charming and sweet, and innocent almost at times. In his endings we get to see a different side of him which is umm...sorta adorable but possibly extremely annoying to some people. 

[b]Axel[/b] - the awkward, shy, quiet guy. So much adorable blushing. [spoiler]And honestly, he's very clingy which you may or may not enjoy.[/spoiler]

[b]Kyrie[/b] - the sadist. Kyrie was probably my favorite character. (I will admit I did like him much better as a love triangle partner on one of the other character's routes.) He never failed to make me laugh. During the love triangle part of his own route though, I really wanted to kill the man. HE IS AWFUL. [spoiler]In his endings, he is very open with his affection towards the MC, which I love.[/spoiler]

[b]Scarlet[/b] - sweet young love. Scarlet is a little blunt and unsociable at times. There isn't a lot of romance in his route, but it's still very sweet and enjoyable. [spoiler]There's an element of ""star crossed lovers"" to his story.[/spoiler] 

[b]Hamelin[/b] - this man just needs a hug. Seriously. His route is entirely too short though, and my only complaint is that it isn't longer. If he had a longer route he could have easily become my favorite (sorry, Kyrie). After playing Scarlet's route you should have a pretty good idea of what his personality is like. [spoiler]He reminds me of Levi from Psychedelica of the Ashen Hawk.[/spoiler] 

[b]Pashet[/b] - this is sadly not a GL route. Instead it's a platonic friendship/girl power route. I like Pashet's character a good deal, but her route itself left a lot to be desired. It was longer than Hamelin's but his seemed to have much more substance to it. 

[b]The Brothel[/b] - the infamous Brothel Route. With how much people complain about this route, I was expecting a lot more sex than I was given. But, following a similar pattern to the other routes, once the ending started it took a very sharp turn into dark and twisted. There is a lot more sex at the end, and it's described rather graphically.

There are 2 endings for this route, but unlike other routes both are rather bittersweet and dark. The ""good"" end was one I enjoyed reading and was very happy with. It was well written and I like how the MC developed given her situation. The ""bad"" end had a much different feel to it, and was even darker- there is a lot of implied noncon and dubcon. 

[i]Very little to the overall plot is actually revealed in The Brothel route, so if you are at all uncomfortable with the concept, feel free to skip it entirely and enjoy the rest of the game.[/i]

[b]Doctor Robin Hood[/b] - sexy doctor man. [spoiler]Probably a yandere.[/spoiler] His endings felt so rushed and caught me off guard. There is dubcon present, so be warned. Like the other routes, it takes a sudden turn into dark and twisted territory.

[b]Caesar[/b] - adorable tsundere wolf boy. I didn't think it possible, but he's even stupider than the MC. But he's so freaking cute! There are some big plot holes that aren't answered in his route, but it's still enjoyable.

[b]Soh[/b] - sweet, mysterious character. His route will make very little sense at first, so be sure to play it last. 

[b]Epilogue/Grand Ending[/b] -  Most (all?) of your questions will be answered, and plot holes filled here. [spoiler]After completing one ending from each route, click on the book the girl is holding on the main screen. This will start the Epilogue. Once the Epilogue is finished AND you've completed ALL endings, click the book again and read the Grand Ending.[/spoiler]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you can accept the game for what it is, I would recommend it to you. It's dark, with lots of innuendo and off color humor. (thanks Kyrie!) 

If you're looking for a serious, romantic game with healthy relationships and a capable, intelligent MC, this probably isn't for you.",1593720400,1593838816,True,41,2,0.813878536224365234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game was absolutely worth it. Each love interest has a unique personality with unique thoughts. Every character slowly makes you love them in some way. Or at least they did for me. I've played a few Otome games, and usually there is always one character that it just a chore to do the route. and I just get it done to get it done. I didn't have that problem with this game. I was invested in each of the characters. I wanted to know why they did the things they did. And the humor..guys the humor was so on point especially with the Oz boys. I chuckled, snorted, spit water, and down right laughed out loud with this game. If you are like me and you are looking through reviews to see if a game is worth the purchased boy howdy is this one worth it. 

now a slight caveat to my praise above. I am about to list somethings that may make some people hesitate on buying. I personally don't think these things take away from the game or make it worse. They are just the other side of the coin.

The first thing I want to mention is my praise above does NOT include the brothel story line. That line really messed with my brain. There is no specific ""target"" in this story and in all honestly I was a bit uncomfortable the whole time, and I""m not one to be squemish about sex and paid services like that. It was not something I expected when I started the game (although with Dorian Grey as one of the characters I probably should have). But it was there so I completed it. There are a few other story lines that touch on some very dark subjects, but this one was real harsh.

The other thing I want to point out is that when going through some of these routes you will be confused. There are some things that happen that are just not explained and don't make sense when you get the ending. It's not until you've done someone else's route or gotten to the super final route that things start to make sense. For me this didn't bother me. I actually enjoy that ""ah-ha!"" moment when you are realize that a character was acting a certain way for this reason that you find out later through other means.

But is it completely worth it? I don't know. I keep having breaks in between, I started this game since DECEMBER. 
I only managed to complete everything despite how painful it was, where I basically gave up where I still were missing endings (specifically the love triangle in the oz group- A COMPLETE HEADACHE) and used a guide!??!! 

There were times where I completely accepted cheesy and cliched scenes where I just adored to bits! Then other times I just thought it doesn't go well with me, I was just Tired of it. 

Also I feel like no one mentions how... awful... absolutely painful the loading screen IS!!! I am haunted by the melody. No. Really. You would go through so many, and make the story go slow after the first read of the main/common story before the routes! That is why it felt so difficult to me, because it's best to 100% this otome to read the epilogue they give afterwards- however it requires so much patience and skipping, that also feels like because of the constant skip read-text takes me out of the moment, read new scene with whoever's route, then skip, new scene, skip. It's hard to take it in nicely since you have to run over this long common route, sigh.

Also I hate the ending, whatever, cowards. Pashet's route disappointed me. A certain fella's route also felt very brief to me. Brothel route, ""Thanks. I hate it"". Also I'm going out and say Caesar is an a**hole so I had this constant undercurrent feelings of severe distaste despite sweet moments that happens like any other. 

I don't know, I feel like I only truly appreciated 2 of the guys that felt right and absolutely cute with the protag. I feel like I think too much about ages with ""sweet"" protags a lot, so I guess that doesn't surprise me why I feel like that when looking at the bigger picture. Hm. Also why is her name Fuka??? Shouldn't she get something... european at least? Idk felt weird to me. But I don't know, maybe that's just me.

While it's not totally bad, I think the game's cons heavily outweigh the pros. The game's premise seemed interesting, and the characters/visual style is very colorful, as it draws influences from various literary sources. Sadly, once the game begins, it loses steam very fast. Instead of spending time developing the plot, we instead are treated to a bunch of conversations with the characters that come off as pretty boring. And when the game actually attempts to focus on its plot, the writing comes off as pretty clumsy.  As a reader, I felt very disconnected from the story and I hardly cared for the most part. 

Anyway, it is by no means very bad, and the Epilogue was actually an interesting read. But overall, I don't think it was worth the price and I highly advise to buy it on discount (tbh, I don't think it's enough even on discount).

Personal favorites were Scarlet, Hamelin [/spoiler] (their routes weren't very good though) and Caesar (only good route in the game IMO).",1588306309,1588306309,False,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I bought this game years ago, but I haven't written a review for it until now. So, Ozmafia is an otome game where you play as an amnesiac young woman with all the characters being based on fairytales. We have characters from books written by famous authors like Lyman Frank Baum, the Grimm brothers, Oscar Wilde and more.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Gorgeous art. The colours, the character designs and CGs are all beautiful. 
- The voice acting.
- The BG music.
- Plenty of save slots.
- Love triangles. Several otome games do have routes where another guy has feelings for the heroine, but few have the option to completely switch lover in the middle of the route. If you're playing Axel's route and end up in a love triangle with Caramia, you can switch to have Caramia as your love interest instead. I think it's an interesting feature, but I also think they could've been written better. Because if you do decide to switch love interest, the game makes it seem like you and the first guy never even dated.
- Lovable characters. We have the adorable sniper Scarlet (Little Red Riding Hood) and the reliable leader Caramia (Cowardly Lion). By far my favorite routes. Axel's (Tin Man) route is cute too. He's the typical ""robot learning how to love"" kind of character with an unhealthy love for sweets. And then there's Pashet (Puss In Boots). Although I don't swing that way, I didn't mind playing her route at all. She's without a doubt the best girl in Ozmafia. And, again, why is there no route for Hansel? He's the second best character in the game! He's the positive, half-insane brother of Gretel and may or may not enjoy blowing people up with dynamite. What's there not to love? If they ever make a DLC with a route for him, I'll gladly buy it. The last character I like that I want to mention is the hilarious bad boy - Caesar (The Big Bad Wolf). Him showing up to kidnap and/or kill you is basically a running gag.
- You get to participate in a beauty pageant with your opponent being a duck. No, I'm not kidding. Her name is Juliette.
- Personally, I'd say the dialogues are fun to read. I rarely skip conversations even though I've already seen them 10 times [strike]unless it's with Kyrie[/strike].

[b]Neutral[/b]
- The fact that you need to play all routes and get every ending in order to unlock the grand finale. While I think it's good to have the players keep playing the game, I don't like that the game forces you to play the disgusting Brothel route.
- Soh and his route. The route is pretty cute. However, while the good ending does make sense, it was still pretty underwhelming. I can't think fondly of him either considering that he's the one who [spoiler]made Hamelin kill Robin Hood's wife[/spoiler]. I couldn't case less why he did it. It doesn't justify the damage he caused.
- Hamelin's route. I like Hamelin, but he definitely has the least memorable route despite being the don of the Grimm famiglia and [spoiler]a criminal[/spoiler]. How are you even supposed to figure out how to get on Hamelin's route without looking at a walkthrough? Just from the player's curiousity about [spoiler]how the Oz trio would react to getting rejected[/spoiler]?
- Robin Hood. Almost everyone knows about the legendary thief who steals from the rich to give to the poor, yet there's [i]nothing[/i] connecting this character to the ""real"" Robin Hood other than his name. Still, he has the most beautifully tragic route and I can't help but feel sorry for him after [spoiler]the death of his wife[/spoiler]. An important thing to mention for those who are planning on playing his route is that you might feel uncomfortable playing it because of a certain scene. Just saying.
- Only Caramia, Axel and Kyrie can be in a love triangle. I kinda wish there were more of them. There was definitely an opportunity to write love triangles featuring Caesar x you x Soh, Scarlet x you x Hansel/Hansel x you x Gretel, Pashet x you x Bercy and Robin Hood x you x Hamelin. But that's not really a big of a deal. It's fine the way it is too.

[b]Cons[/b]
- The protagonist (You can rename her). Oh boy. First of all, how could you possibly mistake Scarlet for a girl? And during his route, the MC becomes quite frustrating. Instead of explaining to Scarlet that [spoiler]she had to officially join the Oz famiglia in order to save him, so the two of them wouldn't be able to be together anymore[/spoiler], she [spoiler]completely ignored him without explaining anything[/spoiler]. The poor guy thought he had done something wrong and ended up having to [spoiler]beg her to talk to him[/spoiler]. She had no excuse to be doing this to him either. After all, [spoiler]the rules forbid her from being with Scarlet, but they don't forbid her from ever talking to him again[/spoiler]. And then there's Kyrie's route. MC has no problem with being harassed by Kyrie. One of these ""jokes"" is when he tells her that he likes ""large"" women. What does she do? She starts eating like a pig until she feels ill in order to get fat just so she can be physically appealing to him. Where is your [i]dignity[/i], woman? The fact that she's allowing Kyrie to treat her poorly because she ""loves him"" is absurd. And don't even get me started on how she acts in the Brothel route. The level of stupidity that she shows during that route is so high that she [i]deserved[/i] the Brothel route's normal/bad ending. But that route is a separate point, which I'll be getting to soon.
- Kyrie and his route. Did you really expect me to like the MC being a doormat for Kyrie? Am I supposed to find it amusing? Am I supposed to feel sympathy for her? It doesn't matter what the answer is because it doesn't change my despise for his route. I've never even liked Kyrie as a character - for obvious reasons. I'll give him one thing though. The sincere sadness he felt when [spoiler]everyone except him forgot her[/spoiler] and seeing him desperately try to [spoiler]make Caramia and Axel remember her[/spoiler] was heartbreaking. And to be frank, Kyrie is the only character whose normal/bad ending I prefered over the good ending.
- The Brothel route. This route made me feel so uncomfortable. I didn't even want to play it in the first place, but - as I mentioned earlier - you [i]have[/i] to play it if you want to reach the game's final chapter. It's the only route where both endings are bad, in my opinion. The only reasonable character at the brothel is Manboy, although Alfani isn't that bad either.  But even so, a kinda likable character and a reasonable character aren't enough to save this route. It's unsettling, disturbing, toxic and should not exist. I still can't believe that this garbage got a route but Hansel and Gretel didn't. And speaking of the brothel, of course I have to mention the scum of the game - Dorian Gray. A holy man of the church? HA! He's a [spoiler]murderer[/spoiler], and [spoiler]executes the women who become pregnant at his brothel[/spoiler]. Then there's him declaring [spoiler]the MC as dead so others won't come looking for her[/spoiler] and - if you refuse to give in to him - will literally [spoiler]keep her as a prisoner until she becomes a brainwashed, living doll[/spoiler]. Wouldn't it have been better (and healthier) if Manboy and/or Alfani [i]rebelled against Dorian[/i] because they want to protect you from him and from the brothel itself? Good ending: they win and the brothel cease to exist. Bad ending: Dorian wins. Why couldn't we get that instead?

[b]Final words[/b]
Despite the cons (which I feel strongly about), they are easily outmatched by the pros. I absolutely love Ozmafia and it's one of my favorite otome games.

Because of this, I ended up on a character's route that wasn't even in the main story- which was an emotional rollercoaster. I grew to like his character so much that I lost interest in playing the other routes for 4 months!! XD

So far, it's been an alright game. Parts of the story tend to drag, but there are interesting scenes and an aura of mystery surrounding the world of Ozmafia.

(I hope my review makes sense as well)

OZMAFIA!! isn’t a straightforward otome game. It requires you to play through (almost) every ending if you want to get hints about the story of the town. To explain, you might think there are tons of plot holes or that some scenes end in cliffhangers when you finish one ending of a route but those plot holes are filled when you try to get the other ending of the same route. That’s because another scene (often where Fuka/MC isn’t present) is added in when you play through the route again to get the other ending so you get an explanation of what happened. I personally found it fun (it's like solving a mystery) but this might not be your cup of tea. 

In my opinion, the game isn’t much focused on romance but it’s more focused on the story and the characters. I know that otome games are supposed to focus on the development of the relationship between the MC and the capturable characters but don’t expect much from this one. So if you want an entirely romance-focused otome, I don’t recommend that you play this one. If you want a plot-focused otome or if you enjoy making your own theories out of lore as you play, then you can give this game a try. That doesn't mean that the characters aren't likeable btw. I enjoyed seeing them interact with each other.

It’s a given that not everyone will like this game but I enjoyed playing it from start to finish. The characters are based on fictional characters so refreshing my mind about the literature they were based on was fun.

~Suitors~
I'm going to try to keep this review with as few spoilers as I can. I have not finished all the routes, but I will say the ones I have completed are all unique. In fact, something I saw in this otome that I haven't seen in many others is the idea of changing your romantic partner half way through. What I mean is, even after you've ""chosen"" your preferred mate, other potential suitors can still confess there love for you and even pursue you. So your never really stuck with one person. This is not true on all routes, but I thought it was worth noting. One of the reasons I highly recommend getting this game is because of how different they all are. There's even a potential female suitor even though I have not played that route yet. This game has so many options! You will never get frustrated because you saw a really cute side character and they weren't available. I wish some of their routes were more beefed out, but they did amazing with what they had.

~The Main Character~
Ozamafia follows the typical otome stereotype of amnesia. The girl is quite dumb and doesn't understand many of the things that are going on. In my opinion, I would perfer a mc that is a little more head strong or at least has her own opinion about things. Depending on the route the mc is dumber. On the doctor route it was quite frustrating for me, but what can you do? I understand that she has amnesia and is not very aware of how the world works at the beginning, but I just wished she were a little more savy. Despite my complaints the mc isn't completely unbarable. She does have her good points, and she is really pretty if that helps.

~Time and Playthroughs~
I have 46 hours currently documented on this game and I've done about five (succesful) routes. The game is very easy to navigate and they have a skip option that works really well. I'm only noting this because in some otome games the skip option goes really slowly or it pauses every 5 seconds (Uhg). The settings page is also really easy to understand and navigate. Once again noting because some otome games don't have this. As for playthroughs for me, I just saved all the screens where you choose a character and it makes it easier to go back just in case you mess up, because you will. 

~Optics~
This. Game. Is. Beautiful. You can hate the oc, you can hate the suitors, but you cannot hate the amazing views in this game. I can't say there is one ugly suitor or less desirable suitor. The backgrounds are also really nice some aren't ""gorgeous"" but they 

~Do I recommend?~
YES YES YES. This game is more than worth the full price, and you should definetly buy it if you can afford it. Im still getting through my playthroughs and I will update this if anything changes. But if your into otome games then you NEED to play Ozamafia! I promise you will not regret it.

My review takes both experiences into account and is coming out before the Nintendo Switch port of the game.

I would recommend OZMAFIA!! to others interested in dating sims, otome games, or visual novels. The cast is memorable--unique, even, compared to other games in the genre. Their voices are a treat to listen to throughout the game. The world is fleshed out and fascinating. It's clear from the first run-through of this game that a lot of love was put into the project by the writers. The way the narrative is constructed is clever, teasing the reader with information that makes them stop to think, and inspires them to keep playing. It's an enjoyable otome that I [i]want[/i] to 100%. I've put some hours into it, so I obviously enjoy it.

Fuka is my least favorite visual novel MC ever. There are odd translations and typos that other users have already recorded. There are an annoying amount of transition screens. When sprites are zoomed in, it's easy to see the ""flaws"" in the art, and the case could be made that the art hasn't aged well (though I'm a huge fan of the art style). A touch-up on the things reviews and discussions have mentioned over the years would be great.

I would [b]not[/b] recommend OZMAFIA!! as Baby's First Visual Novel, at least if Baby wants a straightforward visual  novel experience. Compared to other otomes of the same type, OZMAFIA!! is challenging for two main reasons:

- The story expands as you play it; the player can go back to the same scene after passing that scene or playing another route and new information will appear. Some scenes don't appear in the first run at all. Even knowing this, it still surprised me to see how it impacted my view of characters and their relationships. (This has been most significant with my opinion of Kyrie as I replay in 2020, as I've gone from actively disliking him to considering him one of my favorites.)
- Completionism is rewarded and, in a way, encouraged despite the game not having achievements. You won't ever have a full picture of the story unless you read the Epilogue and Grand Finale, which can only be unlocked by achieving 99% completion. Aside from the CG gallery there isn't an efficient way to keep track of your completion, meaning that if the player is going for the gold they're going to do a non-zero amount of suffering to get there. 

Both of these could easily be addressed in the Switch port (and in the Steam version) with the minor addition of a tracker of sorts--one that tracks ""hidden"" interactions the player has seen and one that tracks the endings they've achieved. Not all VNs do this, but in one as complex as OZMAFIA!! I think it would be a worthwhile addition. 

Neither of these are to say that someone can't enjoy OZMAFIA!! unless they 100% it--it's totally reasonable to only play through the routes that you want There's still an entirely different story under the main premise of the game, and in this way, OZMAFIA!! is reminiscent of Dandelion and Nameless. That's something I, personally, am into, but not every player is, and that's okay. OZMAFIA!! can still be enjoyed for what it is on the surface.

It's a good game. I enjoyed playing it. It did feel very... professional? Like, yeah i love the quality but it missed the mark on passion. Ooey-gooey romance stuff, that's what we're here for. The romance was sparse even for the obvious main love interests. Don't even get me started on the others... [spoiler] Soh and Scarlet [/spoiler] were my best boys. I actually loved these boys but they didn't get any happy endings! And all the endings were very abrupt. I played a LOT of otome (ahem) so I'm used the the ending and epilogues being nice and drawn out as a reward for dealing with the usually awful heroine's antics. I looked away from the screen during an ending once and I was back on the title screen. I didn't even expect it to end there-- it felt like they didn't finish their thoughts. Romance 4/10!!!

The storyline.... well, I can dig it, I guess. A good amount of plot points made me roll my eyes. I expected something pretty deep, what with the foundation of the story being an amnesiac girl dropping into a world where people fight and kill over nothing. It was very shallow, and there wasn't any violence. I played Alice in the Country of Hearts otome(good luck finding that anywhere these days...) and they did it right. Basically the same plot: violent world, nice girl. Except you know, there was violence. There were stakes. You felt like characters would kill one another and the world made them insane and violent. Here, they give the emptiest of empty threats. There's no actual mafioso conflict!?!?! I really wanted to see hot guys fight over me, so major let down there... But it could have been worse. Let's give it 6/10 for worldbuilding+plot.

Characters.... Some were very forgettable, but maybe that's just taste. What I remember was HATING the heroine at many many points. I get the the boys are supposed to have less of a moral standing, but damn the heroine [spoiler]slept with another man right after an argument with the current love interest. And the man she slept with is his best friend like damn why???[/spoiler] You will find some lovable love interests in here, but you won't be happy finishing their route hahaha. And the side characters? Who? If i squinted my eyes, all i saw was Cliche Background Character 1, 2, and 3. They had ""personality"" i GUESS. Their personalities could be summed up with single word at ALL times. No deviation, no nothing. Some of the main cast could be summed up with TWO words, i digress, so... Characters 6-7/10. Nothing special.

I think the developers didn't have any passion for the product. I didn't feel like they had a story they wanted to tell or felt love for the characters we were supposed to love. If you don't love the love interests, then neither will your audience. All in all, it was a decent addition to the otome genre, but maybe next time I'll look for something with a tad more romance...",1582935504,1582992033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

OZMAFIA!!（OZ黑手党!!）是由Poni-Pachet SY制作的一款乙女向视觉小说，大致讲述了一个失忆少女fuka（芙卡）在被人追杀的情况下彷徨不安，独自在陌生的城市不断徘徊，在危急时刻被支配当地城市的黑手党奥兹家族所救下，并且受到了他们的庇护，而这一切在她背后所发生的却又是家族之间的斗争旋窝。

[h1]游戏的考据&科普：[/h1]
OZMAFIA!!（オズマフィア）实际上是由Dramatic Create和Poni-Pachet共同制作的乙女向视觉小说，早在2013年就以光碟的形式登录PC端，后于2015年2月登录PSV平台，此次在2016年登录Steam平台的版本应该是PSV的移植版本。后续衍生出同名漫画，并在2016年7月改编播出同名泡面番，由于番剧弱化了黑手党属性转而校园风，虽然能够比较简洁明了的了解个人的属性和关系，但实际对游戏并没有帮助，可以算是一个平行世界企划。

Mafia一词实际与黑手党并无任何关联，是中国国内意译的约定俗成，在历史考据中源自“Morto Alla Francia, Italia Anela”（意大利文的“消灭法国是意大利的渴求”）的缩写，实际是历史战争遗留的产物，后用于通指一些黑社会犯罪团体，并不单独指意大利裔的犯罪分子，但是非常有趣的是意大利拿波里的犯罪组织一般不称为“Mafia” 而是“Camorra”，应该算是本土的一些风土人情，另外在阿拉伯语中“Mafia”一次指的是避难、逃难，根据实际的历史进展，“Mafia”原本指的是为了防范入侵者而自发组成的民兵自警团，后续演化成了一些犯罪组织，也是我们经常在一些作品里能够看到收到当地民众爱戴的原因。

[h1]游戏的体验&分析：[/h1]
首先要提到的是，鉴于本作最早是在2013年左右发售的，到现在为止时间跨度较大，因此在部分细节表现上可能会和现在一部分玩家的喜好冲突，我姑且把这部分称谓游戏受到了时间上的机能限制，并且在部分战斗画面的表现形式上受影响较大。

本作大致上讲述了一个失忆少女收到黑手党保护的剧情，由于乙女游戏的惯例玩家是可以自己起名的，不过本作还特地的迎合剧情搞了个失忆的设定还是比较有趣的，整体的内容就是一边和黑手党之间度过的日常，偶尔推进一些主线，其中会时不时出现一些火拼剧情，大体上能够说是温馨愉快的。

从画面上来看，本作并没有选择浓墨色彩的风格，整体上偏向柔和亮丽的色彩，让这个画面充满了一种淡水彩风格，确实能够更好的体现出一种温馨细腻的日常风格。从人设上来看女主芙卡是一个积极向上的女孩子，非常善良温柔，性格非常软糯讨人喜欢；caramia是奥兹家族的BOSS，虽然说是Boss但是和女主说话一直都是温柔的笑着，符合勇敢狮子的设定；kyrie是奥兹家族的顾问，城府比较深，一肚子坏水，如果是和芙卡单独相处时挖苦较多，不过和奥兹家族一起时显得非常靠谱；axel是个死傲娇，并且每次受伤的都是他，说实话奥兹家族的三位在一起的时候真的非常温馨，相互补足这点非常棒，不过也让我感觉女主完全无法插入他们的铁壁之中。pashet是一位一本正经的女骑士也是长靴家族的BOSS，虽然表面威严但是其实少女心爆绷，也是我去见次数最多的一位，性格上与女主芙卡真的非常切合，一方面要强的她却也意识到了自己身为女性所存在的不足之处，并且在不断的努力，确实是一只严格而又温柔的猫。而剩下的两个家族安徒生和格林其实出场戏份不多，但是成员人设都还比较有趣，就不细谈了。音乐方面整体上是偏向童话风的温馨旋律，能够较好与画面搭配渲染出温馨的日常。

本作整体上是按照好感度加成来算路线的，每天都有一段固定的主线，主线推进完后会进入自主选择见面的模式，选择与人见面后会基本上在小剧情里会出现一个加成选项，我选择了与pashet见面，随着对她越来越多的了解，也发现了她对自己的苦恼，而女主芙卡却是一个聆听的好对象，她虽然严于律己表面严肃，但也还是有软弱的一面，也有少女心的一面，越到后期越会发现她的那份笑容和害羞是多么宝贵，而她又是多么一个逞强的人。结果我越到最后越想了解她反而进入了pashet的支线，在个人结局里pashet开了一家甜品店。实际上本作的结局非常之多，如果是选择了奥兹家族三人组的路线就会进入三角剧情，随着好感度高低会出现恋人和情敌的要素，据说在这个三角路线里还分成了纯爱线和NTR线，让我觉得略微有点奇妙，不过我实在不愿意破坏三人之间的调和于是选择了别的个人路线，还是让奥兹家族的三个男人一台戏吧。
[/quote]

[quote]
[h1]最终总结：[/h1]
OZMAFIA!!（OZ黑手党!!）作为一款乙女向视觉小说来看，虽然在时间的跨度上较大，不过在诸多细节方面仍然能够较好的表现出自己独道的内容，即使选材是有点争议的黑手党题材，略带童话色彩的画风和音乐也能够渲染出一种温馨细腻的日常风格，并且在人物的塑造上能够较好的把控性格，回避了乙女游戏一贯存在的性格过于偏激的问题。本作推荐给喜欢温馨细腻风格乙女游戏的玩家。

没有中文需要打补丁，但是epilogue和the grand end以及Caesar end没有汉化需要啃英文。因为是黑手党设定里面用词很多非常生僻，都是意大利式英文，但是有些地方翻译的还可以，令人会心一笑。（WE NEED CHINESE!）

画面满分，童话感很足，人物表情刻画的很传神。只有75%配音差评，女主没有配音差评。演出效果负分，神（精病）一样的转场，情节断片化，这一秒人物还在剑拔弩张，下一秒黑屏了，然后大家都和和美美在一起？？？中间发生了什么，观众一脸懵逼。需要打二周目才出现第三人称视角的补充，强行拉长无意义的游戏时间，体验极差。大部分战斗剧情儿戏化，都是你来我往回合制，但是··· ···乙女游戏嘛，就不要求太多了。我第一遍因为没有专心刷一个人的好感而进入了哈梅尔线，但是这个人的线非常不适合第一遍走，要配合医生线和小红帽线才能体会到，反正进入NE的我简直是火冒三丈，因为我什！么！都！不！知！道！糟糕的叙事让我想当场放弃。我完全不知道发生了什么，哈梅尔之前做了啥？为什么会突然黑化？女主为什么突然喜欢上了他还为了他当了修女，这哪跟哪啊？（摔鼠标）

我最最不喜欢的还不是断片式表演，而是神奇的女主。失忆的女主我见多识广了，最著名的失忆症，黑蝶，等等，为了给玩家一个更好的代入感。但是抱歉，OZMAFIA!!里的女主Fuka完全没有给我代入感，因为这个角色太令人难以忍受了，愚蠢（这是我的雷点，我可以接受懦弱的，自私的，圣母的主角，但是我唯独不能接受愚蠢），并且愚蠢到近乎白痴的程度的，不仅如此，还非常没有眼力见，傻乎乎地做出一些伤害别人的事，在某些场景又会变得非常绿茶婊。于是我要强行扮演一个既没有智商也没有情商，完全靠别人的善意生活的女主？简直强行喂屎。

可攻略角色都非常可爱，这也是我打了推荐的原因。Oz家族的三个人真是太好了！我永远喜欢狮子先生！小红帽虽然不戳我但是他的线写的蛮好（[spoiler] Scarlet这个名字也太出戏了 ，ps,格林家族的双胞胎也有萌点，结合起原著感觉非常微妙，笑[/spoiler]），帕榭小姐非常帅气，百合赛高！大灰狼的线虽然不戳我但是他在epilogue里强行刷了一波好感。其他人就有点微妙了，各有各的雷点（sou的线要配合真相线才能体会到雷点在哪）。娼馆线的女主非常无脑，但是假如你熟悉王尔德的故事就会发现深深的虐点，[spoiler] 为了他人把自己的一切都奉献出去徒留了一具空壳的快乐王子和追求自由却被束缚在人渣手里的燕子，太惨了，道连格雷纯属人渣 [/spoiler]。医生线的女主非常婊，[spoiler] 但是罗宾汉有妻子这一点我觉得符合原著的，虽然这个故事里的妻子和玛丽安完全不一样[/spoiler] 。至于强行NRT的操作确实非常迷，逻辑也非常奇怪，NRT之后的初始对象也大度的不像话，但是意外的，只有走NRT才能获得高甜剧情？？？

与之前的脑残剧情相对的真相线才是全部游戏的精华，但是需要解锁所有人物的线之后才能进就非常令人烦躁。真相线虽然也有强行降智的成分，但是好歹也勉强自圆其说了。以下剧透[spoiler] 熟悉绿野仙踪故事的我熟练地给女主起了Dorothy的名字，结果！Kyrie说，你确定你真的失忆了吗？我建议你换一个名字，因为这个名字对我有特殊意义。得，我能猜到结局了。在grand end里，Dorothy真的非常可爱，我立马喜欢上了她，和Fuka完全不一样，我甚至可以理解奇利耶为什么会暗暗想，为什么回来的是你不是她了，因为Dorothy这个小姑娘比Fuka要成熟好多啊，哭，并且配音也可可爱爱。并且结合起op和部分医生线，真男主奇利耶真是得到了剧本娘的完全偏心，烘托的整个人物都立起来了，并且好戳人泪点。但是回过头一想他的线路就令人如鲠在喉了，太难受了。[/spoiler]

Story wise it was not good. I only have done one route and it was hard to read. You know the general gist of what’s going on but the rest is dialogue.

Things weren’t explained and some things happened way to fast. No descriptions on emotions or events (festivals) that went on. It was just like this is the event, a couple people from town with dialogue and done. You don’t feel involved in any way. Not with the person you choose, not the story and it’s just bland.

The only thing that is good about this is the music and art. I like the guys but I wish I knew more about them.

这应该是我为数不多接触的乙女向游戏，有印象中的接触过的乙女向游戏就是大名鼎鼎的追梦游戏Blood Code。一开始感觉毕竟作为一个男生玩这种乙女向游戏应该会很膈应，结果玩起来居然感觉异常的良好（雾）。 [/spoiler]

前言

OZMAFIA!!是Poni-Pachet SY公司制作，由さとい担任原画的乙女向恋爱游戏。游戏于2013年发行，于2016年在steam上发售。Steam版游戏由ManagaGamer代理发行。

游戏的画风很细腻，而且音乐也很出色，基本上就是一大群帅哥围着主角一个人转，人物的细节画的还是挺不错的，而且人物的塑造方面不会给人那种人物像纸一样立不起来的感觉，人物形象有立体感。虽然并不是100%语音，女主的语音基本上全程没有，但是cv的配音基本上全程都在线，整体给人的感觉还是很不错的。

游戏简介

游戏的名字OZMAFIA，OZ是游戏中的黑手党家族的名字。游戏的主角，失去记忆的少女Fuka，孤身一人身在陌生的城市，结果遭到了不明身份的人的追杀。在这时候伸出援手的便是游戏名字中的OZ家族。说实话，这一开始的剧情，就给人一种浓浓的网络小说气息，但是千万别被游戏开头的简单剧情给迷惑了，这游戏有足足20+的结局，而且虽然这游戏吧可攻略男主的脸在我看来都差不多，但是不同的线路有不同的分支剧情和结局，其中有几条线的剧情甚至还有劈腿和百合。[spoiler]（这真的是乙女向游戏该有的东西么2333） [/spoiler]

游戏中的绝大多数出场角色基本上都是出自童话故事，如OZ家族的三巨头设定便是出自《绿野仙踪》，还有于《格林童话》、《穿鞋子的猫》、《罗宾汉》、《卖火柴的小女孩》等很多童话故事有关或者出自其中的人物。游戏中有三角路线，三角路线中主要由奥兹家族的caramia、kyrie、axel组成，其他人的路线都是个别路线。三角路线中第二个亲密度高的角色将成为情敌，然后会展开不同的剧情。

剧情

在剧情方面，由于我只玩了几条线路，并没有把全部的可攻略线路都解锁，我玩出来的几条线，有几条都是比较偏纯爱的恋爱线，听说解锁True ending需要每个可攻略角色都至少达成一个结局，Ground Ending需要达成全部的26个结局才能解锁。

女主的白纸设定其实有利有弊，虽然能够更好的让玩家把自己代入进去，但是现实中应该很少人会像主角这样的天然呆吧233。在攻略人物的期间，如果你在死心塌地的攻略某一个角色的时候一个不小心选错了选项，这就进入到了这游戏最有特色的劈腿环节了，会自动劈腿到另一个可攻略人物上。[spoiler]（其实看来挺不可思议的233333） [/spoiler]

游戏的好感度系统也较清晰易懂，好感度上升有很明显的提示，如果像走纯爱路线只需要跟着游戏的提示走就可以了。

总结

   这游戏是一个挺不错的乙女向游戏，画风吸引人，而且音乐制作也很不错，很契合场景。而且在立绘方面，一眼看过去全都是帅哥。就以上这几点就已经完美符合受众人群，虽然在人物语音方面做的还是不尽人意，没有做到100%的语音，但是cv配音水品在线，与场景契合度高。在剧情方面，游戏的可选择路线多，不同的路线也有不同的分支，而且多周目还有不同的内容，一些线路的剧情内容十分丰富，但有一些的内容实在是有些干瘪，毕竟可攻略人物太多，要做到一视同仁实在是有点困难。

   游戏的总评的话，满分10分，我觉得最少可以达到7分至8分，除了几个小的扣分项，其他方面还是很不错的。推荐人群的话，肯定是乙女玩家了，我觉得大部分的乙女玩家应该都能喜欢这个游戏。

Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.

THIS GAME HAS ENRAGED ME. I waited quite patiently for this to go on sale, because it's rather expensive in my currency. But upon finally getting it, I started to drag myself to play it... which felt wrong. It says 6 hours, but a couple of them I just forgot it running while doing something else. I went in blindly and managed to finish Caesar's route, which wasn't bad - it was rather cute. BUT!! It was not exactly satisfactory.

PROS:
-Beautiful art style and enjoyable character design. Although a bit too bright at times, the style really fits the fairytale setting.
-Nice voice acting.
-Many endings and characters to pursuit
-Good translation job - didn't feel awkward while reading even though I didn't enjoy the writing.

CONS:
-The first disappointment was regarding the port itself - that made playing fullscreen a no go, because it becomes too pixelated. I think it was important to get a proper fullscreen to make the beautiful art enjoyable.
-Do I need to talk about those annoying fake loading screens? Is there anyone who enjoyed that?
-THE WRITING: whenever something seemed to be going somewhere, it got axed. Chopped. Cut out of the screen. This made the writing feel rushed and shallow... and boring at the same time; 
-Story: it seemed promising, but the bad writing made it a waste;
-FUKA (or whatever name you give her): she's your typical cute, happy go lucky, dumb shoujo manga heroine whose whole personality is based on not having a personality. 

I could go on, but that would make it seem even more like I'm picking on the game. Perhaps I just went in with the wrong mentality, thinking it would be a more serious game, when it doesn't seem to be it.

从本作的名字就大概能知道游戏的内容和童话世界相关，可攻略的三角线与个别路线角色也大多与童话相关：
①OZ三巨头设定明显出自《绿野仙踪》
②格林家族（人物原设出自格林童话，作者为格林兄弟或经由格林兄弟进行收集改编收录）
   Hameln（花衣魔笛手）
   Scarlet（小红帽）
   不可攻略角色：Gretel和Hansel（糖果屋）
③长靴家族Pashet（Puss）（穿靴子的猫）（百合线）
④娼馆线（取自奥斯卡·王尔德的著作）Dorian·Gray（道连·格雷的画像），Alfani（快乐王子中的王子），Manboy（快乐王子中的燕子）
⑤医生线（Sherwood舍伍德森林，即罗宾汉居住处）Robin Hood（罗宾汉）
⑥可攻略角色Caesar和So（Wolfgang或沃尔夫冈）出处未知
其他不可攻略角色比如海蒂家的Heidi（海蒂），安徒生家族Ande（卖火柴的小女孩），Aelling（丑小鸭），Melisus（拇指姑娘）取自的作品基本都是广为人知耳熟能详的故事。

而且本作曾经出过总长度12集的泡面番，有兴趣的话可以快乐的吸一吸。
（似乎也出过舞台剧，但是资源好像并不是那么好找。）

[h1]剧情与攻略建议与正经吐槽[/h1] 

基本剧情就是失忆的女主不知道因为点什么突然被不知道哪个大帅哥追杀，然后大帅哥一拥而上把女主给救了，然后女主就在那住下来推推剧情[strike]劈劈腿[/strike]，每周全勤选择路线，最后抱得帅哥归（Pashet是百合线，除外），然后推着推着最后就了解到或是胃疼或是裹着一口玻璃碴子的糖的真相了。
但具体甜度因人而异，对于我个人来讲，哪怕是娼馆线都很有意思，更不用提那对于我来说简直是闻所未闻见所未见的乘换劈腿系统了，简直是太有趣了。（汤川学脸：実に面白い。）

因为游戏是全年龄向的所以其实就算是HE也十分清水（虽然成功乘换或者娼馆线可能会有点超出清水范围的鬼畜内容），而且二周目攻略同一角色会追加新剧情，所以在攻略之前建议提前规划好攻略顺序以及攻略方向。
（True End需要所有可攻略角色都至少达成一个结局，Ground End需要达成所有26个结局，进入方法为标题画面女主角Fuka手中的书。注：True End略虐）

设定方面采用了一张白纸失忆女主设定（虽然有点天然[strike]呆[/strike]黑元素），还独特的加入了主动劈腿系统，如果一方好感度没有某一方好感度高，自动劈腿，继续吃糖，而且劈腿线比正常路线爆点还要多甜度还要高，但若是专心想要攻略某个角色然后一不小心选错了点什么突然劈腿可能就会觉着这设定鬼畜极了，虽然对于我来说觉着其实还好，可能是因为我个人对有毒的东西免疫已久。
再一个就是[spoiler]剧本可能会强行喂屎，而且还是喂得猝不及防戛然而止那种，具体怎么喂的可以推一下医生线或者Hameln线自行懵逼。[/spoiler] 
好感度获取方面其实比较容易得到提示（如果想走纯爱线就选有提示音的选项就行了，走劈腿纯爱线[spoiler]（……）[/spoiler]的话初期选择没有提示音的选项，进入路线后选择有提示音的选项即可。）

[h1]总结[/h1] 

其实本作在当年确实算得上是乙女游戏良作了（虽然跳过票），音乐和画风细腻，立绘不管怎么看都是大帅哥，一颦一笑牵动人心，堪称一绝，哪怕是放在现在也毫不逊色。虽然并不是全语音，但两个真相线里女主有语音，且CV配合场景演出水准始终在线，这一点也导致了曾经有人吐槽剧情时候说颜和声音不要可以送人23333
故事线很多，结局也很多，CG也很多，一些路线写的十分丰满，能让人快乐到原地转圈，另一些路线又写的过于简单有些草率有些牵强，所以很难去直接定义剧本到底写的是好还是不好，这点就仁者见仁吧。

如果硬是让我说个推荐人群的话，我觉得应该是“善于接受新事物的有耐心的能把游戏当作崭新体验的乙女玩家”吧。

I won't say it's because of the plot though. Though the plot is pretty good, it's full of holes to the point where it gets annoying. What drew me in is the magical atmosphere. Ozmafia takes place in a fantastical town where a cast of quirky characters based off Western fairy tales roam, with most of them being mafia members who reside in different famiglias. In the main group, there's our typical bishounens--the outgoing and friendly ""prince"" type (Caramia), the quiet and sincere tsundere (Axel), and my favorite, the intelligent, sadistic af troll Kyrie. Oh, Kyrie. I love you, but I hate you, but I love you...Moving on. These men are in charge of the Oz famiglia, and they take the heroine under their wing as she struggles to regain her lost memories. The other characters besides the big three are also great, and I enjoyed seeing them interact amongst themselves as well as with the main group.

Now as for the heroine herself, who I'm sure has become infamous among the otoge community. MC is just...a total moron. I'm pretty sure being innocent and naive does not excuse an MC to do the dumbest things to the point where she practically needs adult supervision despite being a grown-*ss adult herself. Still, overall she's not a terrible heroine. She still has positivity and sunshine going about for her, which isn't bad at all, and it's endearing to see how the guys change because of her influence.

I like how Ozmafia doesn't shy away from drama and tragedy in its plot. Although sometimes it can be a bit much--the brothel route almost made me barf from how unabashedly explicit it was, and there was a very detailed description of a violent act at one part--which can be off-putting to the whole atmosphere. However, this shows that Ozmafia isn't simply just a romance game, but also has a strong theme of war and underlying politics. Thus, you'll get a pretty epic otoge.

The music is nice, with a few tracks that pleasantly surprised me (one of them is Caesar's theme) and the OP and ED both. However, the best part of the game hands-down for me is the absolutely gorgeous art. I'm a sucker for soft, romantic artstyles so Ozmafia's was right up my alley (and the artist also did the art for Diabolik Lovers!). As for the routes, there are plenty to suit your individual tastes, but I do feel that the game suffered from a case of ""quantity over quality"". A few of those routes could have been left out in my opinion.

Still, I feel that Ozmafia was worth the number of hours that I sank into it. The setting was lovely, the characters were great, and it transported me away to a magical world with a healthy dose of action and heart-fluttering romance. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a little enchantment in their lives. <3",1575972463,1615927186,True,11,0,0.650757730007171631,0,True,False,False,False,,,

本作是Poni-Pachet SY公司制作由著名的黄油大厂MangaGamer发行的一款乙女恋爱游戏。本作最早发行是2013年，而且已经有了衍生动画，虽然是泡面番，不过因为是学园欢乐向也可以体验到游戏中不会有的另一种风格，而且游戏作品是乙女向，但番不是，如果对乙女接受不了的可以去体验体验番剧哦，虽然是腐向的...

简单说一下剧情吧，就是说女主失忆，在这个什么都陌生的小镇上，开局就被一个狼人（大帅哥）追杀，说着“你是我的猎物”这种话，女主就拼命的跑，然后邂逅了狮子（大帅哥）稻草人（大帅哥）反正都是大帅哥把女主给救了下来，之后被他们收留（绑架）的女主慢慢的了解到了这个小镇并不太平和家族纷争之类的事，并且在接下来通过了解各种大帅哥，和他们加深感情，推进剧情，慢慢的得知最后的“真相”。

说到剧本本作的线路很多，并且还有好感度的设定，文字量也是海量，想要完整体验还是最好按着攻略来，但要说剧本好不好，我只能说如果你想体验轻松甜蜜的恋爱之旅那最好还是三思一下，有很多的情节可能会令你适得其反，你可能会看到一个本来很清纯的女主人公突然转变了画风，一堆严肃认真设定的各有气质的大帅哥们互相过家家的打架（玩游戏），我也说不清楚这款游戏究竟适合什么样的女玩家，毕竟我是个男的，硬要说的话如果你喜欢ntr，喜欢装纯，把男性代入女性，把女性代入男性，没有多么高要求，那么你可能会喜欢这部作品？相比于光鲜亮丽的美术，本作的剧本实在是没有达到我心目中的要求，但毕竟是童话风格，就是应该儿戏一些，对吧？[strike]对个屁，剧本有毒[/strike]

[h1]画面&音乐[/h1]

本作最大的亮点其实就是画风和音乐这一块了，由さとい担任原画，就是风闻小镇那位画师，独特又柔和舒适的画风带来的视觉体验极佳，除此之外由Article One演唱的《I love you more》也是令人印象深刻，占了篇幅75%左右的cv配音其实也深得我心，相对于有毒的剧本来说本作在画面和音乐方面的水准绝对是超额了，但唯独就是“真相”之前的那些线路和情节会令你困惑不堪，莫得办法。这些加起来如果说你问原价购买值不值我肯定会说值，毕竟国区挺便宜的，但我得提醒一下，游戏全程英文，如果你想啃那么需要有足够的英语水平，其实我也找不到汉化补丁，我也没辙了。

[h1]总结[/h1]

本作拥有数量足够且质量很高的cg，并且画面风格也非常的适合各种口味的人群，另外音乐方面和配音方面的演出水准也非常的高，并且各色人物对应的线路也很多，玩家的选择可以影响剧本的走向。但本作的剧情上确实有诸多不足，特别的挑剔玩家，如果说你能接受得了上述的种种问题，那么我还是推荐你来体验的。",1571228002,1571228002,True,2,0,0.516743719577789307,0,False,True,False,False,,,

There is, however, one glaring issue with this VN - and it's its main character. 

I am no stranger to otomes with bland MCs with no free will of their own - it's something that often cannot be avoided in this particular genre. I'm not a fan, but it's usually okay. Unfortunately, in OZMAFIA!! we get that same bland MC with no free will of her own - but this time, she has one (1) defining characteristic: she's endearingly stupid. Yes. That is her feature. Stupid, ignorant, naive and incredibly sweet. Nice mix, wouldn't you say? So nice, in fact, that instead of a more or less mature female protagonist we end up with an oversized child as our main character. Do you see?

In this game, you're basically playing as a child. 

Cute? Hell no. Wrong on so many levels.

And this is precisely why I can't deal with this game.

2016年7月6日，一部叫做OZMAFIA的泡面番在BILIBILI上独家上映了，讲的是男主人公Scarlet转学到了奥兹学园，被卷入了某件麻烦事。在他面前出现并帮助他的是，Caramia、Kyrie、Axel这三人。学园风加上可爱的萌系画风吸引了很多人的关注，虽然短的连泡面都煮不熟，但的确是一部值得一看的泡面番。

其实这部泡面番并不是全原创，三位主角都是来自同名的女性向视觉小说，只是背景世界观和故事完全变了。原来的女主fuka也被新男主Scarlett替代了。虽然每集很短,但都表现出了性格特点。亦是因为世界观全部重构，这部泡面番是一部无论是新人还是游戏玩家都能看得下去的优质动画。

接下来讲一下游戏本体，游戏讲述的是失去记忆的无名少女，在陌生的城市里彷徨不安。她突然被人追杀，帮助她的是支配这个城市的黑手党家族奥兹家族。勇敢的狮子，狡猾的稻草人，不懂人情世故的铁皮樵夫，被这样的他们保护会展开一段什么样的故事呢？

阅剑知其主，游戏名OZMAFIA，OZ意为奥兹家族，而mafia意为黑手党，可以说是有点官配的意思。

从介绍中就可以知道，本作隐射了弗兰克·鲍姆著的童话绿野仙踪，但仔细想想，却又并不违和。稻草人——一心想要得到能够思索的脑子。铁皮人——一味想要一颗活跃的心的伐木工。狮子——拼命想要获得勇气的胆小鬼。和本作中三位主角有异曲同工之妙。

其实本作中含有的童话并不只有绿野仙踪一部，还有诸如小红帽，罗宾逊等童话梗，看似简单，但其实世界观非常大。

游戏的线路文本量挺大的，但没有较好的节奏感，使得部分流程免不了有些无聊。个人不太喜欢的是在不同线路中女主的性格会有变化。游戏总体故事先苦后甜，结尾质量不错。

最为亮眼的其实是本作的画风，曾经画过风闻小镇的さとい老师的原画质量非常的高，有一种赛璐璐的感觉，立绘和CG也是同样的优秀。但是可惜的是本作虽然有CV但是配乐不全。
 [/quote][quote] [h1] [b]附加：[/b] [/h1]
喜欢本作的玩家可以尝试一下PSV版的移植作品OZMAFIA!!-vivace。PSV版比起PC原版来说进步了很多，最为直观的便是全CV，UI也是为了适应psv而重构了，甚至连背触都用上了。PSV版还增加了许多可攻略角色，基本上所有角色都可攻略，但是因为文本量巨大，节奏感不佳的问题被扩大了。

[h1]耳目一新的音画[/h1]

音画作为一款AVG的主要外包装，作为吸引玩家的第一要点，其质量直接关系着玩家想不想去玩、游玩时体验如何，而这款游戏在其外表上无疑做得相当漂亮。画风上虽然仍算是日式萌系画风，但其风格却和常见的日系作品相去甚远。画面上色细腻，过渡自然，整体饱和度偏低，有种水彩或是彩铅的感觉，看上去极为舒适柔和。具体到角色，发梢和表情的绘制特别值得称赞，尤其是不同角色之间富含感情的表情。和立绘相比，CG的质量还要更胜一筹，CG中淡化了线条感，使得人物和环境的结合更加自然，观感也更舒适。且不论质量，9名男性角色都有四张起步的CG，在数量方面也是诚意满满。
游戏的BGM和画面相同，数量质量皆有保证，在众多场合都有切合时宜的背景音乐烘托气氛。加上那首动听的主题曲""I love you more""，着实是种享受。（好感UP的选项会有特殊音效也是一个很人性的小细节）

[h1]一言难尽的剧情[/h1]

游戏的画面和剧情简直就是两个极端，画面有多舒服，剧情就有多难受。游戏流程中，玩家需要不时选择该时间想要见面的男性，并在对话中选择选项，增加好感度，推进剧情。游戏角色众多，线路繁杂，各个线路的男性会给玩家带来不同的体验，但有一点绝对是相同的，膈应的体验。游戏中的各条线路中，大量充斥着儿戏一般的家族斗争、NTR、撩骚有家室的男人、莫名其妙的XXX等等内容，带来的体验极差。走这条线走的好好儿的，哎，线路突然就转到那个人身上去了，整个感觉就好像在刷自己的职业本，莫名其妙掉了其他职业的装备一样。一条线NTR也就算了，更虎的是几条线都有这种狗屎发展，哦豁！女主到底是个清纯女生还是个心机bitch，我作为玩家已经搞不懂了。纵观各条线路，各有各的shi，对于三观正常，寻求甜美爱情故事的玩家，这款游戏的剧情宛如毒药。

[h1]总结[/h1]

优点和缺点都相当明显的一款作品，外表精良，内在诡异，仿佛一块精致的糕点，里面塞的馅料却是黑暗料理。对于想要放松地感受一段温馨美好地感情的玩家，这款作品并不是一个很好的选择。

I play alot of Otome games and the amount of time I HAD to spend on this game only to get disappointed is astounding. Found out there's a bug- specifically for AXEL IMAGE 5. That you can't always get. So I just went ahead and played the rest of the characters hoping that It'd show up if I Played through again.  WRONNNGGG. 
This game has NTR- which I just discovered was a thing. 
I did genuinely enjoy most of the characters- but there was uh- some cases of clear sexual assault that other people have reviewed up before.
I am honestly but upset right now that I AM STUCK at 95% because even though I went through AXELS route at least 20 separate  times now. Trying to get that last image to get bumped up to 98 for the grand ending, it's not going to happen because of a bug. 
So I am very upset that I can't finish this game, considering the amount of time and money I spent on this. Other people have also apparently had issues with this but it's not been taken care of yet apparently. I pretty much have given up on this game. When It gets an update I may try again, but until I can 100% get the grand ending it's not worth it. So I wasted money on a game that took me forever to even get through. 

I know I've gotten all the ending, just not trigging the final CG for bitter sweet because it has the dialog.

Felt like I truly lived in a town with everyone in this story - I laughed at the usual banter in this new home; smiled for the kindness everyone showed me; felt troubled at times because of them; felt deeply worried for the troubles they faced; and finally, cried hysterically at the end of it all. It's true when they say some parts are flawed. It was definitely awkward at times! But deep down, I will always remember this world as a home filled with warmth and happiness. I wish I could keep reliving this game feeling as blessed by it as I am now. 

Not all routes are perfect, but they all further shape characters and their story. The story further fleshes out when you replay for other endings and finally the epilogue and grand finale. 

OZMAFIA!! is like a magical puzzle. Each character is like a blurry puzzle piece. Each puzzle piece you place down, it clears up ever so slightly. Then, when you place the final puzzle piece, it bursts with unexpected colors. It truly shines at the end of it all, but it takes a bit of patience and effort. To me, it was definitely worth it.

Please support this game and try it! And if you do try it, please consider taking your time to go through each ending to unlock the grand finale. 

Have a memorable journey!

On my second playthrough I found myseld smashing that skip button and dreading to get through the common route sequences. I hated the common route, despite the interesting premise, I hated most of the ""fluffy"" interactions between Fuka and the Famiglia Oz. The common route just seems to lack any focus and does whatever it pleases at the moment; you are just getting through some weekly routines and then interacting with the guy of your choice during the weekend, and this repeats itself until Week 10 or so and then something happens. I found it hard to take the drama seriously though because the tone of the game seems all over the place. It is a strange game. 
For that reason, my first route (Caramia's) took so long to complete. Then I did Scarlet's. I enjoyed his character much more than any of the Oz guys and the romance was very cute, but the problem was that the romance was at the stage of a strange unconfessed crush until the very end, unlike with Caramia who had a solid relationship with Fuka. Then I started doing Brothel and got bored and stopped playing, even though I try to be a completionist with visual novels and read all the content available, actually read it and relive the story through different routes. In most cases this leads to some kind of a true route, and this game has some a grand finale that explains everything. I really wanted to get to that point, but the unfocused common route skipping got so boring that I am probably not coming back to it any soon.

Usually with visual novels I am hesitant to pay upwards of AUD$30. However with Ozmafia I'm currently about 40 hours in and still have yet to complete all the possible routes. I mean Id still suggest waiting for a sale, but if you are impatient and have enough money to pay full price its probably still worth it.

真相线真的值得一看！虐的我眼泪都要掉下来了！虽然要每个角色至少通一个结局才能在开始界面点女主的那个书
看完真相线再点一次那个书可以看GE，缓解一下被虐的心情

和其它人看法一样，优缺点都非常明显
画风非常美，立绘和cg都非常好看
剧情的话没看真相线给三分（满分五分），看了TE，GE之后四分！
真相线真的值得一看，毕竟这个游戏也不算很便宜，看完不白买啊！
糖度非常少，满是玻璃渣的暗黑童话，我只在Caesar线和Caramia线感受到一些糖。。。Axel貌似还行但不是我的菜所以几乎全程快进，没怎么看他的剧情，还有劈腿线也有一些糖，但也没有很多qaq，如果为了磕糖玩这个就算了
词汇的话大二狗觉得大学水平就够用，没什么特别难的词，实在不行可以下一个词典，而且这个英文版据说翻得不错

缺点也很突出，一直转场叮叮咚咚的真的很烦
有些剧情这个线二周目才可以看，意味着最好这个线先跑NE再跑HE，要不然可能觉得对方好感度来的莫名其妙的
对于一条线不跑二遍的姐妹来说可能不太友好
还有个人原因不太喜欢劈腿系统，对我来说这个也算雷点吧，劈腿完必啪怎么回事！明明前面还是全年龄劈完腿就R15了
而且主系统也没什么特别的，想攻略谁一直选他就可以了，选到正确的选项会有提示的声音

以下有一点点剧透

从因为狮子的立绘种草这个游戏到现在已经好几年了，当时以为是那种甜甜的披着童话皮的黑手党家族恋爱故事，现在才觉得当时的自己是多么的天真
不过作为表官配，Caramia真的太可爱了！拔枪的时候那个角度看蜜汁像宋仲基，而且个人线HE是全篇唯一一个结婚结局！最后cg笑起来那么好看！！！跑完他的线都不想跑别人的线了，不忍心看他难过啊，失去笑容
里官配好像是Caesar，当时刚跑完娼馆线心情无比复杂，跑他的线瞬间被治愈了，应该是全篇最甜的线了，傲娇，口嫌体正直，为了女主跑去端盘子简直可爱到不行
然后是真官配Kyrie，刚玩的时候不是特别喜欢他，感觉女主追着他跑，他并不是特别喜欢女主，不过看完TE，最长情背负最多的也是他，果然太聪明背负的烦恼也多啊
还有剩下的三巨头Axel，喜欢吃糖这一点还是挺可爱的！面上看着很正经但内心一点都不正经！！

The music is nice, fitting and doesn't overpower or get annoying.
The art is good, the voice acting is high quality and overall it's a nice experience.

I mainly got annoyed by the main character but I feel like this is the same character type most of these games use so it gets a pass on that. I've played these type of games enough to be used to it (But it is a nice surprise when it doesn't follow the same format)
The translation was done well for the most part. There were some mistakes I noticed but nothing a regular player would see right away or get bothered by (Foolish fool made me laugh pretty hard)

One of the things that bothered me was the lack of explanation of who the amnesiac character was. This question keeps hanging in every single route and it started bothering me for a while until I got to the Epilogue and grand final endings. Of course it's quite obvious who the MC is or seems to be but some extra stuff in the 20+ routes there are would be cool. Ceasar declaring the MC as his prey is still a questionmark for me however. Don't think they handled that well. 

Also I recommend playing Soh as your last route cause those endings left me extremely confused without the grand ending. [spoiler] Also I liked Soh until the grand ending. I don't like him all that much anymore. [/spoiler] I'm kinda sad you barely get any interactions with Hansel and Gretel they were two of my favorite characters and I would have liked to see them more. Even in Scarlets route they were quite lacking to me.

If you love fairytale references this game is a lot of fun. The game is high quality and has replayability by adding a lot of extra scenes after completing a route. Caramia gotta be my favorite route he's precious. I also loved Scarlet, it was the first route I played and he's just so sweet. Kyrie I disliked at the start with how he treats the MC but after going through his route he's okayish.

I was first drawn to this game because of the art-style resembling Diabolik Lovers (which I'm a huge fan of), but after playing a full route, I can say the story is nothing like that of Diabolik Lovers, but it is still great and so are the characters.
I am making this review after only completing one full story and getting one ending, so there is way more to the story and characters than what I can say.
I experienced Scarlet's ""happy""? / ""normal""? end, and oh boy. I enjoyed it. But, I was also incredibly disappointed. Not much romance happening. No kisses or cuddles or nothing. It felt more like a cute crush story than anything else.
But! This could be a problem with only Scarlet's story. Maybe it would be strange to have such a relationship with a guy that looks so young haha
But reading up on some other reviews, there does seem to be more romance with other characters.
There were parts in the story that were just confusing. There were also some anti-climatic scenes that were clearly supposed to be a big deal and intense, that would just... suddenly end... and the next day, everyone acts like nothing even happened. (Again, I am speaking for Scarlet's route, the others might be better!)

The voice-acting is good, but not great. When there are intense scenes, everyone just seems really chilled most of the time. Not sure what that's all about. (Let's just pretend it's a mafia thing!) It is also not fully voice-acted. So, there are scenes and dialogue where there is no voice-acting at all. But, thankfully, most of the story seems to have what we want!

Pros:
- Amazing art
- Mafioso Husbandos 
- Cute music
- Interesting story
- Decent voice-acting
- Backgrounds and emoticons
- Scarlet (because he is best boy)

Cons:
- Not fully voice-acted
- Can be anti-climatic
- MC is really stupid
- Annoying 'loading screen' that happens like 100 times in one route
- No achievements
- You can't take screenshots in this game without researching how to and following a long step-by-step guide. It's very frustrating.

《OZMAFIA!!》是一款由Poni-Pachet SY制作，MangaGamer发行的以童话为题材，乙女类型恋爱向多结局AVG游戏。女主人公Fuka醒来之后发现自己在一个陌生的地方，甚至不知自己的基础属性，突然眼前出现的男人想要杀她，但是幸运的是，她被三人组所救下，并且被带到其的羽翼之下给予庇护，因为她深不知背后是激烈的家族斗争。游戏也就从此进行展开，女主Fuka能找到属于自己的道路吗？

[h1] 游戏的画风	[/h1]
游戏的画风充满着欧美的艺术风格，尤其在人物的立绘有着相当明显的凸显，男士们大多绅士偏偏，女士们大多温文尔雅，而且还能感受到画师那高超的绘画技艺，因为对每一个人物的细节的把控都很细腻，特别是面部的绘制，将每一个人物的表情都展示的充满魅力，其中我最喜欢眼睛的感觉，因为我觉得可以从眼睛中看出一个人的特性，颜色的运用也是炉火纯青，将每一个场景都绘制的如梦似幻，将童话的特点显著突出。

[h1] 游戏的音乐	[/h1]
游戏的背景音乐的绘制也是充满魔力，除了渲染了游戏剧情的气氛之外，还很好的带动着游戏的节奏，玩家也可以更好的融入游戏的氛围之中，特别是当你选择要拜访的男主角之后的剧情，这时的音乐将会有一种童话般的感染力，而且更可以促进女主人公和男主人之间的感情，所以喜欢谁就请多多拜访他吧！

[h1]游戏的剧情 	[/h1]
游戏的结局数量相当的多，所以想进入自己喜欢的线路是需要一定的选择才可以进入的，而且一旦选择不利，就会进入BE了，所以进行游戏的时候需要经常进行存档，以防选择出现失误。然后我就说一说其中的狮子线，刚开始看的时候感觉狮子是一个阳光并且有点的二的人，但是随着剧情的进行，你会感觉其实并不是酱紫，他和Fuka在一起感觉更像父女的关系，而且能在流星节表白之前能够明显感受到其对Fuka的好感，然后就是很多日常的事件的互动，感觉很是温馨，一起同甘共苦，比如晚上一起下酒馆（我只能说Fuka妹子的酒量是真的不行，一点点就直接醉了= =），还哄骗AXEL帮助他们一起消灭咖喱的摊子（真的聪明），特别是酒醉后的Fuka显得特别的可爱，十分粘着狮子，不让他走，这样的妹子有谁不爱呢？最后还有婚礼现场哟，可以感受到Fuka是十分幸福的。游戏对于剧本的描写很是细致，对于人物性格的塑造也是很不错，让我们可以更好的了解游戏中的不同人物的秉性，这样也将会有更好的游戏体验。

[h1] 游戏的优点	[/h1]
+细腻高质量充满欧美风的画风
+多结局的游戏走向
+应景的背景音乐
+人物性格的完美塑造

[h1] 游戏总评	[/h1]
总的来说，这款游戏可以说是一部不错的乙女类作品，如果你是乙女类作品的爱好者，来体验一下这款游戏，相信会有不错的体验。

While the game had a few positive aspects, its serious flaws greatly outweigh them for a gameplay experience that was at best tedious and at worst so upsetting that it took me completely out of the narrative. For the sake of those who would appreciate warnings about these topics I will warn you that the following in-game routes contain emotional abuse, sexual assault, and/or sexual enslavement of the main character: [spoiler]Kyrie, Robin Hood, and Manboy/Brothel[/spoiler]. If you would like to read the rest of my opinions on the game, here are some of the things I noticed while playing through it:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
The game has a few things it did well. The artwork is beautiful with a watercolor style that lends itself well to the fairy tale concept. The voice acting was varied and emotive without being disruptive to gameplay and the music was well matched to the scenes.  New scenes from the love interest's point of view become available upon replay. Lastly, the game's concept of Fairy Tale characters becoming mafias was an interesting premise.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
This game had some serious problems in its writing, character development, replay value, and most of all content choices. 

[b]Main Character[/b]
As other reviewers stated, the main character is not just naive or ""innocent"" but incredibly stupid in a way that goes beyond what amnesia explains. She makes poor choices, lacks depth in personality, is very pliant to whatever the other characters want, and overall has very little to make her stand out as a character. She is incredibly helpless and does not develop throughout the story into anything else. Overall, this was frustrating to sit through.

[b]Writing and Pacing[/b]
This game is long and poorly paced. The first time playing through is enjoyable, but becomes incredibly tedious to sit through to get all the endings for the epilogue and grand finale, even with the skip feature. The writing often left me struggling to see how a relationship could grow between ""Fuka"" and the chosen route's character.  Kyrie's, Caesars, Hamelin's and the Brothel routes were especially bad about making a story that showed how the characters could fall in love. I was most disappointed that the only female character route was [spoiler]purely platonic[/spoiler], as Pashet is arguably one of the most well rounded characters in the game. The epilogue was predictable but not satisfying. The grand finale was extremely short with little payoff for the amount of time you have to spend unlocking it.

[b]Replay Value[/b]
While this game has a lot of endings, the length of the story makes replaying it very boring. The addition of extra scenes is helpful in the first replay, but only makes additional replays even longer to get through. The Ozmafia ""loading screen"" between every single scene also adds to this. In addition, the epilogue and grand finale endings do not give a pay off to justify the amount of time needed to get all the different endings.

[b]Content[/b]
Some of the routes in OZMAFIA!! were enjoyable. The characters spend time together, fall in love, overcome difficulties, and get a good, bad, or bittersweet ending. Unfortunately, many of the routes include comments from the men about their desire for the main character and how she should be careful around them when they're alone. This is not romantic or endearing. It's just creepy. However, the most serious problems come up in Kyrie's, Caesar's, Robin Hood's, and the Brothel routes. Both Kyrie and Caesar's routes feature characters with ""bad personalities"" that are emotionally abusive or downright threatening to the main character. They are fully aware of their cruelty and show they have no intentions of changing, instead blaming the main character for choosing them.

Finally, I come to the most serious problem in this game. In both Robin Hood and the Brothel routes, the main character is drugged and then physically/sexually assaulted. In the brothel route the main character is then enslaved. These scenes totally ruined the rest of the route, especially as there was little to no reaction on the main character's part about what happened to her or any sort of consequence for the characters who assaulted her. Most upsetting of all is that there is no warning anywhere about these scenes either on the game's store page or in-game before you get to those scenes. This is completely unacceptable, as it does not leave the player with a choice to opt out if they do not wish to see that kind of content, implied or otherwise.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
OZMAFIA!! is a game that had the potential for an interesting premise. Unfortunately, it's poor writing, slow pacing, lack of character development, and use of abuse/sexual assault in its routes make this game unenjoyable to play. I highly recommend players get their romance fix elsewhere.

So, I've finished half the routes (and my friend finished the other half, as we play it at the same time and we discuss and share screenshots). I've read the epilogue and Grand Finale online. We played without a guide.

So the good things: Great art! I absolutely love it. The characters are really nice (except Dorian and Alfani, f them). The story and plot twists of it makes it really interesting to read (at least once, not enough to do it as many times as needed to complete the game 100%).

So onto the bad stuff...: 
1.While the story and plot twists are interesting... each individual route felt rather... unimpressive? Unimpactful? I don't know how to explain it. But basically it feels like you play for such a short time, nothing -actually- really happens throughout each individual route and it feels short. Seeings extra scenes here and there makes it a little better, but even those are sort of... irrelevant, to me at least. They give extra depth to the characters, but that's about it.
2. The choices a lot of times just made no sense to me, I'll be honest. Ofc, it's my personal opinion, but Caramia and Robin Hood's route choices just... didn't make any sense. A lot of times I felt like I was led down a path that according to the discussions beforehand, it made no sense to be end up there? I think that choices and following dialogue is probably made sort of ambiguous as to whether it's good or bad as to not make it easy to Save-Load to end up where you want to, but even so... I don't know. I discussed this with my friend, cause I was really upset when I got Robin Hood's bad ending, and yeah, we were very perplexed.
4. Make Pashet and actually romantic route! I was SO disappointed to find out it's all about how good friends they are, NO! Either that, or at least make it so you can actually push her and Axel together (cause that was adorable AF). Again, good and bad endings were a mega disappointment.
3. Very personal opinion, but the Brothel route just -felt bad-. There's no good or bad ending, it just a whole load of feeling bad and dirty and disgusted with yourself. I think the game should allow players to skip this route entirely for the Epilogue and Grand Finale cause I think it's unfair to people who pay for this game, to make them feel this way, come on...",1555005937,1555005937,True,3,0,0.560606062412261963,0,False,False,False,False,,,

(Edit: part 2 of review is a positive review, spoilers still somewhat apply to it)


Spoilers below-vulgarity included:(Caps are to demonstrate strong feelings of disbelief, do not mind me)


Firstly, she was being chased by an assassin but upon bumping into some strangers, instead of simply apologising and rushing off for her life like normal people, she somewhat started a conversation with them and only panicked when the assassin finally caught up. Like, wtf? It might have been a device used to introduce other characters in the game to the player but really, can't they do it more realistically? Like, say, the characters were being suspicious of her for running around like a madman and  grabbed onto her for interrogation since they didn't recognise her or something, while she realistically tried to escape out of fear for the assassin or begged them for help. INSTEAD OF STARTING A CONVERSATION THAT HAS THE ""oh, what pleasant weather we have today, let's go frolic in an open field."" VIBE.

And the action of remodelling an entire shed for her use as her living space seems to...lack common sense? Like hello, IT'S A FUCKING HUGE MANSION, THE PLAYER WAS EVEN GIVEN A KEY TO A BATHROOM IN THE MANSION FOR HERSELF, CAN'T SHE GET A ROOM WITH A KEY TOO? I know that this is very minor in retrospect to the plot but it is a small annoyance that disrupts immersion. How is living in a shed on the grounds of a mansion filled with men a more comfortable situation than living directly in the mansion with the men??? The rooms can be locked, and as trained mafia soldatis or whatsoever, won't it be easier to break open a shed than a room in a mansion where the leader himself lives? 

But the incident that truly triggered this review is the conclusion she came up with after Axel got kidnapped. Like, another wtf. Axel was trying to protect her from a group of men who wanted to kill her. He told her to run because, well, she can't fight shit at all. While the other characters were pretty callous of Axel and seemed to not care of his life or death, the logical conclusion(well, at least for me, if I were the player character herself) would be hounding the other characters for his rescue, asking around for information to know more about his kidnappers while trying to bargain with powerful people who might be interested in whatever I can offer to rescue him. Going on a hunger strike or something, while getting trained in the art of self-defence. INSTEAD OF RESCUING HIM MYSELF. Like, the dude sacrificed himself to protect me, why on earth would I go all the way there alone and helpless, without knowledge or skill in combat, to practically their base of operations? Not only are there more people to fight against,the character didn't even think her rescue plan through. What if he was bound in chains, or hidden away in some secret lair? What if he was comatose, how was she supposed to safely and quickly get him away? She isn't even that familiar with the area, what if she gets lost instead?

edited review, review part 2:

Well, I played more and the player character annoyed me a hella lotta less since I finally discovered why she was so willing to go stumbling blindly into enemy territory without preparation (Naive, but at least not delusional enough to consider herself a Mary Sue) 

It irked me a litle that some characters talk about previously being non-human and the player character doesn't even question how he was even non-human in the first place, and how she just accepts it as the way of the world without even wondering why. Hell, I am sure even 5 year olds will ask why, but well considering the fact that this is an entirely different world with weird rules and myths I guess I can't exactly compare this world and reality.

I probably played long enough to have exhausted my mind, because I strangely didn't get any other neurotic thoughts that stem from the usual over-thinking that I do. Or it is simply possible that there weren't any more plotholes in the first route I played. But anyhow, I found the game to be quite the challenge since it has new concepts. I am not sure how I feel about bffs stealing their bro's girl (Imma girl too but bros over hoes ya know) as part of the plot, and was very shocked that I somehow suddenly transferred to another person's route without intending to do so in the first place. 

This game is quite a challenge in itself, and for that alone I will be changing my negative review into a positive one. It blindsided me halfway, and the ending I wanted wasn't so easy to get. I am not sure if the same plot applies to different routes, but I'll call it a day with one route. 

I can't see anyone binging on this without earning a massive hungover-esque headache, but at least it means that I shall be entertained for some time to come.",1552595755,1552605790,True,4,2,0.521703481674194336,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As others have said, the art is quite pretty, the voice acting and music are (mostly) good, and the translation is excellent -- production value-wise, this is a high-tier otoge. But, man, is it ever weird.

The plot, which puts fairy tale and literary characters into a mafia setting, barely makes sense even after seeing the true ending, which itself is abrupt and unsatisfying. Just getting that ending in the first place is an exercise in tedium, because it means going through both endings of every single route, and that means doing the Oz Famiglia routes over and over for what feels like an eternity. The skip button helps, but even with it on the whole way while using a guide, you're still looking at 15-20 minutes of sitting there waiting for it to get to the parts you haven't seen. There is a [i]lot[/i] of content in this game, and that's a good thing in some respects, but much of it doesn't feel worth the effort it takes to actually see it.

As far as the quality of that content goes, there are some interesting routes and likeable characters for sure, but also a surprising level of potentially uncomfortable subject matter. One of the routes, for instance, includes alarmingly graphic depictions of sexual abuse regardless of what choices are made, and there is another that seems to imply[spoiler]the protagonist was drugged by a love interest, who proceeded to have sex with her while unconscious[/spoiler]. A few of the love interests are manipulative bordering on emotionally abusive, and in at least one case, it is nearly impossible to anticipate this kind of content going into it. Something that I found particularly grating was a recurring character whose entire purpose is to be a walking fat joke, so if that's a non-starter for you, well, there you go. And that's not even getting into the ""transfer"" mechanic, which many find distasteful for obvious reasons. I expected worse -- usually the scenario involves the original love interest doing something that could reasonably be considered a deal breaker, and sometimes they even flat out tell you to move on -- but it wasn't something I particularly enjoyed doing, either, and mostly felt like a weird gimmick. A lot of the ""edgier"" content feels gimmicky like that, in the sense that it appears to be more for shock value than something that had careful thought put into it.

In general, I feel conflicted about this game. I realize there is a small pool of choices in the English-language otome market that tick all the quality boxes OZMAFIA!! does in terms of art, translation, voice acting, and sheer volume of content, but I just found myself baffled or annoyed with the plot and characters more than I found myself enjoying them. One of the few characters I did really like ended up having a totally platonic route, too, which I admit really put a damper on my enthusiasm. I think a certain kind of reader might appreciate this game in spite of its quirkier features and flaws, but when it really comes down to it, I just didn't enjoy it very much.",1548471068,1548471394,False,37,1,0.774213254451751709,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As she spends her time with the mafia, she discovers the cycle of life: Friendship, loyalty, love, life, death. 

You may recognize the art from other games such as Diabolik Lovers or Re:Birthday Song. The character design, CGs and backgrounds are astonishingly beautiful. Poni-Pachet has indeed chosen a marvelous artist. Aside from that, the voice acting is a welcome extra. Famous voice actors such as Shingaki Tarusuke or Okitsu Kazuyuki were hired for the main characters. There could have been no one better suited for these roles, they perform with their heart and soul. Here, the creators have made an excellent choice as well. Even if the game is only 70% voiced, which threw me off at first, I do not find fault with that decision. It would have been nice if the game was fully voiced, but voice actors are expensive, especially the more well known ones.

Before starting the thorough review, I recommend playing the game UNTIL THE END. Here's why:
At first, the story seems pretty inconsistenst. Logical gaps everywhere you see. For a mafia setting, the game seemed pretty light, colorful and bubbly. Since I had such high hopes for this game, I was truly disappointed by the outcome. But the more routes and endings you play, the more you understand. By playing the routes in order, you get a better understanding of the story, kind of a red string that follows the tale. It also goes darker, deeper. Very unique. And: NO R-A-P-E!! At the very end of the game, you get to see the epilogue, and with that, everything makes sense. If you had questions, they will be solved after viewing the epilogue. So please give the game a chance if you don't like the story at first. Keep playing!!

The perfomance of the games was kind of meh. The cutscenes appear every 10 minutes and it drove me crazy while playing! There is also no real love-meter where you get to see the progress of the romance. 
OZMAFIA!! is kind of repetitive in the beginning as you have to play the first three characters about 3-4 times. To our advantage, there is a skip function. Really, it saves you a lot of time!!
The play time is fairly long, it took me about 40 hours to complete the entire game. 

The characters are generally well written and go deep, especially when you play all the routes, the characteristics add up and you get to see another side of them. Every character is kind of loveable. Some are also pretty unique, others I feel sorry for. I like that there is character development, which usually lacks in a lot of otoges. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the cast. 
I recommend playing the routes twice (the three main characters have to be played 3-4 times anyway) as you unlock the thoughts of the characters during the current chapters. I only discovered this mechanic when my game crashed and I had to play an entire route again. 

The plot is diverse, from happy and bubbly moments to dark, dramatic situations. Whereas I do have to admit that I did not like the dramatic situations that much because they did not come across as that severe. My favorites were probably the very comedic and humorous scenes [spoiler](e.g. when Caramia shows the heroine how to use a gun and Axel enters the room upon hearing her saying she had ""never imagined his (Caramia's) to be that long and big"")[/spoiler]. There are even references to fairytales such poisoned apples or putting someone into an oven. Loved those little details!

All in all, I genuinely recommend OZMAFIA!!. I had to shed tears at the epilogue, but also from laughing too much. I smiled because of beautiful and touching moments. I got goosebumps from suspense. One of the greatest, localized otome games on the market so far. Loved the experience and I would play it again!",1546796590,1546796616,True,9,0,0.621310830116271973,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-So many route to play
-Unique route such as /Dorian route/ahem/ havent seen this in Otome.
-The story add up after every route you play (you will go OHHHHHHHH. OH WAT. OH YES OH NO OH TEARS)

Cons:
-Friendzone by Pashet LOL
-You wont realize how amazing this game at first.
-Take lots of time for light player. 
-So many holes in the story if you don't play other route.
-Simple gameplay, quiet typical. (But I guess it suit Ozmafia since it focus heavily on story)

I'm a hardcore Otome player, 
I played this game once and stop. I feel that this game is simple and so many holes in the story. Boy I was wrong.
Thank god I decided to give another go to Ozmafia or at least finish 50% of the route. First off all, I never knew that other route effect the the completion of the story so much (epilouge route) and that there's so much new cut scene once you play other route or re-play the route. Its never boring, you wont keep skipping cause of the new cut scene once you finish your previous route!! Once I realize all this, I was so freaking drowning. I love the story, the filler, everything holycow. It's addictive.

This game is a hot mess. After finishing Caramia, Axel, and Ceasar's routes, I can say that the game's biggest flaw would be its bad execution: the pacing was off, the characterization unstable, and the writing left little to be admired. I did research about the rest of the routes, as well as the Epilogue and the Grand Ending, and I can honestly say that had the execution been better, I would have continued playing. As things stands, however, there's very little incentive for me to go on. At the end of the day, it's the story's responsibility to keep the reader to ask for more. I shouldn't be making excuses for such poor writing and direction.

The characters were cute, the art was gorgeous, but things seemed thin. Shallow. It felt like I was playing one of those cheap mobile otomes with underdeveloped characters and a bad plot. I was expecting a game that should've been darker, grittier. I wondered why the mafia famiglie seemed to get along, even with the Sunday Compromise. Not exactly smart to befriend someone 1 day of the week, who is trying to kill you and take your land 6 days of the week... I was tempted to write a bad review back then, but I wanted to complete the game before I made a concrete judgement. The more I played though, the better it got. The game isn't without it's cons, but the pros certainly outweigh them.

Starting with the cons, the loading screens were my biggest gripe. They're cute and a neat way to show story progression and what kind of choices you're making, but the number of them is excessive, and listening to the jingle and watching the like 10 second animation gets really annoying really fast.
It was a bit of a shame that some of the characters didn't get all the endings that the Oz boys do, but I do see how that many endings would've been excessive. Especially with 10 characters.
Pashet's route was cute, but I feel like a friendship route is a cheap way out of actually writing a girlxgirl route. I would really appreciate an actual girlxgirl route with a romantic ending from Poni-Patchet in the future.
A lot of scenes don't really have a conclusion. They just end abruptly and jump to the next scene, where there, you may or may not get a brief line or two about the conclusion of said previous scene. This was really annoying, and it felt like the writers were a bit lazy or were unsure how to finish a scene.
The MC is the biggest moron out there. There's being naive and having amnesia, but then there's being an outright airhead. I don't know what any of the guys see in her. She made me want to quit the game in the beginning at times because she was just so....stupid. [spoiler]Like yeah, lets just go visit the guy that's trying to kill you! Let's walk into a conflict unarmed! Keep going to the brothel when everyone says don't do it! Go to the slums after being told not to! Need to be rescued from everything! [/spoiler]
Ande was so damn annoying I would've happily skipped every scene with her. I know that's her purpose, but it still pissed me off.

And with the pros, the game is well written. It can be frustrating at first and seem thin, but the story unravels itself the more characters you play, and the epilogue and grand finale really do a good job at tying things up. The game was translated and localized well, things were relateable, funny, and made sense. Very few spelling/gramatical errors. 
Characters like Caramia, Axel, and Ceaser really stole my heart. Soh's route made me cry. Scarlet didn't creep me out like most token shota boys in otomes do. Kyrie is still a complete jerk but he has his moments. Poni-Pachet really created a loveable cast that will be memorable after playing the game. 
I felt like Brothel was handled well by using [spoiler]Manboy as the sort of antithesis.[/spoiler] It's not wrong to put more dark content in a game, but it has to be done right. I felt like it was done in a way that didn't romanticize the cruel reality of the situation. [spoiler]Manboy makes sure you know that what's going on is wrong.[/spoiler] This is a really good thing, there's nothing more upsetting than a game that romanticizes abuse and tragic situations like that. [spoiler]Plus the naming Dorian in one of the endings was such sweet revenge.[/spoiler]
Satoi's art is beautiful as always, and there are plenty of CG's. Character designs were good, relatively original (Axel looks a LOT like Ruki from Diabolik Lovers sorry not sorry), and there wasn't a drop in quality between main characters and side characters.
Partial voice acting was good, though I did feel like it was a bit odd at times where and when they decided to suddenly switch to a voiced line, or how the MC is only voiced in the epilogue/grand finale.

My route reccomendation: Caramia>Kyrie>Axel>Scarlet>Brothel>Pashet>Robin Hood>[spoiler]Hamelin[/spoiler]>Ceaser>Soh
Really, The Oz boys can be played whenever. It might be more enjoyable to spread them out through your playthrough, seeing as how their routes will be a bit longer and feature multiple endings. However, Brothel should be played as early as you can, but don't play it first. It will give you the very wrong impression of the game and it's ideal to start with an Oz boy. Just play it when you want a change of pace. Play Robin Hood before [spoiler]Hamelin[/spoiler] due to spoilers, and Ceaser and Soh should be played last. Absolutely play Soh last.

Overall, the game was a really good and enjoyable play. It had a decent amount of content. The price is a bit high, but if you get it on sale, it's not bad at all.

[b]The Good[/b]

It has Japanese voice acting (covering about 70% of the game) that is superbly done and really takes many scenes to a whole other level; from heart warming, to funny, to heart breaking, to slightly steamy, to dark and disturbing, above and beyond what the writing alone would have done for me. Regardless of weather you understand the language itself, the tone and delivery makes all the difference in my book. I loved the writing and the translations are superb and flowed wonderfully, not rough or choppy or clumsy at all. 

The place where it is set is intriguing, and the characters... oh the characters! One of them, Kyrie, has made my all time favourites list of characters from any media. I found him to be so well developed with such fantastic depth (party thanks to his VA, too) that just got better the more I played, as in every rout I found something more to dig my claws into with him, even if only one scene, just another hint of the layers to him. The others are all wonderful in their own way too; detailed, each with their own distinct personalities, each adding wonderfully to the world they are in. Love them or hate them, this is quite a cast! You could take these characters, drop them in a void, and they would make a story all by themselves, just by being who they are, which says how good they are.

The story... the story is a little odd but I enjoyed it. You have your different routes, and then you have the true ending, which is revealed through the epilogue and grand finale. From what I can gather, non of the routes other then the true ending is canon, yet at the same time it is written in such a way that it is feasible that [i]any[/i] or even all of the routes COULD be [i]partly[/i] canon, which is nice. For the player, each rout is an exploration of the situation the MC is in, and the characters in it, who they are, the part they have in the world and the state things are in now, bits and pieces of the over all story, which gives a us a pretty cool overview of the story/setting/situation by the end. 

The MC... well, its not often one can all naive stupidity a superpower, but this gal pretty much manages it. Its like watching a puppy blunder around and bump into things; cute, though not what you would expect of an adult, even a young adult. Yet, while she did bother me at times, she somehow sort of grew on me, which is a wonder. Oh, I still want to kick her, regularly, but still, I have been somewhat suckered into the cute so I guess this is a good thing. Anyway, there are in game reasons for her being like this, utter lack of prior memories and being lucky enough to fall (literally) in to the arms of a group willing and capable of looking after her tiny-puppy-like self and thus prolonging her naivety being two big ones.

The sound and music does it's job. Nothing grated on me over much and most of it just faded into the background of the scene, as it should, to set the tone. A few tracks I did particularly enjoy, either for being tied to a favourite character or just because I thought it was very cool in and of itself (one in particular in the epilogue I let sit on my computer for a while, I liked it so much). Some sound affects were meh, but not enough to distract from the rest. The scene change card and jingle did mildly irritate for a time, but I reached the point of blanking that out too.

I loved the art in this, both Sprites and CGs, I thought were gorgeous. The sprites per character were good too, giving many expressions that added to the scene and helped bring it all to life. Brilliant!

[b] The Meh[/b]

There is a feature to this game I have not come across elsewhere that some might consider a blessing, some a curse; the second play through of any rout - including the conflicts with the Oz boys and their transfers that can follow it (two different things) - will reveal additional mini scenes (usually away from the MC) such as banter between characters or character introspection. These add soooo much more depth to the story and the characters, and some of the Oz CGs can only be gained this way. If you want to just get all the info now this is a curse (I lean this way myself), but if you are planning to take your time with replays this will be a blessing, adding more to the game next time you want to savour it. To a degree this also serves a story function, withholding information until you have already experienced the story in the first play through, which I can appreciate in and of itself, but still...

Fade to black... This VN relies on fade to black so, so much. For just about everything; action scenes, sexual scenes, some dramatic scenes, more regular scenes... I can see the artistic direction and it does maintain the pacing, but at the price of feeling choppy at times. There were numerous instances when I wish they would have let things play out more - I would NOT have complained at this already long VN being even longer, I would have loved that! Still, I did get used to it, so it didn't ruin things for me - I still adore this VN.

[b]The Bad... potentially[/b]

[b]HOWEVER![/b] All that said, as much as I love this game, this wont be for everyone, for two big reasons; the brothel rout (Manboy rout), and to a much lesser degree, the Robin Hood rout. There are serious consent issues (and more, in the brothel rout) here which, in fiction, some might enjoy playing with but others will not. In order to unlock the epilogue and grand finale you have to complete both endings of all routes (including the transfer route endings for the Oz boys), including these two. [i][b]You can however just click though everything quickly and use a guide to know what dialogue options to pick to unlock them. You can also change the skip function to skip all, not just what you have already read, to make this go even faster - just remember to change it back after.[/b][/i] Most endings of each rout (there are two for each) can be called either 1) good or  2) bitter-sweet, depending on your choices, but there are exceptions and these two routes fall into that; RH's rout endings I would call 1) bitter-sweet and 2) kinda messed up, while the brothel rout endings I would call 1) [i]very[/i] twisted and 2) horrifying, and given it is a brothel that gives some indication as to the problems people might have here.  Personally, I'd say if you think this would be an issue, but are intrigued by the rest of the game, I would just fast click/skip through them to get them out of the way.

My personal reactions to these two routes was... Well, I found the Robin Hood rout a little uncomfortable, but, as a work of fiction I was ok to explore it in a morbid sort of way and did sympathise with RH to a point, despite my disagreements with him. The brothel rout was an odd one for me. Again there was a morbid fascination - like watching a train wreck - that one can exercise with fiction. However the most I got out of it was fanfiction fodder with the two endings and imagining what the fallout could be like. I did click through some parts rather quickly as things got too uncomfortable for me, but, this is did not tarnish my appreciation for the rest of the game, some parts of which I have already replayed, I enjoyed them that much. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

Ho giocato abbastanza e in sostanza mi mancano soltanto le route di Caramia e parte di quelle di Kyrie per completare il gioco, ma dalla seconda partita in poi ho cominciato a usare il comando skip un assurdo numero di volte e per me completare il tutto stava diventando sempre più simile a un lavoro che a un gioco - cosa che, in teoria, non dovrebbe succedere con nessun gioco e nessuna visual novel.

Ripeto rapidamente i punti che altri hanno elencato prima di me con cui mi trovo d'accordo:
- Il doppiaggio è ottimo, nulla da dire neanche per i disegni che sono perlopiù fatti molto bene, per non parlare degli sfondi.
- L'ambientazione avrebbe anche del potenziale, ma la storia è così scialba e inutilmente carica di misteri irrisolti da essere più frustrante che divertente.
- La protagonista è sicuramente la più ingenua, ottusa, frustrante e genuinamente fastidiosa che io abbia mai incontrato in un otome o in uno shoujo. E ne ho viste tante, di protagoniste di questo tipo. Ci sono personaggi passivi e piagnucolosi che tutti hanno odiato e che io ho adorato, ma in questo caso non sono riuscita a farmela piacere neanche io.
- C'è una sorta di schermata di caricamento, o una schermata di transizione, che è accompagnata da un jingle e serve a separare vari momenti della storia. Durante il primissimo gameplay non era fastidiosa, ma ogni volta che ho rigiocato l'ho odiata profondamente. Non c'è modo di disattivarla, ed è abbastanza invasiva da smorzare l'immersione nella storia.

Tutti i personaggi, nessuno escluso, sono stereotipi da manga shoujo. Se trovate il tipo di stereotipo che piace a voi, bene; in caso contrario possono essere tutti potenzialmente fastidiosissimi, in particolare i personaggi secondari. Si intuiscono i loro ragionamenti (anche quelli più contorti) già dopo aver letto poche loro battute di dialogo, tanto che per me è stato impossibile non annoiarmi per la maggior parte di essi - salvo quei personaggi che apprezzo di più perché, per l'appunto, mi piacciono i loro stereotipi.

La storia, molto semplicemente, è del tutto inappropriata per l'ambientazione: trattandosi di organizzazioni criminali (""mafia"", come hanno purtroppo deciso di chiamarle) mi aspettavo qualcosa di più dark, con una trama ben carica, avvenimenti interessanti, intrighi particolari e così via. Quello che ho ottenuto è una protagonista che, ritrovandosi senza memoria, invece di interessarsi a scoprire di più sul proprio conto, preferisce piuttosto trascorrere il tempo mangiando dolcetti, facendo passeggiate notturne in zone ad alto tasso di criminalità e appiccicarsi al love interest di turno come una cozza allo scoglio. Concorsi di bellezza, bambini impegnati a vendere fiammiferi, assassini che passano tranquillamente interi pomeriggi domenicali a chiacchierare amabilmente con le proprie vittime... più che una città afflitta dal problema della mafia, sembrano gang di bambini che ogni tanto bisticciano. Non sono mai riuscita a prendere sul serio neanche uno dei risvolti più potenzialmente pericolosi, nemmeno quando c'erano in gioco spade, pistole o bombe. Allo stesso tempo, quando nel gioco avvengono cose come molestie o addirittura stupri (perché sì, ci sono anche questi), sono avvenimenti trattati come questioni di poco conto. Gli altri personaggi approfittano dell'ingenuità della protagonista più di una volta, ma ogni volta che questo succede nessuno ha reazioni particolari. La leggerezza con cui vengono affrontati molti dei temi della storia è forse una delle cose più frustranti.

La storia in generale sembra un ammasso di varie scenette legate l'una all'altra. Lo scorrere del tempo è molto confuso, buona parte degli eventi principali avviene fuori dalla scena e spesso anche situazioni serie come dichiarazioni o finali sono raccontati in maniera sbrigativa. Ci sono tantissime route ma sono tutte superficiali - anche quelle di Axel e Kyrie, che in teoria sono due dei tre personaggi giocabili principali, le ho trovate piuttosto scarne. Avrei preferito meno personaggi e una storia come si deve.

Ultimo ma non ultimo, le route hanno per lo più una storia comune, da cui poi si diramano le varie possibilità a seconda delle scelte fatte. Questo significa che c'è letteralmente META' della storia che va rigiocata ancora e ancora, ogni volta che si vuole ottenere un finale diverso. Se era già scialba durante la prima partita, quando ho rigiocato per ottenere altri finali è diventata un vero e proprio inferno.

Ammetto che se dovesse essere il primo otome che si prova in generale potrebbe essere divertente; in caso contrario consiglio caldamente di cercare un altro gioco da provare. I disegni saranno anche belli, ma non vale la pena di perdere tempo qui quando ci sono altri otome più economici (anche molto più economici, o addirittura giochi gratuiti) con storie più interessanti e personaggi meno fastidiosi.

EDIT: Ho reinstallato il gioco giusto per completare la collezione di CG (non ci sono riuscita, me ne manca una) e vedere il gran finale, insieme anche alla risoluzione di tutti i misteri che durante le varie partite non vengono svelati neanche parzialmente. Purtroppo il gioco non vale la pena di essere giocato neanche per questo: sono rimasta abbastanza delusa.",1536502976,1608552097,False,3,0,0.556786715984344482,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each character pursuit have at least two and sometimes four more endings (due two love triangles) - some of them alike. Arriving at these can be a hassle though if a/The guide is not followed as there are many choices, sometimes similar and sometimes with not apparent effect.

The epilogue, available after covering at least one ending on each character and the grand epilogue, after basically covering all endings, are really a must to wrap up the whole picture. They also bring nice vibe into the whole thing.  

To help the Replay there is a Skip button which is convenient, regretabbly it does not stop when there is not covered scene, but skips it instead. Thus the nice feature of this Novel, mixing new scenes (usually right away after the MC choice) after covering a route can be missed. Worth to note that somehow this Skip button somehow can wear off when running for long time and spitting a script error it crashes the game.

Saying that this VN has some nice ideas like the graphics library for some special moments (which is even voiced, though not subtitled), soundtrack openings/closings, scene transition clips (which can give you a hint about your current situation ... and can be boring after 100th time). Most speeches are voiced (apart from the main character and her, in the epilogues). Japanasse over, I believe well translated, english text is a big plus. Then the music blends nice and is variable enough.... As for the visuals: the art is somehow unique. Characters are detailed, background not much distraction and with time, this mix can be appreciated more and more - well done. Though some of the [i]special[/i] screens from the gallery can be a bit [i]odd[/i]... Another small detail appreciated was that the game remembers on which save/load page is the last one (they are 20!).

Few other quirks: running this VN for undefined time makes it loose all sounds. Restarting helps. Also the Quick load/Quick save buttons functions does not work across restarts (only in session time).

To start off with, this game has so many freaking routes. More routes than any other otome game I've ever played and I've played a lot. I love that there's so many routes but all of them are really short except for the Oz family routes. Each Oz boy has four endings each, and it's extremely tedious trying to get all of them. (I had to look at a guide to save myself a lot of time) I do like being able to switch routes halfway through one but honestly after a while it started to feel like work because just getting through all the Oz endings took most of the hours I played this game. One of the routes [spoiler] Brothel [/spoiler] can also be really triggering to some people and has actually made some people quit playing the game altogether so if you feel like you can't handle it you might want to avoid it. Overall I really did enjoy playing all the routes and I liked how different each one was. The mc was almost hilariously dense but it definitely didn't ruin anything for me. My only real complaint is that Pashet's route isn't a lesbian route and I was really hoping that it was. I would recommend this to otome game fans that love having a variety of routes to play, pretty art and some reaaally dark storylines. If you decide to play this game I recommend playing in this order to avoid as many spoilers as possible: Caramia, Kyrie and Axel first. Then Pashet, Brothel and Scarlet.

早知道我就应该多读读评测，底下评论首页那么大的一个不推荐我居然没看到。。点击推荐是因为我没有完全推完，所以观点肯定有不正确的，看着乐乐就好了。

重要的事情再说一次：

以下全都是个人观点，我还没有把游戏玩完。。所以可能观点不全，全都是为了好玩，能看着乐乐就好。我就是发泄一下我自己的情绪。。。但是我觉得我可能需要一点时间才能克服我这几天被这游戏喂的恶意了。。

下面有对各种线的严重剧透，请慎重。虽然没有任何细节，但是会说一些线的结局。

游戏的介绍就是：

某天一名失去记忆的少女出现在这个城镇

但是这个城镇內有着众多黑手党在争夺地盘

而少女的心  会倾向于谁呢?



简介很帅气对吧！！黑手党的设定我也很喜欢，然而我期待的“争夺地盘”在哪里？？我期待的“黑手党智斗”在哪里？？

​在哪里？？？

我唯一看到的就是：

A：哈哈哈我去你的地盘扔个雷

B：哈哈哈我去你的，打爆你

A：哈哈哈别这样，我给你钱

B：哈哈哈我们是文明人，钱给我，我要全花了去买糖

​A：哈哈哈女主脑子有问题，我去把我丢的钱都骗回来，我不要现金，我要火柴哈哈哈

B：哈哈哈女主真可爱哈哈哈

好，我认了，我的要求可能有点高，乙女游戏感情戏好就行了，其他的不用在意 ：）

玩完五条线的我：哈哈哈我去你的哈哈哈


第一条线玩到了隐藏角色（这里就不说名字了），我真的都不知道我是怎么玩到他的？？不过比起其他人，我很喜欢他的角色，可惜线真的很短。。。我是说真的很短，大概十五分钟就完了。。结局有两个，一个是be一个是半个be？be的那个我打出来了但是没看，因为会剧透接下来玩的角色，所以我就跳过了。。半个be的结局是：隐藏角色进了监狱，主角为了和他在一起成为了监狱看守人。

说实话第一条线给我感觉还蛮好的，虽然感觉并不是那么惊艳，但是也还好啊！

于是我就心情高涨的开了女主在的黑手党的老大的线。

然后

我就看着女主开始了她的NTR之路。

说实话，我个人不是很喜欢NTR​，但是如果NTR被处理得好一点我还能接受，但是这个女主的秒切换我真的是理解不了？？？

我看了一眼NTR，大概就是：

女主：我想明白了，我不想要他，我想要你。

NTR对象：不是你的错，是我引诱的你，你不需要自责，来上床。

女主：啊！我好爱你啊！之前那个谁我已经忘了他了！

然后最奇怪的是，NTR居然还能拿到好结局？？？嗯？？？？

好，我们不说剧情，我们说一下这个游戏的cg机制：如果你想要拿到所有的cg，你必须要走NTR线。

​

嗯？？？嗯？？？


哦，还有，如果你想要拿床照​床戏cg的话你也必须要走NTR线。

Ozmafia制作组：我们的口号是什么！NTR才有未来和奖励！

没错，据我目前来看，正常的纯爱线是没有床戏情节或者任何脖子以下接触的，我已经能感受到官方的恶意了，这不是逼着有收集强迫症的玩家去NTR吗？？

抱怨完毕，继续回到黑手党老大的线，老大的设定是OZ里面没有勇气的狮子，进入线确定关系都蛮可爱的，然后进入真正的线后，系统自动给你设置在这个黑手党三人组里你平常对话戳到他好感的一个人，然后就开始NTR。

能够NTR的原因是：

黑手党老二（NTR对象）：老大，你为什么喜欢女主？

黑手党老大：我喜欢她身上的气味，因为她让我想起了那个女人。

女主：黑手党老大你什么意思！？

黑手党老大：你居然敢偷听！？哼！

（几天后）

黑手党老大：我不告诉你那个气味让我想起了谁，我也不告诉你那个人和我是什么关系，但是你一定要相信我，我真的很爱你！



看完这段剧情的我快要崩溃了看完这段剧情的我快要崩溃了

​嗯，没事，没准有隐情，我要保持原则不能NTR。

接下来就是这条线的第一个高潮：

女主想给老大一个惊喜，半夜出门在老大背后要捂住他的眼睛，老大正在追捕一个犯人，以为女主是犯人，一枪爆胸。老大失去了自己获得的勇气，又变成了一只胆小鬼狮子。

老大：都是我的错，都是我的错，我怎么这么弱！

女主：不是你的错！是我犯蠢！

老大：不听不听我不听，就是我的错！你不能离开我，你离开了我我的生活就一片黑暗！

女主：好好好我不离开你！

然后就是女主被绑架，老大去救，被打，老大被下属救，女主哭，老大叫女主别哭，然后就完了，狮子没有拿回勇气，女主成了他的保姆（NE）。

？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？

嗯？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？

我到底看了什么？？？？？？？？？？

隐情在哪里？？？？你大概每三条线就说你爱女主，你到底解释一下啊？？？？

我觉得HE可能会有更多的信息，于是我load了进入到老大线的存档，开始一遍一遍的试，一遍一遍的进入NE。

大概第四次的时候我的内心是拒绝的，于是我去找了攻略。

按照攻略弄了三次全都是NE之后，我才发现如果我要HE，我要从头开始重新玩，每个选项都要按照这位老大的萌点来选。

老大你好，老大再见老大你好，老大再见。

最可怕的是，这个游戏有着史上最长的loading screen，黑屏半天后给我放个小音乐，图标一亮，继续游戏。（我玩老大的线从头到尾大概出现了30多次）

这还玩个屁。我拒绝。我选择投降。

然后我开了第三条线，老二的线。

对，就是第一个的NTR对象，毒舌喜欢看别人痛苦的表情的老二。

日常刷他好感的时候，我觉得还蛮可爱的。

NE就是老二把代表稻草人脑子的项链给了女主，说让她务必好好保管，女主在逃命的时候弄丢了，稻草人没了脑子变得不是那么的聪明。女主自责，去找了，发现项链被敌人拿走了，敌人说你跟我走我就把项链还给你，女主说好呀好呀，然后把手伸过去给他们绑，然后敌人就把项链踩碎了。老二过来救她，弱的要命，直接被砍了几十下，但是还是救活了，失去了脑子的老二不虐待女主了，不喜欢看别人痛苦的表情了，但是就是容易失忆，但是不会忘记女主的事情，the end。

可能是老大的线给我的冲击太大了，我觉得觉得这个NE还不错，毕竟没了脑子的老二对女主真的是好太多了。

然后我去打了HE。

老二给女主的项链是假的，因为他不信女主，他一直都在演戏。可惜女主不知道啊，女主还是自责去找了，老二这次突然被buff，变得超强，一巴掌打爆敌人，当着女主的面杀人，然后说这个戒指才是我的脑子，给你戴上，老二继续玩弄女主，男二愿打女主愿挨，两人恩恩爱爱，the end。

男二你到底是信女主还是不信女主？男二你到底是信女主还是不信女主？



剧情？？？？你怎么了？？？？还能抢救一下吗？？？？原来老二不信女主的吗？？？？那NE到底是怎么回事？？？？恩恩爱爱怎么回事？？？？女主你还好吗？？？？

这下完了，NTR我是不想碰了，黑手党里面的线我肯定是不玩了。玩完这两条线后我觉得自己已经崩坏了，于是我去选了一个更崩坏的线：

妓院线。

嗯，你没看错，喜闻乐见的妓院线，而且还有三个攻略目标：老板，头牌，和清洁工前台。

我看妓院这个名字的时候已经能够预想到这条线很重口了，但是我没想到这个线能够这么可怕。

妓院线里我唯一有好感的就是管扫除和清理花园的男性。

他也有着这个世界最清奇不做作的名字：ManBoy。

为了方便，我就叫他男宝了。

这个线的前面铺垫剧情就是：

女主：男宝，你工作的地方到底是干什么的啊？

男宝：呃。。。妓院。。额不是。。是沙龙。

头牌：女主你喜欢S还是喜欢M

女主：我喜欢S

头牌：女主你快来把我搞得一团乱！

老板：这里是妓院哦！我好喜欢你啊女主！我要把你变成我的！

男宝：女主你别再来这里了！会有很不好的事情发生！

女主：嘿嘿嘿头牌比起男宝我更喜欢你！

头牌＋老板：嘿嘿嘿我们要把女主迷晕后强奸她！

（一夜过后）

游戏：正常进行剧情！女主对被强奸没有任何反应！嗯！很合理！

女主：我又来玩了！

头牌：来！这是一些玩具，用在我身上！你不知道怎么用吧？我教你！

老板：来，男宝，我把女主迷晕了我们来玩3p吧嘿嘿嘿

男宝：不行！我不能这么对女主！

老板：那你看着我强奸女主吧！！哈哈哈哈！



游戏制作组还很贴心的多次介绍那些“玩具”怎么用，都可以放到说明书里或者广告语了。

头牌：你一开始放进去会震动的很厉害，可能会有点疼，但是后面会特别特别的爽。

爽你个大鬼头。

其实我玩到这里的时候已经恶心的不行了，直接按照攻略跳着看看结局：

结局一：女主多次嫖男人花费太高，老二把她卖了。然后女主被玩坏了，成为了这里的头牌。老板只把女主给有权力的男人享用。

结局二：女主整个人扭曲了，推翻了老板，成为了妓院的新老板，天天欢快的4p。

​其实这条线全程我都是整个人带着WTF的心情度过的，女主对自己被迷晕后强奸毫无反应，日常固定剧情还是日常，被多次提醒之后还是作死，男宝想要带着她逃出去她还拒绝。

女主：只想张开大腿。

唯一一次真正让我感到特别难受还是因为男宝说的一句话：

“我已经不认识你了，我之前深爱着，如同太阳一样明亮的女性已经不见了，但是我还是控制不住我自己，我要帮你成为这里新的掌控者，我不能看着她的身体如此的被折磨。”



官方我去你的。

你觉得这里是这个游戏的底线？？？

NONONO。

第五条线我去攻略了医生，因为我很喜欢他在其他线里面出现的角色设定。

我本以为医生这个角色能够安抚我受伤的内心，然而。。。

这位医生居然是有老婆的。

有老婆的。

老婆。

但是按照他说话的方式，我的第一反应就是老婆死了，医生十分难过伤心，女主来温暖他的内心。

个屁。

这条线我有两个雷点：

第一：女主在知道医生结婚的情况下还是多次去找医生，还满大街的跑乱问别人知不知道关于医生老婆的情况。我从来没见过这么白莲花的女性。而且女主还在得知医生老婆还活着的情况下跑去告白。在医生老婆对她特别好的情况下，多次祝福她和医生的恋情的情况下，女主居然在葬礼上和医生谈情说爱。

第二：女主又双叒叕被强奸了。没错，虽然女主喜欢医生，但是并没有任何想要深层次身体交往的心思，然而医生把女主迷晕了，强奸了她，利用她累得半死半昏不醒死去活来的时候去了女主所在的黑手党的地方偷了枪然后去杀人。

这条线下来我最心疼的还是医生老婆，被关在水晶玻璃里想死不能死，半死不活，一会有意识一会没意识，放弃自己爱的人，祝福抢自己老公的小女孩和自己老公开开心心生活后，还是死的那么惨，老公直接在葬礼上和女主谈情说爱。

我只想说一句：老婆我好心疼你啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！

这条线我去看了一下别人评测的结局，很明显外国人和我一样三观爆裂，恶心的不行。

最后总结，这个游戏肯定是有很多人喜欢的，我看国内评价还不错，不过我个人是接受不了，剧情写的太差，打斗戏太过儿戏，剧情根本没有任何起伏，也不是全语音。

不过有想玩的人就去玩吧，只要能接受多次的强奸戏和女主毫无反应笑嘻嘻的立绘就好。​​​​",1531525272,1531563732,True,453,361,0.953361570835113525,24,True,False,False,False,,,

The MC Fuka, or whatever you decide to name her is very adorable to me. She is simple, cute, and very sweet. But she is also extremely dumb. But its not in the way that most otome MCs are portrayed. The reason for her lack of sense is explained in the ending of the game. 

As far as love goes in the game, its pretty well done.

They HAVE been together more than we see after all. For this very reason, the other characters progression moves more slowly. 

The overall plot moves very well if done in the correct order. I'd suggest Caramia > Axel > Kyrie first. Though that can be switched around (: Also since these three have so many endings, remember to save at certain points so that it doesn't become bothersome later on when trying to get all endings and CGs. Trust me, each ending is worth it and they even add a little more behind the scenes script on each try. (Just skip until you need to get to the next answer, if there's text you haven't seen before, it'll stop.) Brothel > Robin Hood > Hamelin should be done in that order since Hamelin can spoil some of Robins key points. The Brothel.. Eh. It should just be done before because its a bit odd and honestly its the only part of the story I didn't enjoy very much. Though it does give insight into that part of the town.  Scarlet and Pashets routes can be done either before or after those three routes. Though, Id recommend doing one before then one after just to keep things light. Caesar > Soh should be done LAST and in that order the epilogue and Grand Finale obviously.

My favorites where Kyrie, Caramia, Caesar, and Axel. Pashets was pretty refreshing since she is a girl (no yuri, just friends). I adored Scarlet but wished there was more to his story. It lacked key points to me and I don't really understand why he wasn't given a little more. I just felt there could have been more added to his part of the story. I also felt, at first, that Hamelin needed more in his route but as I kept going through the game he was given the recognition in the story i felt he needed. Same goes for Robin. And well the Brothel route was my least favorite. Some may like it but it was just a bit of ""let me get this over with already"" for me. 

Overall, I loved this game. It's actually one of few otome games I feel could be played, left alone for awhile after finished completely, then played again later on down the road. Like a good book. I laughed quite a bit and shed a few tears here and there. I bought this on sale but feel its well worth the original price. Though, if the price is a bit to stiff for you it wouldnt hurt to add to your wishlist and wait for it to go down in price (: No regrets!",1531190641,1531190641,True,6,0,0.585283219814300537,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Проходил я её чисто из спортивного интереса и ради сюжета, никаких гейских наклонностей не имею, такщо не надо тут xD

Ну значится так: играем мы за девушку (кто бы мог подумать?), которую зовут Фука, она внезапно оказывается в каком-то незнакомом ей городе с потерей памяти, город поделен на сферы влияния мафиозных кланов, названия и персонажи которых взяты из различных сказок и выглядят все как на подбор красавцы як тот вампир из Сумерек, в общем все девчонки (как я вас ненавижу) ссутся и текут от восторга с данных рисованых кунов. Все мафиозные кланы есесена жить в мире и согласии не могут и постоянно бодаются за влияние в городе, во всем этом клубке интриг нам и приходится вращаться, попутно пытаясь замутить то с одним, то с другим красавчиком-сладкопопиком.

В игре очень много концовок и рутов, все их пройти я, конечно же, не смог, хотя, если бы был девчонкой, то скорее всего обязательно бы это сделал, кажется что их бесконечно. Если рассуждать объективно, игра действительно очень качественная, как с сюжетной стороны, так и с графической - персонажи отлично нарисованы, каждый обладает своей индивидуальностью и загадкой, на самом деле у меня сложилось такое ощущение, что даже мальчишечьи новеллы не рисуются и не прорабатываются так тщательно, как вот эта, серьезно, здесь нет стандартного набора архетипов новелл а-ля цундере, яндере, староста-тян, подруга детства, очень много внимания уделено деталям каждого героя, и каждый из них, по-своему, уникален. Звуковая составляющая тоже на высоте, большинство диалогов озвучено, музыка играет всегда в тему, даже опенинг выглядит как начало какого-то популярного сериала на ТВ.

В этой игре есть все: романтика, страсть, интриги и любовные треугольники, колоритные персонажи, много действительно хорошего юмора, сказочная атмосфера игрового мира, игра действительно крутая и заслуживает внимания женского (может быть и не только) круга аудитории любителей визуальных новелл, отличный гаремник для девчонок, добавить, пожалуй, больше нечего ;)",1531061671,1531123562,True,8,4,0.610670685768127441,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I loved absolutely everything about it! I love the dark elements even more, and my favorite route was the brothal route. I'm so in love with Ozmafia. I adored all the characters, and the art was so beautiful, Yuka was so gorgeous! I was pretty much gushing and screaming the whole time.
Do all the Oz guys first, if you're looking for route suggestions.

The only thing I didn't particularly like, was how stupid the MC was, a complete airhead, for most of the routes. If she spoke out of place several of the men would be like ""A lady like you shouldn't say things like that"" Like boy, watch your mouth. I'd say much worse things if it would let me you naughty kitty. 
But yeah in some of the routes her intellect was allowed to escape, so that's fine. Most of them see her as some pure and innocent canvas not to be tainted, which was frankly, quite annoying. Which is why i found the brothal route empowering, and  painted her quite the defiant manipulative mistress. 

I have so many amazing things to say about this game, I rave about it to everyone, and it's 110% worth the money! It's so intricate, and has so much to offer. Though oddly, i find it quite comical no one seems to care about where she came from or who she is, but who am I to judge.  I still have like one more route, but I just wanted to share with everyone how much I absolutely loved this, and I wish there were more games like this. Like, guys please make more of these so I can sink into these fantasies over and over. I'll just keep replaying this one for now, I don't mind at all!

The artwork is super pretty and soft and I could stare at it for ages! There are a lot of CGs to collect, and some of them are among my all time favourite CGs as far as Otome games go. 
It's a shame that the game doesn't have steam achievements, I think it would've been a nice touch, considering you can track your CG progress in game, but hey, it's not a deal breaker!

I enjoyed most of the characters, there was the odd one or two that I thought were a bit meh, or just not my cup of tea (and no it's probably not the ones you're thinking of!) and the MC really annoyed me at times. She can be frustratingly dumb and I wanted to cuff her round the head more often than not. That being said however, I still enjoyed the routes and the 'story' as it played out. I know some of you may not like the idea of the love triangle routes, but you don't have to play them :) I would though, they're pretty darn good!

That brings me to the story. It's set in a fairytale type of world, hence the characters personalities and names etc. Which is great in itself as I love fairytales and that sort of thing, however the overall/canon ending, or epilogue, or whatever it gets called (I forget) is a bit pants.

首先画风我真的很喜欢，BGM也不错，可惜语音只有70%左右。结局也非常多，线也多。
说说剧情是黑手党+带点童话色彩，毕竟主角不算人。说真的完全感觉不到黑手党氛围，完全是打闹着玩，而且战斗场景描写的非常苍白！！！人物之间的感情递进和心理描写我也觉得很粗糙，可能跟流程长短和篇幅的原因有关。
按照设定其实可以写的很有剧情，但玩起来确实很像白开水，剧情也有虎头蛇尾的感觉。

[b]Type of Game: [/b] Visual Novel – Reading & Choices
[b]Length: [/b] about 30h (not finished with the main routes)  
[b]Story: [/b] 10/10 (for side characters); didn't play Axel's route because Kyrie's route annoyed me (5/10)
[b]Art: [/b] 10/10
[b]Warning: [/b] This game allows you to switch your partner within a main route. I do not support these types of games to be honest because I personally do not like it. Especially because you can still get ""a happy end"".

The art of this game is it's strong point. The backgrounds, the characters and the CG's are gorgeous. I would even say that the art makes my review that positive. 

But the writing isn't as good as the art. Somehow, it may seem like they tried to be poetical, but at some point it's just switching between the normal dialogue to the poetic description and it's rather confusing. I mean, you shouldn't make a 3rd person narrator in a romance visual novel that talks like an old novelist, while the characters talk like they would in our time. For me it was something that made me chuckle, so that I couldn't take the story serious and wasn't immersed in it. 

Next point is the story. Like the writing... Well it's not a strong point. Many people like a large amount of choices in a game. Well, I'm not that picky, so I don't care, if there are a lot or almost no choices to make. Rather it annoys me, if I have to look up a walkthrough to finish a game because I keep getting bad ends. 

I haven't played Axel's route yet (I'll do it later because I heard this will be the best route of the game), but seriously...

I mean, it's great that you have a lot of choices and that, when you play a second time the character gets more scenes in the game and that he talks to you, when you open the game (it's a great idea BTW)... BUT it's just not good pacing for me, if the scenes get switched to quickly, if you always have to choose with whom you wish to spend time with and, if there is this second choice thing, about whom you wish to date. 

I went for Kyrie first, knowing how I don't like those type of guys, but I like them more than those goody-goody like [spoiler] Lionly [/spoiler]. Well, it's a good thing that you can choose, who to date, a second time, but in Kyrie's route it's almost impossible to get the answers right. Had to look up a guide because my girl was trying to leave him all the time... 

After that I finished Caesar’s, Robin Hood’s, Scarlet’s and Hamelin’s routes.

Hamelin’s was far the most impressing, although it was so short. I truly liked his personality and, how the MC and he interact [spoiler], although both endings are quite sad. He is the main antagonist and this route explains his perspective, why he did the things he did and, what a person he truly is [/spoiler].

Scarlet is [spoiler] the assistant, so to say, of Hamelin and he’d follow him anywhere. Until he meets MC, of course[/spoiler].  I think this is the most not-logical route of all: [spoiler] First the MC is all lovely and talks with him a lot, trying to be his friend, but after she is forced to join the famiglia, she is like another person. She completely avoids him for no reason. WHAT’S UP WITH HER?! It was painful to watch… [/spoiler]

Robin Hood is the doctor [spoiler], a quite huge psychopath, who wants to revenge the death of his wife. Ah, yes, he keeps his wife alive in a tube next room. Pretty normal, I guess [/spoiler]. He has a nice route, quite enjoyable to read. He’s my favorite character from this game. After finishing this route, you know, what happened because of [spoiler] Hamelin. The story is, if I’m not wrong, that Hamelin liked Robin Hood’s wife, or something, so he went to their wedding and shoot her. After that he went all berserk on the townspeople, so that Scarlet had to shoot him down. Hamelin was exiled since, but comes back, after the arrival of the MC and tries to lead a rebellion again. Robin Hood tried to revive his wife, but he couldn’t. So he kept her comatose in a tube, until Hamelin arrives and he is finally able to get his revenge[/spoiler].

And another thing: It may be good that there are this many routes... BUT it's hellish annoying to play them, when you play without walkthrough and have to play through the whole game to get the answers right. And playing with a walkthrough sucks for a lot of different reasons e.g. one of them being that you keep clicking between game and site and can't concentrate on either on them.

SUMMARY:
There is gorgeous art
There isn't a very good writing style and the story lacks pacing sometimes
-> They tried to make it look like a story book, but the dialogue is more like 21st century than ""fairy tale-ish""
There are characters, who have their own personalities without being ""too great, too prince-like""
-> But they also suffer because of the weird pacing
Most likely you will need a walkthrough
-> getting good ending without it will be REALLY difficult
(The main is annoying because she is naive and stupid in actually every route I played so far)
You have a lot of choices
-> you need like 4 hours to play through every variant of ONE route

====> So, if you want a game, which is good, not that expensive, if you think about the time you going to invest in it, then it's great. If you want a gem, something that will make you think, make you cry for hours or simply be your favourite visual novel for ages, this is most likely not it. It's good, but it could be better. It's far better than those cliché novels, which don't have any plot or any story behind it, but it's more something that you won't replay after finishing. <====",1516109303,1676029671,True,2,0,0.538664281368255615,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The premise is interesting and well done, and the story does not disappoint with its romance, storylines, characters, and plot twists. OZMAFIA!! is sometimes cute, funny, tragic, or a bit risqué. But it is all beautiful and memorable. 
+Positives+
	-Beautiful character designs, bgs, cgs, and general designs. Plenty of save slots and no clunky game play and easy navigation. 
	-Voice acting (Japanese) and specific options to turn off voices if you don’t like one of the voices (I never had to use that option because I liked them all).
	-Excellent storyline, if you love fairytales, romance, or story depth, this is for you. When you replay a route, there will be extra scenes added in that give a behind the scenes look to give you more insight into the characters. That is a huge plus because every ending, though not always happy, was worth reading, personally.
=Neutrals=
	-The MC is a lovable but naïve girl, she can change slightly from each character route. But she has amnesia, so she can, in some cases, come off a little blank. BUT, in the hidden true ending (the Grand Ending), she gets a really good resolution to her character and becomes much more defined. Her character makes sense and is very lovable anyway. I loved her, but some people might feel differently. Give her a chance.
	-The price is high, but I actually believe it fits the product. High quality equals high price. This otome has a high replay ability and a long play time. (I spent over 60 hours in-game and I don’t care what the counter says.) I haven’t found all the extra scenes yet and these characters WILL make you come back for more. IF IT IS ON SALE, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET IT!
--Negatives—
	-I wanted steam achievements. That’s all.

While there are several things I absolutely enjoy in the otome title, there are some rather troubling issues (both story and presentation related) that prevent me from giving it an overwhelming thumbs up.  I do recommend the game, but with a few large caveats.

First of all, I love these characters.  As much as I wanted to hate a few of them, they're all incredibly well-developed, well-written, and a  joy to watch interact, especially the 3 Oz men who have rather entertaining relationships with each other.  Yes, there are a few points in which characters do pretty despicable things (and it hurts my heart that my favorite is guilty of some nasty stuff), but my overall enjoyment of these characters, with whom I've spent 50+ hours, overcomes a few extremely infuriating moments.  But just barely. 

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1204386597
The visual novel has some rather controversial moments which include emotional manipulation, drugged sex, drunken sex, and BDSM elements (ahem, the Brothel route) which likely won't appeal to all readers.  The non-con stuff was extremely off-putting for me personally, especially since the writing doesn't make it out to be an issue at all.  On the contrary, the scenes are written in an almost titillating manner, which made me very uncomfortable.   So if you just read through that and are like, ""NOPE, I'm outta here!"" I can totally understand.   The humor may also come off as vulgar and risque to some. However, I felt  it worked just fine given the characters' personalities and disposition in the world.  And this is coming from someone who's usually put-off by trashy comedy.   At least the guys keep most of their comments away from Fuka's ears...for the most part (I'm looking at you, Kyrie)!   

That said, the story has a lot of issues in both plotting and structure.  While the translation is one of the best I've come across in any visual novel with incredibly fluent writing, very few typos, and cultural references that all feel fitting and natural, it's not enough to cover up the disjointed narrative that is exacerbated by an overly long common route that feels like a string of unrelated scenes that don't add up to much.  Things get a little better once you finally reach the characters' individual routes, but oftentimes the stories feel like they end before they've even begun.  I guess I was hoping for more than what I got, and I wanted a LOT more because I really do enjoy the world and lore that Poni-Pachet created.  I love the setting, the fairy tale characters, the mafia families fighting for control, the magical elements of the town, and the unsettling way the darker themes have taken root in this pastel-colored wonderland.   It just feels like it could have been so much more had they just tightened up the plotting and removed the many ""loading screens"" which do nothing but interrupt the narrative flow.

Fortunately,  the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and brings Oz to watercolor life with its soft hues and delicate detail.  Drawn by the talented Satoi (Diabolik Lovers, Norn9), everything glows from the pastel backgrounds to the gorgeous CGs.  This is one of the BEST looking otome games on Steam with very little variance in artwork quality (although some CGs seem to have slightly better coloring than others).  The voice work is also phenomenal with a few familiar seiyuu lending their talents to the game.  Unfortunately, only about 75% of the lines are voiced, but the more important scenes are fully covered, and it's nice to get a good feel for how the characters sound even if they're not talking through every single line.  

Wow. That seems like a lot of criticism for a game I'm recommending, but I probably wouldn't be as critical if I didn't feel like there was untapped potential here.  OZMAFIA!! is a great idea that falters due to haphazard execution, but it's still a tale worth experiencing as long as one can push through the jumbled mess of a story and raunchier plot points.  And if you can skip the Brothel route, cause...yeah...

I've wanted this game forever and I did finally buy it a couple weeks ago, I've yet to finish all the routes but I'm enjoying it nonetheless.

Here's my review as to why I consider OZMAFIA!! to be an otome I'd recommend:

[b] Pros: [/]
- It's so beautifll drawn, the colours aren't like usual visual novels. It's different and different is good, it stands out.
- The characters are well written and each have their own individual personality which reflects very well. Even though Fuka (your character) is quite dense, it makes for a lot of humour especially in Robin Hoods' route.
- The storyline isn't perfect however it is quite lovely. Each route has 2 endings (except Caramia, Kyrie and Axel who have 4 each I think) I wouldn't call them ""good and bad"" endings but then it depends on the route honestly as some are ""bad"".
- It's not actually that long. It has a lot of routes to take and you'd spend most of your time doing the Oz boys but it's truthfully quite short and sweet.
- The music is beautiful, the theme song is played instrumentally throughout some parts of the story. I personally find it difficult not to sing-along as it's so catchy! However the music does set the mood/atmosphere of what's going on.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- I can't really think of negatives for this otome besides the fact that the endings are quite short, I'd love them lengthened more as I adore all the characters. It'd be nice to have a longer epilogue.
- I'd have enjoyed being able to romance Hansel and Aelling as well as have a longer route with Hamelin.

[b] Overall: [/b]
I love every second I play this game, it always makes me smile when I watch Kyrie, Caramia and Axel's banter. The laughs are always there and even the seriousness can make you feel like you're there. There isn't a set way to do the routes though some recommend doing the Oz boys first (Caramia, Kyrie and Axel) however I did Caesar, Scarlet, Robin Hood and Pashet - going to be doing the Brothel, Soh and finally the Oz boys. Honestly do whichever route suits you first, it doesn't matter.
This game is a blast and you wont feel cheated, if you love the fantasy world then buy this game!
- Pashet isn't a lesbian route, just a friendship route.",1509858758,1509858758,True,8,0,0.644243240356445313,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The artwork was enjoyable and they had many poses/faces for the characters to help set up the mood. The story is based around fairytale characters (set in different Mafia groups) and you, as the female protagonist can hang out and romance quite a few different interesting characters. As with most Otome games, your character has the brains of a earthworm and gets herself into dangerous situations where you have to be saved by a strong-strapping-young-hero. (Example: Mystery dude tries to kills you for reasons you never bother to sort out. You find out he lives in the woods with ruffian vagabonds. Conclusion: LET'S GO EXPLORE THE WOODS AND POKE A WOLF-GUY WITH A STICK!) But I suppose drama makes the heart grow fonder. My favorite characters were the three main Oz boys, which makes sense because the game is mostly centered around them. The other routes aren't as long or well thought out, and most leave you with more questions than answers. Believe it or not, they DO answer most of your questions once you get the super-secret-ending (follow a guide if you need to) but even that ending left me displeased. Yes, it answered questions, but it wasn't satisfying. Still, the rest of the game made up for the lack-luster ending, so I can forgive it.

Some routes feel like a chore to go through just to unlock their CG.

My opinion on how fun the routes are: main characters > robin, caesar, scarlet, soh, hamelin > manboy > pashet

Interesting overarching plot, though it's a chore to unlock it with so many characters. Most of the story is found in the main characters' routes, but nothing much is revealed from the supporting characters.

С одной стороны были очень положительные отзывы, а с другой - недовольная подруга. В итоге я купила эту игру и не пожалела. 
Пишу обзор, пройдя один с половиной сценарий. 
Игрулька о том, как девочка с амнезией попадает в мафию и начинает с парнями мутить, - в принципе, вся суть игры.

Плюсы:
- много рутов; на каждый рут минимум две концовки, одна чуть похуже другой, не могу сказать, что это конкретно плохая и хорошая концовки;
- отличный рисунок, как раз, как я люблю;
- нормальная музяка;
- несложный (лично для меня) английский;
- карточки;
- японская озвучка
- проходит достаточно много времени до того, как гг и ее любимый начинают встречаться (в некоторых новеллах проходит пара-тройка дней, и все - любовь).

Минусы:
- игра запускается в маленьком окошке, а когда выставляешь fullscreen, изображение искажается - вытягивается в ширь. Игра располагается на 1/4 часть моего монитора;
- озвучка частичная - где-то парни трындят, а где-то нет (это даже не минус, а скорее я не могу понять, почему озвучили не все реплики);
- не понравился перескок с одного рута на другой (можно менять руты с одного на другой, если полностью своего бойфренда не заромансить ""до конца"" правильными вариантами ответов). Внезапно гг после фразы своего бойфренда ""я занят на работе, давай расстанемся, найди парня получше"" сразу влюбляется (или просто находит утешение) в другого и прыгает в постель к нему (это было очень внезапно, у меня пригорело, аж играть не хотелось дальше). И это при том, что она со своим бойфрендом даже не поцеловалась. Ну, кто его знает, может так и бывает;
- когда играю долгое время, игра начинает тормозить - текст подвисает, а кнопки нажмаются с пятого раза;
- нет ачивок.
О цене сказать ничего не могу, потому что мой внутренний жадина был бы недоволен, если бы игра стоила даже в 2 раза дешевле. Но, если смотреть на цену новелл на сайтах разработчиков, то 600 рублей - цена нормальная (я лучше заплачу 600 рублей, чем 35 долларов).
В целом, игра неплоха, лучше многих новелл, в которые я играла и которые можно приобрести в стиме.
P.S. По моему мнению, с финалом очень намудрили, можно было сделать все попроще - кажется, будто из кожи вон лезли, чтобы объяснить все, что происходило; но все так, как я и ожидала.",1502442822,1504024840,True,4,0,0.559779882431030273,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game itself wasn't bad, but there are several major drawbacks forcing me to disagree with all of those enthusiastic reviews. 
I could write a long text about things people already mentioned, like painfully stupid and unreasonable MC or annoying loading screens, but I will better focus on one thing that pained me the most which is the storyline.

The game gives you drastically more questions than answers, which I didn't mind at first but after finishing the game I feel just empty. Half of the routes just leads to nowhere and the endings are quite disatisfying and neglected. The most annoying thing is that the game forces you to play everything over and over and over and over again and I honestly admire people who got all of the endings without walkthroughts, I would never have the nerve to go through it more times than I had to in order to unlock the grand ending.

Some of the characters have a great potential, but they just don't have enought space, the routes feel rushed and unfinished. After first few routes I stopped counting how many times I was just staring at that dark screen like ""please tell me it's not the end yet"" [spoiler] Hamelin's route was just one big joke. During the entire game I believed Hamelin will be that kind of ""fated"" partner for MC who is much more wounded than he looks like. But nope, that guy get's like 30 minutes of gameplay while both of the endings are again pretty disatisfying. On the other hand he might be the only character that really got my full attention...just to have me totally heartbroken when I got to know his route is more like a trailer for a whole TV series that is never coming.

The story is quite unique and you seriosly get a lot of different views. I am not sure but I think there is one route missing (Caesar's) because if I remember correctly the Japanese PSP/PS Vita version of Idea Factory(?) contained that as well. But I am not certain because I am not through yet.

Losing your memory doesn't mean you have to lose common sense. You live in a town where mafia families are constantly fightning, and are specifically told to NOT go out at night. Pretty obvious what she decides to do. I'm gonna go for a walk! Idiot...

The visuals, voice acting, and my curiousity on the background story of WHY they're human, and y'know...mafia, are the only reasons I haven't uninstalled yet. If it ends up being one of those games you have to play every single route to get a tiny bit of information on the 'big picture' I'm not even going to bother.

Also the whole love triangle thing you have to go through for every route is really annoying. I didn't realize this was a love triangle game. I thought maybe one route, sure. But to get the 'true ending' you literally have to go through every route, with every other guy as the love triangle intrest. There's like 7 guys, and that's not to mention the Oz boys have 2 different triangle endings each, on top of the 2 pure endings.  

An example: You're pursuing Caramia, then Kyrie comes in. Chose Caramia, reload, chose Kyrie. reload, reject Kyrie, reload, reload reload.

The walkthrough I'm using for Caramia is just so ridiculous, they have to actually tell you when to make new save files, so its easier to go back for all the other routes. Caramia's route page is so long, the scroll bar is a sliver. And this is the same for EVERY. SINGLE. GUY.

Well, how insane, right? But how unique. For the first time, I throughly enjoyed an otome without the worry of repetitiveness, because it was actually an endearing story that was written well. So before the title throws you off, maybe you could learn that uniqueness isn't quite so bad.

Ozmafia really brought some old beloved characters from 'The Wizard Of Oz' back to us all in the same art style as Diabolik Lovers. While the game really did seem to have a lot in common with the other, more popular game series- they used their own devices to make a very heart wrenching story with beautiful characters. A world that is painted in a special way that you can see both sides of every story allows a more in depth experience. You can easily become attached to these characters, and it makes for all the better impact in the end.

In terms of negative, this, like all games- does fall into the repetitive. There's no real commitment to the game or story other than however empathetic you are to the characters and story. It is, unfortunately, another 'just click to get your man' kind of game. There is also a story you can follow that tricks you into thinking you can have a Yuri relationship- but it is not the case.",1498345475,1498345475,True,9,0,0.628533661365509033,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The problem is the plot, it has a lot of holes and feels like a QuinRose's Alice ripoff for the most part. What put me off the most was the constant contradictions. It's almost like the writer forgot about some elements of the world and it's characters. 

Still, it was enjoyable, it's pretty funny too, if the amount of hours I spent on it is anything to go by, I like it. 
We don't have that many otome games localized, it's not the best but it's definitely not the worst. If you like dating 2D boys (and a cat girl) and enjoy mobile kusoge you probably won't mind the plot flaws that much, if you prioritize a good plot... Then you might not like it. If you love playing otome games and want to play a lot of them, then by all means play it, especially if you don't have a psvita (like me </3), besides, if we buy otome games, we'll get more otome games, Ozmafia sold enough to get a physical copy and now mangagamer is localizing another otoge (it's a +18 too), so if this says anything, helping the industry sounds like a good deal.

Also, don't watch the anime before playing this thinking you'll get an idea of how the vn is, you won't, the plot is completely different and the only good thing was [spoiler]seeing Hameln happy (please, just let him be happy, I'll forget all the flaws if you just let him be happy I don't care about the rest).[/spoiler]

So, the summer steam sale came and went and Ozmafia!! was on sale for a whopping 15% off. But I was impatient and grabbed it anyhow. $5 savings is $5 savings after all. And I couldn’t wait any longer. 

Genre: Visual Novel, Fantasy, Romance

Oddly enough my first two tries I ended up with a minor character. And not on purpose. It was a tad frustrating. I did eventually figure out what I was doing wrong, but it wasn’t as clear as I would have liked. 

Artwork: The art is lovely. There are plenty of CG’s to entertain you. 

Characters: There is a good variety of characters. And they all seem to have an actual branching path. Which is my favorite. Some games get repetitive when the only thing that changes is who you go places with and not the actual story. All the characters have a very pretty look. So, if rugged and whatnot is your style they aren’t going to appeal.

I’ll give you a quick rundown of the characters whose routes I’ve done.

Oz Family:

~ Caramia: Very sweet in personality, very kind to heroine, The Cowardly Lion

~ Kyrie: Likes to play games with people, kinda twisted, The Scarecrow

~ Axel: Very cold and  oblivious, The Tin Man

Grimm Family:

- Hameln: Fairly flirty, in trouble with the law, The Piper

- Scarlet: Wishes he was more manly, soft spot for heroine against better judgement, Little Red Riding Hood

Stival Family:

> Pashet: Strong and confident, teaches the heroine skills, Puss in Boots

Wolf Gang:

* Caesar: Acts tough, threatens heroine on regular basis, The Big Bad Wolf

*So: Very friendly, wants heroines dreams to come true, and I’m not certain who he is suppose to represent

There are a two more routes, but I’m not interested in playing through them. 

Plot: It’s actually pretty solid, but the big question doesn’t seem to be answered in the main game play. I guess there are two ending scenes that you unlock  by playing every route. But that is a lot of hours in and not all the routes interest me.

Replayability: There are some scenes added in as you complete routes.  I don’t think that truly adds to the replay value. I’m not all the interested in going back and playing routes to see a couple extra scenes. But since each route takes time I don’t think lack of replay value actually is an issue. Most visual novels have decreased values in replaying them.

There were a couple cons I just want to get out there. One: There are a ton of loading screens. It gets a little tiresome and since they are all pretty much the same it isn’t visually interesting. Two: The story is in third person perspective. You can get over that, but it isn’t the norm for visual novels. It didn’t phase me after awhile, but I know it bothered other people. Three: It isn’t fully voiced. While there are many scenes that are voiced sometimes the voice acting stops before you are done with a scene which can be a bit jarring. Four: There are no romanceable ladies. Which was a shame since one of the routes that was the best was with a woman. But you can’t romance her. 

While I did enjoy this game……. with the hefty price tag and the cons I have a difficult time recommending it to folks at it’s set price. Not to say I think the price is unreasonable for a visual novel as big as this one, but it’s really a matter of how much you like the premise that will determine whether you love it or not. I liked it. So, thumbs up from me. Use your own judgement to decide if it is worth if for you!",1496805403,1496805403,True,6,0,0.592024087905883789,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The way they organized the CGs was a little odd to me, many of the character's CGs were listed under ' Other ' which just seemed odd. It was really hard to tell which options gave you more affection with certain characters, which made staying on route without guide difficult in my opinion. However, all these little things didn't amount to much in my opinion of the game! By the time I completed the Oz boy’s routes I was definitely happy with my purchase. I lived for the moments of ' team hazing ' to embarrass another character, the artwork was really decent, and the voice acting was good too. I really recommend playing the oz boys first, helps when you want to skip texts. I played in this order - Caramia > Axel > Kyrie > (Then did all the triangles) > Pashet > Scarlet > Robin > Brothel > Cesar > and LEAVE SOU FOR LAST. There is no good or bad endings, but B endings were pretty hard for me to swallow. Outside of Caesars I actually liked his B ending more, Kyrie's line about Fuka x Caesar was great. I saved the Epilogue and Grand Ending for last, and I really recommend that cause I feel like the Epilogue might spoil some routes a bit?

I wanted to wait until I officially finished the game before writing a review.  This may contain spoilers (depending on how you look at things), so read at your own risk.  Otherwise, I give it a 10/10 rating


  
Let me start by saying this is by far the best otome I have ever played in my life and I have played quite a few.  Most otomes have one or maybe two characters I am interested in; the rest of the storylines have no appeal to me.  This one was different.  Every storyline has some appeal to it.  There are my favorites (Kyrie and Hamelin), but I enjoyed them all.  A lot of people seem to be saying that the Brothel storyline ruined the game for them.  The point of an otome is to appeal to a wide variety of people.   I would probably say I liked the Brothel storyline least of all, but it didn’t really bother me.  (This is also coming from someone who is a big fan of Diabolik Lovers (Laito ❤))  If you are just completely opposed to kinky, mental abuse, then yeah, you are going to have problems with the Brothel storyline, but it would be a shame to let one storyline ruin an amazing game. 
 
This otome gives incentive to finish it 100%.  This is how it works.  You play a storyline to the ending, either A or B (both are “good” endings, there really isn’t any “bad” endings, but obviously, you’ll like one more than the other).  When you play that storyline again to get the other ending you will see scenes you didn’t see before.  Mostly private scenes showing what the main love interest is thinking/doing.  It gives a lot of insight into the story.  The Oz boys each have two pure love endings and two transferred endings (when you start with one guy but halfway through decide to be with one of the others).  They are the only ones to have transferred endings.  Everyone else has two endings each.  
After you have gone through each storyline once the book the main character is holding on the title screen will be clickable and you will be able to see the epilogue.  DO NOT DO THIS YET.  It is tempting and you will get a lot of answers, but you will be frustrated because the grand finale will not open until you have somewhere above 90% completion, I don’t remember what number exactly.  I recommend you play through each of the endings (Don’t forget to reject one Oz guy for another ending) and then do both the epilogue and grand finale.  

When you have completed this game 100% I think every question should be answered.  Unless I forgot something, I was completely satisfied with the story at the end.  I see a lot of people complain that there were a lot of unanswered questions, but if you do all the storylines, the epilogue, and the grand finale, everything should be answered.  If you are looking for a game to just play through once, this is not the game for you; you will be left with a lot unanswered.  

I think the best way to play the game (which I didn’t do unfortunately T_T) is:

1.	All Oz storylines – These give the most overall to the main storyline

2.	Pashet – This is a friendship line and you’ll still be dealing with the Oz boys a lot, so I just think this one makes sense to play next.

3.	Brothel -  You can probably play this one at any time.  It contributes the least amount to the main storyline, so I think it’s better to just get it over with before you get too hooked on wanting answers.  I would just try to at least play it before Hamelin’s story.  
4.	Scarlet -  I really recommend playing Scarlet before Hamelin.  

5.	Hamelin - (Reject an Oz boy to get this one) Make sure to play both of Hamelin’s lines before Robin hood, just because I think it makes you feel hyped up about Robin Hood’s storyline where there was no hype (at least for me) before.

6.	Robin Hood -  This is a big “answers” storyline.

7.	Caesar -  Play this one before Soh. 

8.	Soh -  This will leave you with a bunch questions that will be answered in the epilogue.  

9.	Epilogue

10.	Grand Finale 

At the end, all your questions should be answered and you should be left with a smile on your face.

Ozmafia tries to set up all these ideas but refuses to explore any of them: not a single one.

This game gives you a ton of content in that respect but without any follow throughs there's 0 chemistry between ANYONE because no one is left in a situation long enough to see it conclude. There's no build up to the confession scenes at all. There's no chemistry building, there's not a lot of time spent together in meaningful ways (with the exception of the brothel hilariously enough), and suddenly you're confessed to that they're in love with you and...I'm just sitting here like ""HOW!?"". 
I can think of only one scene that has a conclusion and that was breakfast. And all they did was eat breakfast and then they were done eating. But at least it had an ending to the scene. And there was a sort of conclusion to the beauty pageant even if the entire thing takes place in the ""fade to black"" and then is explained to you in four sentences after it happens. But it doesn't actually mean anything to the story. Situations never develop into ANYTHING EVER.

-Oh, Cesar is back in town and wants to kill you still? Let's not address this in any way. Have a duel happen off screen. And then cut to the next day where we'll never speak of it again. Because we won't even address who Cesar is and what he wants from you the entire game unless you do his route or So's route. Otherwise, he'll just keep popping in the story and no one seems to care. At all. No one even pays attention to the fact it's happening. It's completely inconsequential to the story.

-Oh, you're in love and dating now? Okay. Let's have a confession screen, fade to black IMMEDIATELY after your love interest says he's in love with you, and then never mention it ever again.

-Here, go into town with Axel so you can talk about absolutely nothing. You don't have to buy anything. You just go into town, have about 6 lines of dialogue and then fade to black and it's tomorrow.

-Let's run back into a violent scuffle to find this little girl we apparently saw earlier despite the fact it's never mentioned that you saw her and she never shows up on screen UNTIL you go back to save her. And then she's never brought up again. No one talks about who SHE is or why you went back into the line of fire. No one talks about who she is. I'm not convinced she even really exists. No one even vaguely aludes to her presence but she's clearly physically there.

-Here, go to a meeting about the upcoming festival. Oh, wait, you can't be there. Get kicked out of meeting and stand outside while the meeting takes place off screen. You're never filled in on the meeting. The only reason you're in this scene at all is to show that a meeting is in fact happening. But, not about anything relevant to the story nor will you ever find out the contents of said meeting or any implications it doesn't have on the story anyway. Literally, this entire scene is you walking to the meeting with Kyrie, getting kicked out of the meeting, and sitting outside talking to Axel about absolutely nothing until the meeting concludes, Kyrie comes out and....fade to black. It's tomorrow!

-You have amnesia and no one knows who you are. No one seems to care either and this will not be a relevant plot point EVER until the very end of the game and even then it's explained in two pages and never matters ever again. It does absolutely nothing in the story. Not a thing. Caramia brings it up once because he's reading a book on it. Does this ever come up again ever? Nope.

-Let's have an entire scene where we burn books to cook potatoes. Did we accidentally burn a book we needed? Nope. Is there a reason we couldn't have prepared the potatoes in doors like other food scenes? Nope. Do we get to witness the potato eating as we connect together as an odd family just enjoying each other's presence? Nope. This scene, like every scene in this entire game, has no baring on the story and no conclusion. It's barely a set up, virtually no middle content..and then no conclusion either. No plot advancement. No character advancement.

-Carmia talks about how he's always prone to getting sick. This will never come up again. Ever. An entire scene is spent for him to talk about how he's always sick and it doesn't do anything for the story and is never brought up.

-Dr. Robin Hood is here to conduct a physical on everyone! Why? Uh...no reason. This doesn't go anywhere. You take a nap while the boys get checked out, Dr. Robin Hood comes to your room to perform your physical. Everyone is healthy. Doesn't even use this as a chance to talk about how Caramia is always sick. You're perfectly fine too. Nothing happens. Fade to black.


Honestly the brothel has more development than the main three love interests. Everyone talks about how strange the brothel route is because it has the least to do with the story. And you're right, it does! But because of that, it also actually goes places with its development in characters and its own plot. It actually has substance to it.

It doesn't really give you any foundation for a relationship with any of these characters. They just WEREN'T trying. If this wasn't a dating sim I'd be more forgiving but the fact it does have the audacity of culminating in a relationship (that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere) is a problem. I don't think its worth the money. I love the idea, I love the anime..the anime has more depth than this game does. And the anime is 12 episodes of 4 minute long situations and that's it. And THAT has more development than this game. And before you try to tell me, you unlock scenes after you play a route...1. the unlocked scenes don't give anything to the story either. 2. You have to play through this game so many times just to unlock stuff. It is the biggest chore I've ever had in a dating sim. 3/4 the game is the same regardless of who you pursue but those choices matter so you have to go through that same 3/4 the game over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over to unlock everything to try to make this game maybe a fraction more sense.",1490392474,1490392474,False,20,5,0.572775781154632568,3,True,False,False,False,,,

PROS:
+ super cute artwork. I really love the style itself and the character designs are all brilliant as well.
+ A+ voices.
+ cool take on the Wizard of Oz story and other fictional characters. really interesting and unique.
+ I do love the dudes I've played so far, even the darker ones, but those things are always subjective.
+ if you replay a route, you get extra scenes that add quite a bit of context to the story.
+ lots of choices, something I'm not really used to from most otome games.

CONS:
- Fuka (the MC) is next level useless and bland. she has no real personality (yes, she has amnesia, but BOY is it hard to forgive her utter lack of character even knowing this). she always just comes along for the ride. she has no strong opinions on anything. does she love the guy she's with? who knows? not I. not her. she SAYS she does, so.... I guess? basically she's an empty shell who says yes and amen to everything and is so unbelievably stupid at times it makes you WISH the guys out to kill her would just FINALLY SUCCEED.
- game skips over a lot of stuff that would be interesting. can be good when you just wanna focus on the romance, kinda rips you out of the immersion more often than not though. (e.g. a fight ensues, 2 people face each other, suddenly you're back home and it's been a week since that happened and everything's dandy.)
- SOME CHARACTERS DO NOT HAVE ANY REALLY GOOD ENDINGS. this is a big no-no for me, so be warned. yes, some characters do not have ANY endings that are happy, even if they're stamped as the ""good"" ending, you do NOT end up together or your relationship isn't really acknowledged.

WARNING
Yes, the brothel route is dark and twisted and abusive. I personally like it in principle as I don't mind this brand of darkness, however, Fuka's blank slate character that makes her seem like a clueless child makes the whole thing EXTRA creepy and put a lot of people off.

TL;DR
It's good. There's a lot of content. 10 characters to pursue, each with at least 2 endings. The Oz guys get 4. Those have 2 ""transfered endings"", meaning you start out pursuing one of them and end up choosing his rival. Surprisingly, those endings are somehow cuter than the ones you get if you stick with your original choice. Overall I love it, but you're gonna get cheated out of a happy ending quite a few times. 7/10.

[h1]Pros:	[/h1]
-The art is AMAZING!
-The CGs
-10 Routes
-Over 20 endings 
-*Transfer endings
-It takes roughly 4-7 hours to get pure heart ending A or B (the good endings)
-There are NO ""bad"" endings. Some are worse then others but nothing too bad
-The characters 
-The music
-The stories (and how insteresting and unique they are)
-Sha la la la la la la la la la 
-**The protaginist
-There are some really sweet moments in each route (except for the brothel route I assume)
-Almost every character, even non-important ones get some art done for their faces

[h1]Cons:	[/h1]
-Sometimes the writing goes from very good to just ok for some certain scenes
-THE LOADING SCREANS! After the mid way point in a route there will be a loading screan after every interaction
-The Protaganist (yes i've listed her twice keep reading and you'll see why)
-Unresolved sceanes or buildup for something and never finding out what happned 
-***The brothel route


*Transfer Endings
Transfer endings are really unique for otome games. What will happen is if you are on someones route, sometimes depending on the answers you pick, you can leave the guy you are currently with to be with another guy without feeling too horrible (which was one of my main concerns) and get tranfer ending A or B for that guy. The transfer endings don't take too long (20min-50min) to complete and sometimes they will explain or hint at things in their own route.

**The Protaginist
Fuka (or whatever you want to name her) Is a bit of an odd character. She's not the worst otome protaginist but she's far from the best. In most routes [spoiler] (Especially in the Oz routes)[/spoiler] she's really nice and sweet and what you would typically expect from a otome game. In some routes though [spoiler](Brothel, Kyrie, Caramia and sometimes Scarlets)[/spoiler] shes a really diffrent person rather being rude, not standing up for herself and just letting someone else control her. You'll probably find yourself yelling at your laptop saying WHY WOULD YOU DO/SAY THAT!?! The best example I can give without spoiling anything is Kyrie's route as a whole. He will contantly boss Fuka around and bully her. He even says ""I just want to see you in agony"" and stuff like that on multiple occasions. The upside is things do eventually get better but not until the endings. (Kyrie's endings are pretty sweet compared to his route)  [spoiler] Even in the transfer endings he dosen't really care if you leave him or not making his route feel a little more empty [/spoiler] (got a little off topic there sorry)

***The Brothel Route
This is a really controvercial route. It ruined the game for a lot of people so be prepared! Personally, I didn't mind it too much because it explains a lot about the world you are in but like I just said, the MC is a completly diffrent person. There is a drugging scene and an abuse scene so if you get triggred easily, rather don't play the game or just avoid doing this route (you won't get 100% completion but if it will make you hate the game, its probably best if you don't play it)

For order of routes, I would say do these people first to last:
-Caramia
-Axel
-Kyrie
-Pashet
-Scarlet
-Caesar
-Brothel
-Robin Hood
-Soh
-Hamelin

You can do whatever route you want to but if you play it in this order, things won't get spoiled before you play that route. 

But yes, I do reccomend the game, it may have some classic otome flaws but it really is a great game overall :D

Edit: When you choose to spend time with someone you'll spend time with them and then go back to content you've already read on other routes so the first route you do will take a LOT longer then any other route you do if you choose to skip content you've already seen

The best things about Ozmafia was the idea surrounding this world as well as a number of its characters. It was interesting to have story book characters thrown into the world of the mafia with each family competing for dominance or simply to maintain and gain more territory. 

Each of the main character suitors were well developed in their personalities. BUT, it was a little weird how, in the middle of each of their routes, you end up swaying to the possibility of changing your object of desire. It wasn't necessarily bad per se. Every story you read is going to have their own style and their own way of doing things, but the way it happens was shallow. In one route, if you do not play your cards right,  Caramia and the MC end their relationship for no other reason than that she made him take a bath. I mean, they didn't even really discuss the problem whatsoever and before you know it, the MC ends up going out with Kyrie instead. It feels like you were alright going on this one train and then suddenly, without any warning, the MC just jumps on to another train at full speed ahead. Just be prepared for some whip lash. 

And I really hated this MC. There were a few moments when she manages to add her own snarky responses that you'd wouldn't expect, but the reality, she is childish. The maturity levels between her love interests (which at times can also be questionable) compared to the MC is so overwhelming that if you stop and think about it is pretty gross. It is like picturing mature teenagers or young adults pursuing a serious relationship with a girl who might, at best, just managed to reach her teenage years. 

Yuck.

Ignoring the MC, which is what I always did anyway, I also disliked having so many character routes that made this story dragged on for eternity just to get to the main finale. There were a lot of character routes that seemed so inconsequential that it would have been better to spend that money on their voice actors. Half the time, you can listen to the characters as they are speaking to you and half the time, you only get to read what they are saying to you. Why? It would have been better to cut out five of those pointless routes and simply pay to have their actors voice the entire thing. 

Unfortunately, they didn't do that. 

The last thing I hated about this VN was a couple plot holes and details. I don’t want to spoil it for you… (Or maybe I should because…gag me…), but it has to do with the origins and structure of the tower and as well as Dorothy’s magic and where it ended up manifesting. It was ridiculous, though comical, and I did (since we were going that way anyway) like the explanation why we should accept that answer. Sure, why not at this point, right? Though, we could have been spared of that plot hole by having a better one, but meh. Details. 

Just be prepared to lose a couple brain cells when you come to it. 

Other than that, it was a decent VN, not great, but decent enough. The drawings were amazing. The voice actors, when you got to enjoy them, great. And the story, although flawed in some areas, were well done in others. There were moments that tugged at the heart-strings, moments that were humorous and lighthearted and others that were rather cruel, but something you'd expect in the mafia world. 

Personally, I think it would be better to wait for when it is on sale just because of those those flaws, but overall, decent enough for recommendation.

Узнала про Озмафию совершенно случайно. Решила купить благодаря рекомендации [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kezuar]Kezuar[/url] (ещё раз спасибо тебе! ^^).

Сначала немного смутило обилие персонажей (не могла понять, кто больше нравится) и пастельные оттенки графики. Но стоило чуть-чуть поиграть... и понеслась... в течение недели каждый день после работы приходила домой и старательно проходила рут за рутом, всё глубже погружаясь в волшебный мир. 

Сюжет начинается классически — симпатичная девушка приходит в себя и обнаруживает, что у неё совсем нет воспоминаний. Тут же её начинает преследовать незнакомец, который сперва тоже не совсем понимает, что происходит, и это не спроста... 

Набор концовок, CG-артов и героев впечатляет. В этой игре можно найти романтику и сюжеты развития событий на любой вкус. Лично мне больше всех понравились руты Цезаря и Кириэ. Цезарь — буйный дикий зверь, который упорно хочет наложить лапу на свою добычу. Только, как потом окажется, совсем не в том смысле, в каком все думали... Что же касается Кириэ, то тут двояко. Поначалу я считала его отмороженным козлом, но после его счастливого рута поняла, что с этим мужиком не пропадёшь. Кириэ — хитрожопое создание с остреньким язычком. И он один из немногих, кто реально понимает, как надо обращаться с женщиной. Из забавного — насмешило, как Карамия практически во всех рутах намекал или откровенно говорил героине, что он её любит. Настойчивый парень! Из грустного — рут Робина Гуда. Хотя мне очень приглянулась его «счастливая» концовка, такое вполне могло случиться и в реальной жизни.

Очень понравилось, как обыграли сказку про волшебника страны Оз (и не только её). Персонажи ближе к концу рутов теряют себя, но если героиня делает правильный выбор, они вновь обретают самих себя и счастье. Это хорошо отражает важность отношений — любимый человек поддерживает тебя и принимает таким, каков ты есть, отдаваясь полностью. Вдохновляет на борьбу со страхами, врагами и даже с самой судьбой.

В игре две концовки: эпилог и гранд финал. Оба запускаются при нажатии книги в главном меню. Чтобы открыть эпилог, надо заполучить как минимум по одной счастливой концовке для каждого персонажа. Чтобы запустить гранд финал, который расскажет, чем же всё закончилось на самом деле, надо пройти все руты, все варианты развития событий, открыть все CG (кроме одного арта, который откроется после гранд финала).

Озмафия — прекрасный представитель визуальных новелл. Романтика, приключения, опасности на каждом шагу, лихие сюжетные повороты, великолепно продуманные характеры персонажей и оригинальный интересный сюжет, от которого в конце игры может попросту отвиснуть челюсть.

За поверхностные, как простыня, и дырявые, как дуршлаг, руты. За нелогичные, а порой и конкретно ООС поступки персонажей. За вульгарно обыгранные любовные треугольники и бордель с клиникой. За феерически раздражающую систему, которая вынуждает тебя проходить 26 концовок, чтобы докопаться до основного сюжета, и прогонять один и тот же рут по 2 раза, дабы не пропустить половину происходящего. За паталогическую привычку обрывать все нормальные сцены на самом интересном месте и черный экран с тынь-дынь-дынь-дынь-дынь через каждые 2 минуты.

Звучит, как антиреклама, нэ? Да потому что OZMAFIA!! – она вся измазана в этом нереализованном потенциале. Из нее можно было сделать если не шедевр, то хотя бы настоящую годноту. А в результате слепили то, что слепили.

Но я честно скажу, что это одна из моих самых любимых отоме и визуальных новелл вообще. Потому что хоть она такая, откровенно говоря, хреновая, есть в ней что-то такое… особенное, что согревает сердце и вызывает улыбку на лице. Да, я просто влюблена в этот сказочный мир, в этих живых колоритных персонажей, которые его населяют, в этот город с красивыми улочками, мощеными желтым кирпичом, и таинственной башней, стремящейся в небо. И вот, ты заходишь в сейвы, слышишь знакомое «La-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-la-la» – и чувствуешь себя так тепло и уютно, как будто вернулась домой. Да, сюда и правда хочется возвращаться, а возвращаясь, хочется всех обнять. И как-то даже ненароком думаешь – омг, как же я по вас по всем соскучилась!

К слову, персонажи в OZMAFIA!! действительно замечательные, нешаблонные, многогранные, а за их взаимодействием и реакциями, можно наблюдать вечно. Кирие – так вообще one of the best written characters, которых я видела за последнее время. Он, как радужный опал – одни и те же его поступки ты видишь по-разному, в зависимости от того, насколько ты его понимаешь, но ты вряд ли поймешь его даже после четырех прогонов его собственного рута. Признаюсь, вначале я Кирие терпеть не могла… но мой первый ран, который я вела без прохождений, обернулся полнейшим провалом с сопитием водки. Единственный, кто хоть как-то разделял мои эмоции о происходящем и вытянул концовку, был именно Mr. Scarecrow со своими ехидными комментариями. А потом, он очень сильно удивил меня в прямом B-эндинге Карамии. А потом, оказалось, что его сейю озвучивал другого моего любимого персонажа. А потом, началось…

И знаешь, несмотря на тухло проработанную динамику рутов, в OZMAFIA!! есть то, что я очень ценю в отоме-играх – она показывает любовь в самых различных проявлениях, будь то «она встречалась с ним полгода, а потом прыгнула в постель к первому, кто предложил», моральный бдсм, банальная жалость или бордель, обыгрывающий гедонизм в духе Дориана Грея на порядок выше, чем ожидаешь от игры для всех возрастов. Но самое главное то, что некоторые руты заканчиваются плохо, вне зависимости от твоих решений. То есть что бы ты ни делала, как бы ты себя ни вела, как бы ни пыталась что-то изменить, эти отношения тупо не работают и изначально обречены. И тебя не пытаются ублажить какими-то притянутыми за уши ванильными концовками: нет, выбирай – плохо или еще хуже.

А еще, мне безумно нравится, что многие моменты застывают в воздухе намеками без объяснений, поэтому ты можешь сама додумать, что же произошло на самом деле. И это забавно – когда читаешь обзоры, то замечаешь, что все расшифровывают одну и ту же ситуацию совершенно по-разному, а иногда находишь новые подробности, которые сама даже не заметила. Соглашаться с ними или нет твое право – здесь тебя не ведут за ручку, не кормят флешбэками и не разжевывают все до единого знаменателя. А что же касается простых повседневных сцен… да, в них нет никакого смысла – но это и делает их такими родными и близкими, такими похожими на реальность, где большинство разговоров все так же непоследовательны и абсолютно ни о чем.

Мне нравится арт от госпожи Satoi. Фирменный сатои-стайл, дизайн спрайтов, цветовая палитра и CG просто очаровательны [strike](разве что разрешение маловато и задники замылены)[/strike]. Мне нравится игра сейю и музыка. Голоса свежие, незаезженные и идеально подходят персонажам [strike](а то бывает же иногда, что смотришь на персонажа и, хоть его озвучка сама по себе ох, как хороша, но прямо диссонирует со внешностью и характером героя)[/strike]. Ну, про то, как я стала фанаткой Article One и ревела над Vivace!! OST я уж тебе рассказывать не буду, но хочется отдать должное переводу от MangaGamer – например, то, как они превратили «ojou-san» в «signorina», а «ojou-chan» в «fraulein». Такие мелочи и создают настроение. =)

А вообще, OZMAFIA!! – особенная, потому что на тебя не вешают роль Главной Героини. Тут даже повествование ведется от третьего лица, а мысли Фука-Факи остаются за кадром. А вот кто ты в этой истории на самом деле – на этот вопрос, как и на многие другие, каждый найдет свой ответ. Если, конечно, захочет. Потому что, как я уже говорила, эта новелла не для всех. Но я очень надеюсь, что ты полюбишь ее так же, как и я.",1486726268,1497693017,True,35,2,0.77462691068649292,19,True,False,False,False,,,

The artist who worked on Diabolik Lovers designed the characters so if you have played this game, you will be familiar with the art style; only the characters are far less sadistic and are not vampires.

The game starts off with the protagonist waking up in an alley with no memory of who or where she is only to find herself on the run from a mysterious silver-haired man who wants to take her life. Luckily, she bumps into the Don of the Oz family and she is taken into their care.

From here, you are given the option to choose who you want to spend time with, with some characters available right from the beginning while others are unlocked as you progress through the routes. It was refreshing that the game does not feed you the right answer to the choices you make and unlike other games, there is no ""affection"" bar which makes you go in blind. The only way to track your progress is by viewing the CG gallery for each character.

There are ten routes to choose from, and an additional two, Epilogue and Grand Finale, which are only unlocked if you have completed all character routes and their endings, including the transfer routes. This game also has extra scenes when you go through a character's route for the second time which allows further insight on either a conversation or situation that took place from that character's point of view. I found this a unique bonus that is not typically found in other otome or visual novel games.

Each character is also unique and fantastically written which draws you in wanting to know more about them and watch as they develop. Just to name a few, there's an adorable friendship, a tragic past and there's even an entertaining sarcastic jerk that made me laugh on several occasions.

That being said, this game does have adorable moments but it can get quite dark. There's blood, sex and violence, which is written descriptively, bloody character sprites and some CGs which could make others uncomfortable. [spoiler]Two routes in particular, Brothel and Robin Hood, lead to prostitution and the other has a particular scene that is the result of being drugged. The first one has characters warn you repeatedly to stay away while the other offers you obvious choices to pick when conversing with Robin.[/spoiler]

Overall, I throughly enjoyed this game with it's beautiful visuals, intriguing universe and wonderful soundtrack that it justified the cost of this purchase.

This game is also available on the Playstation Vita in Japan, released as OZMAFIA!! Vivace, and contains new scenarios, illustrations and mini games which I was a bit disappointed not to have included in this release. If the Vita port gets released in English, I would not hesitate to buy this again for the extra content and playing through the story once more.",1484426271,1484426271,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately this was probably one of the biggest let downs I’ve experienced in gaming. The art is so beautiful but there’s just- nothing! Nothing of substance in the plot, characters or writing. There's also no sense of atmosphere or even investment. The characters are just cardboard cutouts (it also doesn’t help that the designs are eerily similar to the Diabolik Lovers ones – Axel = Ruki, Scarlet = Kanato, Kyrie = Laito etc) and yes they talk a bunch of exposition and backstory to you but it just falls flat.

I don’t feel like I know these people, or that they could genuinely care and love Fuka (She’s a blank slate! But the story sure demands that they love her) and you can practically feel yourself being manipulated by the game. It tries to pull the right strings by repeating tropes often found in otome and romance games, but the difference here is that you’re hyper aware of it. Where other games mask this by creating investing plots, engaging characters and scenes that stir your heart, Ozmafia will have you rolling your eyes and yawning.

 Fuka has no personality and is basically a doll to smile and look pretty. She says insensitive things that can be passed off because – lol she’s so naive, isn’t it quirky! 

*Sigh* I really wanted to like this game, I really did. I tried to turn my brain off and just enjoy the dialogue, nice voice actors, and pretty art if there was no plot, but nothing made me want to keep playing. I wanted to support more otome games since many titles have yet to be translated that deserve attention, but buying this game is not worth your time or money.

You are dragged to the unknown world ruled by mafia families, where as an innocent and beautiful young lady you start to explore it and get to know its inhabitants. What is more, you do not get bored, there always happens something interesting. Even if some events are not shown directly [spoiler](eg. beauty pageant)[/spoiler], it is still addictive. Not to mention a beautiful art style and partial voice acting, which hook you even more into this game.

What makes this game a gem is the characters. They are vivid, mysterious and almost all of them are captivating. It is as if you were dragged into a book, where you fall in love with those people, start to understand them and their feelings. Additionally, you can interact with them. You could say that this is purpose of the game: to be able to pick answers and to lead the story by your own. However, I could not say which person I would choose finally, they are all so impressive [spoiler](really, I even cheered for Pashet x Axel, even though he is my favourite one here)[/spoiler]. There are about 9 romanceable guys [spoiler](I don’t know how to count those from the brothel route xd)[/spoiler], one friendship route and about 21 endings.

What is the best part of this game is that a player develops some kind of bond towards the characters. Their relationships and the way they talk to each other seem to be natural, as if they were real. The atmosphere of conflict which can be triggered anytime is also convincing. And after you finish all the routes and the secret ending, you start to miss this game: Axel’s cute awkwardness toward the MC, Caramia’s protective attitude, even Kyrie’s mean yet intelligent comments.
 
When you come back to browse CGs gallery, characters welcome you in Japanese, and talk to you about particular photos. I find it charming. The game is more authentic with such details.

Infelizmente, não foi o que eu esperava...
Prós:
- As vozes. Estão todas maravilhosas e muito bem feitas;
- O visual é simplesmente lindo! Pena que em full screen fica um pouco estranho...
- A quantidade de rotas. Você tem várias opções a sua disposição!

Contras: 
- A protagonista. Não consigo descrever em palavras o quanto ela me irritou, sinceramente. Ela simplesmente não passou emoção no jogo e, não consegui me identificar com ela. Ela foi a principal razão pra parar de jogar. Ela é muito alegre e otimista (nada contra, mas...), e já no começo do jogo deu pra perceber que ela não pensa muito nas consequências (Como por exemplo, não desconfiar de praticamente NINGUÉM no início).
Outro motivo que me irritou demais é ela ser ""meio"" lerda pra entender as coisas (Tanto que, na maioria das vezes, o Kyrie tira uma onda com a cara dela, e ela NÃO percebe que ele é sarcástico na maior parte do tempo......). 
E não para por aí! A quantidade de desculpas que ela pede... é absurdamente grande. Até quando ela não faz NADA de errado ela pede desculpa!
Infelizmente não posso falar muito da história, porque EU NÃO CONSEGUI ter paciência.
- A falta de escolhas. Eu sei que tem visual novel que a maior parte é ler e.... ler. Mas senti que esse jogo deveria ter mais escolhas (para evitar que a protagonista fale uma abobrinha atrás da outra). 
- Pelo pouco tempo que passei jogando, não senti muito carisma dos outros personagens... Um dos motivos para não ter me prendido no jogo.
- O preço. Fiquei frustada por ter pago 47 reais (e olha que comprei na promoção, pois o preço normal é 63 reais!).

Conclusão: 
Os pontos positivos não compensam os negativos. O visual é lindo, as vozes são lindas, mas... não compensou pra mim. Não consegui me prender à história, e a protagonista ficou devendo muito.

I will admit, that this game was enjoyable at times (especially during first playthrough). It has a lot of content (pursuable characters, CGs, choices, extra scenes, endings, special ending, etc.). Translation is good. Graphic is beautiful. Story is intriguing, even though poorly executed. I liked most of pursuable characters, despite them being rather cliche.

For me, it started as a pleasant experience and quickly transformed into a boring chore.

[h1]Bad stuff:[/h1]

[b]Protagonist.[/b] This is a first point for a reason. I feel that Fuka (name is changeable) is what, ultimately, ruins the whole game for me. I don't think I ever generated this level of hatred towards playable character. And believe me, I am very well used to idiotic protagonists, with no personality. The thing is, Fuka is not only brainless, useless, constantly happy for no reason and naive. She's also unlikable as hell. I read a few reviews and I've noticed that some people consider third-person narration as an immersion breaker. I don't think that's the issue. You can present character's actions, thoughts, reflections and motives in that way. The problem is, Fuka has almost none of those and even first-person narration wouldn't fix that. It would enhance it, because then it would became painfully obvious. She's a walking, talking, smiling plant. If that wasn't enough, she behave in a way that makes it even harder to sympathize with her. She says things that are obviously hurtful to other characters ([spoiler]particularly on Scarlet's route[/spoiler]). She's not caring at all - there are moments, where her chosen one is about to fight someone and she has absolutely nothing to say about it. Sometimes literally, because even though she's in the same room, other characters decide her fate. All her ""I love you"" moments, seem like she is just going with the flow. And I absolutely ""love"" the moments, where, after guy risks his life for her and gets hurt over her stupidity, she decide to stop talking with him, because someone told her to. Bravo, Fuka. You made me not care about you in the slightest. 

[b]No drama, no tension.[/b] I think this game wasn't as bad as it could be for me, because I quickly stopped treating it seriously and manage to look at it as a ""silly story"". As soon as [spoiler] assassin, who is going after protagonist, instead of killing her, informs her, that he's about to do that, and then run after her through town and then, after she bumps into someone, he kind of threatens her and then walks away[/spoiler], I already knew, there is absolutely nothing to be afraid in this game. I was right, since [spoiler] the same assassin comes back and basically announce what he's about to do every God damn time, instead of actually doing anything[/spoiler]. Same goes for drama. Fuka ruins every more-serious scene she's in.

[b]Action happens off-screen.[/b] You hear about something really cool, like festival or fight, but then you get transfer to another day, after all that is over. At best, you will get a few sentenced about what happened. At worst, you'll get nothing. Which leads me to...

[b]Unresolved scenes.[/b] So fight is just about to happen and then... We have next scene and I don't even know how it ended! Did they kill the other guy? Did he run away? Did they let them go? Did they arrest him? I guess I should just assume, because game gives zero explanation. Btw, this a perfect example of moment, when third-person narrative would be perfect to give us, players, some insight, without writing extra scenes/dialogues (as, apparently, fight was completely unimportant), but nah. Who cares.

[b]""Loading screens"".[/b] I'm not sure if this is what they are, because you can skip them with the rest of the text, which shouldn't happen if it would be a loading screen, should it? This looks like some sort of artistic decision and it was a terrible one. They didn't bother me that much during my first playthrough. During every single one next, they were painfully to look at - literally, as the picture and subtitles are very bright on a black background.

[b]Rushed routes.[/b] Oz guys have the most fleshed out routes, but even those feel disappointing and lacking. As for other characters, things happens, because they do, and characters do stuff, because they do, without any motivation, reason or previous setup.

[b]Endings.[/b] Again, rushed. They usually aren't established in any way and honestly I didn't get even one ending that would feel satisfying.

[b]Wasted potential.[/b] Transferring well-known characters to the alternate world, where various mafias rule the city, is a great idea. Setting is amazing, the vision of endless conflict and possible fights intriguing and terrifying. This game should be much more darker, greedy and action-packed, but this is JUST a love story. And it's not even good at that.

[b]Price.[/b] Price is always a subjective thing and visual novels are often over-priced because of small customer base, but I always try to compare reviewed games to other, currently available at the marker. My reflection is that:

[*]Quantity-wise it is worth it. If you are looking for a game, that you will play for 20-50 hours, if you want voice-acting, lots of pursuable characters, secret endings and all that good stuff, you will find it here.

[*]Quality-wise it isn't worth it. You can get better plot, deeper characters and better love stories even with some outstanding, free visual novels, not to mention payed ones.

Honestly, I'd say it's not an awful game, but it's good? I dunno... this game does have a lot of flaws, but after finishing it I can look back and say I did enjoy my time playing it (despite my frustration with the MC and lack of telling me what the heck is going on with the plot and how she got there while playing.) I enjoyed getting to know the characters, as there's a lot of routes and endings to explore. I actually had to use a walkthrough with this one so I could keep track. There's also love triangle/transferred ending aspects with the three Oz Mafia characters. A lot of people didn't like those, but I didn't mind them, and they provided for some NICE cgs, heh. The art is great, but I'm sure every other review tells you that as well. Anyways, none of the routes tell you ANYTHING about the main character or the plot. You just learn about the characters, which isn't bad, but the game would have been a lot better to me if it got a bit deeper with character development and plot reveals. It'd be nice to see some hints or foreshadowing to the plot, or any attempt at ALL to help the MC ""get back"" her memories or find out how she got there, but they all just accept it and continue on... like what?! That's not realistic! But, whatever... you only find out about anything during the Epilogue and the Grand Ending.

Besides the plot being a bit shallow, the biggest aspect I disliked about this game was how dense and idiotic the main character is. I know this is kinda common in otome games, but goodness... I honestly wanted to just reach through my screen and punch the MC sometimes for how stupid she was. I know she lost her memories and all (and with the plot reveal of how she got there through the Grand Ending, I guess it kinda makes sense as to why she was a bit dense) but I feel as though if breathing wasn't automatic, she'd forget how to do it and would die within seconds. She's just really, really innocent and dumb and it annoyed me greatly, especially since all of the characters KNOW SHE IS and make fun of her for it and treat her as if she's a 5 year old. Meanwhile, in the Brothel route, she does a complete 180 during the end and I'm just left to think... where the heck... did this side of her just come from... is this really the same girl who was told to drink milk in a bar and got passed out drunk after one sip of Caramia's alcohol...? Hah. Btw, speaking of Brothel route... weird as hell, but I have the biggest soft spot for Alfani.

Anyways, the plot reveal was cool, but don't expect some huge, cool, new story out of it. With some of the explanations, I was kinda like, ""...Oh?"" but at least it put everything into place. I can't really explain it any other way without spoiling. While I was playing and knew nothing about the overall plot though, I was getting a bit upset that I wasn't getting any answers during gameplay/routes, and wondered if I would ever get any at all.

Anyways, as a conclusion, I do recommend it. Not the best, and probably not worth how expensive it is for an otome game, but it was a long game and I enjoyed it for the most part. Also, even if I really, really hated it, I'm not going to impulsively spend $35 only to not play the game! I'm impulsive, but not crazy. After you go through one route, you pretty much have already seen about 50% of the plot for each of the routes... so using Skip for already read parts is a must (this is because, as you are able to ""pick"" who you are going for, the events are all the same, but you get new tidbits with each new character you're going after until you're 100% on their route, which all continue on differently... if that makes sense!) I was surprised at how much I liked Kyrie during his route despite him being a massive turd during other routes (and I guess for some of his own, too). I loved Soh during his route and he made me cry and then I took my crying back during the Epilogue/Grand Ending.

(Let me emphasize that most endings are at least bittersweet. There are few endings that are outright happy and a few that are sad.) If replayability of an otome game is important to you, this will work well for you! If you don't like love triangles or stories where a couple breaks it off and the heroine gets together with someone else, you'll probably want to avoid this, though.

---

[b]Overall Impression:[/b] I do like it in a general sense, but can't help but feel completing the game becomes tedious at points. Several of the characters are wonderful, but after you've seen the ""common event"" scenes a thousand times in pursuit of completing the game, their charm can wear thin, even when you're using the Skip/fast forward function. 


[b]Content:[/b] It's a game about mafia groups and has a route called ""The Brothel Route"" - that should give you a general idea that there is some violent, twisted, and at least heavily implied sexual content. (And it has all of these things.) Please keep in mind that there will probably be areas of the story that you will find upsetting or uncomfortable - and most of them were probably meant to make you feel that way. Honestly, I'm very disappointed with The Brothel Route in general - not out of prudishness, but when you unlock the Grand Finale ending, IMHO, it doesn't even make sense that it exists. If you like a bit of twisted darkness to your fairytales, I suppose it'd actually be a bonus, but even though I don't mind sexual content or dark, twisted storylines, this one left me feeling very discontent.


[b]Translation/Editing:[/b] For the most part, it seemed pretty great. I never read the orginal Japanese version (as I don't know enough Japanese to read the originals yet), but the story was expressed smoothly and didn't differ much from the audio I understood. There were a few typos, but I probably only noticed because I was looking.


[b]Art/Character Design:[/b] For the most part, it was pretty great. The characters were distinct and looked interesting and fairly unique. Nameless NPCs and most of the smaller side characters only got static sprites, so it was a bit disconcerting when they would look joyful while expressing terror or sadness, but it's a very minor gripe. 


[b]The Heroine:[/b] Look, okay... I know that for ~story reasons~ it makes sense she's an idiot, but she was pretty insufferable with her idiocy. There were a lot of times I agreed with Gretel and sort of wished that there were outright Death endings, rather than simply ""more bitter than sweet"" endings. I can't even put her into the category of ""good-hearted idiot"" - because she was often quite callous and insensitive in her stupidity - even to the point of ignoring outright statements of, ""Hey, you're hurting my feelings saying that."" I believe it was Kyrie who said that where she went, chaos followed and it's true. It wasn't even in a ""yes, shake things up!"" sort of chaos, but often seemed to hamper the story more than move things in interesting ways. There was something about her I still ended up liking, but honestly, the love interests deserved better than her.


[b]The Love Interests:[/b] For the most part, all of them were wonderful characters. I may have ended up not appreciating all of them, but I think most people would be happy to interact with all of them. Well, maybe not those from the Brothel - they were interesting, but what wasn't disturbing about the route was upsetting. (Manboy...) My favorites were Pashet (whether you decide there was unvoiced romantic interest or if it was a pure best friend route doesn't matter), Scarlet (he was robbed in his routes, but I liked his personality), Caramia (he surprised me as I expected him to be blandly charming and he was definitely more interesting than I expected), and most of all Kyrie. (It says a lot when the most acidic character in the game is my favorite. I'd have been very upset if Kyrie had been that cruel to a different heroine, but for this particular heroine, it never made me feel uncomfortable. I liked him still even before I entirely understood his motivations.) I agree with those who felt like Robin Hood's routes shouldn't have ended the way they did. I'll warn in advance that they're pretty upsetting, too.


[b]Story:[/b] I want to say it's actually very wonderful and interesting, but I'm not sure I really feel that way. I don't know that it made a lot of sense and I almost regret having played through the ""Epilogue"" and ""Grande Finale"" endings. Especially since the endings actually made parts of the story make less sense, even while supposedly closing the mysteries of the game. There was something that could have been amazing with the story, but I feel like it didn't quite reach its potential. However, since I place characters higher than overall story in otome games, I'm still overall pleased with the game. I will warn that if you try to get all of the endings, you probably will want a walkthrough and a lot of time will be wasted hitting the Skip button while you wait for it to get to the next choice so you can make sure to flip all the correct switches to get a little chunk of new story and the ending. I hear after you play the Grand Finale and have unlocked everything, there are new lines/mini scenes that get added to the game, so when you feel like revisiting the characters/the world, there will be something new for you to experience... 

I also would like to specifically point out the love triangles/break up part of the storyline. I don't know that I've ever played a game with such a feature before and I'm pretty sure I don't want to again. I felt like the transitions between the romances were handled very poorly. [SPOILER - warning in case you want NOTHING spoiled.] It bothered me that her feelings were so weirdly wired. ""I love him, I love him, Oh I guess it's not going to work out, hey second guy? I think I'll love you instead."" And this [i]always[/i] lead to them sleeping together and her going the next morning to tell her first love interest she'd decided to be with guy number two. In that order of events. Then guy number one would always wish her well and then (because of the way the game was set up), it's like it never happened. [/SPOILER OFF] I feel like the only way it worked at all was because the heroine was so dim-witted and her feelings felt extremely shallow, so it made sense on her end. It made me feel utterly rotten, though. Weirdly, the ""transfer"" endings were often the best and most positive, sweet endings available, so they're actually worth getting.


[b]In closing...[/b] I may sound very negative on the game, but I feel like there were a lot of good ideas in it and some real gem characters. I'll probably replay the game just for my favorite characters from time to time, especially Kyrie, whom I'll actively miss. I can't really say that about a lot of games.",1481031948,1481032501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And it's still hard for me to define my attitude. Generally, I dislike this game cause it pretends to be good while actually it's neglectful and shallow. It's my personal impression. And I regret it cause the game has its potential.

So, PROs:
- Interesting setting. Fairy-tale heroes live like mafia families in some city. ALAS. If you like Mario Puzo or Fables, forget about it. Local mafia spends time consuming cakes and organizing festivals. I could accept it, it's an otome game after all, but every good idea can be corrupted by a poor realisation. So, the setting is charming but it's made sloppily.
- Artwork. Everyone knows that Satoi is in charge of game's art. The sprites are really eye-catching, meticulous and beautiful. Even side characters (like Bercy) are drawn carefully. The backgrounds are gorgeous too. Some CGs are an obvious win, some are more inaccurate. 
- Character interaction. I like the way how Oz family guys communicate with each other. They often made me smile. All in all, Oz characters' depiction is successfull. 
- Kyrie. Since I try to write it all fair and deliberate, I shouldn't mention it. But if i'd voiced my extremely personal impression, Kyrie would be the only positive moment of this game. I like this character and I sorta regret that he's stuck in that game's world =)
- Voice acting. Not all dialogues are voiced but still... I can't remember when japanese voice acting was not splendid. This game is no exception. 
- The game is translated into english and is available on Steam. A _very_ important issue for a japanese otome game. 

CONs:
- Poor overall plot. I went through all that endless routes to unlock the grand finale and it was rather disappointing. The individual plots are different. Oz guys have interesting issues with their obtained talents, Robin Hood has an unexpected plot twist, Scarlet's route is rather touching... 
- Many routes. I'd prefer several high-quality routes to 10 so so routes. And the fact that you have to push yourself through 26 endings to get Grand Finale is... It's really rude. Since there are 26 ends the common events appear very dull and repetitive (like every route you have to deal with poor Hamelin). All routes except Oz family are rather short.
- Disguised smut. Many people like it though. Since I'm an adult, I do appreciate a dose of adult content. The only condition for it is to be made with good taste. BUT. Ozmafia doesn't bother itself with good taste and stuffs the game with hints of certain sort. When I see guys joking about Axel's self-satisfaction I feel ashamed for them etc. Not mentioning brothel route here. 
- Publishers' politics. I see how the guys don't let players record and share their walkthroughs. Looks like hysterics. If it'd been some genius hell-of-a-game I could have understood but we talk about Ozmafia... What's the trouble with sharing a walkthrough in the web?
- Characters. Some characters are nice, some are strange and awkward. The protagonist is one of the most dull and useless otome heroines ever. 

Overall opinion. You may like the game especially if it's you first otome game. If you are keen on common sense and depth you may be disappointed.",1480346995,1480346995,False,30,0,0.687723994255065918,6,True,False,False,False,,,

I think the setting and characters were good but the execution was absolutely terrible.  
Let’s start on the fact that the game doesn’t have any kind of affection indicator and the only way you figure out whose route you’re on is based on the eye catches between scenes. 
The eyecatch is basically a black screen with silhouettes showing whose route your own and a small melodic jingle. 
THIS DAMN EYE CATCH SHOWED UP AT LEAST 50 TIMES PER ROUTE MY FIRST RUN OF THIS GAME I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SHOOT MYSELF.
ALSO THERE WAS NO CHOICE TO AVOID NTR asdfghjkl.
The game had very few CGs but at least half of the CGs in each guys route came from only NTR scenes. 
Wow really? Thanks.
Besides that, some scenes were humorous. The CGs are good, beside some inconsistent hands, but I don’t like how most of the CGs only appear close to the end of the route.

While it's true there's a lot to read, a lot of it comes down to characters stammering or babbling in embarassment/confusion, and it skips over such huge chunks of time that it's impossible to really care about characters we only see in silly little skit scenes. The game goes week to week, essentially, but you really only see what the main character does on Sunday (the ""free"" day) apart from a few random scenes, and everyone else just makes comments about time passing. It misses out on a lot of chances to flesh characters and stories out as a result... even following a specific character's route doesn't necessarily mean you wind up knowing or caring about them much more than any other. This is an otome that lacks the depth and writing skill of other games, which means that anyone looking for a really well-written and compelling story may find this one falls flat.

Another issue is the choices given to the player. At times, the way they're phrased doesn't always make it clear as to what, exactly, the heroine is going to say, or how it'll be received. I don't mean that it's difficult to predict what the ""right"" choice is to get a character to like you more, I mean that the wording is often vague enough that what seems like an innocuous comment can actually come out insulting instead, for example. Compound this with how frustratingly stupid the heroine can be at times (not just naieve, but STUPID), and you may find it hard to really get into the story.

Other concerns are minor, but worth mentioning. The dialogue frequently contradicts things that have been said previously (one character tells the heroine he is terrible at firearms, for instance, and then later on reacts with offense at another character ALSO telling the heroine the same thing as if this has never been brought up before), there are comparatively few illustrated scenes beyond the characters simply standing there staring at you, the interface isn't as user-friendly as other visual novels that allow you to scroll back through the dialogue or right-click to open save... all of this makes for a game that takes an interesting premise and muddles it with a mediocre presentation, lackluster writing, and bland interaction.",1476897891,1476897891,False,7,0,0.464493602514266968,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The humor was just priceless, and I liked that the characters interact with each other in a fun way. I had a great time playing the routes, of course there things that I wasn't completely happy about.  The Oz family had a lot of story and the developers spended a lot of time on their routes, but in comparisson the other routes lacked a bit, which was really too bad.   The story of this game was really interessting, fun and heartbreaking at the same time, I still feel sad looking at certain characters. Which is in the end a good thing because that means the story touched me, (Even though I'm really really really sad). I also have to say that the characters are very very likeable, loved their personalities and backstories.  I'm a big fan of Soh with his very bright, happy and caring personality, Kyrie's sadistic, know it all personality had me laughing for forever. And I also got really fond of the Grimm family, Hanzel and Gretel priceless opposite personalities and Scarlet's hardworking and sweet way of life. I'd like to talk for ages about everything I love about these characters but I will stop here.

Like, waaay too many. On and off steam. I just completed a 100% run of this one, and here are a few of my humble impressions:

Without revealing too much, the story is both sweet, bitter, and at times violent. It has a great way of giving those completely innocent moments, but also mature moments, or even moments where the anxiety or tension is kept going for a long time throughout. [spoiler] Think the brothel route, and some of the oz three. [/spoiler]

Overall the music matches and builds the story well, but from so many playthroughs, gets a little repetitive. The CG's are mainly on point, but in some places appeared mis-matched with the story just a bit, a lot of times not syncing quite up with what had been going on previously. It looks like they were made before the store started, and the store written around them. Nothing wrong with that, but hard to string together, and sometimes seemed slightly forced. The backgrounds too had only I would say a moderate amount. Not a few, there was definitely enough variety to give you the feel of a large city with lots of areas. ^_^ The character sprites were varied, and aside from some being a little strange in placement of the screen, they were marvelously executed, really making moments feel like danger. However, given how much combat is in the game, I would have liked to see a combat or action sprite for at least the main three in the Oz family. 

I've read reviews that some of the characters were not fleshed out or described as much as they could have been, and some parts of the story felt empty. I agree with that, but only in so much that those moments appear to be filled in the blue scenes that only appear on a second playthrough of the characters. Having already played multipl routes, re-playing and seeing the same intros over and over again, going back to the begginging on each single route did not appeal to me in the slightest. The his POV in my humble opinion should be a given, as the men are the romance option and should be developed to be pursued, not the other way around. Filler and greater story context also was mainly in these extra scenes, so it would have been nice if they were just included without having to play through again to get them. 

ALso, not to give anything away, but in terms of the Grand Finale, [spoiler] I would like to make note that wishes and love are not a finite thing, and the ending left me with that impression. If the Tin man, or Lion or Scarecrow had really cared about their friend, they would have wished for her happiness first. I think real love only happens when everyone wishes for the hapiness and love of everyone above themselves, not just one overly-giving person. **Steps down from soap-box** [/spoiler] It fits with the 'Love isn't perfect but still good' theme of the game, but doesn't seem like a truly happy ending to me like some of the character routes. 

Having given my critical parts of the game, please allow me to say just a few more works. I am totally BLOWN AWAY by this game. It's not perfect, but it has such depth and bredth in its characters and the world. They all have their own motivations, and the artwork is gorgeous. Not only that, but the story for the main characters allows you to switch characters mid-way and stil get a happy ending?! That's awesome! No romance should feel like you can only ever pick one character. And this game has made some great advances in that regard. The game is also open to so many facets of love and intimacy and sex that I was quite happy to see it! ^_^ My only wishes would be that there were more characters with a wider range of skin tones that were dateable, and [spoiler] that you could fall in love with the female character. (Supporting her too and having a friendship route was also a plus!)[/spoiler]

Overall, would definitely recommend playing this wonderful game! I sincerely appreciate all the time, effort, and the marvelous work put into the branching story. It's simple, sweet, and fun, but still adds a variety of intense, immersive, and sad stories without killing it. [b] If you love games closer to real-life love (you know, the kind with actual heart- and body-conflict) while still wanting the story book happy ending, this game is for you! ^_^ [/b]",1474337895,1474337981,True,3,0,0.552123546600341797,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Неа, не в этом случае. Это же отоме, чего вы хотели? 
Однажды, идешь, никого не трогаешь, а потом «бац!» и все. Амнезия (Чувствуете оригинальность?). Кто ты? Что ты? Куда вообще шла? А это что за мужик, который гонится позади? В такой не приятной ситуации оказывается наша героиня на забытом Богом переулке в неизвестном городе. После чего, немного подумав, выбрала единственное верное решение – бежать со всех ног, вдруг и повезет. И повезло. Натолкнулась на группу, которая быстренько неизвестного отправляют восвояси, а девчушку берут к себе домой, где кормят, одевают и заодно имя дают (Фука или игрок сам выбирает любое имя, но при озвучке это выглядит странно). И… все. 

Наша беспамятная героиня Фука оказывается в безымянном городе у людей называющих себя «семья Оз». По мимо них в городе есть еще несколько группировок, названных в честь различных писателей сказок: семья Андерсон, семья Гримм, улица Оскара Уайлда с борделем. Тогда, почему семья Оз, а не семья Баума? Просто потому что. Наверное, ""Брамафия"" не понравилось как звучало. Герои из этих семей являются своего рода «камео» из известных сказок,[strike] особенно «Портрет Дориана Грея»,[/strike] и практически с каждым имеется свой рут. Персонажи очень разнообразны, а некоторые даже интересные, да к тому же очень здорово нарисованные, так что каждая для себя может найти «любимца» по вкусу. В этом плане проблем в новелле вообще нет – прекрасная рисовка, в приятных пастельных тонах, любопытные герои, очень добротная музыка, но когда приходится говорить о самих рутах… Сюжет. Его вообще нет. По большей части герои страдают повседневной фигней. При этом сам мир и герои так и просят хоть какую-нибудь интригу, заговоры, истории группировок, да хоть что-нибудь! Лучше бы обрезали количество рутов, а их 10 штук с 26 концовками, и развили основную историю. Хоть в новелле и есть True Ending с проблеском сюжета, но его так мало и так надоедливо получать (собрать все концовки), что даже после титров обидно становиться, когда потрачены столько сил (ох, мой лучший друг ctrl). При этом авторы просто уверены, что мне еще раз захочется почитать тот или иной рут, т. к. я не могу объяснить иначе зачем надо было вставлять дополнительные сценки при повторном прохождении? Есть несколько историй, которые мне действительно понравились, которые сильно отличаются от остальных. Но ради этих 3-ух рутов мне жалко отдавать свои 400 руб. Не стоит оно того.

Все-таки, явно не моя новелла. Жаль в Стиме нельзя стаивть нейтральные отзывы. Если коротко: много рутов с очень разнообразными персонажами, хорошая музыка, красивая картинка, озвучка, отсутствие сюжета, немного дорого.

What is the name of this fairytale? OZMAFIA!

I've played lot of Otome before and I am positively happy to write that Poni-pachet did an amazing job to create this visual novel.

[b] Pros: [/b]

1) a lot of choices and interactions!

 You will not find yourself bored for just reading meanwhile you wait rare moment  where you can  finally interact with the story. In Ozmafia, everytime there is a new scene or you meet a boy, you will have to choose an answer.
I think this is a rare quality and I enjoyed it!

2) Love triangle!

In the majority cases in Otome, when you start the game, you have to pick up only one boy until the end.
In Ozmafia you can choose another husbando, if the first didn't convince you.
Unfortunately, this is available only for the Oz family, but I don't complain at all, as I really liked this new fresh air in the Otome world.

3) a lot of routes, CG and different ending!

4) Amazing art and music!

5) Cute and fun moments, but also drama and mature content!

Ozmafia is a great mix of romance, innocent stuff and dark, mature content.
Violence and extreme content (like in the Brothel route) are leaved to the immagination, but still this game gives unexpected materials that I honestly didn't foresee.



[b] Cons: [/b]

1) YU-RIS bug:

It happened twice, meanwhile I was skipping some scenes, that it appeared an icon titled ""Yu-ris debug"" where I had to interrupt the game and I wasn't able to re open the game, before deleting files from the save folder.
If you copy the files, you can paste it later, so you don't have to re start the game from the beginning, but still I have always lost all the CG in the gallery.
Nothing so serious, but as I wanted to finish the game with the gallery complete, I had to replay all the routes.
At some point, I was afraid to use the skip button.

You start as a adorable girl without memories chased by an, of course, handsome man in a town you can't recognize. Luckily, you get saved by the don Caramia and and his right hand Kyrie of the famiglia Oz, which is the first Mafia famiglia of five you get to know and get to stay throughout the story.

Artstyle: 10/10
I've seen many artstyles before even if not in a Visual Novel and this is on of the most stunning and dreamy drawings I have seen! the chracters are to die for ;)

Characters: 9/10
Not only their appearances are drop dead gorgeous but their interactions are so entertaining and witty as well. Tsundere Axel, Best Friend/Big Brother Caramia with a soft heart and witty Kyrie and to only mention the main characters. Each chracter is very unique which makes evry storyline you choose more or less equally as intriguing. I peronally hav to say that I really like Kyrie although not many seem to like his teasing manner. Maybe because I am quite similiar to him in some aspects.
Now to our little Fuka. Many don't seem to favor her character too much but I thought she was really, really entertaining. She is just so abstrusely dense and do to no memory even more helpless which I find absolutley endearing .

Story: 9/10
The special thing about the story is that the climax is not when you finally conquered your love interest but the story after. Every charcter has alternate endings depending what answers you chose and the three main characters have even more endings. I was pretty confused what suddenly happended when I tried to make Kyrie love me when I suddenly landed with Caramia in bed. There is a sign which charcter you have currently in you favor which I didn't pay futher attention. But praise the (very many available) save slots. 
Bit by bit you learn more of the town, its citizens and its past unitil it catches up to the present in the grand finale.
Some recommended not to start with the Wolf Gang characters but to be honest I don't think it matters that much. The stories are independant.

Music: 10/10
Music was very pleasing! I especially love the melody in the backround of the confessions which adds so much atmosphere. I really wish I could somehow get my hands on it.

Specials:
This game has a CG Gallery where you can revisit special moments from each character even with their own commentary which has unfortunately no english subtitle.


The only frustrating thing about this game would be when you can't seem to get all the CG's.
It gets very repetitive collecting everything there is to collect but maybe it's like that in Visual Novels.

The main character is generally irritating since she does not have a single thought in her head. She is a prime example of an useless heroine. Having to struggle through the story with her is definitely a big con.

There's no real flow to the story and everything is very random. There will be a festival or a fight scene playing. When it's about to reach the exciting part of that scene, the game will suddenly skip over it and cut to a new day/scene. There may be a short and poor summary of what happened in a flashback or converstation after. 

If the abrupt scene changes was not enough to make the experience jarring, the voiced lines randomly cut out. Not all lines are voiced so the voiced lines sporadically come in and out. At first I thought I had accidentally muted the voices.

Some of the stand poses with a background are nice enough to be stand alone cgs. I also love the uniqueness of this art style.

Story: 8/10 - A compelling story about an amnesiac (as so many MCs suffer from) finding herself  under the protection of a mafia family after being chased by a guy that is out to kill Fuka. The main story is interesting as well as the character routes. There are quite a few routes (10) and a very interesting brothel (Manboy route) to spice the game up. 

Music: 6/10 – I felt that the menu sound was used too much as it was in the main menu, choice menu and as a bg in the game. The number of bg tracks is pretty low and no bg that I would listen to outside of the game. I feel that they are bland and standard but not terrible. I do like the opening song a lot though and wow English that makes sense (I know, I know this is a Canadian band that wrote it but still good English is exciting)

Characters: 7.5/10- I think out of the main three Axel is adorable cute and Caramia is rather dashing, but I simply cannot stand Kyrie. Anyone who is not willing to compromise on behaviors that the MC doesn't like is simply worthless IMO. Just because I fell in love with you, doesn't mean there aren't things that need to be changed, no one is perfect. I also found the less major guys have nice stories. 

Game Mechanics: 9/10 – I really like the love triangles you can get into and change the character for a different ending. I haven't played another game where this is an option. Sure there are love triangles sometimes but not switching the character's route. I like the replay value of every character has at least 2 endings and when you play through a second time, you get POVs from the guys.

Postive: -I love how Manga Gamer decided to do some of the character titles translations as Italian. For instance Caramia refers to the main character as “ojou-san”  which is translated as signorina (instead of  young lady) which adds more flavor and more of a mafia feel to game.
- I also like when the game progresses after the point of confession and has conflicts related to dating the guys. The climax actually is beyond the “I love you”s and the falling in love is a stepping stone rather than the climax.

Negative: The biggest annoyance with this game is that the narration is in third person instead of first. This feels atmosphere breaking, if I am supposed to be Fuka (or whatever you name her) and be enchanted and romanced by the guys then why switch to third person as refering to someone that isn't me? This is the first otome game I have played that writes the narration in third person, every other single game has had first person (I've played 50+). I felt that the third person narration was so jarring that I closed the game and waited for a couple days until opening it again.

Honestly I've never encountered a otome game with so many choices before (especially the triangle relationship) so it's a nice change of pace for a game of this genre. I absolutely love the character art (one of the main reasons I was attracted) and while not the entire game is voiced I at least like how important conversations are voiced; personally for me when it comes to visual novels I do like to read a lot while the voicing is an added bonus!

(For this review, I use the herione's default name of Fuka)

[b]Negative[/b]

- While the majority of the music was very nice, that jingle during the scene transition quickly got on my nerves. You can turn it off, but doing so means turning off the sound effects which was fine for me in the end, but some people might not want to lose all of them.

- Having more options is usually never a bad thing, but I feel like they wanted so many character routes but didn't have time to really flesh them all out? The Oz boys, of course, have the most in terms of story-content, but on the flip side you have characters like [spoiler]Hamelin[/spoiler] and Caesar, who felt very rushed? The first more so than the second, honestly.

- I'm sure someone out there liked the Brothel and Robin Hood routes, but I honestly could not stand them. The Brothel route, had it just been a developing romance between Fuka and Manboy (or even Alfani) would have been fine, but Dorian just ruined it for me. True, you can choose options that lead to Fuka willingly staying, but the whole route just left me very uncomfortable. Now Robin Hood's route, oh boy, let me tell you I was super frustrated when I realized where it was heading. Which was early on because they did not seed the 'surprise' of this route very well. 

Listen, I'm all for 'person loses someone they love and mourns them but are able to find love again' because it's realistic; there's no rule saying that just because you love one person, you can't love another, but dude Robin Hood just, I mean look, there is mourning the loss of a loved one and then there is Robin Hood's method, which was to [spoiler]keep his wife in a state of being semi-alive in his basement inside of a glass coffin (is she supposed to be Snow White??) so he could try to heal her but having to be careful because if he 'wakes' her up too soon then she'll die[/spoiler]. 

His whole route could have been the hurt/comfort trope and it would have been fine, hell his desire for vengeance could have still factored in, but the way it turned out was just disgusting. In one of his endings, I didn't get the sense that he really loved Fuka—he was just settling for her, since [spoiler]his wife finally died but said it was cool before she did[/spoiler], and in the other, well he doesn't love her at all and so she becomes a nun. And the best part of all this? It doesn't matter which ending you're going for, because he's still going to show up at Fuka's cottage, ask her to tell him if she loves him, then [spoiler]gives her a drug and sleeps with her, leaving marks on her body afterwards[/spoiler].

- I'm pretty sure this feature was used as a way of appealing to a replay, I wasn't fond of how certain scenes could only be accessed during second playthroughs. It's not a huge deal, because I had to go back through some of the routes anyway for CG's but, it leads into my last issue with the game...

- The pacing. The story for this game is interesting, I'm a sucker for fairytale's and reimagining them, but the pacing for this game is so weird. Like I said above, a lot of extra scenes are unlocked only if you replay a route, but that means on your first time through, you're going to be left wondering why a scene ended suddenly and why when the next begins, it seems like a lot of time has passed. Even with the extra scenes, it doesn't help too much in some areas (like fight scenes), and it's sad because I feel like if they had done a better job with that, then this game would have been even better.

- Fuka's amnesia is literally never resolved in any of the routes. It's constantly talked about, but nothing comes of it until the epilogue and grand finale, which while I enjoyed both, are locked behind objectives: to get the epilogue, you must see at least one ending from every route. To get the grand finale, you must see ALL endings for all the routes AND you'll need to watch the epilogue. This was annoying because it meant I had to go through routes I'd rather not have (the Brothel and Robin Hood ones especially), but thankfully the game offers a skip mode. Both the epilogue and grand finale have nothing to do with the romance routes, btw.

[b]Positive[/b]

- The artwork is absolutely gorgeous. It was also nice to have a little avatar of Fuka, showing her expressions during her speech and such. I'm disappointed that she wasn't voiced during the main game, because when you hear her voice in the epilogue and grand finale, it's so adorable.

- Despite the choppy pacing, the story was interesting. It's obviously heavily focused on the story of Dorothy and her time in Oz, but I felt like the spin they put on it was really good. [spoiler]I wish we could have met Dorothy outside of the grand finale, she was adorable and I'm so happy my fear of her being evil didn't come true, I just felt so bad for her not being allowed to live with the others, even though she allowed Fuka to remain[/spoiler].

- Even though some of the routes were disappointing, like the ones I mentioned above, I did enjoy a vast majority of the ones offered and even some of the NPC's. I liked how so many fairytale characters were reimagined and their personalities were very different (Hansel and Gretel were hilarious, btw). The Oz guys were all great, and I had a hard time choosing one I liked more, though I think Kyrie wins for me; I have a thing for characters like his, and after viewing the epilogue and grand finale, it feels like his has the most involvement in the overall story. Caramia was super sweet and Axel was adorable. Scarlet's route would have earned more points if I felt like they took the romance aspect more seriously, and Soh was also a character who took me by surprise! I definitely recommend giving him a shot, because his endings are emotional and he, like Kyrie, has a deeper connection to the overall plot.

- Caesar was also a surprise; he spends most of the game as the 'bad guy' but it's easy to see when he shows up more that he's not nearly as threatening as he makes himself out to be, and his romance was adorable; I have a thing for gruff guys who are secretly soft and affectionate. He has a lot of interactions with Soh, so I liked that as well!

- I had to follow a guide to get the Transfer Endings, which are essentially you start romancing one guy, but wind up with another. These are only available for the Oz guys (Caramia, Kyrie, and Axel). When you're playing and going for one of them, another will usually fall for Fuka and that will result in a love triangle. You can either reject them by going along with the route for the guy you want or, if you pick different answers, you can decide to leave the first guy and choose the second. The reason I list this under a positive is because the game handles this choice relatively well. It's obvious that it hurts the guys, but Fuka also goes through some guilt over it, but when it's all over and the choice is made, all of them act like adults. Plus, some of the transferred endings are actually nicer than the Pure Love endings--Kyrie's transfer ending A was, in my opinion, absolutely adorable and I kind of consider that my 'canon' route. Caramia and Axel's were nice as well, but I have a bias for Kyrie I think.

Overall, the game was worth the price for me and I hope they release the other's over here, because I'd definitely like more Ozmafia!! content to play.",1470934690,1470934690,True,6,0,0.587757647037506104,0,True,False,False,False,,,

An easy recommendation to fans of otome VNs!

Ozmafia is a visual novel with many choices to make and several different endings.  The gameplay consists entirely of reading and making those choices - there are no stats or time management in this one.  The description on the store page is very accurate as far as the story goes, so I will not bother to recap it here.  Suffice it to say, this is an extremely well-done visual novel and worth the full price!  Buying Ozmafia gets you a wealth of content: There are 10 characters with routes, and multiple paths in each one.  Each character has a minimum of 2-3 significantly different endings, with some having as many as 4-6 (can't remember the exact total count).  Unlike in some VNS where the main plot stays the same and your route only affects extra scenes, each of the 10 characters' routes significantly changes the events your character experiences.

The characters themselves are some of my favorite in any otome game, and the different paths allow you to explore different sides and possibilities to the characters.  Each of the ""main"" three characters, especially, are quite deep, and their personalities are very well fleshed-out.  In one of my favorite routes, the player's choices can either temper or feed into the route character's insecurities, and the way he expresses himself changes a lot as a result.  

The art is consistently beautiful (as you can tell from the screenshots), both the regular sprites and the CGs (of which there are plenty).  Even in other visual novels with above-average art, I rarely find myself visiting the CG gallery after completing a character's route; in Ozmafia, however, I was often drawn back to ogle the scenes.  (I would say this game is a tad spicier than the average otome -- nothing goes past PG-13, but that is still a lot more than most otome games, which treat a tap on the shoulder as a super scandalous event.)  Furthermore, the voice-acting is top-notch (which is evident even if you do not speak a word of Japanese), and the voices fit the characters wonderfully.

There's a ton of things I'd like to say about this game, but I'll try to condense it as well as I can without spoilers XD. 

First off, as the opening theme at the top of the page demonstrates, the music is great. The art too, is fantastic. (Fun fact: The artist is the same for Diabolik Lovers, another great Otome from Otomate). The interface is cute, but not overly done. The atmosphere and setting is well-established, and the characters are quite charming. The MC, Fuka, is also cute, but could be rather ignorant and clueless in some (if not most), situations. Although that isn't necessarily her fault.

However, it's also important to note that a couple of routes contain trigger warnings. OZMAFIA!! is a fun game, but some routes and characters are likely to creep you out and dart into rather dark themes. Something to also consider is that the final epilogue of this game is actually only accessible once you complete every route and ending OZMAFIA!! has to offer. So this could be a bit of a turn-off to those that wish to avoid such themes.

Also, be sure to SAVE OFTEN. Replaying routes is necessary to complete the CG gallery and obtain all the endings. So the ability to load save files at the route's turning point is a huge convenience as well as a time saver, (or unless you're like me and insist on seeing the extra scenes that are available upon repeated playthroughs from start to finish... which I still consider an annoyance, as those scenes could've easily been included in the first playthrough, and saving the player many hours of playtime).

OZMAFIA!! is a flawed game, and not a perfect one by any stretch of the means, but it has great art, a cute soundtrack and a plot interesting enough to keep the player engaged. Although the game drags on at some points, OZMAFIA!!'s an experience worth considering for Otome and Visual Novel fans to play from the growing list on the Steam market.

If asked how I'd score it, I'd give a 7.5/10. Has holes, but none so big that it should be avoided from playing firsthand.",1470455127,1470455476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Good voice acting, graphics and story. The localization is pretty good too, which is my pet peeve. The characters are fairly distinctive, so there were some I really didn't like (Kyria) and others I loved (<3 Axel!!). 

It's a little annoying that you have to replay every guy's route to see all the extra scenes, and that means you'll be using the skip function A LOT. But it also means there's more incentive to replay the stories and the game is detailed. Some parts of scenes aren't voiced so it's a little odd when the voices come in and out in scenes, but I'd rather have sporadic voice acting that's high quality like this than none, so I won't complain too loudly.

It's so great to see that the translation and localization went very well.  I dare say even perfect!  They kept the mafia feel with Italian words while also staying true to the original story.  The interface work is even great too, it feels so natural with it all translated.  Same thing for the opening and ending movies.   

The way the characters interact with each other is what I really love, especially with Japanese humor.  I've played Ceaser's route (the wolf) and I was dying with laughter.  I'm a huge comedy fan so when it's matched with romance, I adore it immensely.   

The MC, known as Fuka, can be quite clueless but I find it pretty adorable.  I can see why she would take everything so literal since she lost her memories.   You could compare her with Amnesia: Memories' heroine, but I find that Fuka to be more dimensional but that's because the two games are different, the other having a spirit helping her without others knowing while Fuka already has someone watching over her (in this case, the Oz group).   Fuka can be pretty silly and ignorant to some things (especially with others teasing her), she does pick up on it though later so she's not completely clueless.

The concept, though based on the Wizard of Oz and other fairy tales, was creative and cute. They even added the concept of the mafia into it. It seemed interesting enough so I bought it and played it.

I was disappointed for several reasons. Not to say that this game is bad, it was enjoyable and cute, but it has flaws.

I've only completed one character route, but I don't think I'll play the others. The plot is a bit lacking. I checked other reviews, and there is a plot, but when you're playing the game, it feels like you're just playing through choppy movie cutscenes that start and end abruptly. The beginning of the game was alright, with the music intro and exposition. I thought OZMAFIA!! was a Japanese game translated to English and released on the market, becuase the the artwork is brilliant and beautiful and because of the music opening. The exposition could have been better though. It felt a bit too rushed. What script the game has is well written with few grammatical errors and typos, (though I did find some), but I wish the developers added more. It would help with the plot holes and the ""choppy"" scenes. 

Another reason I was disappointed was the voice acting. When I bought the game, I thought it was fully voiced, but this is not the case. The beginning is voiced but towards the middle and end, the voice acting starts getting choppy because only certain lines are voiced since the developers of the game added more script after the voice acting was done. For $34, I expected full voice acting.

The final reason I was disappointed was the quality/resolution of the game. I played on both Windows and a Macbook with retina display. I expected the quality on retina display to be better. The game, even in full-screen mode, does not fill up the entire screen for either Windows or Mac. There are several inches cut off from the sides and though the art is beautiful, it is pixley. I understand that OZMAFIA!! is the developer's first otome game, but I wish they could make the game at least fill up the whole screen. 

The game has a high replay value since it's an otome game, but the common route would get tiring after a while. The only new parts of ""story"" the game has, after your first playthrough, happen when you choose who you want to spend time with on Sunday. This makes the script even more choppy. 

Overall, I did enjoy the game. I don't regret spending my money, but I wish the game was . . . better. I wish the developers good luck in their future games. This dones't make the game bad, but I didn't really like the personality of the female protagonist, but this is just in my opinion as some people will like her and some will not.",1469646330,1469646374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really love Ozmafia and I'm so glad it got an english release! Thank you, Poni-Pachet, for creating this beautiful game (art, story, characters, and all! Music artists thank you, and voice actors as always, thank you so much! Especially Scarlet's VA - I just love Scarlet so much!! <3), and thank you to MangaGamer who partnered with Poni-Pachet so that the game could be translated and released to eager english otome fans!

I've been dying to play this game ever since I saw its opening on Youtube many years ago (early highschool - I'm in college now, so it was quite a wait and hope!) To finally be able to purchase and play it has been amazing. Honestly I was confused when I got my first ending in the game, but as I played more and progressed more I noticed the extra scenes added to expand the story and got to experience a path differently and understand the characters and story more. It was a lovely mechanic and I really love this game for it. The characters are probably one of the best things about Ozmafia, they're all so unique and their love for Fuka made me so happy each time. Naturally, the romance is super cute and I love it so much. Its probably obvious by now, but Scarlet was my favourite XD Such a wonderful guy!

I must warn that I smiled, laughed, and cried pretty much every playthrough. Especially a certain someone, who I won't name to avoid spoilers, who made me cry and stop playing for a good couple of days LOL. When an otome game is able to get me like that, I know its a really good one and because of that, it will always have a place in my heart. I'm certain that if anyone else who loves otome games plays this then they will also experience a wealth of emotions and find Ozmafia to be a gem. 

With that I must say my thanks once again to Poni-Pachet, MangaGamer, and all those involved in making such a wonderful game! I look forward to future games by Poni-Pachet, so please release them in english! I shall buy each one <3 Also, I'd love the OST of Ozmafia if a digital or disc version is ever sold XD (And more Scarlet because SCARLET <3) Please continue to make amazing love-filled games! <3

The art and character designs are gorgeous, some of the best I have seen and the use of softer colors is highly fitting for it. The story from what I have read so far is actually quite good, even though I chose to focus solely on Caramia for my first playthrough I still found out a good amount about the world and the other members of Famiglia Oz and all of the other characters. For the most part it's pretty easy to choose the right options to get on the route you want to go down, which is a nice change of pace from some of the other VN I have played that make it harder. I was a bit put off from buying the game initially due to the fairly large price tag, but it seems that this game is long enough to more than justify the price tag. 

Pros:
-Gorgeous art
-Just about every character is entertaining
-Interesting plot
-Good setting
-Bishounen
-Good heroine

Cons:
-Putting it in full screen actually make the sprites look somewhat worse.
-Not every line is voiced
-???

Overall I would say that this is a fantastic VN and well worth the time of just about anyone, assuming they are levelheaded enough to not be sickened by trying to romance the men, or the single female romantic option, as a female lead.

[b] Puntos buenos: [/b]

-Cada una de las rutas de los chicos ha sido encantadora a su manera, y aunque muchos de los personajes no eran, por así decirlo, ""mi tipo"", terminé enamorada de todos ellos antes de darme cuenta. Sobre todo, me dio la impresión de conocerlos bien al terminar el juego, gracias a las pequeñas escenas que puedes leer desde su punto de vista al rejugar la historia (por esto recomiendo rejugar las rutas enteras al menos una vez y no desde los puntos de guardado de las guías), y no todos los juegos me han dado esa sensación.

-Todos los finales me han gustado.

-La BSO es agradable; no he sentido la necesidad de silenciarla a las dos horas de juego por resultar cansina (aunque no me hubiera importado escuchar dos o tres tracks más, y tampoco la compraría).

-La protagonista, pese a no ser muy inteligente, me ha caído simpática (si bien en algún final me ha hecho fruncir el ceño, no lo negaré). Creo que, aunque no es el tipo de protagonista fuerte que nos suele gustar a las occidentales (para decir esto me baso en críticas que he leído ya muchas veces), tampoco resulta odiosa en ningún momento: se ve que todo lo hace con sus mejores deseos. No sólo eso, creo que su personalidad va muy bien con la idea con la que se ha creado, es una protagonista que vive con la palabra ""inocente"" escrita en la frente. Para que una chica así no te moleste después de 60 horas de juego, tiene que estar muy bien hecha.

-El dibujo. No voy a mentir: compré este juego porque lo ilustraba Satoi. Y esto es así. Es un dibujo precioso tanto en lo que viene a ser el modo de juego normal como en las CG. Ay, esas ilustraciones, ¡podría mirarlas durante horas!

-Es un juego muy, muy largo, con todo el tiempo que te mantendrá entretenido estás pagando un precio justo si lo compras. no lo dudes.

-No sé mucho japonés y mi lengua materna no es el inglés, pero no he notado ninguna falla garrafal en la prosa/traducción (pero me ha hecho mucha gracia que hayan traducido el inglés de Caramia por italiano... y aún no entiendo de dónde han sacado el alemán que habla Hamelin). Tal vez me hubiera gustado algo un poco más poético, pero lo cierto es que probablemente sea mejor así: cuando se trata de rutas tan largas, a más fácil de leer sean, mejor ¿no?

-Me ha encantado la actuación de los seiyuus.

-La posibilidad de irte con los rivales de tu interés amoroso en las rutas de Oz ¡es genial! Por fin un triángulo amoroso interesante en un otome.

-He leído críticas llamando a la ruta principal del juego ""aburrida"". Está claro que opiniones hay mil, sin embargo ¡a mí me ha parecido muy interesante! No está repleta de acción y drama, sino que muestra el día a día en un lugar de lo más interesante, para mí ha sido un soplo de aire fresco ante los mismos argumentos repetidos constantemente [spoiler] (salvar el mundo, redescubrirlo tras haber vivido uno o varios traumas horribles, todo era un sueño, todo era parte de un conflicto dimensional...) [/spoiler] ¡por no decir que cuenta con [spoiler] dos buenos antagonistas [/spoiler] . ?Qué más se puede pedir?

[b] Puntos menos positivos: [/b]

-La ruta de Pashet me pareció una pérdida de tiempo. No fue odiosa, pero... meh. La jugué con la esperanza de encontrar una ruta yuri y, bueno, no lo era.

-Los finales malos han sido magníficos [spoiler] (tal vez el de Hamelin un poco menos) [/spoiler] , pero ojalá hubiera habido más.

-Algunas rutas terminaban de forma bastante abrupta, ¡menos mal que sus epílogos las han redondeado!

A mi parecer, Ozmafia es una novela visual muy disfrutable y muy recomendable, pero debes comprarla en función de lo que tú busques en una VN, claro.Personalmente, me ha parecido muy completa y entretenida, ¡te animo a comprarla!",1467755593,1467755593,True,30,0,0.801593244075775146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

mafia! what more do i need to say
fairytale references - hahaha, Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray. 

yeah, there are a few cons but could be read in others' reviews though to be honest it didn't bother me as much because really, for what little otome games we could find in english this is super amazing already imho

Pros:
+ The art is SO pretty. CGs are gorgeous, character designs are really nice (Caramia, unf), and even the backgrounds are pretty.
+ Nice soundtrack
+ Japanese voice acting. Although, not all the scenes have voicing, and Fuka is only voiced in the Epilogue/Grand Finale.
+ Plenty of different routes and endings!
+ Interesting Story. Some routes had more interesting stories than others for me, and some routes were a bit more confusing than others. 


Cons:
- The stupid loading eyecatch screens between each short screen along with that repetitive little jingle. Some scenes were really short which led to those screens. There was just too many of them.
- There is no affection meter to monitor your progress
- The game is really repetitive because each route uses the same main storyline. So most of my gameplay after completing one route was in skip mode.
- Fuka is your typical useless airhead otome MC, but she is cute, so she has that going for her.

I just got the game and am loving it so far. 

I have not finished one a playthough yet, but if I had to make a suggestion about it; a much more narrow text background. It is annoying to have that huge text bar across the screen all the time. You miss out on half the art in the background.

1* I've been playing a huge amount of visual novels. Ones made from actual known developers and ones from small time developers. 

2* I've also played a lot of games from PlayStation 1-4.

3* I don't just write reviews for games. In fact, this is the first time I actually decided to write one for a game.

Let me discuss what you'll find in the game..

**Amazing visuals. From the Character design to the background.
**Pleasing Soundtrack.
**It's not fully voiced over but half, if not majority, of the time it is. The japanese voice acting are well done.
**They have many characters. 
**Each character, despite having a lot of them, they have their own individuality. They have rich personalities I must say as well.
**With that said, there are multiple routes to choose from and each has their own respective endings.
**The Heroine has a wonderful character. Even with her memories gone, she does well in the game. Then again, this still probably depends on the player.

What made me write this review is that I fell in love with all the characters. Not just with the Oz, who seem to be the main casts, but also those of other groups. Every conversation makes me laugh and love them even more. There are other visual novel that makes me laugh of course, but this one feels different. 

The story is not exactly 'romance-driven.' There IS the presence of romance in the game. You can't take that away; it is an Otome Visual Novel. But to me, in my eyes, this game shows more of the interaction of the characters to each other.

To those who read this review, hope this helps you to decide whether you'd buy the game or not.

PROS:
-Great music. The opening theme and the closing theme are both really sweet songs that fit the mood. Background music adds to the immersion and isn't annoying or repetitive. 
-10 routes. The three Oz boys have four endings each, and the other seven routes have two endings each, for a total of 26 endings, plus the epilogue and grand finale. 
-The routes aren't all the same cookie cutter plot. I like when the boy falls in love with me, I do. But I also appreciate variation, and OZMAFIA!! doesn't disappoint. Some routes are heavily romantic, some are light flirting, and one is even a friendship route.
-Additional scenes unlocked for subsequent playthroughs. Once you finish one route for a character or group, playing through the route a second time will offer additional scenes. Some are very short, while others are longer. Some offer character insights, while others are just witty bits of dialogue. I thought it was a nice touch.
-The characters all have discernably different personalities, and they grow and deepen as you play. Without giving anything away, I originally hated Kyrie, one of the Oz boys. I thought he was despicable, and I didn’t even want to play his route. However, by the time I’d played through all the endings and additional scenes, I fell in love with him. I think he’s actually my favorite.  
-The love triangle aspects were handled well. I have no other experiences with love triangles in game, but I was deeply appreciative that the characters gave me an out without making me feel (too) guilty. 
-Great, entertaining dialogue. A lot of the best lines came from Kyrie and Gretel, I thought, but some of them were so good that I laughed pretty hard. The wit is evident in the writing, which indicates that the localization team really considered their intended audience during translation. There were a few typos, but nothing really significant. No problems with word choice or sentence structure that I can recall. 
-A really interesting plot. I found it to be a very creative idea, and although I thought some of the explanations got a bit convoluted during the epilogue, overall it’s a very well thought out and implemented design. 
-Fantastic art!! Everything looks amazing, and the CGs are breathtaking. 
-200 save slots. Yes, 200. You have 20 pages with 10 slots each. As a chronic saver, I didn’t have to fret about running out of slots. The other otome game I played only had 24.

CONS:
-The main character bugged me at times with her unbelievable stupidity. I accept that, with no memories, she may not know everything one might expect her to know otherwise, but some of the things that she does and says seriously made me facepalm.
-I found it strange that after dating (or even marrying) some of the characters, the MC still called them “Mr.” For English-speaking audiences, that’s an abnormal convention. 
-In general, the “transfer” endings obtained through switching characters during the love triangle were more mature and interesting than the “pure” endings obtained by sticking with the same character throughout the game. I would think that the more passionate ending should belong with the “pure” routes, but that’s more of a nitpick opinion.

I got hooked, simply caught by surprise and I also caught myself wanting to re-play the damn game. I wasn't pleased with MY first route, I was scared to death by several of the characters who crept under my skin in a rather chilling manner. Awesome touch ( Kyrie and Hamelin ? Yikes man ) on the personalities, though some characters might be somewhat shallow. We run into the stereotypical otome heroine with certain choices that makes you sigh because it's such a...typical ""lost anime girl in a strange world""-cliche. 

The characters grew onto me ( I will admit that it might take some time, but then again ; I am a rookie with otome games ), the soundtrack is calming and casual, but the most oustanding part to me is the character design. There is something smooth about the artstyle that I , personally, like a lot. The colors blend very well and the game overall has a rather appealing color palete to it; of course there are certain backgrounds that could have been adjusted and fixed, but that's details. On the topic of game design, I do miss some more cutscenes, perhaps actual pictures of the quarrels that take place just to add more ""realism"" to it. Some additional facial expressions would have helped as well.

Summed up in two stars ( * ) and a wish ( !? ): 

*-Interesting concept, nice twist to stereotypical fairy tales that we encounter/have encountered in our childhood. I really did enjoy the mafia story that was intertwined with Grimm, Andersen ( I think they spelled it as Anderson in the game, but if they refer to H.C Andersen , the danish author, then we have a small misunderstanding here ) etc. As a general lover of fantasy, and Andersen specifically, I found this quite refreshing! 

**-Well performed design. I really enjoyed the designs that various characters had. There were so many interesting details to the, everything from colors to personality traits. It took some time to recognize specific characters, but they still had a really, really beautiful concept to them. Caramia came with typical ""lion colors"" and his voice suited his face rather well, it actually made him more handsome in my opinion. Then we had Kyrie, damn. His design makes him come off as a mysterious character, especially with his half-secluded face ( reminds me of Xerxes Break from Pandora Hearts, to be honest ). As said, overall beautiful designs, though I don't really see why Scarlet is a male ( Red riding hood, I understand, but that's a chick in canon ). 

!?- Stories can be a bit shallow. I understand that making long and deep stories might be a little hard when it's an otome game, I can assume that it would add additional hours to the game's estimated play time. However, I would still have liked to see some more behind specific characters, perhaps a character menu could have been added, one where you could actually READ about the various characters you encounter ( ex: their likes, personality traits, alligment etc ). It's too much to demand from an otome game, I guess, but it's a neat thought in my head at least.

Still a great experience, made me laugh quite a lot!",1465592469,1465592530,True,1,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That said:

Gameplay 4/10 - Most of the alternate routes are repeats of the main route, minus the love triangle endings, and the paths although basic (2-3 options at best) are meticulous. As in you miss one single choice and you've messed up getting the route you're after. Also the game crashed a total of 6 times, usually directly after the intro video, but one time it was just a grey screen.

This game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, because for the price I expected something more polished. There's no option to re-watch the route's paths after finishing them, There is nothing to do after finishing the game and getting the final endings, and even the final end left me going ""Ugh... How cheap.""

I'll also mention that this game is 100 percent otome. There are a few paths with eroge text, but it's very much softcore, and not too big of a deal unless you're ONLY into romance. The ""dark"" paths in this game are really tame compared to other ones, so it's a good one to start with imo.

Music 6/10 - The music in this game isn't bad, but if you're skipping already seen text, there's overlap issues - and that gets a bit annoying at times.

Voice - 5/10 - Half of the scenes are NOT fully voiced which makes the auto-skip kind of annoying to use since without turning the autoskip to full. Some places were fine, but for the large paragraphs I did have to scroll back. That got annoying. 

* The other issue I had with this was a personal one. Fuka/MC's voice actor was terrible imho. I don't mind voiced MC's, but I literally set her volume down to mute. Luckily you can turn down individual character's voices, because ugh gross.

Characters: 7/10 

I don't want to use spoilers, but I will say that the Oz character ""True"" paths were all irritating to me towards the end of the route. The only thing that made them better was the ""love triangle"" endings although even they were lacklustre in a lot of ways. Also - I did not like playing through any of Pashet's routes. They felt like an after thought, and boring in comparison to the other routes. It really just left me empty.

Most of the characters too - I had difficulty figuring out what character types they were. A lot of them felt extremely basic and one dimensional which made it hard for me to actually care what happened to them/with them. The designs are really nice, but the actual text made the characters seem really boring and it made it hard to figure it out. 

My recommendation: If you're into these games... Get this one only if it's on sale - I personally think $40.00 CAD is way too much for this game, when you can spend a little less on games with WAY better end-game content and a much more stable game system... It's got quite a few flaws to work out with the crashing thing, and It would be better if the Dev's added some extra options. The replayability of this is pretty low.",1465246374,1465246374,True,7,0,0.592481136322021484,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Some Definitive Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Stunning Artwork and a bountiful amount of CGS.[/b] If you're a CG completionist the game makes you want to play every route. 
[*] [b]Lovely cast of VAs.[/b] The game is not fully voiced, but you do have full scenes of voice work vs games where you just get 'hey' 'oh' bits voiced in full sentences. All of the important and heart clenching parts are voiced.
[*] [b]A lot of cusomization options to personalize your reading experience.[/b] You have options such as choosing text speed, a volume master that includes individual character controls, and even being able to disable the Protagonist's character sprite. 
[*] [b]20+ endings as described in the overview.[/b] You have good and what I call 'bittersweet' endings for each route.  If you unlock one ending for each character you get a fully voiced epilogue and if you unlock all endings (including the switch route endings!) you are given a fully voiced grand finale!
[*] [b]The game brings some more adult themes that localized Otome games severely lack.[/b] I have no problem with endearing otome games depicting a pure and innocent love, but the localized Otome industry is severely lacking in adult content. While most games dance around certain topics in the writting and leave you guessing---its really nice to see (at least in some of the routes) a more adult relationship portrayed. And to answer your inevitable question: No, this game does not have H-scenes. At the same time, however, it does not shy away from adult topics and telling you outright that our protagonist has sexual encounters with her lover [spoiler](Or multiple lovers--holy moly I still can't believe the brothel route is a thing that actually happened)[/spoiler]. I do consider this a step in the right direction to show the industry that girls DO want 18+ otome games localized. 
[/list]

 [h1]Pro/Cons Depending on your Perspective[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Constant Loading screens[/b] can get a little annoying on your first playthrough but they become [i]EXTREMELY[/i] handy when speeding through your second run and onwards.  After completing a route for the first time you will unlock bonus mini-scenes that add to the character/story.  You'll notice a mini-scene via the blue silhouettes vs the usual orange.
[*] [b] The Oz Love Triangles.[/b] The writting gets a little hasty and is not paced very well in my opinion. It just adds a little quick drama to a story that was already progressing just fine. When you do switch the writing is short and doesn't really give you much time to attach to the new love interest before reaching of the two endings. Its not all bad, however. The game provides different pre-triangle stories per route per intended rival (i.e. Your beginning to date Kyrie scenarios are different depending on if Axel or Caramia is your 2nd runner in affection). ALSO If you do switch you get a bit more information on the boys that isn't present in their main routes as well as some CGs. 
[*] The game is written in 3rd person vs the usual 1st person for visual novels. I know a lot of readers prefer a more immersed experience and this can disrupt that. 
[/list]

[h1]The Bad:[/h1]
[list]
[*]The story gets a little confusing at times and it leaves you questioning a few things even after the Grand Finale. [spoiler]What happens to Ceaser and Hamelin? Is Fuka/Protagonist considered ruling class?[/spoiler]

	Японская отоме с иллюстрациями самой Satoi, создательницы образов ""Дьявольских Возлюбленных"" - это просто праздник для моих глаз и души.

В виду отсутствия английской версии последних, я жаждала наброситься на Озмафию уже за два месяца до ее выхода.


	Итак, что же мы имеем - главная героиня с полной амнезией (моя любимая тема) приходит в сознание на улицах незнакомого города. И в первые же минуты бодрствования она оказывается мишенью кровожадного отступника, не признающего законы мафии, которая управляет городом.

	К счастью, быстрые ноги спасают героиню и очень скоро она оказывается под надежным крылом семьи мафиози - Оз.

	Но семья Оз не единолично управляет городом - город более-менее четко поделен между семьями Оз, Гримм, Андерсен, Уайльд, Адельхейд и семейством Кота в Сапогах. К этому моменту, думаю, вы уже примерно понимаете, персонажи каких сказок являются главными героями этой волшeбной новеллы.

	Несмотря на наличие границ, ни о каком мире между семьями и речи быть не может. Постоянно та или иная семья развязывает кровавый конфликт с целью расширения своих владений.
	

	Во многих отоме главная героиня у меня часто вызывает раздражение или отсутствие каких-либо эмоций.

 	Но в Озмафии наша подопечная - просто прелесть. Она настоящая красавица. Она бесконечно милая, отзывчивая, до кретинизма честная и из-за амнезии весьма наивная, чем постоянно ввергает окружающих в шок своими словами и поступками. Однако, в определенный момент, в отношениях она способна вести себя весьма по-взрослому.

	Героиня здесь так же выгодно отличается отсутствием обилия внутренних диалогов и многократного пережевывания событий, так часто сдабриваемого в отоме толикой соплей. 

Из-за отсутствия воспоминаний героине все в новинку. Наша подопечная во всем видит хорошую сторону и заражает оптимизмом окружающих.


	Пристально наблюдать за похождениями протагонистки будут аж 11 потенциальных кавалеров и одна неко. 

	В Озмафии, как мне кажется, любая найдет себе возлюбленного по вкусу. Юноши все очень разные как внешне, так и по характерам - есть и милые, и вредные, и темные лошадки и с совсем поехавшей крышей. А для любителей жести (я! я! мне!) есть изысканное извращение в виде бордельного рута. 

	Сейю так же на высоте. Где-то в районе облаков, если конкретнее. Оригинальная японская озвучка ласкает слух, а некоторые юноши своими голосами способны вызвать дрожь в коленях.

	Впервые, сколько играю, встречаю настолько ярко выраженный и проработанный любовный треугольник. Ни один рут мафии Оз без него не обходится.

	В целом, обилие рутов просто будоражит воображение. Детали из одного рута дополняют другие истории, а когда вы будете близки к полному завершению игры, перед вами откроется Grand Finale... 

	Дабы об игре не сложилось мрачного впечатления, хочу сказать, что несмотря на мафиозный сеттинг, Озмафия очень веселая. Если честно, я не помню чтобы я столько смеялась читая новеллы, рот постоянно непроизвольно расплывался в широкой улыбке. 


	Рисовка, как упоминалось выше, это то, чем меня изначально привлекла игра. И мои ожидания полностью оправдались. А в глазах некоторых персонажей я несколько раз потерялась и утонула. 

CG в игре более 80. Нет, вы только задумайтесь сколько это роскошных картинок!


	Обычно я не упоминаю о музыкальном сопровождении в отоме, так как, зачастую, оно откровенно слабенькое. Но в Озмафии оно настолько проработано и столь плавно дополняет события, происходящие на экране, что я порой просто сворачивала окошко с игрой, дабы насладиться музыкой подольше.

	Озмафия - сказка для взрослых. Она милая и жестокая, веселая и трогательная до слез, романтичная и страстная до боли. Здесь давно знакомые бессмертные герои классических сказок взяли в руки огнестрельное оружие и, используя классическую иерархию мафии, встали во главе города. И каждый из них, явно или в тайне, хочет чтобы его полюбили таким, какой он есть на самом деле.

	Озмафия стремительно покорила меня и оставила клеймо ""W"" и ""I"" в моем сердце, а так же нежный призрачный след от прикосновений одноглазого безумца.  Я очень полюбила эту новеллу.

Рекомендую это сокровище всем девушкам.

This is NOT a mobile port, so it is actually high quality and the art is beautiful and it never has ""derpy"" looking CGs, only beautiful CGs. The music is very nice, and really adds to the emotions that you will feel while reading, and I think they did great timing it to the situations.

You can choose volume options for voices, so if you are like me and HATE high-pitched squealy falsetto anime girl voices, you can disable your own voice and the loli girl's voice. 

If you plan to watch the anime, another one of my reasons you should get this game first, is because like almost any otome anime-adaptations, the anime will most definitely feature her super high-pitched voice and her acting like a stupid doormat (you can make smarter choices in the game), and probably will skim through some routes without the deep emotional involvement, and for sure you will not enjoy the anime as much as the game.

My only complaint with the game is that Caeser's route is short and kind of linear compared to the main 3 guys, but somehow, I liked it a LOT better.
I've only played Caeser's and Axel's route so far, but I much preferred Caeser's. 
Axel's route started cute, but became more and more anticlimactic as it ended... It's just my own opinion though.

I highly recommend Caeser if you like beautiful Kuudere-type guys(characters that start off cold/anti-social but warm up to you gradually). He also has a beautiful uniform in one ending (my favorite ending so far). His route overall had a little bit of a ""Beauty and the Beast"" feel to it, it was sweet.

On the other hand, if you do like the main 3 guys, you will have a great time because their routes are really long and have many alternative paths.

If you play any route a second time after finishing, you also can see the guy's perspective kind of like a behind the scenes thing.

Overall, if you like fantasy-themes and Otome visual novels, definitely consider this.",1463469255,1463469255,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Voice acting wise, do note that this is partially voiced. You'll manage to hear the heroine voice at the very end of the game.

Still, no regrets buying it. Now, firstly, some personal criticisms, then some good :3

To put some relevance and potentially be helpful as a comparison, some of my favorite otomes/VNs are The Second Reproduction, Nameless, Dandelion and Cupid and I don't think OZMAFIA!! surpassed any of those frankly (and two of those games are basically free). I like story-rich plots and hate games with tons of unanswered questions and plotholes, and found too many of the latter even after finishing every. single. route. of this game.

Now some things I enjoyed about OZMAFIA!! (I seriously can't help exclaiming the title every time I read and/or type it out ~0~;;). 
- The sprites are absolutely GORGEOUS. Some of the prettiest sprites I've seen even though the guys remind you of Diabolik Lovers but less...sadistically crazy lol so definite plus in my book
- The voice acting was also done well, especially those by Pashet, the 3 OZ boys, Hamelin, and Scarlet, just a shame it's only partially voiced but I went into the game knowing that so didn't mind the missing portions as much as others. 
- TONS of routes, and not all of them are romantic per se...I'd advise following a walkthrough if you're a completionist like me
- MC isn't a doormat and she's actually pretty hilarious at times with a lot of spunk and appropriately cued stubbornness. She is also adorably optimistic, albeit somtimes naively so, but I actually didn't mind her naivité as much as I would in other games because her sanguine disposition was pleasantly infectious. I also liked the fact that she's somewhat AWARE of her present uselessness and tries making up for it somehow, unlike a lot of other amnesiac characters.

TL;DR: I'm guilty for over-thinking a lot of details in games, books, shows, life in general (lulz sigh), so I tend to nitpik when something just has too many unanswered details/plot-hole inconsistencies, which is why I felt a tad unsatisfied at the end with this game. But, if you go into this game not expecting much depth but a pretty decent way to pass time by looking at pretty sprites/cgs and listening to decent VAs, this game is worth playing. Regardless of it all, if you like otomes half as much as I do, I definitely recommend buying this game at some point (especially when it's on sale) to support the release of future otomes :)",1463344424,1463344424,True,6,0,0.590570747852325439,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The visuals were stunning, the concept was interesting and the reviews were overall pretty decent. 

Unfortunately the game itself was not what I had been anticipating and certainly was not worth the 35 bucks I invested.

The good: The character designs are pretty, you are provided with a lot of different route options, and the game definitely makes you work to get more of the story. Ozmafia is heavily romance-driven as opposed to plot-driven so if that's your preference I'd say it also can count as a positive feature. Oh and....the soundtrack is pretty nice.

The bad: LOADING SCREENS. ALL. THE. TIME. No seriously..... there were times where I read about 10 lines of dialogue and I hit a loading screen. All of that waiting gets extremely frustrating......especially when the plot gets extremely dry. Speaking of the plot........if I had to sum it up....I'd say the plot is basically a glorified slice of life anime with fairy tale references and the occasional fight scene. So for those of you (like me) who were expecting something with a little more depth and creativity...this is not the game for you. Unfortunately the characters are also severely lacking in notable development which makes them a lot more two dimensional. In particular, the main character is extremely undeveloped and almost entirely unrelateable. To top it off...... the game is also NOT fully voiced.

All in all I'd recommend this title to otome gamers with a thirst for some mindless romance and pretty visuals. I'd also recommend those who are interested in this title to purchase it after it lowers in price. However, if you are looking for a compelling visual novel that has it all....Ozmafia is not the title for you.

They will remember you from Diabolik lovers, Shinigami Kareshi series. I am glad to see this one finally translated. Of course, like any other game, it has good and bad points.

Pros:
-The story.
-The characters, you will love them, they are well drawn and their personality is adorable, all of them, even the nasty ones.
-The MC isn't completely dumb.
-The character's voices, the sounds and the music. (Love it.)
-The quantity of choices. Maybe is just me, but as more choices and variety I have, the best.

Cons:
-Seeing the loading screen every five minutes bored me, a lot.
-No love meter or anything to know how you are doing in the route with the boy.
-Unless you use a guide or write down the endings that you finish, there isn't a way to track them.
-Mc sometimes is too naive (can I hit her?), made me mock at her sometimes.
-There are times where the characters have no voice.

In regards to the negative feedback, imo, the loading screens (while frequent towards the end of routes) aren't terrible, most often they serve as story cuts or a scene change which i can forgive ...tho when you go back and skip dialouge you can skip right over these loading screens which makes me wonder why they need to take so long in the first place.

First of all, a friendly ""screw you"" to all of the spoilers in the reviews. No matter how small they were, they dulled my experience in what should have been powerful scenes quite a bit. I'll do my very best to sell this game while spoiling nothing.

There are so many routes to choose from, and unlike some games, this one isn't overly ambiguous about which route you're being locked on to. It has a very user-friendly interface that allows you to select a character to spend time with. Which means, if you hang out with someone and change your mind, you still have time to find someone else to cling to! I've finished 4 playthroughs and completed 30-something percent of the gallery. There's a really cool system (which, admittedly, pads out the length a little) grants characters additional scenes on your second playthrough with them. It also seperates these scenes with unique loading screens so you know when you can safely stop skipping. Each route has multiple endings and there are way more routes with specific entry requirements. I accidentally landed on one of these, and it was absoloutely fantastic.

So with that in mind, I've received about 9 endings so far, and have only actively hung out with 4 characters. And with each new route, I've learned so much more about everything and everyone and it's only deepened my curiosity about the universe and the charachers.

The art style is vaguely reminiscent of Valkyria Chronicles, in the sense that it's like that of a storybook. The colours are somewhat watery and there are sometimes little blotches of colour on the screen. It might sound a little distracting but in actual fact, it's a fantastically subtle touch and it only emphasises the already impressive visuals. Every character is beautifully designed, with unique qualities matching their personalities. The backgrounds are pleasing to look out with enough detail to tell you where conversations are taking place, but not enough to be distracting, which is a nice balance.

The soundtrack, though simplistic and somewhat limited, is still very good. It's not ""run off and buy"" good, but it compliments the game wonderfully and I think it more than lives up to everything else that the game does so well.

I can't recommend this enough. It's a great Otome for anyone, whether you're a veteran or new to the genre, and I really wanted to get a review out there with no spoilers. Hopefully there aren't any big spoilers. I'm still mad that some routes were spoiled for me :c",1462468483,1462468483,True,17,1,0.655824661254882813,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The beginning music is super addictive, I've had it stuck in my head forever, I kept singing the same tune over and over again.

I have two issues with the game: one, the art can be a little bit weird. Axel's arm and shoulders are weirdly drawn, look at it. You'll know what I mean. Secondly, the loading screens are so frequent, the worse I've had it was for Axel's route, he said one sentence, then the dorothy and three companions pops up, with a short version of the theme song. This happens too much, it should've been utilized sparsely and between appropriate breaks in the story.

I should hope that Poni-Pachet SY understands how annoying and time consuming it could be.

However, I would like to notice that the character's voices are only there 70% of the time (as the developer said in the discussion), so there would be awkward moments of silent. It's nice that the background music are there, but still, for the price I paid, I kind of expecting much better voicing for the characters.

The first route I'm taking is Axel's route, and I haven't finished yet. I will update my review later on for other routes. However, my first choice might be in the 30% that wasn't voiced, since there were a lot of time where there is just silent and background music going on (sorry to keep nagging, but yeah, I'm disappointed abt this).

On the other hand, the plot for Axel's route (or at least I thought I'm in Axel's route) is well written, there are interesting moments and enough cuteness that keep me move forwards. The plot was a bit confusing at first, then gradually gets better (spoiler alert: probably because I chose him everytime, so there a disconnection where I was with him then with another character a moment later on, without any leading line or connection(?)).

Just finished all endings of Axel's route. The plot gradually gets better as you advanced further into the story. There was drama and twist along, therefore, the game becomes more attractive. Definitely compensate for the lack of voicing.

You play as Fuka, a girl who finds herself in an unfamiliar world without any memories of where she is or who she is. After being chased by a man with white hair, you end up running into two men who introduce themselves as Caramia and Kyrie of the Oz familia.

Firstly, the original reason of picking this game up was the fact that one of my favourite artists made the art. I didn't know much about the game, except that it was vaguely based around the familiar fairytale; The Wizard of Oz and a few other fairytales. I like fairytales, or well, I love them. So that was another reason to why I ended up buying it the moment it came out, I didn't really know anything about the game, so it was a huge gamble.

But I'm really happy that I did, because I spent multiple days playing through all the different routes that the game has to offer. I kept talking about how wonderful the game was, and how wonderful each individual character was. And I still don't regret spending the money I did on it, since it's one of my favourite visual novels by now.

There's plenty of violence and blood all throughout, and while it's mostly written and not really gory there are some bloody sprites, and CGs that might make people uncomfortable. The True Ending is also exceptionally violent, even considering the rest of the game.

There are also two drugging scenes, and another scene that was likely the result of a drugging. There's implied rape, prostitution, and one of the routes made me seriously uncomfortable. But that's only in two routes out of about ten, both of which are easy to avoid. You're warned away repeatedly in one, and here's a tip to avoid the other without spoiling too much: leave the married guy alone.

But with ten routes (thirteen if you count the secondary routes for the three Ozes) there's bound to be something you'll enjoy. There're a couple star-crossed loves, an adorable friendship, and an entertainingly sarcastic jerk. Or the brothel, if you're into that; just because I disliked it doesn't mean that you will.

""Я бы его заромансила"" (с)
На самом деле, изначально, я как-то не собиралась приобретать эту отомэ. Но после прочтения всех отзывов (которые в основном положительные) что-то щелкунуло и ""бац!"", я уже на третьем роуте.
У данной игрушки несомненно больше плюсов (которые по сути затмевают минусы), о чем уже говорилось в других отзывах:
1. Неплохой саунд. И плюс, не только приятный, но и не надоедливый (как порой бывает, что хочется его просто выключить). И осты тоже вполне себе хорошие, что открывающая композиция даже пополнила плей-лист.
2. Приятная глазу рисовка. Как персонажей, так и окружения.
3. Огромное количество роутов. Честно, одной из причин, почему изначально я не хотела брать эту отомэ, это мысль о том, что понравившиеся персы могут оказаться второстепенными и без возможности заромансить. А в итоге все вышло так, как вышло :D Выбор на любой вкус. Прямо любо дорого.
4. Сама продолжительность роутов довольно таки большая, что, для меня лично, является большим плюсом. И персонажа понять успеваешь и влюбляешься в него вместе с протагонисткой.
5. Хороший интерфейс. В том числе простое переключение между сохранить/загрузить.
6. Куча настроек. Вам не нравится выскакивающее личико протагонистки сбоку? Можно убрать в настройках. Не нравится чей-то голос? Можно отключить в настройках. 
Настройки голосов даже не просто на уровне ""вкл/выкл"", а с регулятором громкости для каждого (!) персонажа.
7. И последний по счету, но не по значению пункт. Сейю. Да, вот уж что приятно, так это голоса персонажей (мужских особенно). 
А теперь о минусах:
1. Непонятный баг с озвучкой героини (она как бы есть, но ее как бы нет). Может, оно  к лучшему.
2. Персонажи озвучены процентов на 75, остальное время они ""говорят"" без озвучки.

At the time of this review, I've completed one route, which took 5.5 hours.  I loved this game!  As another reviewer has said before me, this was really the full otome experience, harkening back to games like Amnesia and Hakuoki, Dandelion and Nameless.  After playing mobile otome games for the past few months since I don't have a PSP, this was a more than welcomed change, the depth and length (bow-chicka-bow-wow?) of the storyline dwarfing the typical mobile experience, leaving me more than satisfied with the time spent.

Right off the bat, the artwork really stands out.  The light watercolor-esque designs of the characters, settings, and CGs lend a luminosity to the experience despite the darkness of the storyline in places.  The music is inobtrusive and atmospheric, and the characters are well-developed, nuanced, and dynamic.  The inter-character relationships are well-developed from the start too, and the dialogue is realistic, really well-translated, and quite funny!

The MC, Fuka (renamable), is pretty vapid, though her cheerful air-headedness certainly makes for some pretty funny situations, especially when placed against Caesar or sharp-witted Kyrie.  Her complacency bothered me a little, as I'd have thought someone who lost all of her memories and woke up in a strange place where no one knows her would kind of want to work on figuring stuff out, but she's just as content to let the Oz family take care of her like a pampered housepet, which more than one character points out to her.

I enjoyed the adaptations of the Oz ""Main Three"" for this game: The Cowardly Lion has earned his courage, yet lacks brains; The Scarecrow has a razor-sharp wit, yet in all other ways lacks a heart; The Tinman has a heart, but lacks courage and is very shy in the face of love.  It's little tweaks like this that really made this game unique and its characters quite endearing to me.

Relationships are built slowly and, for the most part, blindly (there are no heart gauges or affection menus), letting you get to know the characters like you're peeling the layers off of an onion (or a cake, or a parfait!), until you reach their rich, nougaty center.  (Why does this onion have a nougat center?  What has happened here?)

Sunday is the only day of the week that the mafia famiglie agree on a strictly imposed peace (violations punishable by death in some cases), and allow you to visit with a character of your choice in order to build your relationship.  I started off picking Caesar whenever possible, apparently because I have a predilection for things like Hybristophilia and Stockholm Syndrome.  JKlulz ~ I just really really love tsundere characters, and what can be more tsun tsun than a guy who's literally trying to kill you, amirite?  (sigh)  Courting the literal Big Bad Wolf on the Sunday Compromise starts out as an exercise in futility.  Over the weeks that you visit him every Sunday, there certainly were moments that I doubted that the appeals to Caesar's humanity would prove fruitful, as they must, considering he's like a viable romanceable character, but I was rewarded in the end for my foolhardy persistence.  That being said, I could totally see how a bad ending would be possible if you weren't thorough enough with your good choices.  My advice, as always, is to quick save at the choice and wait for the affirming ""ding"".  Without playing the other routes, I just felt like you walk a very, very fine line between love and impending doom in this route, Caesar sometimes playing the caged animal peering out from between the bars all too well.  On the other hand, once you've won him over completely, he's fiercely loyal and unarmingly sweet, though still a blustering, self-important tsundere character, no matter what anyone says, huffing and puffing like the Big Bad Wolf should.

.. and refunded it about 2 hours later. I want to like it, I honestly do. But there is just so much about that either doesn't sit well for me or I just simply hate and with a price tag of over $30 I just can't justify buying a game I'm not in love with.

Some problems I had included very minor things like spelling mistakes, the default name being said which was rather jarring, the third person perspective was okay at first but I felt so disconnected from the Protagonist that I couldn't get as interested in the story as I'd liked, and around the 2 hour mark my game wouldn't stop lagging, which really surprised me.

But the most jarring thing? The actual romance. After refunding the game I looked up a quick summary/review to see what I was going to be missing out on and holy-! The amount of NTR in this game is awful, and some of it is impossible to avoid, which really didn't sit well with me.

If that last statement sounded confusing to you, it basically means that you can choose to cheat on your main route and go towards an alternate route with the guy you cheated with. Woah!


Some Pros:
- Beautifully drawn
- Likeable and attractive characters
- MANY options and routes; it's fun going back to see what choices lead to which story
- If you get one ending, you can go back and see small side stories to what the guy was thinking during each event
- Good theme song
- Not an innocent lovey dovey romance; can get ""steamy"" at times
- Love triangles
- Heroine is pretty; you can name her

Some Cons:
- The story leading up to one guy can be draggy and long
- The loading screen can get annoying.
- Wish there was a more variety in music, but nbd
- Heroine's facial expressions don't really match the mood/tone of the text at times
- You might dislike it if you absolutely hate adultery in otome games (cheating is possible)

All in all, I really like this game so far, and it was totally worth the sale price.

Oz family made up of the characters of Wizard of Oz, and indirectly stated through out the game. Grimm family made up of Hansel, Gretel, and Scarlet (which I so far think is like the boy version of Little Red Riding Hood). Which leads me to believe that every character is based off a Fairy Tale character, so I've set out on a mission to see who is who (cause they change so of the names, which is seen through the Oz family). Also, there seems to be a narrator here and there to imply time passing and so on, surprisingly it is not annoying at all either, it actually boosts its Fairy Tale theme and feeling! 

About the game, there are some translations which throw me off by how odd they are, for example they use signorina for ojou-sama/ojou-san which is kinda weird o.o I have to say the story is good and the translation still gives a good vive to the game (I mean it's a good translation, just odd at times). It's also kinda sending you in blind not telling you how far you are with one characters and the others (you know, like a love bar). It's ok not having one, it's just nice to see one, you know?

I dont know what the character was talking about and what happen there. 
I accindently clicked past the ending credits.

For I didnt got to have any sort of romance with any other character beside Mister hammel??

I just happen to be curious about a man laying in the same place

And then later my character helps him. And then they get into romance after that??

Shouldnt I have any more chances to meet them again?? 
After a while in game I couldnt come back to the menu where you 
could click to some of the character you wanted to meet.

And the Cesar guy what was his problem chasing the main character all the time. 
His action was like I am the bad guy that just happen to arrive to be the bad guy in that moment something needed to happen. Like for a dumb example. 
Everyone has tea party and if it's get too boring just make Cesar appear so he can ruin the party and make the boring day interesting. *small laugh* I kinda feel bad for the poor guy.
Maybe he was not a bad guy at all. That the game just make him it randomly.

If it ended like that, then I would had been very upset for play something that I just started to get the hang of it and all of the sudden my favorite character dies. Instead, the story continues and now that character is finally starting to warm up to me~ :)

I enjoy being immersed into the mafia town setting with its fairy tale characters. All the characters have different personalities which makes the story fun, interesting, and amusing. Like how I wouldn’t personally want to mess with a person like Heidi but hearing Heidi’s dialogue is hilarious! Even minor characters get character portraits which means the creator puts in lots of thought into the details of their game.

I have very few complaints but none that would prevent me from buying the game. Considering the high quality art, beautiful music, huge range of characters that get voiced, and long routes (a route is about 3 hours for most visual novels I’ve played so far and [strike]like I said before I’m at the 3 hour mark and haven’t even finished Axel route yet[/strike] [i]finally finished first playthrough which took me 9 hours[/i]) I say the price is fair. It’s a visual novel that otome fans would enjoy.

Pros
+a range of different character personalities
+characters partially voiced ([strike]Even though I’m not fluent in Japanese, I didn’t noticed it. Except for[/strike] the part where you first meet Soh and a chunk of dialogue has no voice but afterwards you’ll hear his voice again. Well, any voicing is a plus for me since it gives the characters more personality) [i]I noticed this happening more after I played 3 hours so it's not a bug that some dialogue are not vocied.[/i]
+appealing artwork
+lovely music
+you aren’t forced to choose a guy to start with/stick to their route until the end and you choose who you want to spend time with on “Sundays”

Cons
-fullscreen = lower quality (but I don’t mind playing in windowed mode)
-some voices are low even at max (I tried lowering the background music but then I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the music and at the same time I want to hear them both so I just beared with everything at default settings)

Because there's so many, I think it was a good choice that there is no ""super heartbreaking"" bad ending. It ends on a bittersweet note but still I would say it is a favorable outcome. This is really good for those really worried about bad endings (like me).

It's also a game I could recommend to people who are new to otome games. Oh, also, this game is only partially voiced so not every single line has the characters talking. From experience, I think it is 60%-70% voiced? The UI is simple, but still pretty enough and very easy to use. I think it was translated pretty well and from what I remember, not much (or was there any at all? if there were, it is rare) typographical errors.

Usually, I don't care for love triangles but that one got me good. 
I actually wept. T-T 

Overall I have very few complaints. In any other VN, I probably would have considered this main character to be too dumb but I liked this game so much as a whole that it really didn't bother me. After a while, it was actually endearing when taken in context with her condition (as cliche as it is). The other characters even comment on her naivete like ""wow, how do you not know this stuff? It's pretty basic"" which I think helped sell the MC to me. There were times I wished she had more speaking parts that weren't one word answers or her repeating what someone said, but again, all the good bits of the game allowed me to overlook its flaws. 

I really enjoyed the music. Every track feels like it fits the scene and they are all fantastic.

Absolutely loved the charater designs, voice acting, artwork and overall the plot was really enjoyable.

Anyway, my head is still swimming and I'm having trouble finding more words to explain why I adore this game.

Pros:
Georgeous artwork
Lovely soundtrack
Voice acting
Clever modernizations of classic characters

For what I have played I can easily say that it's money well spent. When I first spied this game in the upcoming games list I knew that I had to have it and I knew that I was willing to pay up to $40 for it. It looks like a high end title to me, it doesn't look like a VN that's going to take me 2-3 hours per route to complete and I'm so happy that I'm right. 

It takes me back to the good otome games, the ones that are released for the Vita and the 3DS. The otome games like Amnesia, Code Realize, Norn9, and Hakuoki. I was instantly taken back to the building up feeling, the thought that I actually have to work for the guy's affection. I actually have to take the dang time to get to know the men of the game and it feels great to be playing such a title once again. I want more titles like this to come to America.

A lot of people fret over grammar issues in VN's that are released on steam, I don't blame you. They suck, they just do. Ozmafia laughs at them, they say ""We have a beautiful art style and excellent grammar, we make portraits for unimportant characters."" This game is so detailed that shopkeepers that we don't see at all really, have portraits drawn up for them to give us more of a visual aspect to it. I was super impressed, the music is pleasant as well.

My main complaint is small I must admit, the female (Fuka) isn't voiced. All of the male characters are voiced, including unimportant characters, and even all of the female characters are voiced, except for Fuka. She's not and she's the main character, so this sadens me.

This is a minor complaint and it doesn't take away much if anything from the game for me. The CG's are obviously gorgeous and given out like candy, the backgrounds can be a little lackluster but the character modules are to die for. I remember a moment when Kyrie didn't have his hat on and then he picked it up and put it on, the module instantly changed to one with his hat on, simple details that made me smile. 

The characters themselves seem very interesting. It's your typical ""Who do you want to see today?"" kind of game that doesn't feed you the right answer to the choices. I love that. Each character is unique and takes on a classic fairy tale like character ranging from Puss in Boots to Hansel and Gretal.

The options menu has plenty of changeable things (i.e, background music, effects, and voices), including, surprisingly, individual voice controls, which I didn't expect, and the ability to re-size the window box entirely or have a full-screen (which has a minor impact on quality, so I prefer windowed). It also has detailed backgrounds, interesting and unique characters, and superb voice acting. 

Also, thus far, I haven't seen any major bugs or translation issues; [strike]though there are a few instances where the dialogue will refer to the default Heroine name rather than the name you chose--but that's rather minor, IMO.[/strike]

Overall--if you're a fan of a) otome Visual Novels, b) stories or games based on or around fairy-tales, and c) a thoroughly enjoyable experience, I wholly recommend OZMAFIA!!.

[b]UPDATE[/b](April 30th): Also, for a perspective on length, my first route took me almost 7 hours. Needless to say, it was a blast.

[b]UPDATE[/b](May 1st): It seems that the mistake of the game showing the default Heroine name rather than your own has been fixed. It never really bothered me much, but I'm happy that they care about their costumer's enjoyment so much.",1461975666,1462126742,True,50,2,0.776587605476379395,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros 
- amazing art style
- japanese voices for basically every character but your own
- 10 routes. There are a lot of people to choose between and you can have routes with girls or multiple people. Sadly, there are some routes with basically no romance. (ie, the one guy who is so friendzoned that the protagonist Fuka thinks he's a girl at first)
- you can disable your portrait if you want to be more immersed
- there's a tonne of options in settings. Plenty of save slots, audio options for literally every character bar a few, an option to full screen and windowed mode. Also, lovely options for skipping
- tonnes of options. I'm 20 minutes in and I've already been given 5 options. 
- super sexy and unique characters
- a metric tonne of endings. There are bad endings and even an ending where you choose to dump a person and date another, which is insanely rare for an otome.
- it doesn't demand you pick a person to try dating in the very beginning, which is brilliant because you get to know the people and then make a decision.
- the heroine isn't a complete waste of space
- there's a log of previous dialogue that you can scroll up at any time in case you miss something someone said or don't understand a character's response
- you can name your character (this has been known to cause glitches, but the developers are very attentive and fix this as it happens)
- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind
- the characters have clearly defined personalities, no more guessing what to say randomly and being totally wrong

Cons
- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind
- no steam overlay and no taking screenshots
- no steam achievements
- no steam achievements which makes it stupidly hard to remember what endings you've actually done. There is a grand master ending unlocked after you completely finish routes, and I think a lot of people will find that hard to keep track of what they've done. (Edit - there is a CG gallery that tracks overall completion.)
- the fullscreen mode lowers the quality of the images (slightly, not dramatically) so all the crisp screenshot examples on the steam store are not so crisp when you actually play it. It isn't bad in windowed mode or normal mode, however. 
- I've come across a few words that are itallian or similar sounding, which kind of threw me off. It's no more confusing than your typical ""onee-san"" but they're odd and confused me a little, at first.
- it's really expensive, the most expensive otome I have seen on steam to date, but I feel it's deserving of the price. The only thing I can think that is remotely this quality is Amnesia, and I'd pay double for Amnesia if I had to.

I'll be commenting more and editing this review as I play, but this is all I have right now.",1461973725,1462368797,True,163,5,0.872820615768432617,9,True,False,False,False,,,

Beautiful artwork and attractive voice overs. Some weird translation / transitional things but nothing earth shattering. (ex: it transitions to ""She did x thing."" instead of ""I did x thing.""  And Ojouchan to seniorita throws me off a little)

I've been waiting for this release since probably around January when I was looking around for new games to play when I saw a tumblr page on it about it being released on steam soon.

And here I am! The moment it was released, I immediately bought the game and got it started up! 

Overall, I'm very happy about this game being released and everything about it is absolutely gorgeous in my eyes despite it just being released. 

And the music is so beautiful and gorgeous as well, I could listen to it forever. To be honest, I sometimes come onto the store page JUST to listen to the video for the song. The art is amazing and I absolutely love that it's made by the same person who did the art for Diabolik Lovers.",1461969002,1461982188,True,29,4,0.671161234378814697,0,True,False,False,False,,,
