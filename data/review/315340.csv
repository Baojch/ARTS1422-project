I have so much to say and I can't even share all of it or my review will become even longer than it already is. Anyway, on to the review:

[u]Characters: [/u] Okay, so my favorite characters here are the playable characters Ares and Tarus. (I love their character designs; I want to draw fan art of them someday.) There wasn't much official artwork for the original version of this game, so in regard to the re-design for both Ares and Tarus for [i]A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX[/i], I think they both look more awesome here in the dialogue scenes. Both are combat androids but have very different personalities, which makes things interesting when playing through either campaign. Ares really behaves like a robot in dialogue scenes, like saying the word ""Query"" before asking a question, and making precise calculations of probabilities to the hundredth of a percentage. I think it's cute; I love that robot-y stuff! I wasn't sure about Tarus at first, but one third through Ares' story, I grew fond of Tarus after observing how mysterious and stoic he can be. He's so cool. I had to start playing his campaign immediately after finishing Ares' story. And I ship them, but that's just me. (Yes I know they are androids, but still, I just do.) And I can really see this as an anime. Oh, if only! But for now, that is what fan fiction is for…

In my opinion, Valkyl and Dr. Carson's re-designs are not bad and I won't complain. A remake is a remake. Both these characters have more personality in this game than the original version, so I thought that was an improvement. No word on what happened with the United Earth Chairman, who was mentioned only in the original game.  

[b]Characters[/b] I give 10/10, mainly because I love the playable android characters Ares and Tarus.

[u]Story:[/u] The story is on the About This Game section of this game's Store Page, so I won't go into that here, but personally I thought the story was interesting enough to play to the end… I mean, it was the playable characters, the music, and the gameplay that made me buy the game. For me, the story is more of a bonus here, the context for which Ares and Tarus have the motivation to go through each stage. I wanted to know more about this zytron gas, and you'll find out more how zytron affects robots and machines as you play more of the game.

[b]Story[/b] I give 7/10. It's not perfect, or completely original, but for me it was certainly memorable.

[u]Gameplay:[/u] The gameplay is much easier in this remake than it was in [i]A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda[/i]. Some abilities are less complicated to execute, such as a particular air boost ability that Ares later acquires. Also, the gameplay is faster because instead of pausing to create repair kits, you use 100 Material credits to heal your robot. Materials come from the robot enemies you destroy, and you can use these to either heal your robot or upgrade a weapon or skill/ability. The repair ability does take time to recharge, so use it wisely, but that shouldn't be hard. Just make sure that you plan ahead before whichever weapon or ability you upgrade, because for boss fights you might want to keep at least 1,000-2,000 credits in your collection at all times for healing during those boss fights. Also each time you upgrade a weapon or ability, the next level of upgrade will cost more than the previous version of that weapon or ability. Some grinding/mining will be necessary, I will admit. The best stages to grind for Materials will depend on your preference to stage layout and foes. But in later stages the zytron-infected robots drop more quantities of materials, so that is something to consider.

There are 7 Chapters for both Ares and Tarus. They go through the same stages but they have different stories, different personalities, and yes, even different [i]endings[/i], which you'll have to play the game to find out. So if you want to learn more of the story (or learn more about the mysterious and stoic Tarus) then I recommend playing as Tarus too. After you play as Ares you will notice how different each campaign is, if not the stages. 

Ares's combat involves more precision (not precise necessarily, just generally aiming at the enemy robots) whereas Tarus' combat style emphasizes destructive power rather than precision. They both have ways of increasing their defense, and you'll see that the more you level up either robot's abilities. Both combat androids share the same type of weapons but the weapons behave differently depending on if it's Ares or Tarus (you can see a sneak-peak of this in the trailer on the Store Page). Just try it! Try the game… you'll see. I recommend playing this game with a controller rather than a keyboard, but use whatever you're most comfortable with playing.

[b]Gameplay[/b] I give 9/10.

[u]Navigation/UI:[/u]  Much better here! An improvement from [i]A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda[/i]. All the upgrading + viewing of abilities  is on one screen. You can learn which button you press to do each attack or ability on this page at the bottom of its description when highlighted. For controllers, the Select/Back button is for the upgrades, using the front buttons to switch to viewing Data Cubes (brief, informative reading materials regarding characters and foes ) and Chapter Select. Chapter Select is handy when you want to grind/mine for Materials at your favorite stage. The Start Button is the main menu for the game itself with help and options, achievements and so on.

[b]Navigation[/b] I give 9/10.

[u]Music/Soundtrack:[/u]  Most of the tracks from [i]A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda[/i], with music by Hyperduck Soundworks, are used in their respective stages for Ares. For the new stages and Tarus campaign, the music used was composed by Charlie Parra del Riego. I think his music fits very well with Tarus' character and style. My favorite Tarus track was in his Chapter 1, and I think of that one as his theme music. There are some catchy tunes in this game that may get stuck playing in your head and become a favorite. (That's what happened to me, and it [i]still[/i] happens!) I was however disappointed that the Hyperduck Soundworks track ""The Subtle Knife"" wasn't used in this game as it was in the original version, but maybe the mood and timing wasn’t right for the re-worked ending.

[b]Music/Soundtrack[/b] I give 21/10. (Yes I just did that.) Thank you Hyperduck Soundworks and Charlie Parra del Riego, you guys are awesome musicians!

[u]Overall Score out of 10:[/u]  I might be biased because it's my favorite game now but it's an 11/10 from me. This score is based on my own experience with the game. But you have to try [i]A.R.E.S. EA EX[/i] out to judge it for yourself. I got this game on sale, so I suggest that you put it on your Wishlist and then look out for when it goes on sale, especially during the Winter or Summer sales. [i]A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX[/i] is a gem that should NOT be overlooked.

[u]Do I Want a Sequel?[/u]  I am waiting for a proper sequel. I won't hold my breath however, because sadly there is not enough demand for a sequel at the moment. I wouldn't mind being an Early Access tester of the sequel to help make it possible. This has the potential to become a series like [i]Mega Man X[/i], of which I am also a fan. After 7 years (10 years if you count the original game), A.R.E.S. has only 1.5 games in its title. Sadly yet again, there may be plenty of fans of this game who have moved on and forgot that they [b]wanted[/b] a sequel, so they are not verbal about wanting one.

[b][u]TL:DR[/u][/b]  I recommend this game if you're a fan of sci-fi video games or series like [i]Mega Man X[/i] and [i]Mega Man Zero[/i], or anything like side-scrolling platformers that feature androids as main characters and getting awesome power-ups along the way. Oh, and cool music. Awesome robots and cool music.",1617856466,1617858963,True,3,0,0.577897191047668457,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Jumping though, is very finicky. if you try to jump from a ledge, your character 8/10 times won't jump and you'll just stupidly fall to your death. This version of the game added a bunch more insta-death challenges to frustrate you beyond comprehension. like in the first game, there's a green robot that chases you destroying platforms as you go up, platforms that you can't jump from the edges of, even though you really need to, and some characters don't fit where they obviously should, so you're gonna die a lot. 

They added another stage full of insta-death, like an elevator that rises and breaks platforms, if you happen to be touching the bottom of a platform when it breaks, regardless of whether it would crush you or not, you die, and, lovely enough, at the final part of the elevator, it requires that you jump quickly to avoid being crushed... but guess what conveniently never works at that time? that's right, jumping! you just sort of twitch in place and have an even smaller window to try to jump out of there. Jumping is a major issue in this game.

That aside, if you want to play this casually, it's pretty fun, the achievement though all require perfection, which is pretty hard when you don't know when a jump won't work, or your hover will just stop as soon as you start it.

To make matters worse, hitboxes are a LOT bigger than you'd think, and you'll take hits from little parts of the boss you didn't think were close enough to do damage.

Boss fights often feel more annoying than they do challenging as they last way too long while you deal little to no damage, often having moments of dealing none as the enemy gets to use a 'super' move (Multiple times a battle) that is often capable of doing at least half your health with no realistic ability to dodge... Or not having a legitimate safe zone during phases (Whether it be due to the boss attack being unavoidable, or badly designed areas where the boss clips through the environment to damage you)

Enemies often feel poorly designed due to their ability to stun lock you out of your abilities, especially abilities that are required to even damage some of them.

Abilities often feel pointless with low damage output, very little situational purpose, and long wind up times that can and will be interrupted. Combining that with a cool down, abilities were rarely used or even relied on.  Abilities like healing, which has a rather steep cost, only make this game feel needlessly grindy (Why this game even makes you feel you need to grind is bonkers to me) especially when dying in a fight does not reset the currency, forcing you to restart the level just to have enough saved up to possibly make it to the end of a fight (Or hoping the healing is even up). 

Upgrades only make it feel worse, as they are just useless enough to encourage grinding to make them slightly more useful (Healing to close the RNG gap and cool down, but not cost, mega attack to hit more targets with a little more damage, however no way to force it to attack through bosses often and annoying no-damage super attacks).

Cons:
* Controls - you've got to align the movement stick upwards diagonally; otherwise, the character just gonna crouch and stop moving, which is extremely annoying during the more heated sequences such as the boss battles.
* Platforming - the difficulty is atrocious, especially on the 3rd level. I've rarely if ever died during the combat (even in the boss stages), but have fallen to death countless times.
* Jumping - sometimes, the game ignores the input (long jump and double jump).
* Difficulty - the boss fights are way too easy and some are outright broken ([spoiler]on the 3rd level, you can just shift yourself into the left wall and the enemy won't be able to damage you[/spoiler]), whilst the platforming is excruciating.
* Some enemies - the flying mines can hit you through the walls.
* Lack of the co-op mode.
* Plot - whilst it ain't too important in this kind of games, it's there and it is bad, boring, cliched.
* The database collectibles are absolutely useless - the lore is bare and they don't give you credits or any other advantage.
* Enemies visibility - sometimes, the enemies are obscured by the foreground and simply cannot be noticed in time - it's a cheap way of increasing difficulty.
* Enemies range - whilst you cannot shoot the off-screen enemies, they can shoot you!

I've played Megaman games and finished the whole Zero series, Super Metroid, Castlevania games, got a robot named fight in my library, finished that too. So in terms of those type of games I know what I'm talking about.

What are the problems with this one?

1. The controls are very clunky and unpolished, you know that feeling when you play one of those ""First attempt at 3D"" type of games that had platforming in it's gameplay but was horribly ill equipped to put that into practice? These guys somehow managed to have that problem in their 2D game. This kind of game needs fluid control ability, not this chunky clunky mess that makes it difficult to jump from platform to platform. You'l find yourself dying due to not being able to make a simple jump from A to B which gets even worse when you get boost. 

2. Claustrophobic level design. Now I got to chapter 3 and up until now the levels felt like going through a very narrow tube. There is barely any space. There are literally rooms that get flooded with 3 enemies at once and they're at point blank range with hardly any to no room to navigate. Couple that with very clunky controls and platforming which by the way gets us to manufactured difficulty. You'l have instances where it's not the enemies or the skillrequirement that will get you killed but bad level design trying to pass itself as challenging.

3. So your character is orange, the level is orange, and some enemies like turrets on the ceiling which also has a bunch of cables hanging everywhere are also orange. That makes taking in what you're looking at quite difficult.

So, what is it that makes me want to throw my controller? It's the same sort of problem that old NES games used to pull. 

There are doors that are timed, and once you shoot the device to open the doors you have to jump/hover across platforms to get through them in time.

El juego que nos ocuba, va de ""robores"". Hacia tiempo que lo tenia, pero no me habia dado por ponerme. Y despues de algo más de 6 horas y media... ¿que es esto?

Pues vendria a ser un megatroid, o un metroman. Vamos, que a mi por lo menos, me ha recordado a una mezcla entre metroid y mega man. Y lo cierto es que aunque corto, no está mal.

El control es correcto, aunque algo mejorable. No hay mapa, pero no es que sea muy necesario... no es demasiado laberintico. De hecho, la importancia del backtracking aqui, se limita a encontrar algunas mejoras para las armas que tenemos.  Tampoco es un pasillo recto, que conste, pero dudo que nadie se pierda.

La dificultad no es demasiado alta, aunque hay algun tramito que te puede desquiciar. Especialmente, me ha sacado de mis casillas el 3er nivel y un segmento del 4º en el que un mamón nos persigue petando plataformas y tenemos que ir subiendo rápido.

Y no hay mucho más que añadir... la música no está mal. Y como he dicho antes, no es demasiado largo. Pero aun asi... le casco un 6'5 y lo recomiendo (de oferta sale barato).

Ah si... se me olvidaba... tambien puedes jugar con otro personaje (aun no lo he tocado). Asi que supongo que puede durar algo más.

Llevaba tiempo buscando un buen run n gun o algo del estilo y vaya que tuve una sorpresita agradable con este titulo~♥

>A grandes rasgos:
ARES (EAEsdfjks) es un run n gun/metroidvania/megamano indie, bonito y bueno~♥ que nos pone en control de 1 de 2 personajes jugables siendo estos unos mechas/robots que tienen como mision evitar la expansion de un virus (como en megaman) que anda poniendo a todas las IA en modo agresivo... con el principal peligro de que una base infectada posee un rasho laser que puede destruir a la tierra.

>Lo bueno:
-El gameplay: recuerda a los viejos clasicos como megaman x o contra (por el patron que debes de seguir con los bosses y las secciones que son mas gun n run)
-2 personajes jugables: Ares o Tarus, cada uno con propio arco, banda sonora y habilidades.
-La banda sonora: es epica y con ese feel rock de los megaman.
-La curva de dificultad es decente... y puedes modificarla si lo sientes muy dificil o facil...
-El diseño de niveles hace su objetivo: esta bonito, hay fases que ocupan skill y tienen secretitos que dan cierto valor de replay.
-Las armas y skills: hay en total 4 armas para cada personaje todas mejorables con 4 skills que de igual manera puedes maxear... eso sin contar con una habilidad ""ultimate"" para cada personaje que te puede salvar en algunos momentos.

>Lo malo:
-Podria ser... que dura muy poco 2:30hrs por arco [5 horas por los 2](con 6 stages que toman cada una de 20 a 30 minutos dependiendo tu skill)... que esta bien para el tipo de juego que es.
-Es un indie... le falta pulir a lo grafico, sobre todo animaciones que se ven muy chafas sobre todo cuando mueres xD es una copia de muerte de megaman. Al igual que la forma en que narran la historia que esta muy meh en sus cinematicas.

游戏里使用双主角的设定，每个主角都有四种武器、一种必杀（按键Q）、四种特殊技能（按键E、F、C、shift），不过除了shift两者分别是冲刺和腾空飞行有些不同外，其他从操作上来说还算比较接近
总共有7个章节，单个角色都有自己的进度，除了中间有一关的BOSS战是另一方以外，其他关卡设计上都是一样的
游戏内的升级系统属于比较一个比较重要的功能，主角的能力随着关卡的进度而逐渐解锁，包括武器、特殊技能，都是需要特殊的卡片来解锁，一般都是由BOSS掉落，并且获得后后面的关卡也会有用到这些新的能力
除了主线获取的卡片外，每一章节都有三张额外的隐藏卡片，需要探索地图获取，部分前期地图的卡片也需要后期解锁的技能才能拿到，所以初期看到拿不到的卡片不用紧张，记住位置和挡着的东西特征，后面看到有新能力能解决这些东西的时候就可以返回前面的章节来拿取
隐藏卡片获取后就可以对身上的特殊能力/武器进行升级（tab键打开升级界面），只不过升级需要消耗一定的资源，这些资源都是从怪物身上掉落，后期可能需要一定的farm才能集齐升级全部能力的资源
升级后并不只是数值的提高，有些还能获得更加强力的效果，比如二段冲刺、激光枪可以推动更重的机关等等
游戏三个难度，前两个其实都挺简单的，因为有修复能力，CD也不算长，只要有资源就能回血，反而是一些场景的动作部分比较难，因为摔到深渊或者被某些大型陷阱挤压后都是秒杀的，需要多加练习，尤其两个主角的shift技能在升级前都有挺大的延迟、外加被攻击后会被打断

There's a bit of engrish translation errors, but nothing too bad - they're pretty rare and it's easy to understand what's being said.

Most of my issues have more to do with things like foreground objects that can kill you but which look like part of the background and your weapons pass through making it seem like it's safe until you run into the hazard. Leaps of faith into bottomless pits, spotty controls, forced maneuvering in one section with both the top and bottom of the screen locked down but no indication this is the case on top, and other such design choices which led to a consistent feeling that any time I've died, it wasn't my fault nor in my control to prevent because I couldn't have known it was a problem until it was too late.

In in the middle of the fifth level and a clear example of this came to light - you're walking along a train and it's fine, no hazards at all. Then it suddenly shifts to having these low ceiling obstacles appear out of nowhere, but they move quite quickly and look like they're part of the background at first glance. In the rest of the game, you can move freely left and right without issue. Here, you're walking to the right, same as normal, and the first of these obstacles comes flying out of nowhere just at the right timing that, if you're moving at a normal pace, will squish you against the left side of the screen which now can't move to the left anymore and will instantly kill you without warning. At no point did this feel like I could have reasonably known that I would have died in this situation, that it was an instant kill, that I could be crushed against literally nothing because I'd just been standing in that spot two seconds earlier and there's no obstacles to my left and the screen hasn't locked in that way before, nor that I could have realized that it wasn't part of the background. The penalty for this death was to just get teleported back a few screens and have to start that section over, and once it was clear what was going on, it was easy to avoid the obstacles since they come at a regular pace and are predictable - easy to avoid once you know the problem's there, but almost guaranteed a cheap death the first time you encounter such.

This is what I've found throughout the entire game so far - it's not really difficult at all, but occasionally you'll just flop over dead without rhyme nor reason as a new mechanic is introduced without a proper introduction to how it works. The level design could introduce these elements significantly better than it does, but it's fairly uninspired and bland for what the levels do. There's also a fair bit of unintuitive backtracking, such as areas in the first and second level which can't be accessed until you've gained abilities from later levels. If this were a metroidvania style game where there's a single, connected map which you return to certain areas occasionally, that'd make sense, but these are discrete, fairly linear levels for the most part and once you've cleared a level, the only reason to go back to it is to get a better score or to pick up items you couldn't get the first time you went through it.

The controls are mostly responsive, though there are some oddities like your air dash only being able to go straight up or horizontally, no diagonals, much less aiming where your mouse is like how your primary weapon works. Again, it mostly works, but it feels bare-bones and lacking for both depth and quality.

This is kind of just how the whole game plays so far - it's not bad, but it's kinda mediocre in a lot of ways. Minor nuisances, bland presentation and design decisions that really aren't that well thought out are everywhere. You can definitely get some enjoyment out of it, and I'd recommend playing it, especially if it's on sale, but the fact of the matter is that you probably shouldn't go into it with particularly high expectations. A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX has a pretty reasonable core game to it, but it doesn't really stand out as being particularly polished in any way. It's a rough product and it doesn't feel like it was ever really play tested - probably because it wasn't. The QA team is literally listed in the credits as just being the people who made the game in the first place. There's no indication they even showed it to friends or family to get thoughts on it.

For what it is, it's not bad, it's worth a try, especially on sale for $2.29 canadian like I got it for. I'd recommend giving it a try, but don't look to ARES as being on par with other games in the genre. Sure, it's better than Mighty No. 9, but really, that isn't a high bar to overcome. Really, I just can't give this a glowing review, but I can't say it hasn't been fun either. I just can't say it has been something which I feel like I would recommend going out of your way to get.

It's a game. It passes time. It's moderately enjoyable. It doesn't do anything particularly well, but it doesn't do anything particularly badly, either. If you want to kill 5-10 hours of your life, it will do that for you, it just won't be particularly memorable nor high quality is all. I dunno... it feels like I can't really put what I want to say into words properly for it. It's above average in all categories, and is enjoyable... it just doesn't stand out anywhere and is absolutely riddled with minor problems all over. No major issues, just little things that keep it from ever being great in any way. I don't hate it, I actually kind of like it, but it just feels like it should have been something more than it is. There's a lot more potential here than was put to use, and I think that's the bit that disappoints me most. It definitely deserves a recommendation and is worth playing through once, but I don't think I could give it a glowing recommendation or a second playthrough.",1539199807,1539199807,True,1,0,0.5345345139503479,1,True,False,False,False,,,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

O jogo é bem legal, lembra clássicos como Megaman X, Super Metroid e Contra. Ele não é metroidvania, as fases são lineares, mas com uns caminhos extras com itens e equipamentos escondidos.

A jogabilidade é muito boa, você atira (pode mudar a direção com o analógico direito ou mouse), tem um dash (ou rolamento dependendo do personagem), pulo duplo, dash aéreo, armas diferentes, habilidades de ataque ou defesa, upgrades pras armas, rank nas fases (C, B, A, S, SS) e leaderboards.

A versão EX melhorou muito o jogo original, o jogo é um pouco mais difícil, mas como a jogabilidade é bem melhor, acaba ficando mais fácil em certos pontos. Essa versão tem um personagem jogável novo (com movimentação e armas ligeiramente diferentes do principal) e também tem uma fase nova, que mostra esse personagem.

As fases foram ligeiramente modificadas, com os itens e upgrades espalhados. Os gráficos foram melhorados e o jogo ficou mais leve (o primeiro as vezes dava lag aqui). A qualidade do áudio também melhorou muito, ganhando também músicas novas. Os efeitos sonoros também foram melhorados.

O menu e interface com usuário foi bastante melhorado, no primeiro era confuso controlar com o gamepad era melhor usar o mouse. As cutscenes são desenhadas e foram refeitas e algumas aparecem em momentos diferentes. Os inimigos estão um pouco diferentes os chefes tem movimentos a mais e novos chefes.

A câmera também está mais polida, no primeiro as vezes ela dava um zoom bem desnecessário quando você estava perto do chefe. Para trocar de arma é só usar o d-pad. Na versão original tinha que abrir o menu para trocar. As armas e habilidades tem upgrades diferentes.

Seu personagem tem uma habilidade especial, com o ARES você dá dano aos inimigos na tela, já o TAUROS fica invunerável por um tempo. E ainda tem duas habilidades secundárias, uma explosão para frente e um EMP que paraliza inimigos.

O dash aéreo só tem na versão EX, no original você tinha que segurar o botão da habilidade secundária até carregar, ai quando solta o botão o personagem dá um ataque para frente. Com o dash a jogabilidade melhorou muito, você se movimenta melhor e mais rápido, podendo dar dash para frente ou para cima (cada um tem um botão). O dash no jogo original era somente no chão e tinha que apertar para baixo mais botão de pulo (nada agradável). O personagem novo, TAUROS, não tem dash aéreo, ele plana no ar durante um tempo e pode mudar a direção e altura.

Exitem coletáveis de upgrade de arma, mas é preciso encontrá-los e depois comprar com as ""moedas"" coletadas. Na versão EX tem somente um tipo de ""moeda"", no original tinham três, o que gerava uma confusão na hora de comprar o upgrade. As moedas também servem para recuperar vida, basta usar a habilidade, que no EX tem um cooldown e no horiginal tem que comprar pelo menu.

Além disso, para quem tinha o jogo original você ganhava na versão EX um drone que coletava as ""moedas"" do jogo automaticamente. No jogo orignal tinha que encostar nelas para pegar, o que deixava o jogo mais lento e mais difícil de fazer combos para aumentar a pontuação (perdia tempo coletando itens e o contador do combo zerava).

Uma coisa bizarra do jogo original é que para usar as habilidades secundárias tinha um botão para usar a habilidade selecionada e outro para trocar de habilidade. O vacilo é que são duas habilidades, então podia ser um botão para usar uma e outro para a outra (foi o que corrigiram na versão EX).

Uma coisa útil na versão original era que nas fases tinham cápsulas para recuperar toda a vida. Na versão EX não tem, mas o jogo não parece injusto pois as mortes não te penalizam muito. Quando você morre, volta para o último checkpoint (que são até muitos).

Todas essas coisas que falei que acrecentaram no EX acredito que deixaram o jogo orinal, que era bom, bem melhor. Entretanto, ainda tinham alguns problemas que não corrigiram.

Os checkpoints só são salvos enquanto você estiver jogando na fase. Se clicar no abort mission no menu (ou sair do jogo) e depois abrir a fase, então volta para o começo da fase. Elas não são longas, mas é desnecessário te fazer voltar tudo, sendo que no jogo existem checkpoints.

Se quiser fazer os 100% precisa matar os chefes sem tomar dano. O problema é que no menu não tem botão para reiniciar no último checkpoint. Então tem que esperar o chefe te matar para tentar de novo. E ainda vai ter que ver as animações iniciais, antes de lutar com o chefe, tudo novamente. Outra coisa que achei ruim é que ao morrer sua barra de especial é zerada, ou seja, mesmo se chegar no chefe com a barra cheia e depois morrer nele, você volta para o checkpoint sem a barra cheia. E para encher a barra, só tomando dano ou coletando as ""moedas"" (que não existem no chefe, somente nas fases).

Uma coisa que pode prejudicar a jogabilidade é que é necessário mirar com o analógico (ou mouse) para mudar a direcão do tiro. Mas em um jogo de plataforma (e não twin stick shooter) isso pode atrapalhar nos momentos de plataforma, você precisaria de dois dedões para pular e mirar ao mesmo tempo.

Então é isso ai, o jogo original é bom, mas a versão EX deixou ele muito melhor. Quem gosta de jogos tipo Mega Man X pode jogar que a chance é alta de gostar, jogar, rejogar e querer 100%. Se estiver em dúvida recomendo comprar a versão EX quando tiver uma promoção.

Ah, e a história? Sei lá, pulei tudo, kkkkkk, mais um ponto positivo pro jogo, te deixa pular cutscenes e textos.

[h1]とてもライトなアクションゲーム。難易度は非常に甘くクリアーするだけならとても簡単。[/h1]
[spoiler]※個人の感想です。腕前によって個人差があります。[/spoiler]

見た目はロックマンのようなゲームですが、マウスを使って照準を合わせる為
一部の方々にはとてもプレイしにくい気もしました。
キャラクターは画像を見ての通り2キャラクター存在しており、アクションや武器もそれぞれ異なる為、好みが別れるかもしれませんが、私はどちらも好きです。
ジャンプ、ローリング、ホバリングの3つの操作の一部が被っているので、それによる事故死は割とありました。
恐らく私の方向キーを押す癖も災いしたのでしょう。ただ、
ジャンプ、ダッシュ(ローリング)とホバー移動のキーは独立してほしかったです。

慣れるまでという要素を加味しますと、一番最初の回復を取るまでが最難関なのではないでしょうか。
時点でエレベーターとプレス地帯でしょう。暴発したせいで何度平らになったことやら。

1キャラクターの全てのパワーアップアイテムを取得してクリアーするまでが大体3時間かかりません。
ちゃんとパワーアップ系統を取っていけば特に苦になることはないでしょう。
個人的に苦労したポイントと言えば、チャプター5のあの紫色の箱を壊す方法を探る為に
3…40分ほど周回したことぐらいでしょうか。
あとは空中ダッシュが2回だけの時、一部への侵入が非常にシビアです。勿論、通れます。
ジャンプ、空中上ダッシュ、二段ジャンプ、空中上ダッシュ、被ダメージ。からの着地で可能です。
何処なのかは是非プレイして確かめてみてください。3回まで強化した後であれば楽々通過できます。

全実績も解除したいというのであれば多少の困難もあるかもしれません…
あと、英語が読めない方は無印版をお勧めいたします。",1529725679,1531493073,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Somos ARES, un robot que lucha contra otros robots a los que se le ha ido la pinza y ahora quieren destruir a sus creadores. Mientras nos enzarzamos en una guerra fratricida, conseguiremos material (no definido) para poder mejorar nuestras habilidades y simplificar el juego aún más.

[*]Sin venir a cuento el juego sufre [b]parones que duran dos segundos[/b]. No muchos, es cierto, pero muy molestos. Lo peor es que el juego continua mientras miras estupefacto la pantalla. Si te ocurre durante un jefe, estas fastidiado (por no decir jodidillo).

[*]Las colisiones en los saltos no están bien pulidas en la parte superior del personaje. Sufriremos mucho en las fases verticales, en las que tendrás que escapar de una garrapata gigante. Producirá más de una muerte injusta.

Finally gave the EX version a go and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The one thing they fixed with this version is they simplified the currency (original game had three types- think nuts, bolts and screws). That for me made it more enjoyable because not having to worry about three different parts to have was a relief. 

The second character Tarus is (surprisingly) fun to use... So much so that I completed his campaign, (and Btw I LOVED that ending). 

Another thing I really like is the soundtrack. Heavy, crunchy guitar with some really catchy riffs and awesome solo work. This combined with some light electronic music thrown in is by far one of my favorite game soundtracks. I found myself at work whistling some of the tunes even! 

Being able to go back to earlier stages with newly gained abilities to access new areas/collectibles /powerups is ALWAYS a plus in my book. So I guess it's *kind of* a metroidvania type game in this sense, but it's not open world. Instead of select the level you want to go to (there's 7 levels). Just think of it as warp spots. :) 

I also liked how the cutscenes aren't voiced at all. I know I'm weird but Im the type of person who gives them my own voice. 

Only a couple of things I didn't like but these are small nitpicks- every time a boss or miniboss is introduced you have to wait some seconds for an introduction (show off) before fighting. 
Also the game is a bit short BUT as you can see I have almost 10 hours having played both campaigns and collecting and upgrading just about everything. 

Also I found myself ditching the traditional x to shoot in favor of using the right stick instead. It's something I'm usually against for this genre but it feels much more natural and flows way better.

相比较2011年的前作A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda，本作作为加强版，各方面都有了长足的进步。就鄙人对前作的评测，本作的改进与不足之处，且让鄙人逐一道来。

首先画面仍旧是比较精致的，人物经过了重新设计，比前作更加帅气（但是大头设计我觉得着实违和，而且Valkyl我觉得也是原版好看），场景几乎没有进步（分辨率提升？），绝大多数直接沿用原来的设计与素材；关卡设计也没什么进步和特色（我仍然对洛克人X8中重力蚂蚁那关记忆犹新），原本粗糙的贴图仍旧还是那样，不过画面整体还不错，画风统一精良，不加分也不减分。

操控性得到了飞跃性的提升。首先动作更加流畅（当然跑步姿势看着还是有点怪，但比原作好多了），将冲刺单独拿出来重新设计并提升了实用性，单单这个改动就使得整个游戏流畅度和爽快度大大提升（我玩到后期99连击冲关，小怪根本打不到我）。其次第二关就能取得空中移动，并取消了前作脑残似的蓄力设定。当然显然制作组经验欠缺，Ares在空中冲刺开始时会延迟/蓄力一下下，但就这么一下下，就经常打断攻击节奏了，而Tarus的空中停滞像极了洛克人X中的Alex，不过不受方向限制，实用性很不错。总之瑕不掩瑜，操控性可以给8/10分了。

双主角设定可以单独拿出来一说：本作双主角双方除了Datacube以外，其余均不能共享。Ares和Tarus有各自的剧情（还相互矛盾，好可惜），升级芯片位置与取得方法也基本一模一样。Ares的武器跟前作一样，各有特色也都比较好用；跟Ares比起来，Tarus的武器则是短程但威力大，但是打Boss的时候很多情况下是要拉开距离的，这使它打个别boss来尤其辛苦。不可否认，两个主角玩起来都很有特点，并不雷同，不过要是改成洛克人X8那样的可以随时切换主角，或者生化2那种相互补全剧情的设定，那绝对是加分项。

鉴于操控性的提升，成就做起来也舒服很多，但是看着成就中那些无伤杀Boss的成就我甚是犯愁，要是能单独把Boss战拿出来做个BossRush就好了。

鉴于本作各方面不错的素质（玩起来已经挺像洛克人X8了），强烈推荐给动作游戏爱好者尝试。反正打折的时候很便宜，物超所值。

Eu ja fiz a analise desse jogo antes. Algumas coisas mudaram nesta versão.

A história é basicamente a mesma. Ainda assim irei explicar o enredo um pouco. O jogo se passa em uma época futurista, numa estação espacial, e um gás misterioso faz com que os robos fiquem agressivos e violentos, então voce (imune a este gás) tem que resgastar os sobreviventes da estação. É basicamente o mesmo de antes, só que algumas cenas e dialogos foram acrescentadas, a também um novo personagem chamado Tarus, que é o parceiro de Ares. As Cutscenes ficaram bem melhores também.

A gameplay é onde teve a maior mudança o basico se manteva, voce anda, pula e atira, além de poder dar Dash/Roll. A campanha é a mesma pros dois personagens. No entanto, as armas são diferentes pra cada personage, e algumas mecanicas são exclusivas de cada personagem. Ares pode dar Dash, que é bem parecido com o Megaman X, inclusive pode fazer no ar. Ja o Tarus só da roll mesmo (cambalhota) mas ele pode planar por alguns segundos, o especial de cada personagem é diferente bem como os golpes secundarios também. O sistema de upgrades melhorou, agora é possivel da upgrades no personagem também, não só nas armas. Antes tinha 3 tipos de materiais com cores diferentes, voce precisava de um numero X de cada material para os upgrades, isso foi retirado, agora é tipo unico de material, que por sinal é compartilhado entre os dois personagens. Para aqueles que possuem o jogo original, voce recebe um drone que te segue e pega o material pra voce, o que é bem util. O jogo também possui mais inimigos (além de boss e mini-boss novos), duas novas fase.

A trilha sonora, manteve o que ja tinha e foi acrescentado mais, toda campanha de tarus tem musicas novas, sem contar as que foram adicionadas nas fases novas. O que ja era bom ficou melhor ainda. Os sons como antes estão excelentes.

O visual, apesar de ter dado uma melhorada, não é tão notável assim. Ainda assim, o jogo é bonito.

Não encontrei nenhum bug ou glitch no jogo.

Eu definitivamente recomendo este jogo. Independente de voce ter jogado o original ou não. O jogo por si só é muito bom e melhorou muito. Recomendo!",1483723091,1483723091,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX is a side-scrolling mecha shooter game, safely to say a Megaman clone.

You have 2 mechs to choose from Ares and Tarus, similar to the roles how X and Zero in Megaman series.
Each has different set of weapons and abilities and both have different storyline, though same levels and objectives.

The game technically and visually is good, however the soundtrack doesn't fit and really boring.

The story in general is generic, although it has few cool twists. But it's nothing special at all. You go on levels, destroy bots to save humankind. That's it.

You have also a human female as an assistant that communicate with you throughout your mission and develop new upgrades for you suit.

During the levels there are database cubes and upgrade units to collect, the former for expanding game lore to read and the later allow you to upgrade weapons and abilities.

Each character has 7 levels, which are exactly the same but different dialogues.
And you can beat the entire game in few hours (took me 5 hours).

Let's switch to the cons:

- Level designs: Some areas can be really frustrating, designed to hinder your movements limits to your demise.
- Unskippale scenes: This really made me mad, because checkpoints happen before a hard part, which forcing me to watch the same scene over and over and over until I successfully pass the area. Boss Battles has the same problem.
- Checkpoints sometimes are set far from each other, again due to some areas being frustrating, having to run through many rooms/traps/enemies before you getting to a new checkpoint isn't really a nice idea if you want to put a challenge in the way. I really don't like repeating the same steps for 5~10 times before I figure out a solution.
- The Ending (both endings), although are good, end abruptly. It would be better to see at least a glimpse of the aftermath.

I really really do! it's been on my wishlist for what feels like forever. it's been on here for so long that I didnt even know that they made this ""EX"" version of it until this very summer sale.

now that we have the intro out of the way: 
+the visuals are really nice and pretty. the interface is clean, easy to understand and doesnt interfere or hinder gameplay in any way. 
+the soundtrack is awesome and gets you pumped, wanting to keep charging in, dodging and weaving while dishing out your own punishment. 
+it has that fun factor that you want in an arcade-style game in the vein of megaman, metroid, I'll even throw in contra and metal slug. 
+the level up system is simple
+the upgrade system is simple as well and clearly meant to foster replayability (and done right, I'd say)
+enemies are cool looking and there's enough of them to present a challenge as well as allowing for satisfactory accumulation of your currency/resource. BUT!

and here's where we get to the cons:
-the hitboxes seem off to me. maybe I'm crazy but there are times where I've gotten so frustrated when I analyze a bosses pattern, go to dodge and watch myself still get hit.
-that also being said, the controls are definitely sluggish (using a mechanical keyboard). input lag is a very real and very deadly thing in this game, especially in boss fights and even more so when it comes to platforming puzzles where timing is key.

again, I really really really want to like this game. it's got that something that really helps scratch that arcadey-classic side-scrolling shooter itch and does a lot of things right that other similar games dont (level up, upgrades, interface, soundtrack, etc). but the fact that the controls are so slow and the hitboxes dont really seem to match the visuals sometimes just weighs so heavily upon this game since it's fairly fast paced. you're not sure why you didnt dodge that thing when it looked like you did on the screen, and you're pretty sure that you tried to 2xjump+air dash up, but instead you just headbutted the edge of the platform. I'll admit, I'll still keep playing this game and try to ""get gud"" but as it stands now, I cant recommend this game on the grounds of its combat and controls. if one was spot on accurate, the other wouldnt matter as much. but the fact that both of these major issues  are in the game just make it incredibly frustrating to make it past battles/platform areas. one last plus side though is that you dont really loose anything other than distance when you die",1467617964,1467617964,False,2,0,0.504854321479797363,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played the original version of this game some years ago, but didn't get around to playing this version until today.

At the end of my run as ARES, I was ready to give Extinction Agenda EX a thumbs down, and maybe I still should: It's one of the jankiest run-and-gun games I have ever played. Asthetically, it's fine: The music is excellent and the sprite work fairly appealing. Aiming and shooting is just fine thanks to the mouse, but the jumping controls are uniquely unresponsive and occasionally just fail to work at all. ARES' air dash move is especially difficult to use properly. I must have wasted an hour of the two hours it took to finish the game just falling into pits. It's also rather difficult to avoid damage, and if not for the in-built repair ability, I probably would not have gotten anywhere. I imagine I had a similar experience playing the first version of this game, but that was back in 2011 so I don't remember for sure. Nostalgia makes every game seem better I guess, because I gave that game a positive review just yesterday. But playing it again was not nearly as fun.

Then, I played Tarus, the new playable character to this version of the game. And let me tell you, playing Tarus is like playing a different game entirely, and a better one at that. ARES' unwieldy air-dash is replaced with a much simpler to use mid-air hover move, which allows you to fly around for a short duration. At least once jump segment that gave me no end of trouble with ARES can be bypassed using Tarus entirely: Though Tarus' cutscenes differ from ARES, the levels do not. His ""limit break""-type move, instead of a smart bomb like ARES, is a invulnerability shield. His weapons, while shorter-ranged and slower then ARES', do considerably more damage. All this meant that my run as Tarus took about half the time, give or take a few minutes. I've never seen a disparity between two characters in the same game this huge before. If you get this game, get it on sale like I did, and don't even bother playing as ARES- Tarus is your bot.",1466636071,1466636071,True,7,0,0.569275856018066406,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Начнем с того, что оригинальный A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda просто ужасен. Кривой, скучный, однообразный, со унылым дизайном и не больно-то отзывчивым управлением. 
Обновленное издание - та же, в сути, игра. Те же герой, сюжет, уровни, но...

Изменения в EX-издания таковы, что в них нет ни одного минуса. Вообще. Сами посудите:
+два играбельных персонажа, абилки и пушки которых, вроде бы одинаковые, работают по-разному;
+новая пачка треков с гитарными запилами на фоне для второго чара;
+под возможности героев переработаны и адаптированы старые уровни, а также добавлен один совершенно новый;
+с пунктом выше, кстати, связан небольшой сюжетный твист, плюс на 2 героев - 2 концовки;
+бестиарий тоже чуток пополнился несколькими образцами живой враждебной техники;
+появились сюжетные вставочки, симпатичные, но с простенькой анимацией (мелочь, а приятно);
+переработана система сбора ресурсов и крафта: во-первых, с игроком летает дроид-магнитик для этого дела; во-вторых, теперь вместо трех видов деталей и вытекающего из этого унылого гринда в оригинале в EX-издании всего один ресурс, а цвета теперь отмечают лишь количество деталек в одном кубике;
+БОЛЬШЕ АПГРЕЙДОВ! Разница в мощи стала реально ощутима;
+гранаты и хилки теперь существенно удобнее в использовании.

Из игры убрали никчемные бонусные костюмы за DLC и ранги, и это, если честно - совсем не обидная потеря. Без них лучше, имхо, ибо толку от них было не очень много. Сама игра стала повеселее, уже не такая скучная и как минимум затягивает на пару-тройку прохождений, хотя бы ради пробы разных героев и погони за новыми ачивами.

После этого масштабного реворка A.R.E.S. стал вполне достойным экшн-платформером, который больше увлекает динамичными схватками и меньше жрет нервы игрока, если сравнить с оригиналом.

ARES EX riesce ancora a divertire per diverse ore. Come lo fa? Gli sviluppatori hanno preso tutto quello che era già venuto bene nella prima versione di Ares e lo hanno migliorato, introducendo nello stesso tempo anche alcune novità molto interessanti. 
Tutti i livelli sono stati revisionati ed ampliati introducendo nuove meccaniche e nuovi nemici. Viene reso utilizzabile Tarus, visto di sfuggita nel primo Ares, che amplia la storia e chiarisce alcuni retroscena. IL sistema di controllo del personaggio è stato rivisto e migliorato ed è stata introdotta una semplice componente GDR per gestire la crescita dei due personaggi disponibili in questa versione.

[b]MECCANICHE DI GIOCO:[/b]
In Ares EX alcune meccaniche di gioco sono state rivoluzionate e migliorate.
Ora non ci sono più 3 tipi di risorse riciclabili, ma una sola risorsa adatta per ogni potenziamento. 
Questo rende più semplice e rapido il potenziamento delle armi, delle abilità e dell’armatura.
Anche il sistema di controllo è stato ampiamente modificato, permettendo finalmente la completa personalizzazione dei pulsanti ed è possibile attribuire un tasto allo scatto! Anzi ai due scatti disponibili: uno verso l’alto e uno in avanti, combinali tra di loro dopo aver trovato i chip di potenziamento, per poter raggiungere punti prima fuori dalla nostra portata e trovare così altri chip di potenziamento o datacube con i dati dei vari nemici.

http://steamcommunity.com/id/byuwraindmaizwei/recommended/92300/


先說系統和操作，改動還不少：
◎難度由兩種變成三種
◎界面重新設計過，較原版好
◎滑鼠右鍵由手雷改為衝刺（Tarus則是翻滾）、跟手雷相關的移動技能全部分離出來可直接使出，整體操作感較原版好很多
◎連擊可突破99 HITS的上限
◎廢料由三種變成只有一種，上限為9999
◎手雷和維修包沒有攜帶上限，但每次使用後重新裝填需時
◎手雷不用買、無需切換，但攻擊方式變成只有一種
◎評分準則改變並新增Leaderboards，在最高難度可以突破10000分的上限
◎成就

除此以外改動：
◎角色造型以至設定都有更改
◎劇本全部重寫
◎過場CG改為動畫
◎新增兩個關卡、原有關卡重新設計、補血點全部刪除、部分敵人有所強化
◎部分質材更換
◎Ares的裝甲除了一開始那套就只有會隨劇情取得的「原型裝甲」

至於兩名角色如下……
◎Ares：攻擊力較低但射程較長，可衝刺及空衝，特殊技有範圍限制，絕招是衛星砲
◎Tarus：攻擊力較高但射程較短，可翻滾及浮空，特殊技為無射程限制的水平射擊，絕招是攻防一體的能量力場（無敵狀態，但BOSS戰被摸到照樣扣分）
關卡BGM、劇情、武器性能也會隨角色而有所不同。


雖然有新關卡新角色，但還是感覺意猶未盡，Ares的裝甲只有兩套、新增的音樂沒OST也滿可惜的。
不過，跟原版同樣的價錢（有原版的話還有半價和特典），更多的內容，整體而言算是誠意之作，值得一玩！",1421496993,1423025541,True,13,1,0.691629469394683838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/92300

En si, los cambios mas drásticos son las cinemáticas que están mas cuidadas y presentables, no por mucho pero que demuestra mas formalidad en lo que respecta a presentación. En el sistema de combate las granadas o movimientos especiales se recargan por tiempo y no mediante la chatarra que juntábamos, la cual sigue teniendo el mismo propósito de incrementar el nivel de cierta arma a su vez de otros parámetros como dash, movimiento, armadura, etc. También se implementa un sistema de subida de nivel que dependiendo de cuantos puntos hagamos y que rango saquemos (de la D hasta la SS) tendremos mejoras de salud alternativas. 

En tanto a los cambios de diseño de juego, se añaden dos nuevos niveles manteniendo intactos los otros sin ningun cambio notable. También cabe aclarar que se añade un nuevo personaje llamado Taurus, el compañero de Ares quien en la versión original no es jugable. Este propone un gameplay diferente puesto que sus armas y varios movimientos son totalmente diferentes, pero en si se siente bastante familiar.

Por otro lado, presiento que bien podría caber como un DLC de la versión original y que los peores problemas con respecto a hitbox y detección de colisión que arruina muchas veces las secciones de plataformeo, no se han solucionado del todo.

Si bien, recomendaría esta versión por sobre la original, aunque ambos juegos son muy similares

The story remains pretty much the same, although now there's the possibility to play as either Ares or Tarus. Ares retains the story of the first game, with some additions; as for Tarus, he has his own story, although you'll find yourself playing the same levels as with Ares, including several of the cutscenes.

As far as gameplay changes, the scrap you used to collect in the previous game has been unified under a single type, but the crafting menu is still there. Upgrades to your weapons and abilities need to be found before you can unlock them. Each character has his own weapons and abilities.

É o tipo de jogo que foi bem programado e que tem gráficos bonitos, mas o sistema de progressão frustra muito os jogadores inveterados.

Problemas:

*Não há como salvar no meio da fase (em checkpoints).

Há checkpoints caso você morra, mas é preciso concluir a fase inteira ""de uma vez só"" para salvar seu progresso. Se você joga no hardcore e acontece algum imprevisto e você precisa sair de casa, você precisa escolher entre deixar o jogo aberto ou perder tudo que fez ao longo da fase. 

*O sistema de dificuldades dentro do jogo é desmotivador.

Não há incentivo para os jogadores que começaram a jogar no modo hardcore, pois a única vantagem é  fazer achievements / mais pontos (normal) e ganhar mais pontos (hardcore). Contudo, você gasta mais recursos e leva mais tempo para acumular recursos e atingir o máximo potencial - necessário passar várias vezes a mesma fase para isso.
Além disso, no hardcore você precisa ficar ""farmando"" para acumular recursos suficientes e garantir que vai passar os chefes (principalmente o último, que é gigante). Só vale a pena pros players hardcore mais bitolados e que gostam de dar final várias vezes.

*Para quem pretende alcançar uma boa posição no Leaderboards, é preciso passar várias vezes o jogo para ter a chance de concorrer efetivamente.

Primeiro, você pega todas as mecânicas necessárias; depois, você pega os upgrades dentro das fases que não podiam ser  conquistados sem essas mecânicas; numa terceira etapa, você precisa garantir dinheiro suficiente para otimizar o seu conjunto de equipamentos.

The short answer for
""Is this game-update worth 5€?""-question
is simply ""Yes"".
Granted, this answer of mine is very biased
(especially due getting the ""Apollo Drone"" to pick up the scrap which is the the upgrading-currency in this game).

My personal ""Most Important selling points"":
This game is certainly more streamlined and not anymore menu-heavy when it comes to game-play in general, mainly because you don't have to fiddle with bombs or repair-kits:
These are now abilities in cooldowns
( though Repair-costing 100-scraps per use ).
""Triple Jump"" is also it's own ability which doesn't require any scraps nor it does have a cooldown. While you'll need to press a separate button, it's certainly more easier to pull off than ""bomb jump"" used to be.

It's however worth noting that the bosses have been reworked too, so they will certainly caught veteran-players off-guard during the several initial trial & error-sessions.


Mostly the same, some improvements, and little bit something new.
I personally enjoy this update more than I did enjoy the original-version.

This is a game that's clearly had a ton of work put into it, but suffers badly at the hand of poor design decisions. Most significantly, the controls are really really bad, owing mainly to the mouse-aim/keyboard move idea paired with complex key-combinations for executing some techniques that the game chooses to make necessary in so many different places. Having bad controls and then choosing to make the game primarily centered around performing ridiculous mid-air maneuvers every 2 seconds is not really conducive to a good gameplay experience. It just feels cheap and unrewarding. Adding the control pad support should have fixed this, but unfortunately it didn't. You have to use both thumbs to move and shoot, but a lot of the primary functions, like jumping, are on the thumb buttons, so you have to stop shooting to jump or use a special. Additionally, instead of letting the dash direction be controlled by the movement stick, they split it between the L/R bumpers, which is completely unintuitive and, again, just plain bad. It really is a deal-breaker.

The upgrade system seems like a decent idea until you realize that you not only have to find the upgrade item in the game, but you also have to spend currency on it. The currency is pretty ubiquitous, to the point that it sometimes literally rains from the sky (wtf), but you also spend it to activate your special moves, which is kind of stupid. 

The graphics are very high-quality. They're at or above the level of AAA games of this kind. There is some noisiness, though, that gets in the way of gameplay, such as foreground girders concealing the fact that the ceiling is suddenly lower, and you find out by trying to jump over an enemy attack only to find that you have no clearance.

The audio is also excellent, with an appropriate high-quality soundtrack accompanied by decent SFX.

In short, it's a game that's worth playing, but it's not worth spending $10 on. Not even by a long shot. 

If you can get it on sale then $5 is a maximum price. It's not a complete waste, but considering that one man can make a Cave Story in his spare time and release it for free, platformer designers should AT LEAST get together the gumption to make a game that can be controlled smoothly.

There are two different playable characters, and while their abilities, weapons, and stories differ, the levels are exactly the same. Some sections of the levels are easier for Ares, and more challenging with Tarus, and vice versa. This is especially true with chapter 3, which felt like a massive difficulty spike when playing with Ares, but was more like a natural difficulty progression for Tarus.

I played a small amount of the first A.R.E.S. game (maybe the first 3 chapters) so I cannot tell you if A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX is a vast improvement. The one thing that I did like was the simplification of the materials system. In the first A.R.E.S., there were three separate materials that would be dropped by enemies, which in turn could be used to craft upgrades to weapons as well as consumables like health packs and grenades. This was overhauled to feature just one material which was used to craft weapon and ability upgrades and also to use the new health ability.

That's what I said about the original A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda. That pretty much holds true for EX, but it seemed somewhat more difficult (or I was just being bad at it) and has been reworked to be a good bit longer, with two extra levels, more cutscenes, and a second character with different abilities who you can choose to play through the game with instead. So, basically it fixed all of my complaints.

Given that they're the same original asking price, I would obviously recommend picking this one up instead if you don't have either.

Gameplay: They've moved to 1 currency, essentially everything is now 1, so you have 1 higher cost instead of trying to farm a particular resource for your upgrades. Thats a positive... you now have to find unlocks to unlock your upgrades, thats a second plus... You get a new character thats like a heavy class/tank compared to the original character, and he plays... kinda meh. His special is a shield that uses up energy vs health...

Other changes is that you have infinite bombs/electrical blasts and they are on a CD. Repair kits are also on cooldown and have a 100 resource cost. All can be upgraded.

Graphics: Uh, I don't like what they did with the supporting cast, the characters and bosses look just as great, but what did they do to the women... its like they changed how they wanted them to look and they look awful. The gameplay is still as crisp and looks similar if not better than the original.

Controls: Yup, did you hate Ares, you'll hate this... love it... you'll love this... its not changed, and its still as wonky as when I played it the first time, jumping off the ends of ledges... good luck and do it early.

So that I've writen this game, if you haven't played the original, you may like what you see, if you have... I'd avoid this for awhile, its in a kinda crashy state in which you have to launch the game again nearly every level I think the changes they put forth are positive for the game, but the new levels aren't really impressive, and the new character while plays slightly different, continues to be similar to what you've done before.

Verdict: Pass, and if you want to get a version get the original for now... I might review once they patch all the crashy bugs... but I cannot honestly reccommend as of 10/4/14",1412463746,1412463746,False,65,1,0.731171190738677979,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Do you think letting players respawn a fucking meaningless sentence before each boss battle is enjoying? This game, although released in 2011, has learned nothing to the road of 2014 games, where respawning and checkpoints are at least upgraded as opposed to the old days.

No, this game instead tries to make you enjoy a terrifying experience by letting you die and die and die and you hardly are capable of learning anything new before having to do back route X to get to boss fight again. You end up wasting lots of time for nothing at all, nothing fun, nothing rewarding whatsoever.

The game's graphics are really top-quality in the genre, and the music is ok although becomes repetitive, just like the gameplay.

I unfortunatly have to thumb down this game, if not just for the fact that's it's a remake and it yet has one of the most frustrating gameplay flaws that none of the developers on the team have learned from the past. Just like we won't learn that war is a terrible thing, some gaming developers will never learn that checkpoints before an important something should, yes indeed, be played RIGHT BEFORE something important, not in front of a lift that wastes everytime 15 seconds if not more, seeing the same shit over and over again.

https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2

A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX is a 2.5D side scrolling game that feels like a fun mix between a dual stick shooter and Metroid. So far I am really enjoying this game. So far playing it on medium it has had its share of difficulty combined with enjoyable boss battles.
Here is a video of early game play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYImDmnkVjo&feature=youtu.be

The game really is in the vein of metroid in the whole being in a mechanical suit looking for upgrades thing. Also where the upgrades will unlock new areas that were previously unexplorable. Oddly enough I have recieved a few upgrades and have yet to seen an effect on my person.

This is not just a run and gun type game either. There are several parts that include tough timing jumps and multiple button pushes. If not you will fall to your death often like myself. I don't know if I like the dieing over and over when the main part of the game is a 2.5D gunner. So far I recommend this game but in a way it is still up in there air and will report back as I get in deeper to the game.

Pros 
The controls feel responsive and right.
The artwork is great.
I don’t have to play with the music turned off.
The story so far is actually engaging. 
Character ability upgrades keep things fresh.
Checkpoints are nice kinda forgot about them with all the roguelikes out.

Cons
Things you kill come back once they are off screen kinda annoying.
Though as nails when it come to timing jumps and not always in a good way.
Tons of upgrades but some seem to do nothing.
Hope I dont have to do a second playthough just to collect the power ups but seems that way.

Quick edit here. There is a talent tree in game where you can upgrade all your moves and weapons armor ect. This is not covered in the tutorial and I found out about it by accedent. This added a lot of depth to the game. This is a great deal at $10 buck and I recommened it highly. You will get more than 10 hours of game play out of it for sure.
