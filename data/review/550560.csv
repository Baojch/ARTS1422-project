Each stage features a short scene in which there's some variation of 1) pressing arrow buttons before time runs out, and 2) performing untimed arithmetic using the numbers/operations you've clicked on during the course of the scene to arrive at an often-randomized target number within a specific number of turns.  Both types of gameplay were enjoyable, although I wasn't too good at either one -- particularly the arrow gameplay when you were occasionally required to memorize a short sequence and execute it from memory in a very short period of time. 

Overall I really enjoyed my time with this game - particularly the characters and voice acting - and it was always a good feeling when I was able to get through a stage on my own without an Excel spreadsheet (I'm not the greatest with basic math). I'm sad to see there hasn't been a sequel since the game ended with ""to be continued,"" but that doesn't detract from the experience I had with this game.",1675132672,1675132672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The game tells a simple and lighthearted story about a little girl named Chilie, who lives an adventure on a strange camper with her friend in an imaginary China.
The mechanics are pretty intuitive: watch beautiful animated scene, react fast in order to pass the Quick-Time-Events and solve easy mathematical puzzles (finding the operands, scattered all around the ambients!). A ""tiny"" masterpiece!

P.S.: play it when you want to calm yourself. Put on your headphones and press start... This is a cure-all for your soul... :)",1480036205,1511397051,True,0,0,0.459123224020004272,0,False,False,False,False,,,

+ The gameplay is very enjoyable. Basically you watch animated cutscenes while doing quick time events, and a math problem during each scene. 
+ Very amusing characters. The main character ""Chilie"" is a young girl who loves peppers, and makes all sorts of crazy noises and faces with her guardian as she searches for her mother.
+ Very sppealing unique visual style 
+ The math puzzles can be quite challenging at times. Basically you have to reach a number in a certain number of actions using addition / subtraction / multiplication / division but have a limited number of choices. Hard to explain in writing, but later on in the game these puzzles will make you think.

- Throughout each scene there are various numbers you can click on which will help make the math puzzles a bit easier. The numbers you find are random each time you play a scene, so sometimes you find numbers that will make the puzzle super easy, while other times it feels seemingly impossible. ( You can skip the puzzles, but I felt like I needed to solve them )",1479915913,1479916152,True,12,0,0.598256826400756836,1,False,False,False,False,,,
