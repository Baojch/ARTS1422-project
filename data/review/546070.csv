My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1709593701,1709593701,True,2,1,0.525658845901489258,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This is a simple application that lets you place low poly/minimalist ""flowers"" into a pot.  It's not a very useful software application, but that's all it is. 

For those unfamiliar with what actually makes something a game, a ""game loop"" describes the interaction and feedback a gamer has when playing a game.  Tetris, for example, has a game loop where a random block appears, the gamer interacts with the block to position it, and then the game decides if that finishes a row or not, increases the players score if any rows were completed, then gives the gamer another block to position.  Counter-Strike has a game loop where a player seeks another player, tests their skill against that player by shooting them or being shot, the computer rewards the player if they win, and then if the player survives, they repeat that loop.  There's no loop here, no true interactive feedback.  It simply is not a game, it cannot be ""played"".

This has misleadingly been launched in the ""Games"" section of Steam instead of the ""Software"" section. This is a common mistake for developers who are new to Steam, or don't understand the difference between games and software which isn't a game.  It seems this software published incorrectly as a game is simply lack of experience/knowledge of the correct process.

Here's a link for the process to publish non-game software on Steam:

[url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=925]Steam Developer Help With Software Publishing[/url]

It's unfortunate this process was not known about/followed, resulting in a software application being published in the wrong place.

Publishing things which aren't games on Steam in the Games section as games is misleading to gamers and somewhat harmful, because it pollutes the Steam marketplace and takes away visibility and market exposure for genuine game developers who do the right thing and make games for gamers.

There are no gameplay loops in this software, no ""gameplay"", no meaningful game like interaction. It's a software application and as such has no merits as a video game for gamers.

My first shock of annoyance came when I realized you have to buy the flowers/pots with points that you get from selling your arrangements. No where did I see any mention of this. You can't just while away the hours creating what you want because you might not have enough shopping points.

There are no directions, tutorials, guides, etc. and many things I simply could not, and have not, figure out. Sometimes I get options on the sides to adjust my flowers/pots, other times they are not there and I do not know why nor how to get them back. I've tried clicking on everything to no avail.

The garden is a mystery to me. I am unsure what to do there, how to decorate it, etc.

I couldn't even figure out how to exit the game for the first few plays! (you have to go into the garden and hit ESC).

Man beginnt mit 3 Punkten.

This game is for people who want to make something gorgeous. It's not up to the standards of a floral designer, nor is it up to the standards of your average gamer. But it's relaxing and easy to play. I immediately found myself trying to figure out how to make concepts that I already had planned out. 

The points system and game progression? Useless.
There game's art? Cute, and simple.
Soundtrack? Not annoying.

Overall I would recommend this for people who liked Viridi, even though it's not as good. I'd like to spend more time on this game in the future, just hanging out making bouquets of flowers. A good wind down from the crazy games I'm used to.

[h1]For a game about designing, that's exactly what this lacks...[/h1]

[i]Flower Design[/i] is a sandbox game created by the developer of [i]Plankton[/i] and [i]Jellyfish[/i] where you design flower arrangements...unfortunately, the developer has decided NOT to explain everything and to leave it up to you to figure out.  You can't tell what's locked, what's unlocked, and what you can use free of charge.

There is no point in actually arranging the flowers aside from your own pictures.  All that appears to matter is that you have enough flowers in your vase to amass a maximum of about 15-25 points per vase.  Achievement-wise, all you need to do is use each flower at least once...nothing to it.  There's also a ""Garden"" mode, which I have no idea what to do in it...so I'm guessing it was a rushed project.

Can I honestly recommend [i]Flower Design[/i]?  Not at all unless you just want to take pictures of your custom flower arrangements...though I think the real deal would probably be more fun.  Achievements are easy and the replayability is low.  You should be done in less than 30 minutes with this one.

[h1]TL;DR（不过希望能看一下结尾关于作者的一些信息）：[/h1]

[h1]4/10[/h1]

[h1]优点：[/h1]
+创意很好

[h1]缺点：[/h1]
-UI十分简陋
-花卉和花盆的建模相当粗糙
-失败的系统设计大大降低了游戏的可玩性（反复快速买卖十几分钟即可买齐全部花卉解锁全部成就）
-作为一款Unity引擎游戏几乎等于没有优化（插上几十朵花以后竟然会卡得失去响应）
-花园系统完全没有卵用，严重怀疑是作者实践自己兴趣的试验场
-作为插花游戏花卉种类太少（十二种花，对应十二个成就，此外还有三个其实本质上没什么区别的花盆）
-不错的创意被执行得极其糟糕

第一次见到Flower Design这款游戏还是在很长时间以前，当时看了封面和简介（事实证明不看宣传片和截图是严重的错误），被其插花的主题打动了，于是加入了愿望单，正巧这次STCN的短评活动有这游戏，于是开开心心申请下来，然而打开游戏的几分钟后，满怀期待想体验插花艺术的我就知道自己对这款游戏想错了。

刚打开游戏，主界面之简陋便吓到了我，然而抱着主界面这种东西说明不了什么游戏内容才是干货的心态，我还是义无反顾地进入了游戏，随后受到了更大的惊吓…
正式进入游戏后，首先是选花和花盆，可以概括为：开局一个盆，剩下全靠扭；开局一枝花，剩下全靠买。点击盆或花切换焦点，可以分别对二者进行多项参数的调整（也可直接在物体上拖动进行调整，不过精确性要差了很多），只是这个UI简陋的让人实在无法想象这竟然是一款以插花为主题的游戏…（虽然商店页面的截图上有文字，但是游戏中实际并没有能方便添加文字的选项）而由于建模实在过于粗糙，因此开口花盆基本没法看…

游戏的基本机制就是插花---卖花---买花---继续插花这样的循环，然而这个系统设计得实在是过于粗糙，经过简单测试后发现，售卖系统的价格完全取决于你插的花的数目和所插花的价值，与你为了美观所做的调整（也是插花的本来意义所在）完全没有半毛钱关系，比如简单粗暴插上一排相同高价格花卉，轻轻松松25点走起（例如每朵4点，插上7朵即可到达上限25点），游戏里最强（gui）花盆+所有花各插一朵，最后售卖所得同样为上限25点

这么一个可以说是毫无意义的系统设计和激励机制，使得游戏的可玩性大大的降低，毕竟能被游戏内容吸引来的用户多半是冲着插花这一主题而来，而可供选择的花卉只有十二种，使得玩家在所有花卉种类解锁后（全部买齐只需要几分钟，可以说是成就党的福音了）便失去了游戏的乐趣（花盆有三种可供解锁，但鉴于花盆可供调整的参数，基本等同于同一个），且游戏虽可以调整包括光照和场景在内的诸多参数，但却没有给玩家一个更好的拍照系统来分享自己的作品，只能F12截图，（这个建模粗糙的程度也使得截出来的作品图毫无美感可言）

游戏中还加入了一个毫无卵用的Garden系统，屏幕正下方莲花一样的东西并不是花…而是个控制面板…点开以后可以选择建筑组件，表面植被之类的材质，以及一些小装饰品，操作逻辑也是拖拽拉伸，编辑功能上提供了擦除和撤销，为了解决视角问题采用了拖拽这个控制面板进行视角变换的操作逻辑，虽然很别扭但好歹还是能用的，只是…这整个Garden系统完全让人摸不着头脑不知有何卵用，只能理解为是作者出于自己对生成艺术的兴趣而打造的试验场了。

[h1]总结：[/h1]
作为一款以插花为主题的游戏，Flower Design有着很棒的创意，本应是一款带着些许禅意，让人能放空于其中真正放松的作品，如果是单纯的提供丰富的花卉，场景，容器种类，实现更精准的目标定位，让玩家可以专著于享受插花艺术本身上，并辅以其它元素烘托气氛，例如在插花时播放恰到好处的BGM，加入一些随机事件，跳出来几句或蕴含哲理或藏着俏皮的台词之类的小彩蛋，那么也许它可以成为像Mountain一样的佳作（至少成为小众邪典233），可惜作者忽略了游戏名字里Design这个要素，而将其做成了更具德国血统的Flower Simulator，用不符合游戏主题的系统设计将这份本该有的情趣毁的一干二净，这不得不说是一件憾事。

不过值得一提的是，从游戏的成品效果上能看出作者也是游戏开发的新手（仅指游戏开发这一方面），因此也许在某些方面的处理上也是心有余而力不足，最后只能拿出这样一件简陋的成品，这不免让人好奇，如果作者的技术水平有所提升，是不是能带来一款更符合我们期待与想象的作品呢？巧的是就在三天前作者新作的Steam页面刚刚上线，并且将于一个月后解锁Early Access版本，其游戏内容换成了盆景（看来作者对这类题材真是相当有爱233~），从商店页面的宣传片和截图来看，这次的效果显然要比Flower Design好的多，如果一个月后发布的成品质量能与此相符合，那还是乐意支持一发的（怎么这么像广告噗）。

至于Flower Design这作，还是要客观地给个差评，如果不是入了IG的包并且HH，那么还是不推荐购买的。

[h1]P.S.  附上作者的新作和其在一些相关网站的个人页面（Steam页面上的宣传截图也是作者发布在其上的艺术作品）[/h1]
其实看了这些信息以后感觉大概能理解作者的心态，想必作者开发本作是出于自己对生成艺术的热爱，因此打造了这么一个小游戏（对作者本人来说更像是工具，里面的系统应该是为了让这工具更像游戏而加，只可惜起到了相反的作用），只是既然是面向市场，那么就不能只满足于自己的需求，而要更多考虑玩家想要的是什么，希望作者在明白这点后能做出既能让自己用着顺手又能让玩家玩的开心的工具/游戏吧。

看到开发商和发行商大概是作者名字后随手google的，从名字和后面Pixels主页上所标记的坐标北京看貌似是同胞？不过很长时间没更新了，前面的推文也没耐心翻，有兴趣的玩家可以自行翻阅看有没有有趣的信息

[h1]Pixels主页：[url=https://pixels.com/profiles/guojun-pan.html]https://pixels.com/profiles/guojun-pan.html[/url][/h1]
从这里能看出作者对生成艺术的着迷，如果Flower Design这作能体现出这样的效果，那质量必然会大大提升。

Désolée mais non, je ne trouve ça ni amusant, ni interressant, ni rien du tout. 

Prenez un pot destiné à y recevoir des fleurs, déformez le pour rendre son aspect plus original mais ce avec bien du mal car l'interface et les outils qui nous sont fournis ne sont pas faciles d'utilisation. 
Puis choisissez des brins de verdure qu'il faudra acheter (grace à des points), ou des fleurs, mettez le tout dans le pot afin de réaliser votre composition (tant bien que mal car ça ne se place pas forcément comme vous en auriez envie). Et pour finir vendez le tout pour obtenir des points et ainsi acheter d'autres variétés.

Il y a un petit bonus : le jardin où vous pouvez exposer vos créations et vous promener pour les admirer et vous détendre.

Franchement l'interface d'utilisation est plutôt hasardeuse, il y a pas mal de bugs de texture, et il faudra créer beaucoup de compositions pour obtenir des points et acheter les variétés plus chères.

Je pourrais tout aussi bien créer ce genre de compositions florales en utilisant un logiciel de dessin, ce serait de une plus facile et plus joli et de 2 moins contraignant tout en procurant la même sensation...

Je ne recommande pas ce ""logiciel"" ou ""simulateur"", ""machin truc"" qui est tout sauf un jeu amusant.

The player can select a background, and the related lighting and shadows. At first, I considered that this might be a detriment for appealing to the more impatient of today’s gamers. To actually REQUIRE numerous finished arrangements to be “sold” into the game, to collect game currency in order to access more pots and plants? Would players be willing to wait, and work, to produce more elaborate arrangements, after starting off with possibilities so simple and basic?

But what the DEV has actually done is to give the arranger/player a valuable tool for understanding and appreciating this ancient art. A successful arrangement has nothing to do with the number of items, or the complexity of the finished project. While there may never be a “perfect” arrangement, an arrangement of a single flower, fern or leaf can as closely approach perfection as may an elaborate one, and that is the lesson this DEV very respectfully trusts the player to come to understand (if they don’t begin the game that way.)

Not only is the player required to start minimally (which places the focus on the positioning, color, size and contrast between each and all items), but as players collect currency from “selling” completed arrangements, each player must decide which is to be acquired next. A pot? A flower? An accessory plant? It’s rare to see a DEV take such a risk, and presume that players wish to not only experience a “game” such as this, but to “grow” as an arranger, as does the quantity of components they have access to within the game. For a DEV to create the means for a player to produce their own artistic growth, as they do the same within the game, is quite remarkable.

FLOWER DESIGN is something unusual, and in fact almost unique in computer gaming; something intended to create calm and peace, beauty and contentment. A game with no losing possible, and every attempt as a winning effort. I dare say that there will be those that may be like me; unable to create art or beauty in ANY form, that will find something creative in FLOWER DESGN that they have searched for throughout much of their lives. And for less than $2, I see no way to fail.

(DISCLOSURE: Since the release of this project the DEV has become a friend. I like to think that has nothing to do with my appreciation for his game, and in fact I acquired FLOWER DESIGN through purchase, the same as most players.)",1505020361,1505020361,True,44,0,0.788800716400146484,10,False,False,False,False,,,

Starting out the interface I wasn't sure how to proceed, there is no tutorial or help to get you started. Natural curiousity and clicking on everything within a few minutes and you figure out how to unlock new plants and designs. I'm not sure if this is an early beta, but it's a good game so far. I've been mass clicking plants and pots to make quick money to unlock more flowers and planter pots. Look forward to really exploring how far you can push the plant designs.

- Good Music, is relaxing.
- Plants are good, get yourself a digital green thumb.
- Few games help you relax, this one might after you figure it out.
- You can modify pretty much everything.
- Developer is still adding elements & features.
- Has achievements.

[u]Con's[/u]
- UX/UI needs a little love.
- Lack of control - Maybe there is a way to arrange the plants in the pot, but I haven't figured it out yet.
- Achievements maybe too simple, got all of them in less than 20 minutes.

It includes customizations for almost everything, the flowers size, pot, pose, colors, petals, and more. When you ""sell"" your arrangement it shows your plant grow from seeds with a little firework show, and you gain points to buy different flowers and pots to design your next arrangement.

If you like flowers or like artistic indie games, I would recommend this. It's a very calm and relaxing game.

UPDATE 2019: Flower Design now includes a new feature you can find in the menu called the garden that allows you to create a full landscape in a sandbox garden mode. You can create structures, plant flowers, grow plants, fountains, paths, stairs, color objects, and more. The UI is very original for it. The garden is very relaxing and calming and i'm glad I came back to check out this new content.",1484356440,1557114225,True,7,0,0.540374338626861572,1,False,True,False,False,,,

ただそれだけ。
ただゲームがセーブされないのでポイントを０からまた貯めないといけない・・早期アクセスだから？かな

人を選ぶゲームだと思いますがキレイなデザインができた時はついスクショを撮りたくなるそんなゲームです。

花的种类不多，但是选择方式上也让人纠结，不可以用键盘快速操作，单单是鼠标操作的话，屏幕两边的选择按钮也不是很方便操作，在频换切换花朵的过程中消磨了过多的耐心。加个序号选择按钮应该不错。
游戏性不足但是作为设计类小游戏的话又显得有些单调。但是真的很喜欢这个游戏类型。


对简介图中的花表示佩服 [strike] 耐心很重要	[/strike]

游戏的玩法有点像以前玩的那个制作陶器的手游，
先用最基本的材料制作，然后出售作品，获得钱/点数，去购买高级的材料，重复……
不过这个的游戏性明显不太强，你的选择其实基本上都是限定了的。
而且一旦开始为了点数而刷刷刷之后，对游戏的兴趣也会骤减。
而且对于一个模拟插花的游戏来说，点选也只能用鼠标操作我觉得是不太方便的，建议之后可以加入用方向键选择原材料。
休闲上比不上Viridi，沙盒方面也没真正体现出来。

讲道理，我为什么要写这么多，
因为是朋友送的啊！我要认真对待！
