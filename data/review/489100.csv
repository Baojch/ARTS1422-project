操作很简单，左右移动+空格开火，向上好像可以加速，但是想玩的好就很难了。
玩家控制一个小灰机朝前飞，并且躲避或者击毁各种穿过各种障碍...
玩两下就厌倦了，主要是不喜欢一直刷同样的场景同样的任务···

Don't mistake this game with a real racing game. This is just a short buggy tech demo, that looks good only on the trailer and if you wanna play a real futuristic racer try Redout or better WipeOut.

im going to give some pros. and cons.

pros 
great first few ships
good  race way
nice luncher but wish there was a blur start up 

cons 
at the moment there is no options to lurn 
contruls, or to change any settings


other than that this game is worth the price if you like planes.
8/10
