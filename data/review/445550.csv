Заброшенная в раннем доступе детективная история на Rpg Maker... Разработчик выпустил только один эпизод и забил... Игра движется линейно, боев нет, свободы действий тоже... Нам только нужно по четкому сценарию игры двигаться в нужном направлении перемещаясь по нескольким локациям... Графика в игре стандартная, ничего своего разработчики в игру не добавили... И вроде бы тогда надо вытягивать на сюжете, но нет... Моего английского хватило на перевод всех диалогов до куда дошел и это не интересно...

[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is one of those nice little games you sometimes stumble on and feel quite lucky you did.. Because these kinds of games tend to amazingly surprise, entertain and catch you in their storyline. [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] has all of these features : 
- it's an astonishing game,
- it has a fairly enjoyable gameplay and pace, 
- it has an entirely immersive intrigue.
It may be still in early access, it's quite well developped as it is. No annoying bugs. Achievements are unlocking adequately. 

[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is a decent little adventure game, in the detective field, putting the RPGMaker softwares to a good use.
The storyline is intriguing. The way the main character learns things leaves room for suspense till the end of the game. 

The gameplay is good.. During the inquiry you'll fastly travel by cab through the city where the events take place, preventing you from the feeling of eternal back and forth. 
The game pace is fine, going along with the development of the plot. 

This is supposed to be the 1st episode , if I understand. 
As a matter of fact the game feels a bit short. The end comes rather abruptly.. leaving the gamer waiting for more, impatiently waiting for a kind of sequel.

The basic idea of [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is excellent, the plot/storyline is tricky and the game developpement very promising... 
Let's hope [b]Retro Warp Gaming[/b] the developping/editing team will be able to get back on the tracks of this encouraging game and give it its due sequel..  Meanwhile, thumb up !",1520079350,1520104250,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It is definitely worth playing and worth finishing (playing to the end and getting all the achievements). 

The only thing that bothers me is the ""finish episode 1 in less than 40 min."" achievement. 
You can get this achievement if you skip all dialogues - but that ruins all the experience of the game, because if you don't follow the plot then it's just another RPG maker game where you move around and constantly click next on dialogues.

This isn't my cup of tea, so to speak, but I'm reviewing the game, not the genre.

Watson's Watch is a JRPG-styled indie game. It is short (I started and finished it in the same stream, and the always-onscreen clock in the corner showed me that it took 75 minutes.) Contributing to the shortness is that the game is very linear. There's really only one straight-path like route through the game... in that sense, it's really more of an interactive fiction than a traditional game; while it's true you can go where you please (among possible destinations), the story only unlocks in a ""follow the bread crumbs"" manner. This is where it becomes not my cup of tea... I am much more into games with a modicum of freedom. However, some people just want a good story, and that's the strength of Watson's Watch.

The player character is a detective staying at a hotel in town. A mystery is soon presented, and the first episode is about putting that puzzle together. For what it is, it's a good game. If a story is what you're after, and you're a fan of JRPGs, then Watson's Watch just may be for you. At the very least, with its price point, you could do far worse. I will amend this review when Episode 2 comes out, and I have seen more of the story.

PROS:
  Strong story, with a number of plot twists.
  Simple and easy to run (if your computer is reading this, it can run it.)
CONS:
  Very linear.
  No options at all (the ability to change the volume level of the music would be nice, although I suspect that lack of that is to set the mood and tone. However, the ability to change the game resolution would have been very welcome.)

Ultimately, the downsides of this game are not enough to outweigh the benefits, which is why I recommend this if the genre appeals to you. Enjoy your stay in Watson's Watch!",1469104543,1469104543,True,5,1,0.58363717794418335,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I'm trying to balance out the fact that there is a lot of progress to be made while still providing constructive criticism. To sum up my thoughts in one sentence: Watson's Watch needs work, but it has several promising elements that make me want to see more. For further details, please keep reading!

I had never heard of Watson's Watch until I saw it in an IndieGala bundle. Being the sucker I am for RPGMaker games, I happily kept it. At the time of purchasing it, Watson's Watch had no reviews. Thus, I put it high on my priority list of games to play so I could help people decide whether it is worth picking up or not. It only has one episode released so far out of three, so everything I write here is based on this first episode.

Watson's Watch is a mystery game that focuses on storytelling. There is no combat, nor does your character have stats at all. I didn't go in expecting any, and it suits me just fine. If you want a ""typical"" RPG with turn-based battles and such, you're in the wrong place. If you're interested in a fairly good story with some intriguing elements, it ought to suit you well.

To avoid spoilers, here's a bare-bones summary. You play as a detective (who you get to name) that is on vacation in a town called Watson's Watch. Except work never takes a break, because while he's staying in a hotel, he learns people in Watson's Watch have gone missing. Suspecting foul play, he takes on the case, and it's your job to lead him in the right direction.

The mystery elements are good. It kept me wanting to know what twists and turns would occur. Watson's Watch is a strange town that serves as an effective setting. The answers that come forth are not as clear-cut as one might first believe. The story leaves off in episode one at an effective cliffhanger point. I am a bit puzzled as to why some of the bigger plot twists were revealed in episode one, but I trust that they are needed for the remaining two episodes.

One thing that bugs me, though, is that you don't do a lot of detective work. Let me compare this to the Ace Attorney series for a better example. In Ace Attorney games, you can go to multiple scenes and interact with people in different orders, find clues at your own pace, and take different routes to the same outcome. In Watson's Watch, you have a linear path that can only be deviated from a limited amount of times. I don't mind a railroaded plot if it makes sense. However, you are working as a sleuth. It was weird to me that there really wasn't much exploring, especially with so few places to visit. Honestly, this might be one of the biggest flaws for this game to have, given what type it is.

On a higher note, the characters are done well overall. The protagonist has more to him than meets the eye. There are different traits to each person that define them for who they are. Even the cab driver has his own quirks. Yet some of the actions these characters take are a bit strange. I can't go into much further detail without spoiling it, but there is one especially odd choice at the end of the game that left me scratching my head. Luckily, that's what early access is for. I plan to bring some of these concerns up in the forums with a proper spoiler-warning title.

The dialogue could use some work. Some of it feels a bit disjointed. There are spelling and grammar errors all over the place, but I still understood everything. I would normally be a lot harder on those kinds of errors, especially in a story-driven game, but the developers have said they are working on fixing these. Since they have said that and it is an early access game, I'm more understanding of it in this circumstance.

Speaking of the developers, they are friendly and responsive. I reported a bug and they fixed it swiftly. They seem dedicated to the project and eager to hear player feedback. That goes a long way in my mind. I appreciate developers that seek constructive criticism and that pour their hearts into their works. That kind of passion is in Watson's Watch, which is one reason I am enthusiastic about where this game will go.

All that being said, the cost of the game is still pretty high. It took me two hours or so to beat the first chapter of Watson's Watch. If all the other chapters are going to be that length, we're looking at about six hours total. A two-hour RPGMaker game would have to have something truly spectacular to warrant a $7.99 price tag. When the entire thing is released, I'd say that it's still a tad bit high, but more acceptable. I was quite pleased with it as a bundle purchase, but I would have felt ripped off if I poured the full price into it. At least, I would have felt ripped off at this stage of the game. It will supposedly cost the same amount when the final version is out, so that might be justified.

Graphics-wise, everything looked fine to me. I don't know much about common RPGMaker assets so I can't say if they're overused or not. It ran smoothly beyond that bug I mentioned, which has already been fixed. The controls are simple. However, you can't sprint. That really, really bugged me. A lot of RPGMaker games let you run, and that would have made it less tedious to check some areas for further clues. There were some oddities (apparenlty you can walk on water!), but nothing that got more than a shrug from me.

Other than an items list, you also have a journal. That's useful for keeping tabs on where you need to go and getting some insight in what the protagonist is thinking. It's a good combination for a game like this. The journal does assist a bit in the railroading, though, so I'm torn on whether I think it's good in its current state or could use some alterations.

There are four achievements present, with two being automatic to find and two being more out of the way. I like that ratio, and they were a nice touch. Apparently there will be trading cards added at some point. It would be nice, but it's not necessary by any means.

In conclusion, I like a lot of what Watson's Watch does. If this version was the final product and was selling on Steam for this price, I would probably not recommend it, much as I enjoyed playing it. However, for an early access version with promised improvements and two more chapters coming, I encourage those interested in the game to pick it up, play it, and weigh in your recommendations to the developers.
