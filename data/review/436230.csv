Heads up; I was playing on the medium difficulty and never experienced nausea, so that may skew my experience from yours.

I just cant recommend this. I spent 3 greuling hours in this game and only made it to level 2. The gameplay elements seem to fight against each other. Why would you make me explore vast empty space when the control scheme is best when in complex indoor spaces? Why do I have to worry about fuel and oxygen when I'm already overwhelmed with not getting lost for the hundredth time? why are there boost rings around when my suit boost works just fine. And also, can I please have a map or hud markers with station names? I don't care about immersing myself in the feeling of being lost in space, there's nothing to do out here but float and die of asphyxiation. 90% of space is like empty space! that's why its called space!

Perhaps there's better gameplay several hours further in, but making progress to that point has been so tedious. Every time I get back to open space I just feel a wave of dread as I have to float around and hope I can read the devs minds and figure out where they want me to go.

Detached ist ein schwieriger Fall. Mit seinen grundlegenden Mechaniken macht es vieles richtig, denn wenn man sich mal an eine der Steuerungsmethoden und die Besonderheiten der Schwerelosigkeit gewöhnt hat, kann sich die Bewegung durch das All ziemlich elegant und gut anfühlen. 
Das Spiel kommt dabei jedoch nicht an die Klasse eines Lone Echo heran, was unter anderem daran liegt, dass wir in Detached keine nutzbaren Hände besitzen. Das bedeutet: Kein Abstoßen von Objekten, kein Entlanghangeln an Geländern und generell ein weniger interaktives All. Im Rahmen dieser Grenzen funktioniert die Bewegung aber immer noch gut. Auch ohne virtuelle Hände wird neben dem Gamepad das Handtracking von VR-Controllern unterstützt. So erlaubt es eines der Steuerung-Setups, mit der Bewegung des rechten Controllers im Raum Momentum aufzubauen, um uns im Spiel in alle Richtungen zu drehen. Ich habe mit Oculus Touch gespielt.

Haben wir die gewünschte Position erreicht, können wir diese durch Tastendruck fixieren - zumindest auf der mittleren der drei Komfortstufen. 
Auf niedrigstem Komfortniveau müssen wir mit den Schubdüsen das Momentum wohl manuell ausgleichen, während bei ""höchstem"" Komfort gar kein Momentum über die Zeitspanne des Schwungholens aufkommt. Ich kann nur empfehlen, sich Zeit zu nehmen, um zu Spielbeginn im Tutorialraum ein bisschen mit den Einstellungen zu experimentieren. Mit meinem anfangs gewählten Setup kam ich zum Beispiel gar nicht klar, wohingegen oben erwähnte Einstellungen für mich sehr gut funktioniert haben.

[b]Die Nadeln im Sternhaufen[/b]
Um in die Kampagne starten zu können, müssen wir erstmal in den Optionen das Tutorial deaktivieren - eine der nicht ganz seltenen Momente, in denen sich Detached etwas holprig anfühlt. Wurde diese Hürde überwunden, erzählt uns das Spiel eine schmale Geschichte von zwei Abenteurern, die in einem abgelegenen und aufgegebenen System auf der Suche nach wertvollen Hinterlassenschaften der Abbaufirmen sind. Dann geht das Schiff zu Bruch, wir werden von unserem Partner getrennt und müssen Maßnahmen einleiten, um uns aus unserer misslichen Lage zu befreien.
Großteils bedeutet das, in einem Wirrwarr von Trümmern und Gestein Gebäude ausfindig zu machen, in denen Systeme hochgefahren werden müssen. Aufgabenmarkierungen gibt es nur in ausgewählten Fällen während Missionen, aber nicht bei der freien Erkundung. Das macht die Suche nach den Zielen im Weltraum, in dem es bekanntlich kein Oben und Unten gibt, nicht gerade einfach. Doch noch besser: Oft braucht es im All verstreute Nands, die wie Batterien in die Systeme eingesetzt werden und natürlich nochmal deutlich kleiner ausfallen als die Gebäude. 
Wir finden auch Sauerstoff und Treibstoff, denn das geht uns nach einer Weile beides aus. Zumindest ersterer wurde einige Male knapp, wenn ich das All mal wieder akribisch nach einem verbleibenden Nand abgrasen musste. Oder als ich einmal scheinbar über die Levelgrenze geschwebt bin und ohne Vorwarnung in Sekundenschnelle meinen komplette Luft ausgesaugt bekommen habe.   

Das klingt frustrierend und so war es regelmäßig auch - gerade, weil die Checkpoints rar und teils komisch gesetzt sind. Doch da sich die Bewegung durch das All gut angefühlt hat, habe ich die Herausforderung angenommen und die Erfolgserlebnisse waren es dann doch wert. 
Dazu gibt es abseits des erwähnten Suchfokuses auch noch eine solide Anzahl an Umgebungsrätseln und Action-Sequenzen, die gerne unsere Körperphysik einbeziehen und Gebrauch vom in den Anzug verbauten Schild, Raketenwerfer sowie Geschwindigkeitsboost machen. Diese Sequenzen finden oft in engen Innenräumen statt und sorgen für einen willkommenen Pacing- und Gameplaywechsel. Teilweise sind sie aber ziemlich schwer und erfordern es, sich richtig gut mit dem Bewegungssystem zurechtzufinden. Jep, damit steht und fällt in Detached echt alles!

[b]Losgelöst im All[/b]
Nochmal kurz zurück zur Story: Wo der Beginn noch ganz nett inszeniert ist, scheint den Entwicklern in dieser Hinsicht schnell das Geld und/oder die Lust ausgegangen zu sein. Dialoge sind spärlich und das Writing teilweise schrecklich. Dazu fallen Erklärungen zum aktuellen Geschehen so mangelhaft aus, dass ich gegen Ende der etwa fünfstündigen Kampagne gar nicht mehr wusste, was hier eigentlich geschieht. Naja, holprig.
Technisch macht Detached einen runderen Eindruck. Wo es an Effekten mangelt, sieht das Spiel trotz im Detail etwas sterilen Objekten immer noch stimmungsvoll aus. Gerade die Weltraumpanoramen mit ihrem schicken Licht und der gekonnt zusammengestellten Collage an Weltraumschrott und Felsen können beeindrucken. Unterlegt wird das von einem tollen Soundtrack von Mikolai Stroinski, der auch an den OSTs von The Witcher 3 und The Vanishing of Ethan Carter beteiligt war.

Detached verfügt auch über einen 1vs1-Multiplayer mit verschiedenen Modi. Ohne Absprache dürfte die Spielsuche aber schwierig werden. Ich habe den Multiplayer nicht wirklich ausprobiert. Viel Langzeitmotivation konnte ich hier auch nicht erkennen.

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/-8hQrJJeNKg

Detached is a zero-gravity space simulation game. It is hard-core. I quit playing this game about halfway through (I watched a full walkthrough). It's not a bad game per se, but it definitely has some negatives you have to overlook to enjoy this experience. 

The biggest negative is the control scheme(s). None of the different control methods felt good. You need to spend time in the game to get used to them. Even then, it feels like you're fighting the controls and it adds an artificial difficulty to the experience. The other big negative is the core gameplay loop. You're basically looking for tiny objects scattered around in the vastness of space all while having to keep an eye on your oxygen and fuel levels. If you take a wrong turn, you're almost certainly die. The problem is that you never know exactly where you're supposed to be going, except through trial and error. The game has random checkpoints, some that feel generous and others that feel punishing.

I really wanted to complete this game. It has gorgeous visuals. When you first look out and see all the space debris in the vastness of space, it is jaw-dropping. It also has several sections that are fun & challenging to play. I could imagine with a better control scheme it being very fun to navigate these ""courses."" Unfortunately, it isn't fun to have to re-do large sections of the game over and over until you master the controls.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, on high graphical settings and pixel density set at about 192, I was getting almost steady 90 fps with only a few drops / stutters here and there. Unfortunately, I did find that using motion controllers on the Oculus Quest 2 was not feasible. I had difficulties selecting menu items with my Touch controllers, so much so that I had to use an Xbox gamepad. I also found manuevering was much better using a gamepad. 

Game is beautiful, challenging, & has a great musical soundtrack. However, the controls & core gameplay loop kept me from wanting to continue playing this game. That's a shame, because there are epic moments in this game.

This is could be a Unreal Engine tech demo.  For a game based on movement and reaching places my 30 minutes was not fun at all. 
* Tunnel vision when moving is also ridiculous, you can only view when you are stationary. 
* Movement and control mostly in a straight line, frustrating.  No consideration for fun/realism balance.
* FOV Field Of View is restricted due to your head inside a visor. Cosmonauts on the ISS international Space Station has better FOV. 
* Movement consumes fuel. Point at a destination and give thrust, then correct your suit orientatation when moving. Consume fuel. Deal with tunnel vision and limited FOV during movement. FOV much less than  your VR headset.  I spent most of my 30 minutes searching for fuel and oxygen while trying to steer the space suit. Spending one hour mastering the controls may be fun in a flight sim, not here.
* Games are supposed to  be games first, balanced with realism. I can understand that there are people that would favor realism first, but is FUN?
* My 30 minutes was not fun, mainly consisted of searching for fuel and oxygen as it runs out too fast. Just as you get going struggling to master control movement a warning about oxygen depletetion sounds.
* Graphics: Beautiful, especially outside the station. The asteroids, planet rings. Easily one of the most beautiful looking VR games.  Unfortunately no fun to be had. It's a tech demo.
* Music atmospheric chilled space music just so happens what I listen to myself. Sound is minimal but there is to hear is good.  Many people forget importantance of good sound design because it can not be seen. Unconsiously sound has a huge influence. I rate excellent sound design above visuals.

Motion sickness
I'm pretty well practised with VR with over 200 hours logged, but the medium level simulation level was nauseating. 
Especially bad when you have a collision - which are not completely avoidable during a playthrough. It does state that it may cause nausea, but I wasn't expecting to get fully, rapidly spun around. That needs its own whole option in my opinion. Moving the player's view without their control is basically number 1 on the VR Don'ts list.
Also on medium control once you initiate a spin it doesn't stop until you hit brakes. There is FOV narrowing, but it was not strong enough for me to avoid some sickness. I didn't see a control for that, it should be presented at starting a new game.
I believe ""Arcade"" (the 'easy') mode is globally easier to control and has less unintended spin, but I haven't tried it yet. There is also a harder simulation mode, which I haven't tried.

Main menu only accepts input from one controller, and wasn't even showing my pointer until I randomly jabbed some buttons. 
Tutorials don't actually cover all the controls. ""Use activate"" it says when you're looking at a panel. OK? 
Then the modules you pick up you never get button prompts for those either. You're simply expected to know.

The lack of direction was worrying. The layout is pretty well designed; You go to the next place you can see, and you're going to the right way. Except you can see accelerators and they're *not* the right way until specific events. I have to assume that if you get off course, it could be very difficult to get back to the right place.

It missed out on so much, like instead of having thrusters, grabbing onto objects and flinging yourself for movement, or grabbing small items and interacting with them with no gravity would be awesome, but alas that will never happen.

Le jeu semble alterner entre exploration/puzzle et moments ""action"" et dans les deux cas cela tombe à plat. L'aspect explo est assez pénible car l'interface n'indique pas où aller, ni ne propose même de journal pour lire l'objectif en cours, ce qui serait ok si le level design suivait. Ce n'est malheureusement pas le cas et du coup on erre un peu au hasard le temps de trouver où est l'endroit où l'objectif souhaité ; ça reste ok car c'est joli et que les contrôles au touchpad sont funs, mais bon...

So I tried playing with keyboard, but the key mapping is terrible and you can't change it. So I tried playing with an xbox controller, and control was just very clunky anyway because it requires constant use of both sticks, the triggers, the bumpers, and pushing in on a stick just for the most basic navigation. Movement is very slow and just sucks out the potential for fun.

The game assumes everyone gets easily motion-sick, so every time you move it gives you super narrow tunnel vision with a black ring that jerks in and out to block all but the very center of your vision. You can't see what's going on to navigate around, and you can't adjust or turn off this ""feature"" in any setting I could find.

The helmet you're inside of is giant and doesn't track with your head, more like a claustrophobic spaceship cockpit. I found that it wouldn't stay straight so I was always looking out the wrong way. The game's HUD is on the glass right in front of you, so you'll be crossing your eyes to try and read the text that pops up five inches from your face. It would have been so easy to make it look just as if I had a holographic display in my helmet, I mean that's what VR is in the first place.

I didn't make it very far into the game to find out if the story gets uh, more engaging than the beginning. But it just wasn't playable with the controls and graphical choices the designers made.

- while changing the direction where character is facing it's like you're looking though a pipe. All around is darkened. This was most unpleasant

- there's almost no story

The developers saw Adrift and wanted to add guns, more oxygen, and more boost so that you're not a floating,desperate Steven Hawkings in space. The graphics are good and I like the controls. I did not get nauseous playing the game. When you rotate, the game limits your view angle which is nice. I can't say this for Adrift.

The issue I have is that the tutorial needs to be more clear about the controls somehow. I'm not sure how but I didn't initially understand that the left controller is to move, while the right is for rotation. Also didn't realize that you have to push the Track pad on the right controller. I actually stopped playing this for a while because I wasn't patient enough to figure things out for myself. The game doesn't hold your hand enough. Speaking of that, I also don't know where I'm supposed to go for mission objectives, I'm having to guess which kills the fun.

It seems like solid game, just not built for VR experience.

Pros:
This game gives a solid 'man in space' feel (as long as you do not look inside man made structures). Overal atmosphere is solid.

Cons:
1. Movement. You can't push yourself of surfaces, you can't use environment to decelerate, you can't attach yourself to surfaces. I might have a relatively high 'VR in space' movement standards, but I feel like these ones are definition of what movement in space should be like.
2. VR games in general tend to favor interactions with environment, in this game there are no VR-like interactions. You see container with oxygen - you look at it and press 'A', it just changes color to dark and your tank indicates that it got more gas. Items that you pick up with 'A' just disapear. You click on a panel and item appears. There are no on-screen buttons. Lack of interaction is notiecable and immersion breaking.
3. Controls. These are not controls for VR spacesuit, but controls made for keyboard and mouse that were mapped to controllers. While I agree with overal control type (you need to engage thrusters to rotate or move), I think controls (at least for oculus controllers) could have been done better.
4. Environment. Most structures do not give a feel of something made for space and do not add properly to environment. Lots of unused surfaces, bare walls and ceilings, most things are uselesly huge (I understand that spacesuit is large and need large passages, but not everything). Not enough 'fillers' be that toilets, tables, suit locker, equipment or whatewer else. Example: the most defining feature of airlock are two large screen (one with vent below) and how bare it is: no railings, no places to lock cargo, no ports where suits were supposed to connect their safeties or life support, no override ports or notiecable access hatches.",1588502552,1588506113,False,11,0,0.628022968769073486,0,True,False,False,False,,1588605814.0,"Hi andreykl, thank you for your valid feedback.

↑の潜水服ゲー同様に自分の首を振って見回せるのはメットのシールド部分から覗ける範囲のみ。それ以上はコントローラで宇宙服自体を旋回させろっていう操作なんだけど、なんせこっちは宇宙。前後左右上下にスライド移動できる上に、ヨー・ピッチ・ロールの回転ができる夢の6DoF完備。

段差に躓いてつんのめるあの原理で、なにかにぶつかるとぐりんぐりん視界が回る。錐揉み回転と振り向き回転のタッグ技でこられると、もう自分がどんな動きをしてるのかわからない。しかも宇宙なので一旦動き出したら止めない限り止まらない。プレイヤーのVR酔い耐性を測るベンチマークみたいだ。

やり始めの頃は顔を白と灰色に塗りたくった相撲好き悪魔が「ワハハハハ、お前も蝋人形にしてやろうか」の言い方で「お前もVR酔いにしてやろうか」って言ってる姿を幻視する勢いなんだけど、人間不思議なものでやってるとそれなりに慣れる。あくまでそれなりに。

メルトダウンするから3分以内にあそことここの冷却装置のボタン押してねみたいに言われると正気かよって思うけど、全自動で最適な逆噴射をかけて止まる慣性相殺ボタンがあるおかげで何度も再挑戦すればなんとかなるっちゃなる。

なのに精々4～5時間のゲームを普通にクリアするだけの実績のグローバル取得率が0.1％しかないのは、多分不親切でつまんないからだと思う。


主人公のいた宇宙船だか宇宙基地だかはバラバラに崩壊しており、重要施設も散逸しているため宇宙遊泳で各所を回って最低限の機能を復旧させて避難しようみたいな話なんだけど、誘導がまったくない。音声で指示をくれる相棒はいるけど、どこそこへ行ってあれをしろではなくて、たまたまできることがある場所にたどり着いたときに初めてそこでなにをしろとだけ言ってくるので、自分がどこを目指してるのかわからないまま彷徨う時間がかなりある。

多分お話的に相棒の方も主人公同様の被災者でかつ身動きが取れない状況なので、どこになんの区画があってどんな外見をしてるのか解ってないんだと思うけど、それにしたってすごい迷う。手近な恒星の方を前として、スタート地点の構造物を後ろとすると前後は決まる。でもそれじゃどこが上だか左だかわからない。上から右方面は探したからじゃあ残りは下経由で左方面かなーみたいな把握ができないので虱潰しも難しい。

それでいてどこの操作パネルも必ずでっかい電池4本で動いており、大抵1～2本、酷いのは4本とも外れている。なにかできそうな場所についたのに手持ちの電池が足りないので戻って探してこいが多発する。プレイ時間の大半はこの電池を探す時間。

なぜか絶対に一本ずつしか入っていないAmazonのダンボール並にスカスカな梱包の箱を求めて、あてもなく完全ノーヒントで宇宙を彷徨う羽目になる。やっと見つけたと思ったらさっき中身を抜いた空き箱だったりする。電池ボックスには蓋をつけろと、声を大にして言いたい。

As well, there's a timed reactor core mission where if you die, you have to repeat parts of the fetch quest, which is frustrating. About half of my play time is in this area...

ゲームについて。
このゲームには2つのパラメーターがある。
・1つ目は方向転換するために噴射する燃料。
・2つ目は自分が吸う酸素。
つまり、残量を管理しながら攻略しなければならない。
この２つのパラメーターがある事で緊張感がとてつもなく高い。

操作性について。
酔い軽減を０にすると圧倒的に酔う。
他のVRゲームの比ではないほど酔う。
ただ、視界が狭まることがなくなるので没入感は損なわれない。

グラフィックについて。
ロードの問題かもしれないが、テクスチャーの一部が荒い。（PC環境による可能性大）

You have a few controller schemes for each controller (keyboard, gamepad, touch controllers). Please check out if another one will be more comfortable for you. 

Being in helmet help reduce motion sickness, but it shouldn't cover more than 40% of the screen. If you have blinders in mind, this feature can also be disabled in-game menu. 

In terms of movement, - You can choose between two types of control. The arcade helps you get familiar with the steering (more assists like braking etc.). Simulation is just a wild ride, our attempt to reproduce the zero-g environment.

// Translated by Google


Vous avez quelques schémas de contrôleur pour chaque contrôleur (clavier, manette de jeu, contrôleurs tactiles). S'il vous plaît vérifier si un autre sera plus à l'aise pour vous.

Le port du casque aide à réduire le mal des transports, mais cela ne devrait pas couvrir plus de 40% de l'écran. Si vous avez à l’esprit les œillères, cette fonction peut également être désactivée dans le menu du jeu.

En termes de mouvement, - Vous pouvez choisir entre deux types de contrôle. L'arcade vous aide à vous familiariser avec la direction (plus d'assistance comme le freinage, etc.). La simulation n’est qu’un parcours sauvage, notre tentative de reproduire l’environnement zéro-g.

Thanks for your honest review. I will strict to the issue with the objective related to disabling satellites. 

Space is hard, and we decided not to guide players all the time. But, the location of the specific parts and upcoming objectives are placed in the position that can suggest players how to pass the space station in the best way possible (+ in the middle of the HUD you can see a small arrow that's navigating you). Of course, you can do it in your way, no problem with that! But for the specific tasks, you need advanced features of the EVA Suit like rockets, boost and shield. 

I assume that you unlocked the rocket module, but to pass this section without problems, you need speed module too. Check out the following guide on Steam, to get familiar with the environment, where you can find these modules. I can guarantee that you can pass this section with a lot of saved time, as long as you decide to try one again :)

Thanks for your review! Steering takes some time to master it, but in terms of the helmet, it's one of crucial things in the game's design. Being inside the helmet gives you a feeling that some part of the screen is almost stationary all the time. This helps to reduce motion sickness a bit, but as you have noticed, Detached is a game for players who need something more from VR.

Thanks!

You have a few controller schemes for each controller (keyboard, gamepad, touch controllers). Please check out if another one will be more comfortable for you. 

Being in helmet help reduce motion sickness, but it shouldn't cover more than 40% of the screen. If you have blinders in mind, this feature can also be disabled in-game menu. 

In terms of movement, - You can choose between two types of control. The arcade helps you get familiar with the steering (more assists like braking etc.). Simulation is just a wild ride, our attempt to reproduce the zero-g environment.

If you're a fan of games like Descent and Sublevel Zero, this game may be for you.

Hi, 
thanks for your honest feedback. Really appreciate your effort to write this review. 

According to your cons, I would like to remind that we prepared few control schemes for each controller (Touch controllers, Gamepad, Keyboard). You can choose the best one, which can be more recognizable from FPS games or VR. Player can also enable steering assist or Eagle Eye View to limit field of view in the most nauseating moments (pitch, yaw, acceleration etc.). 

As you can see for example in the reviews, Detached is a kind of game, that will not suit everyone. We are aware that players with prone to motion sickness can have issues during the game, especially when the above mention features aren't enabled. Those who doesn't have any problems with nausea, simply enjoying the space exploration in zero-g.

As you wrote, there is always a possibility to make a refund if the game will be causing a motion sickness.

Thanks,
Jacob"

In dem großartig aussehendem Detached spielen wir einem Astronauten, der unter gewissen Umständen von seinem Raumschiff getrennt worden ist und nun natürlich alle möglichen Systeme wieder zum Laufen bringen muss, um aus dieser verkorksten Situation wieder raus zu kommen. Detached ist ein Nullgravitationsspiel und so schweben wir während des gesamten Spiels ohne Schwerkraft herum. Unsere VR-Brille wird sozusagen zu unserem Astronautenhelm. 
In einem Tutorial, bekommen wir ausführlich erklärt wie wir uns sicher in der Schwerelosigkeit bewegen. Es ist möglich zu beschleunigen, aufzusteigen, abzusteigen und Drehungen in mehreren Achsen sind machbar. Je nach Würgeschwelle des Spielers einstellbar. Die Bedienelemente bedürfen einiger Gewöhnung, aber gemeistert vermitteln sie einen guten immersiven  Eindruck, wie man sich im All fortbewegen kann, denke ich – ohne jetzt jemals im All gewesen zu sein …
Einzig das Fehlen der Hände kann ich mal wieder nicht nachvollziehen, es werden nicht mal die Controller angezeigt. Nähern wir uns einer Interaktion, wird ein Fenster eingeblendet, daß uns vorgibt, welchen Knopf wir am Controller zu drücken haben. Da hätte es zu Steigerung der Immersion beigetragen, wenn wir selber greifen, drücken oder ziehen könnten.

Die Meisterung der Steuerung ist allerdings  immens wichtig, den Detached ist im Groben ein Survivalspiel, in dem wir Sauerstoff- oder Treibstofftanks einsammeln müssen, um nicht auf dem Weg zur Rettung auf der Strecke zu bleiben. Die Gebiete oder „Level“ sind ziemlich weitläufig und wir haben schneller mit Sauerstoffmangel zu kämpfen, als uns lieb ist. Zudem gibt es keine Map oder ähnliches, auch unsere Missionsziele sind nicht immer wirklich klar. Also verbringen wir unnütz viel Zeit, indem wir suchend nach Hinweisen und Rätseln herumschweben. So können wir aber wenigstens die fantastische Grafik bewundern, die diese Astronautensimulation uns bietet.
Frustrierend kann auch das Checkpoinsystem werden, denn Detached saved immer ab, wenn wir ein Raumschiffswrack betreten und wenn wir schon mit wenig Sauerstoff ankommen und dann dort auch nichts zu finden ist  haben wir schnell ein Problem und müssen den Abschnitt neu starten. Sterben wir, kann es durch die Checkpointplatzierung auch passieren, daß wir immer wieder eine beträchtliche Menge Aufgaben neu erledigen müssen. 

Trotzdem bietet Detached ein abwechslungsreiches Erlebnis, das Schweben im Raum ist atemberaubend, wenn man zum ersten mal aus einem der weit verstreuten Raumschiffe oder Abbaustationen schwebt. 
Die zu erledigen Aufgaben sind interessant und wir können auch Goodies wie ein Schild oder Raketen nutzen. Leider ist Detached aber im Singlespielermodus nicht sehr lang und der Multiplayer hat das selbe Problem wie alle MPVRSPiele, wenn sie keine shooter sind …
Zudem ist Detached noch immer etwas teurer, obwohl schon älter, aber im Sale für Astronautensimfans ein Blick wert.

Sorry to hear that the game did not meet your expectations.
Did you try to change control scheme for specified controller you use? For each control device (Gamepad, Keyboard or Touch Controllers) we've prepared different control styles. You can find them in the game settings page.

Video 5 minute review:

Disclaimer: 
I have dozens of games I have to try in the limited VR time I have right now. So don't expect lots of hours as everytime I  get time in VR I have 3 to 4 games I have to try and video and review for a curator group. So don't get much time to return to great games, unfortunately. 

If you suffer VR sickness than maybe avoid this one, it has safeguards like vignette to try and help with VR sickness although it's probably not enough for those who suffer.

This was an awe-inspiring game in  VR for myself, I loved the soundtrack, the gameplay and the visuals it was a game where I just kept saying WOW to myself. As my recent review of StarShelter these two zero-g games are at the top of VR games for myself. Different games but both show the potential of VR in zero-g games and the immersion was deep in both.

I didn't find much wrong although maybe the repetitive voiceover from the AI instruction voice at times got too much. 
It's a great game and in my top ten VR games as of now.

La prima faccia della medaglia è dorata e di valore, sto parlando del comparto grafico, che rende questo titolo una delle più belle esperienze in VR mai vissute da quando ho il visore, di quelle che ti segnano e ti mettono finalmente in mostra quante potenzialità abbia la realtà virtuale. E' una meraviglia per gli occhi, è immersione pura, è un viaggio. Il comparto legato al movimento non trovo che sia così difficile, è inusuale e richiede pratica, tuttavia ci sono tre tipi di movimenti selezionabili nelle opzioni ed uno di questi risulta intuitivo, anche se un pò macchinoso comunque.

La seconda faccia invece è di ottone, cioè quella legata al game play, infatti ci troveremo davanti ad enigmi devo dire poco esaltanti, a tratti noiosi ed altri ancora troppo incasinati da comprendere, portando il giocatore a dover fare i conti con il lato oscuro di cui parlerò tra poco, inoltre ci vorrà poco a rendersi conto di quanto poco ossigeno e carburante ci sia in giro, trovandosi alle strette senza aver modo di trovarne e morendo così poco dopo. Altro problema che non ho gradito è che il gioco ha diverse volte deciso di salvarmi la partita a 10 secondi dalla morte per mancanza di ossigeno, ciò ovviamente mi impossibilitava a trovarne altro e dovevo proprio ricaricare l'area. Sgradevole un bug così.

Ed ora il lato oscuro di cui parlavo all'inizio. Non ho mai sofferto di motion sickness in nessun gioco, ho sempre impostato movimenti e roteazione fluida in qualsivoglia titolo senza mai un problema. Il gioco ha tre modalità, arcade, simulazione ed astronaut. La prima ha movimenti lenti e semplificati, anche troppo ed è giocabile, la seconda rende i movimenti molto difficili, è difficile frenare, è facile per questo motivo essere sbalzati lontani dalla destinazione, cosa anche gradevole perchè porta maggior realismo alla mancanza di gravità, la terza invece rende i movimenti quasi ingestibili, quasi perchè con un pò di pratica si riesce ancora a controllare la navicella. La seconda e soprattutto la terza modalità però sono devastanti a livello di comfort VR, se ancora resisto alla modalità simulazione, alla modalità astronaut, persino io che non soffro di motion sickness, ho sensazioni di malessere sia in-game che per decine di minuti anche dopo che ho tolto il visore. Chi invece è più sensibile troverà, sia nella modalità simulazione che astronaut, il più intenso ed hardcore senso di malessere e nausea che probabilmente avrà provato in tutta la sua ""carriera"" di giocatore VR. Non ho mai trovato prima d'ora un gioco cosi hardcore in termini di mancanza di confort in VR, proprio per via di questi movimenti ai limiti del gestibile, trovandosi a fluttuare, capovolgersi, essere sparati lontani, il tutto con grande difficoltà a tornare in posizione consona.

In sintesi, gli metto un pollice in su per via dell'esperienza da effetto WOW del comparto grafico, che è spettacolare, per il gameplay ed il comfort invece il pollice sarebbe verso.

Have you tried all three control schemes for gamepads? What makes you the biggest problem with steering? We realize that at the beginning the player may feel uncomfortable with the control for several reasons. First of all, Detached has full freedom of movement, so the keys had to be assigned to each axis. Another change is head control.

I've got quite a bit of experience with VR.  I've got my ""VR-legs"" and don't really have any physical issues with games--even those that can be disorienting.  My system is spec'd pretty high--well beyond this game's minimum.

I wanted to like Detatched...I really did.  It looks like a title that I'd be into.  The graphics are solid, it's got a sci-fi theme, you're floating around in space.  And it is all those things, but boy it sure wasn't for me.  It really made me feel queasy.  I'm not talking a LITTLE queasy--I'm talking ""this is NAUSEATING"" queasy.

Look, I don't like knocking a title, and I don't lightly give anything a non-recommend.  This game does look nice and the gameplay elements I saw were okay--but the VR execution is just harsh.  Now, everyone is different, and if you're one of the folks who doesn't get sick in this game, then more power to you.  It might very well be a great game for those of you who aren't impacted.  It's just impossible for me to recommend because it almost seems purpose-built to make people sick.  There's even some bragging about it in the game trailer.  If you're on the fence with this title, my recommendation is to buy something else.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR --EVERYONE--

The game looks great. If I had a better PC, it would be able to look a lot better than ""great.""
Good game. 
Amazing concept and worthy of praise.

This game, as the video literally say, WILL MAKE YOU SICK. I've had VR for a while and don't normally get motion sickness. This game did a number on me when I set it to ""Astronaut"" mode. I do not dislike it because that. It warns customers, and it's a really great game at that.

WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND IT:
The helmet. The damned helmet. It feels like your head is a bubble 3 tims the size of what the helmet on the image looks like. It feels uncomfortable, potentially hard to get used to. The fact that moving your head moves the entire game with you is really, really bad (there may be an option to change this, hopefully, I am unsure). 

The other issue that really bugged me was that you can't rebind any of the keys. It would be much preferable if you were able to change what axes adjusted tilt, yaw, rotation, etc. 

Believe me when I say that this game is not for everyone. I would consider myself to have an above-average-consumer tolerence to VR motion sickness. If anything, get it mostly for the arcade mode (same game, just less nausiating).",1540944823,1540944823,True,3,0,0.571890175342559814,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Detached is a space exploration game with unique mechanics and impressive presentation.

You’re free flying inside space stations, and open space, looking for the rest of your crew. As you fly along you’ll need to keep your eyes peeled for oxygen and fuel tanks to refill your system, and thankfully the easy difficulty lets those last a long time.

It feels like a puzzle game in some respects. You need to open airlocks, activate panels at the right time, etc...

Early on you’ll gain three abilities that you absolutely must use: EMP rockets, a shield, and a speed boost. I think they implemented the need for a shield in especially creative ways: In one of the early puzzles you need to enter speed currents and break away glass to clear a path, after activating the current you’ll hear a countdown to cue you activating the shield so you’re safe while you become the bullet to break the glass.

As you can probably tell from the footage, this game has completely free movement. You aim your direction with your left hand like a mouse pointer, and your right hand can turn where you face by tilting the controller in any direction. The freedom is great, but if you’re prone to motion sickness then I think you should take caution with this game.

The graphics, sound design, and music are outstanding. You feel truly alone and isolated in space, which may sound fun or give you anxiety, depending on how you’re wired. But if feeling alone in space while trying to solve puzzles sounds fun to you, then definitely check it out.",1535989253,1535989253,True,7,0,0.558947384357452393,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Thanks for your honest feedback. In Detached the ability of sensitive control is the key. In the case of Touch controllers shouldn't be a problem.

Detached is the VR-only debut title from indie developers, Anshar Studios.

In Detached you play an isolated astronaut floating in space. I found the introduction slightly hard to follow, but from what I can gather, you and your crew are scavengers exploring an abandoned space station orbiting an unnamed planet. Due to space constraints in your ship you're travelling in a cargo pod that becomes detached from the rest of the ship by a cocky pirate with a bad attitude. You're left to fend for yourself, exploring the disjointed parts of the space station's hub while you try to rendezvous with your ship and crew. All you have at your disposal is your EVA suit.

At least your oxygen and fuel tanks are full, for the moment anyway.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Detached is played from a first-person perspective. It feels slightly claustrophobic, thanks to the readouts on the protagonist's EVA suit being visible slightly in front of the view. More or less of the suit surrounding the faceplate becomes visible as you look around or rotate the view, too, leaving a relatively convincing impression of being inside it.

The game is made using the Unreal Engine and the developers have done a wonderful job with the setting. Though the game is set in one particular asteroid belt near an unnamed planet, some of the space vistas are beautiful and the game really presents a wonderful portrayal of the area. Asteroids range in size and look big, rocky, and unfriendly. The destroyed space station and debris look fantastic, with some lights still functioning and other areas dark and foreboding. The lighting in general is exceptionally well done and used to great effect.

Non-structural models don't look quite as impressive. There's not enough there to give a good impression of the station's purpose; it seems hard to imagine that people might once have lived there, though I suppose it's possible there have been other scavengers there before you, stripping it bare. I would have liked to have seen a bit more evidence of habitation, in any case. Other effects are okay, but relatively limited and also not as impressive as the environmental graphics. The suit's rather silly power-ups are fairly understated.

There were no graphical slowdowns or other issues running the game on my GTX-1070-based laptop, even in some of the larger areas, and I feel it's worth mentioning that the engine's excellent single-button view recentering functionality makes adjusting your viewpoint and position in the real world a breeze; I wish every VR game had this. 

Music is appropriate and does a good job of building and maintaining tension, while not interfering with the game or stealing your attention. It's well made and sounds quite familiar, but I suspect it's just the space opera style is well chosen. Sound effects are good, though the old sound-traveling-through-a-vacuum thing ruins the suspension of disbelief; my guess is that the developers chose to go for a more exciting game rather than a realistic one in this regard.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Initially, Detached runs you through a tutorial section in which you can familiarise yourself with the basic controls. This is definitely necessary! While you may be familiar with 6-DoF 3D games, I think there's a pretty good chance you haven't come across anything quite like Detached before.

The game offers you a choice of three different control methods: arcade, in which the game auto-steadies you and drains your inertia for you when you're not actively firing any of the thrust or attitude jets on your suit; simulation, in which you control your jets and thus your inertia completely manually, but which lets you hold down two buttons to stop your spin or thrust; and astronaut, in which you control everything manually -- including applying counter thrust in order to stop movement in any dimension. For me, arcade was too unrealistic and astronaut too hard, so I stuck with simulation, which was utterly brilliant.

After the tutorial and between each level you'll see a scripted scene telling the story, but I couldn't really follow it. Though I knew basically what was going on, I didn't really know who was doing what to whom, or why, so in the end I just sort of looked at the nice graphics and waited until I could take control again. It's a bit of a missed opportunity from my point of view, but maybe it makes more sense to some people.

Anyway, you then have to make your way around the destroyed space station performing various tasks to reactivate seemingly unrelated systems, before you move onto the next level, while collecting big devices called NANDs and trying to find fuel and oxygen tanks to refill your EVA suit. Along the way you'll find three power ups for your suit: a boost, a shield, and a missile launcher, all of which recharge with time. There are a handful of levels, some with timed sections and drones that attack on site, but which you don't seem to be able to destroy.

I think Detached is probably the closest I'll ever get to a spacewalk. But while the game's setting and excellent control systems could have made a wonderful EVA simulator game, the developers instead chose to make an action game based on time limits, collection-based 'puzzles', indestructible enemies, and -- just to make it even more frustrating -- automatic checkpoint-based saving. The game all but punishes you for exploring the wonderful environment, and being forced to repeat timed sections (especially when you've inadvertently saved at a checkpoint with low oxygen or fuel) over and over is painful.

As the developers warn you straight out on the Steam store page for Detached, this game is not for anyone with even the slightest hint of susceptibility to VR-induced motion sickness. Given the number of reviews mentioning this, I feel I should say something, too, since I'm using a hacked-together VR rig comprising an Android phone, Google Cardboard headset, and Xbox 360 controller. I'd expect this to be a terrible experience compared to the officially supported HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.

Sure enough, for the first half hour or so of spinning about wildly and trying to understand what I was doing, I felt pretty ill and had to take a break. But once I had the basic movements down, and could control my spins and move and look roughly where I wanted to, the motion sickness faded away to barely a whisper, and I could fully appreciate the zero-gravity environment and excellent movement controls. So don't be afraid! Give it a go; what's the worst that could happen!? (Keep a bucket nearby, though, just in case.)

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
Pros:
+ Great environment
+ Excellent movement
+ Brilliant graphics

Cons:
- Time limits and checkpoints
- Indestructible enemies
- Silly collectibles
- Expensive

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Some aspects of Detached are brilliant: the (realistic?) thrust and attitude rockets that control your movement along, and rotation about, all three dimensions; the wonderful environment; the great graphics with excellent use of lighting and darkness; and the atmospheric music. But other aspects of it all but ruin the experience: the time limits, the checkpoints, the indestructible enemies, and the silly collectibles. The story doesn't make any sense to me, either; I don't really understand what's supposed to have happened or how, or why I'm doing what I'm doing.

So how do I add all that up? I'm not completely sure. It's too expensive at its normal price, but on sale it's not so bad. I've played it for a handful of hours and I don't think I can be bothered finishing it, though I may play every now and then just for a bit of zero-G ballet. And I guess that's the problem: as a game it's not that great, but as an experience it's out of this world.

[h1]Save for Later[/h1]

Note: I played this game using VRidge / Riftcat and an Android phone with Google Cardboard headset.

Sorry to hear that Detached makes you feel uncomfortable. We try to warn all the players (also in the game description here on Steam) that Detached is intense game and it's not suitable for everyone. Especially for players with nausea problems.


I would like to remind that we prepared few control schemes for each controller (Touch controllers, Gamepad, Keyboard). You can choose the best one, which can be more recognizable from FPS games or VR.

(Inside Joke).

Wow...that was an immersive experience! 

Detached really is the most authentic space exploration and survival game I have played.  

The intensity is off the charts!

== Controls & Movement ==

Many have complained about the control mechanics, they shouldn't they are excellent, it's just that they will quite rightly spin your head and your stomach if you're not used to it.

So to explain....

The left controller fires the jets which move you forwards, backwards and up & down.  This is easy to learn and induces zero motion sickness.

The right controller however controls your Pitch and Yaw and this is where people come unstuck.

There are three levels of intensity for the movement; to assist people who don't have solid VR legs.

Arcade (for woosies and children)
Astronaut (for serious players)
Simulation (for hardcore nutcases)

I play on Arcade :-)  

I tried Astronaut but I found it too realistic to be honest, I think anyone in space would take time to adjust to the weightlessness and constant propulsion.

In Arcade mode the constant propulsion is eliminated and this makes a huge difference to your ability to retain your breakfast.

So that’s the controls explained.

== The Game ==
This is without doubt a proper game; it has single player and multiplayer mode.

The single player mode does a good job of recreating an experience of survival in space, it looks good, the immersion is sublime and the gameplay is realistic.

It's not all fast paced, guns a blazing get it while it's hot gameplay, more of a methodical and space simulation experience.

If you want faster paced experience then Multiplayer can provide that.  There are a combination of none combat MP modes available, requiring you to get from A to B to C before your opponent does.

You do have weapons and sheilds and also you can damage your suit by colliding with debree, not to mention the need to keep tabs on your oxygen levels.  This really is a simulation experience.

== OVERVIEW ==
Overall I think this game is excellent, but very, very demanding on your ability to not lose yourself or your lunch.  

I try and stay away from games like this because I know I will suffer (motion sickness is no joke) but this is a game which encourages me to overcome and master the nausea because it is so good.

The game itself is exceptional and very realistic & only the fear of motion sickness prevents me from playing.  

The arcade movement system helps huge amounts and I am able to play 1 MP game without serious incident (unless I accidentally bang into something and start spinning unexpectedly).

In time I will surely overcome motion sickness issues, but I need to take baby steps.

** WARNING **
Play sat down, I started playing this stood up and I nearly fell over a few times!  Be warned.

== FINAL NOTE ==
This is a tremendous game, a lot of time and effort has gone into this so please read the developers warning before buying & don't refund the second you feel sick.

Nach über einer Stunde habe ich das Gefühl, erst an der Oberfläche dieses Spiels gekratzt zu haben. Das mag zum einen an meiner Orientierungslosigkeit liegen, aber auch daran, dass ich einfach immer wieder dazu verleitet wurde, einfach durch den Raum zu schweben und die Aussicht zu genießen.
Auf die Story gehe ich nicht weiter ein, da sie auch auf deutsch beschrieben ist. Wir sind halt ein Astronaut in den Weiten des Alls und haben mit so manchen Widrigkeiten zu kämpfen. Zu denen auf jeden Fall auch die Schwerelosigkeit gehört.
Und genau die ist eine der besonderen Stärken des Spiels. Neben einer ausgezeichneten Grafik ist es besonders die Steuerung in der Schwerelosigkeit, die dieses Spiel auszeichnet. 
An unserem Raumanzug befinden sich Steuerdüsen, die wir ersteinmal meistern müssen. Das Tutorial ist definitiv zu empfehlen, da man sonst schnell Radschlagend durchs All abdriftet. Wir können nämlich nicht nur munter geradeaus fliegen, sondern auch seitlich und horizontal rotieren. (Also auch Schrauben und Saltos machen) Das ist zum einen eine sehr spaßige Erfahrung, kann aber für Leute mit schwachem Magen zu echten Problemen führen. Dies ist definitiv nur ein Spiel für erfahrene VR-Nutzer, die keinerlei Probleme mit Motion Sickness haben, die Warnung des Publishers ist wirklich angebracht.
Im Verlauf des Spiels finden wir noch zusätzliche Module für unseren Raumanzug, wie einen Schild, oder Raketen, was uns Zugang zu neuen Bereichen der Raumstation ermöglicht. Wenn wir nicht gerade durchs All rotieren oder vor Asteroiden klatschen, versuchen wir unsere Raumstation wieder in Gang zu bringen. Dazu aktivieren wir einen Reaktor, sammeln Energiezellen, aktivieren die Kommunikation uvm. Zusätzlich müssen wir darauf achten, dass uns Sauerstoff und Treibstoff nicht ausgehen, oder wir durch unbedachte Flugmanöver unseren Anzug zu sehr beschädigen.
Für mich persönlich gehört Detached zu einer Erfahrung, die man mal gemacht haben sollte. Das Gefühl der Schwerelosigkeit kommt einfach sehr gut rüber, die Grafik ist gut, es läuft super flüssig (1080ti, ss 2.0) und macht auch ohne viel Aktion spaß. 
Ich werde das Review bei Zeiten noch durch den MP-Part ergänzen, kann aber schon sagen, dass es allein die Singlemission schon wert ist.

First of all, sorry to hear that Detached gameplay is too intense for you. According to the game description, we aimed at players who expect from VR a bit more extreme moments. For sensitive players we have also prepared several solutions to minimize the extreme feelings in the game. The Eagle Eye View option will be the key, which you will find in the game options.

Sorry to hear that Detached makes you feel uncomfortable. We try to warn all the players (also in the game description here on Steam) that Detached is intense game and it's not suitable for everyone. Especially for players with problems with nausea.


I would like to remind that we prepared few control schemes for each controller (Touch controllers, Gamepad, Keyboard).

After the tutorial I encountered a bug? which put me almost an hour into gameplay into a dificult part of the map. I initally rated this down due to that level as I thought thats how the game started out. After contact from the developer they notified me that I should not have been put there.

With the very short gameplay I did play, I found the game beautiful and the method of moving around slightly confusing, primairly roll but after some confusion in the tutorial I got it.

I did however refund the game as after my experince with that level I did not want to play the game or that level again through normal game completion",1508778466,1508975915,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,6,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not sure where the idea of 2.5 hours came from.  I don't think that I'm very near the end and I've played for more than that in total. You would have to be seriously good to get this game done in 2.5 hours.  Admittedly I ended up saving the game with very little oxygen left and ended up having to start the first level from the beginning, but that's a definite possibility for anyone.

This is a space simulation based on Newtonian physics and with 6-DOF.  The basic premise is that you have ended up in a wreck in space and you need to carry out various tasks to get yourself out of the situation.  These tasks generally involve flying from place to place, gathering fuel and oxygen, and pushing buttons.  This doesn't sound all that exciting but when you add in the 6-DOF and control systems it is a very fun and challenging game.  The game is not big on hand-holding and one of the big things that is slowing me down is trying to figure out what some of the parts of the game want from me.  I found myself at one point screaming ""HOW THE FUCK DO I EJECT?"" at the game repeatedly until I realised that you press the right trackpad, that's just one example.  Just after that I found myself screaming ""WHAT THE FUCK?  THIS IS NOT FUN!""  over and over because it wasn't, it was just stressful, but it was short and I got through it.  You'll know the bit when you see it.

There is quite a bit of talk about how this game has the potential to be quite vomit-inducing and I would say that if you are prone to motion-sickness this is not the game for you.  I have never felt motion sick in VR so the idea that this might be the first to induce it had me buying the game as soon as I saw it.  So far I'm fine.  It is quite dizzying but I haven't felt the urge to blow chunks just yet.  

The controls are interesting.  I am playing on Vive with the controllers and in that setup the left controller controls the thrust vector of the suit irrespective of which direction you are actually facing and the right controller controls roll.  The right hand controller requires you to squeeze the trigger and then rotate your wrist in the direction you want to roll.  This is a very immersive means of control but is pretty hard on the wrist.  Mine is absolutely twanging today.  Combining the controls to guide yourself through the puzzles (some of which are time limited) is very challenging.  I went straight to playing on astronaut mode which I gather is more tricky but I wanted maximum realism.

I have not played this game on multiplayer.  I'm just enjoying the single player experience for the moment.

The graphics in this game are excellent and truly convey the scale of the space environment.  I quite enjoy travelling from one place to another by just putting myself into a random roll and then just drifting and enjoying the view.  The music is find and appropriate for the game.  The sound effects in general are very good.

If you have a strong stomach, like a challenge, and don't mind risking some serious RSI, I would highly recommend buying this game.",1508399488,1508399488,True,5,0,0.543049514293670654,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I recommend you play the game on simulation mode while in a seated position (helps immersion and feeling of weighlessness) and complete the brief tutorial. The first two modes are way too easy and don't give you the feeling of immersion.

You have on your suit:
Directional thrusters (up, down, left, right)
Maneuvering thrusters on your suit (Roll, pitch, yaw)
This provides your avatar with a true 6 degrees  freedom of movement in the vastness of space, and the close quarters of space buiding while performing simple interactions. The level of immersion is unparralled - even seated, you can alsmost fool yourself into feeling weighless.

With this comes the one big (but not too big) con:You will experience brief bouts of motion sickness (seconds a most) - but as in real life, they quickly go away after correcting your motion so you can deal with it in the following manner.

1.  Fortunately you have a good computer in your suit which allows you to brake (grip) either the directional or maneuvering thrusters, so don't freak out and puke, just use your brakes and it will go away
2. Focus your eyes on a stationary point on your hud (fuel guage) while regaining control
3. Close your eyes
4. If desperate, remove the headset, but it will never get to this point unless you are truly in a state of panic which means you have other problems.

While the game dosn't fully make you feel like you are in zero G because you can still sense yourself standing in gravity, it gets pretty damned close.  It's impossible to not get fully immersed while you are playing and feel like you are actually there, floating around.  Detatched takes the VR experience to the level we all imagine it.  Not only do you feel like you are reaching out and can touch things, it does so floating around...  Which is at least what I imagined the VR experience to be like.

The controls are excellent and easy to understand.  After a little practice it starts to become very second nature navigating with them.  The game play so far and story is progressing nicely with interesting puzzles to solve.  I'm excited to strap the headset on try the game again, and I can't say the same for a lot of VR games.  The fit and finish in the game is on par with what a person expects out of a game nowadays.  So many VR games are so bad, or so short that it really leaves me not wanting to try others.  

Graphics are great, and the screen door effect becomes almost non noticable once you start playing with how they have done the visuals.  Absolutely amazing game, a must have for any VR owner.

A word of caution however!  This game is VERY nausiating.  I don't get motion sickness very easily and this game pushed my limits, I could only muster close to an hour before I needed a break.

6 degrees of motion is a term i have heard hurled about a lot, and very rarely is it true or if true very rarely is it good to control, detached uses the motion controllers in a very good way (once you get used to them) allowing you to control your direction and angle very well.
It is also one of the most beautiful games i have seen (we are starting to raise the bar in visual quality for vr games, as developers get more used to the strengths and weaknesses of the system and as the engines they use get better and better)
 
[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] 
The area you will be spending most of your time in the single player game is very well designed and the first time you go into space you really well feel somewhat small and insignificant against a large open space of ...well space.
Oh man that feeling as you look across at a huge asteroid beside you and see your shadow as it sails across it, tiny in comparison. This game really has got some good environments.
Now roomscale…. You are in your space suit and this is done very well so long as you do not move about too much in your physical room, which let's face it you should not do because there is zero gravity and if you want to keep to realism you would not be able to move, but if you do the suit does try to move with you and sometimes it jolts, i also had to use the re-centre button a lot more then i really should of. I tried the game sat down and found i was looking up way too much to make that comfortable.
So if you are stood and do not move about too much in the real world then it is perfect...if you are a fidgeter then be prepared to put up with the odd minor inconvenience (and minor they are)
 
[b]GRAPHICS[/b] 
Again they are great, even when i managed to get an extremely close look at the textures on an asteroid they looked very clear. The assets used are good too. This is one of the higher tier graphical games (i am noticing that Unreal engine seems to be cable of some really nice visuals these days)
 
[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
A mixed bag here, first let us clear up one thing, the performance in terms of framerate is spot on, no problem there (though i did lower the pixel density a little due to recording in HD was causing a tiny judder) 
However i experienced two bugs one major and one critical, a door control failed to appear until i left and returned. And the critical one is related to story progression a couple of hours in. To mention the critical one in detail would be a major spoiler, these are bugs that really should not be in a non early access title, but both have been reported and i am sure the developer will fix them.
*EDIT 10/06/17 The critical bug is actually a product of unintuitive design, where the player believes they should do one thing and are meant to do something somewhat crazy. This while still bad is much less bad then a critical bug (and i am told will be fixed in the next two weeks)
 
[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
There is a little learning curve but once you grasp how the controls work it is actually really intuitive. No complaints here.

[b]MOTION SICKNESS[/b]
Make sure that your options are set low enough for you pc to not be reprojecting frames and you should be fine. The fact you can see your helmet around you gives you something to ground yourself with and the even though you will feel like you are moving (at one point i was close enough to a wall for the chaperone to appear and for a minute i really thought it was stupid of the game to rotate the chaperone wall with the character i felt that much like i was the one moving….hard to explain). In all honesty though i do seem to have somewhat of an iron stomach when it comes to vr.
 
[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b]
I was unable to test this properly, it has 1v1 multiplayer and the devs did say they could organise a game with them for me to try it, but i wanted to try it as any normal person picking up the game would…. I could not find a single player. Even with a heads up posted on the forum and a 30 to 40 minute wait (not an exaggeration i really did sit and wait for nearly 40 minutes) there was no one playing, get this for its singleplayer content not the multiplayer.
 
[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] The movement system is really well done
[*] The atmosphere and feeling of floating in space of being small in a very large area is perfect.
[*] Freedom to achieve your goals in the order you want to do them in.
[*] Graphics are superb.
[*] In my first test i thought i had only played for 15 or 20 minutes, turns out it was double that, sign of a good game!
[*] The developers engage with their users on the forums, can not tell you how important and major that is.
[*] The few cutscenes for the single player are so good. 
[/list]
 
[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] No online community.
[*] It is a tad on the expensive side, worth it for the single player but only just, a lower price point may solve the lack of an online community.

[b]VERDICT[/b] 
I have 2 hours invested in the single player already and once the bug that stops me continuing is fixed (and i am sure it will be given the devs commitment to the game) i will play more.

Shoot that in 20 seconds or DIE! Oxygen that last minutes and turns the whole thing into a stress-experience rather than an exciting experience. All in all it's designed for kids with some type of attention-disorder (you know; those boys girls hate because they do everything too fast for any enjoyment to arise). There's just no time for any fun in this game. It's all about ""Hurry, hurry HURRY!! You slouch"" (The game literally calls you a slouch, after you just paid them about 26 US$. Of course it's an in-game joke, but it sets the tone for the whole thing: there's no time to enjoy anything and that makes this game a loser-experience IMO))

If you like that type of 'instant gratification' game, then you might find it perfect.

Graphics are quite good, control is ok (I preferred the mode called ""VR thrust"" using the Vive controllers. There are other modes but they were too coarse for me to master (total spin-fest with those) with no way to adjust fine-control)

The game also has power-ups (more speed, so you have even less time to enjoy anything), and rockets (cause obviously little kids these days are only happy if they get to blow stuff up), and shields (so you can be invincible like iron-man or batman or whatever super-hero you prefer (cue the silly cartoon in the beginning, which I could have happily lived without), cause just being in a space-suit is obviously not enough)

There's a lot that goes wrong with this game-play (if you're looking for a simulator-type game, which this turns out NOT to be)

There are, however, a lot of potential. But it's wasted unless you're looking for a fast-paced action-game.

Also, story-wise, you don't feel connected to the story at all.
Some event happened, that broke a lot of stuff (Did a colleague do it, or what was 'the finger' all about? I didn't get the meaning of that). Some dude talks to you on the radio, but we don't even know his name.

Everything is just so rushed :(

The music is nice, but since I was too slow in doing things it ended up repeating itself in a noticeable way, so in the end it didn't really work too well. It tried to set an ambience, and it got close at times, but it felt like it was programmed for a pace of game-play much faster than I was playing at (And so it repeated itself. That's what you get for being a slouch apparently)

I'm sorry to be so nasty here, but the video gave me a very different impression than I got from the actual game-play. Not that the video is wrong, what you see is indeed what you get, it just gave me the impression that this was a slow-paced half-way simulator-type game and not an arcade-game on steroids.

The game is well-made technically and ran smooth on the GTX980 I have (on an i7 pc), so kudos to the developers for that. Very smooth running visually.
It also looks good. Lighting and shadows. All that is brilliant.
Sounds are good. A mix between being simulator-worthy and arcadia-fest nonsense, but with no glitches.
So technically this game is very good (The 'drifting' helmet-position annoyed me a lot though, but I'm not sure how the developers can avoid that since the game obviously can't allow the player's free VR-movement to cause his/her head to stick outside the helmet. It's not a big deal, but it did annoy me having to reset the helmet-position every time I had looked around just a little bit. Maybe they discovered what is really a VR-limitation here; the trouble with small confined spaces)

I really wanted to like this game, but rather than bring me fun it brought me frustration.
If you're a simulator-type, I don't think it's for you.
If you're an arcade-type, it could very well be for you.
The game is not at fault, it is what it is, I just thought it was more like a simulator-experience allowing you to set your own pace in the game, but it isn't and it doesn't.

dizzyness, there is none at all. Which is strange......The trick to Detached is small movements at first.
Just take your time and get used to the enviroment and movements.
 The details are really good in this game. its like your really in that suit..........
 The only con about the game every now and then the game can get a little choppy. Dropped frames sometimes.
Im running 2 1080 gtx cards (Titan gt83vr-6rf) The cards are not M cards. But I do know its still not like having the desktop equvilent.

But the left gpu fan is basically at idle......and with settings turned down 
its still there. But its not that bad. Just took some time to get used too.......because I do like this game. I would say the best title I`ve played yet.

It doesn't let you move your head around at all.  If you accidentally move your head outside of the helmet the game  then the game snaps your point of view back to the center of the suit.

The astronaught on the cover clearly has a spacesuit that gives him enough maneuverability to turn his head and look over his shoulder so why the heck can't I?  Instead I feel like I'm driving a stretcher with misalighned rockets strapped to the bottom.

The movement controls were bad.  The left hand controls your main thrusters and the right hand controls your rotation.  Sounds good on paper, but in game It's very awkward and unreponsive.  I Imagine with enough practice it becomes easy but the game doesn't give you any sort of feedback on how you're rotating.  The difference in movement between tilting down and turning upside down is very slight.

The game does something similar to what no mans sky did with it's flight in that it you have to try pretty hard to crash into anything.  The game will magically push you away from any object that it feels you are too close to.  This doesn't help with the motion sickness one bit.

The visuals are really good but I couldn't really enjoy them.  I didn't get to experience much of the gameplay but what I experienced didn't leave any lasting impressions.

Detatched is an objective based PvP game that simulates a space suit. There is also a single player campaign but this is focused on the multiplayer PvP. 

Detatched has a few varied forms of locomotion but all are intended to mimic space flight. Sorry guys, no teleportation here. This is a prime example of the rare game that it doesn't make sense in. Not only is it PvP but the whole point of the game is mastering how to maneuver a space suit.

That being said, I felt little motion sickness or discomfort. There is a frame that you will see that is constantly in view. This should minimize most motion sickness. There were also comfort options in addition to a full simulation option. It looks like the devs have tried to make sure both sides are taken care of. If you're very sensitive to motion sickness, sadly you may want to steer clear of this one.

As far as the PvP gameplay goes. This is a game to be played with friends for sure. I don't think I'd enjoy randoms as much as getting together with someone you know and popping this in as a social/party game. The fun, for me at least, is more in trash talking your buddies than playing the game.

There were some issues joining a game and we were forced to join via Steam. This was an early build and I hope they've since fixed that bug but I don't know for sure.

I did find that it was very challenging to accurately fly where you wanted to go but I did feel as though I was significantly better after an hour or so of playing. Skill will play a large part of this game and you'll definitely want to at least do the tutorial and maybe 20-30 minutes of the Single Player campaign before jumping into PvP.

I haven't played through very much of the single player story but it does seem to be high enough quality to justify the $24.99 price tag. 

Also remember that being an Unreal Engine game, it plays much better than it records due to the way UE games mirror to the desktop.

The single player map (all I've played thus far) of Detached by Anshar Studios is absolutely gorgeous to look at.
The single player map plays out like a metroid-ish game in that progression is determined by the acquisition of new gear to overcome obstacles. You start off in what looks like a hangar on a space-craft.

*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*
[spoiler]I don't recall whether that first room had windows looking out into space or not, but I suspect it didn't.
If I'm right and it didn't, that was a great design choice because two or three doors in, you feel like you're heading deeper into the ship/installation, when all of a sudden you float through the last door and find yourself in open space. It's a very odd feeling which I enjoyed immensely. It's a mixture of ""holy shit that's cool!"" and ""holy shit I'm floating away from safety!"", and it pushes the tension up a notch immediately. That was a very clever move indeed.
[/spoiler]
*SPOILER ENDS*

The only speech in the game is your suit computer keeping you appraised of your current situation. As you perform tasks, gently guided by curiosity more than signposting, the suit computer announces the state of the part of what now looks like a disjointed space station as you enter and exit. She also mentions things like ""suit damaged"" if you manage to clumsily slam yourself into something (which happens quite frequently). More alarming however is the calmly spoken phrase ""oxygen low"", which left me nervously checking the oxygen readout on the helmet visor as I darted around looking for a green oxygen canister.

I've mentioned it before but it bears repeating, this game is very pretty. The asteroids look great, the man-made installation segments look neat and shiny, the lighting is spot on with glare from the local star when you turn to face it. It's just a joy to look at.

The controls are basically the same as for ADR1FT (right stick to rotate, left stick for thrust, triggers for vertical thrust and bumpers for roll) and the space-suit handles *really* well.
There's an option to select either an arcade mode of play or a simulation mode. The menu suggests that arcade is an easier choice and simulation is only for those with an ""iron stomach"". Of course I opted for simulation mode ;)
I didn't suffer any nausea, but if I'm honest I can see how others might. The primary difference between the modes as I understand it is that in arcade mode rotation is damped, while in simulation it is not. This means that in arcade mode, once you stop applying rotational thrust, shortly thereafter your rotation will cease.
In simulation mode, unless you bang into something, releasing the rotation button or stick will stop you rotating any *faster*, but halting the turn requires an opposing thrust. This is why some might find it frustrating (indeed, complaints about the controls abound in the reviews on Steam), or sickness inducing, but I think the developer made the right call by giving the player the option and simply warning that it might cause a reaction.
If I'd known the difference between the modes before selecting, I would still have gone for simulation as I'm fairly used to those mechanics from playing Elite: Dangerous, among other games.

According to Steam, the single player map took me 77 minutes to complete. The eagle eyed among you will have spotted the price of this title, but hopefully you'll also have noticed that the single player portion of this game isn't what the developer was focused on. There's a multi-player side to Detached that looks very intriguing.

I haven't checked it out yet, and there was mention made in the reviews of a potential lack of players, but hopefully I'll get a game in tomorrow night. As far as I can gather, the idea is that two astronauts are stranded in space and for reasons not clear to me yet, only one of them can escape to safety. What plays out is supposed to be a relatively violence-free contest between the two players, each attempting to get to safety while frustrating the progress of the other.

It's a neat idea, and with a bit of luck I'll be reasonably good at it (heaven knows I'm bad enough at the rest of the multi-player line up these days).
On a technical note, it worked right out of the gate with vRidge/Riftcat and a wired 360 pad on Windows 10. No issues whatsoever. It even provides a very welcome camera reset function which you can invoke with the back button on the pad. Impressive compatibility scores on all fronts.

So, as far as the single player is concerned, it's a huge recommendation from me for anyone who fancies floating in (beautifully rendered) space for a while in VR.

Whether or not the multiplayer holds together, I'm already glad I own this title.

Here is my first 30 minutes of gameplay in Detached, for the first time:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnbgNvaBxSc

This is my first Detached gameplay, and I have to say that I´m truly impressed with the graphics, perfect control system with the Vive controllers, the great soundtrack and the whole story mode itself. Its just amazing how beautiful the space looks in Virtual Reality, and you get total immersion and feeling of presence while playing this lovely game.

Graphics is amazing thanks to Unreal Engine, its sharp and I get fully fluid 90fps with my 980Ti and 4790k computer. I also have SuperSampling enabled at 1.4 to get it even more crisp, and the game still dont lose any frames at all (even while recording at the same time.

The story mode seems very intresting, and there is probably many hours of gameplay, tasks and exploration of the beautiful scenery out in space. Full Vive control system is added thanks to latest update and it works just perfect. 

I get no motion sickness whatsoever, and I guess all of you guys can play it without problems, even thou it takes some time to get used to the control scheme and all movements.

The soundtrack and music is incredible, it sounds like a Hollywood space movie, and that really adds to the immersion and sense inside of the virtual reality.

I have yet not testet the Multiplayer mode, but I will, and I may update this review further on with more impressions.

I really recommend this game to everyone - this is a MUST-HAVE game for all HTC Vive owners, and a perfect show-off for your friends and people that experience VR for the first time.

I have not done the PVP aspect yet, but am very excited too. 

The only con i have are the controls. It took a ridiculous amount of time to feel comfortable with them. I've read in the comments many other people speaking about ""VR Nausea"" and the only time I ever felt that was due to a FPS drop. I believe most users had this issue consistently due to either their GPU not being powerful enough, or tied up doing other tasks (like recording).

I actually did a Livestream of this game on twitch and youtube, and have condensed it into parts. Feel free to check out part 1 here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_JibBl_8Po

Just give it a try, I can't wait full product.

As a kid, I was always fascinated by how it was made in front of my eyes, a huge pink shape was forming, sweet! I always asked for extra layers of sweetness, even if I knew that those last few bites, I would not really enjoy, due to the fact that I had most likely eaten half a kilogram of sugar by that time. 
But let's cut to the chase, as a kid in 1988 I was, first allowed to ride a roller-coaster. What a memorable day that was! The sun was shining straight at my face. One hand squeezing a stick with a huge ball of cotton candy, the second ball this day! In the other hand was a precious ticket for the wild ride, which I never forgot! The queue was moving at the right speed, leaving enough time for me to shuffle huge chunks of sweetness into my mouth, just before I had to jump into my seat. No one knew what was possibly coming. Neither I, or others that decided on a ride that day, or my stomach.
The first bump of the moving cart, gave me excitement, then chills. I was stupid enough to look at what was below the tracks, small people in the distance were waiving hands and smiling, looney toons were playing on the speakers. Sudden cold sweat hit me, turning into sticky hot moisture on my forehead, seconds after. Deep rattling sounds from somewhere in the cart guts, or possibly my own. Surroundings started to wrap around my head tightly, sounds become deep and scary, time was stretching, till it almost stopped. 
Sudden loss of the ground under my feat, the cart start rushing towards its first loop. My head, legs turned to cotton. Sweet and sour tastes on the tip of my tongue, were the last thing I remembered. Minutes became hours, hours stretched into the days, I had lost any meaning of time at this point. 
Sometime later, reality starts coming back to me in waves, first muffled sounds, then blurred vision. Someone yelling at me, a barking dog, crying kids, sporadic excuses and apologies with my mother voice. It took me a while before I realized why I could not properly speak or breath. The reason was that my face, the seats, the crying kid, and the lady holding the squealing dog on the leach, were all covered in a sticky, sweet and steaming pinkish slime. What a day that was.
Time has passed, seasons change, one after the other, memories fade. I was an adult, until this Friday evening. Deciding to relax after a hectic day at work, all house chores done, supper eaten, the game loaded, waiting for me to start. Mistakes, mistakes, huge mistakes were made this evening.
First spawn, a quick look at the surroundings, riding through the first corridor was smooth and easy. A glimpse of a door in the distance, I try to open it. Floating across the room I suddenly had no realization where the top was or bottom of the room was. Cold sweat was the first sign, somewhere around the force-field barrier, the familiar sweet and sour taste in my mouth, has not gone unnoticed. In the next corridor the camera twisted and moments later my knee started to give up. All my childhood memories from that day past, rushed into my head, you can imagine the rest.
It took me several attempts at the game to overcome my nausea, but oh boy, it was worth it! The game with a VR headset, is a totally different experience from anything I have played before. Nothing has ever felt so real and authentic. Every time I jump into a space suit, my hands are subconsciously trying to grab something nearby. Graphics are adequate but scope for improvement.
I will come back to this game again and again, but next time I will not eat before playing, but I still bring the bucket.

It really looks like the real thing that NASA have kept a secret for so long, however the developers NEEDS to add Vive Controller support for this game. Sitting in front of the keyboard gets a bit lame when you see the full potential this game has.
Also, you are not able (yet) to set your own keybindings, finding the ""B"" button usually ends up frantically hitting every key you find over the spacebar while wearing the Vive Headset.

Vive controllers should become the left and right ""controller sticks/armrests controllers"" that connects to the Thrusterpack of your spacesuit.

Lifting/tilting the Vive Controllers then interacts as the joystick.

I recommend this game if you know where your keys are on the keyboard.
Else you should wait for the Vive Controller support, that would certainly give this game a big 8/10 from me.",1472757701,1472757701,True,29,2,0.655360162258148193,0,True,False,True,False,,,
