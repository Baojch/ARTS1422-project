The start of the game is a sensational showstopper.  There is a strong story-line with lot of twists, turns and surprises and it's mostly historically accurate.  
They've done their research, and created the London of the 1890's but with some fantasy themes from literature - their take on Alice in Wonderland is bizarre and brilliant.  The scenes use low key colouring and create an air of menace with not a skeleton or skull in sight.  Londoners will appreciate the joke of the slum having a Mayfair address, although maybe not be so impressed with some of the cockney accents - but that's just nit-picking.

Highly recommended for its clever HO scenes, varied puzzles, and interesting characters.  You play as Hawkes, who abruptly and unexpectedly inherits his uncle's position in the Vermilion Watch, a secret society that acts on behalf of the ""forces for good"".

This game has a classic late Victorian London setting complete with locations ranging from high brow west end to the slums of the east.  Beautiful art with lots of attention to detail.  In this game you'll catch glimpses of several famous fictional characters - although they're not so fictional to the Vermilion Watch!  Can you uncover your uncle's secrets in time to foil the plans of the Red Queen's most notorious henchwoman?

Lots of action, lots to do, I can't wait to play the next game and can only hope that more of the series comes to Steam in the near future.

Pros:
- setting, art, creativity
- variety of both puzzles and HO scenes
- fully customizable difficulty
- interactive map
- solid voice acting
-outstanding cut scenes / movies
- good length and a satisfying bonus chapter

Cons:
- the game froze on me once, and may have glitched a second time (not sure if the game or my system); everything recovered without a hitch by leaving and re-entering the game
- there are two or three ""escape / action"" sequences that aren't my personal cup of tea; that said, they aren't nearly as frustrating as some (these are scenes where you are trying to dodge things while running or swimming etc.)
- right toward the end i found a few of the puzzle descriptions confusing; they'd been quite good up until then (still better than most)

I took 7 hours to play the main game and bonus chapter.  I spent another hour in the Extra's replaying areas to gain the achievements which are in game.  However there are Steam trading cards attached to this game of which you receive 4 cards.
The cinematics in this game are excellent and you are quickly drawn into the game with the cutscene of Ernest Hawke writing a letter to his family.  The backdrop is London in 1895 and a foggy, dark and wet place it is.  You are the nephew of Ernest and have arranged to meet him.   He wants to talk about the family history and mysteriously wants to reveal something to you regarding your parents death.  Come in spinner!!
When you meet your uncle, a large hulking man attacks him and leaves him mortally wounded.  At his insistence, you return to his home where an enigmatic servant called Rufus informs you that your uncle was part of Vermillion Watch.  This league serves Queen and country and were very active against criminals with dark agendas.  The Moorgate Accord was a secret treaty between the Watch and certain criminal organisations.  The current chaos means that the accord has been broken.  You will now have to act in your uncles place.
The story is quite well done and you meet along the way Irene Adler, Sherlock Holmes, Phileas Fogg and Isabel Newton (related to Isaac Newton).  There is also Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde plus elements of Alice in Wonderland.  Sounds fantastical, but they blend it in so well.
Every scene has a sign collectible plus there are souvenirs scattered around the game.  You are able to go back through the Extras and pick up the ones you missed.  Hidden Objects scenes were not overwhelming and are variable.  Some of the clues were riddles, so they aren't easy.  There are morphing objects in each HO scene, some are difficult to find.  You are unable to go back and search for the morphing objects.
Puzzles were also variable and ranged from easy to difficult depending on your preference.  Anything to do with maths stumps me!!  Music was suitable for the environment and building suspense.  You have a map and you can transport to another scene through it.  It indicates if you need to do something in a particular location.
The only downside I found was sometimes the general scenes and HOs were too dark to find objects.  These did get a bit better as the game progressed.
I highly recommend this game and look forward to playing the second one.  Buy on sale as it is fairly expensive for such a short game.  I wish it had been much longer as I enjoyed it so much.  8/10.

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Trainee; Inspector; Chief and Custom.

There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can be completed at certain locations. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.

There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary.

There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Picture items; Find 'x' amount items; Fragmented items; Traditional word list. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.

The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.

There is a collectible in the game: Signs. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.

There are morphing objects (beyond objects.) They can be found in the hidden object scenes only.

Since this is a collector's edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.

There are fourteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.

Miscellaneous

There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Objects; Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Souvenir Room and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.

There are nine different trading cards to collect. Only four of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1561778457,1601828691,True,6,0,0.581717431545257568,0,True,False,False,False,,,
