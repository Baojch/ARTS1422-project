It's nice work, overall.  Thanks for letting me test.

I'll do the Good stuff first then list the Bad stuff

Good stuff I liked:
 Nice planetary visuals.  
+ Attractive visuals, and really great attention to details.  The lens flare fromt the space helmet?  Very cool!  Nice visuals of the starscape and all the planetary visuals.
+ The general theme of the game
+ Excellent Sound and audio effects
+ Very good Music, well selected and suitable to the theme and story.  Good choices overall.
+ Enjoyed throwing the ball at the cat, that was cute
+ Nice envirionment, not too cluttered.
+ As an ESL Teacher, I'm really blown away by your great English skills.  It is great TECHNICAL writing for a non-native speaker.  Congratulations.  


Bad Stuff That Needs Improvement:

- Swaying palm tress.  It doesn't work.  Take it out.  Just... no.  Please, normal trees, not the sickening ones.

- The Writing, story, characters, I didn't like.  And yes the voice actors were awful.  Do I love hearing Chad and Nick and Mike muddling through your hacky dialogue?  Of course I do, it's hilarious.  And when we had Bee read the establishing dialogue for Treehouse?  That worked.  Because it was three lines, and it told the player what they had to do.  Your dialogues is WAY MORE THAN THREE LINES.  It is bloated and too wordy.  It needs to hacked down with a samurai sword to 1/3 it's present size.  Mike, you should ask someone who writes well in english to do a few rounds of editing before releasing a new version of this game.  I'll help you with a re-write, if you want.

- To a more general audiance, the story structure, the dialogue, even the message, was forced, hacky at best.  Following are four specific examples:

- ""Oh by the way your dad died 6 months ago and we forgot to tell you"" - This is awful.  It's awful when they do it in the real movies, and it's terrible here.
- ""I never told you I loved you, son"" - terrible.  Also, if you're sending a message from a dying old man, find a voice actor that sounds like a dying old man.
- ""Click this button to replay the message"" - No, please, no.  Really.  It was terrible the first time.  Please do not replay it.
- ""The pin code is the company you work for."" -  I'm sorry, Astronauts don't don't lock their crew mates out of critical systems in the first place.  
- ""Uh the station blew up for some reason""  - OK, I'm guilty of this in my game because my station also blows up for no reason, until we explain it afterwards.  But yeah, stories have a thing called 'context' and it's nice to have.  Maybe add something to the dialogue that says ""Oh hey look out the window at that big rock that's about to hit our station"".   Or better yet, SHOW US the asteroid hitting the station!  This is the challenge of working in VR.  We're going to be asked to *show* the player what's happening, instead of just telling them about it.  Or, better yet, empower the player to tell their *own* story naturally through the gameplay.... while still passively witnessing external events, like the exploding station.

- That's a gas giant sitting right there.  Is it Jupiter?  Which planet did we land on, anyway?  Did you tell us it was Mars, or am  I misremembering it.  Jupiter's got four moons, which one were we on again?  Europa's a freezing ocean of methane, so probably not there.  But IO kind of fits the bill.  Check it out:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon) - anyway, touches of realism like this really go a long way into ""selling"" the experience to your audiance.  You're asking them to suspend their disbelief, just for a short time, so you can tell them this interesting tale.  Every detail you get right, or at the very least, internally consistent, helps them do this, and allows them to create a consistent, compelling experience in their own mind. 

- The take-off.  It's a cool flight mechanic!  It works OK.  You just need to convey to the user what they're supposed to do.  If the game is to 1) Aim the controller at the launch window, and then use their thrusters to fly through it.... you were 90% of the way there.  You just need targeting raycast laser pointer on the controller.  a very quick and basic mechanic, but it isn't there.  And give the user some time to figure it out, let them fly around a little before they fly through the target window.  Movement in the game needs to be more than just an afterthought.

Stories also deserve to be more than an afterthought in games.  And if you're not telling the story through the actual gameplay, find another way to convey it.  Through the surroundings (which you kind of do), through UI interfaces, and through gameplay (which you kind of do as well).   Gamers care about stories, and writing a good one.  Details matter, it's going to be important, so we both need to get used to getting them right.  So fix some of the glaring plot holes and ham-fisted melodrama.  

- The ham-fisted (english idiom look it up) approach of shoving a baseball themed story in just to add some actual gameplay into the game.  I'm equally guilty of this Mike.  You saw how I made Pokemon No.  But it's better when the gameplay aligns with the story goals.  

- The ""pile up a bunch of objects"" part, this was just frustrating.

- As an ESL Teacher and Trained Actor, I'm a little disappointed you didn't ask me to voice a role?  I was sitting five feet away from you this entire time.  OK, Chad was passable which is an achievement considering the script you handed him.  But Nick's dialogue and delivery were just too corny.  Real emitional dialogue deserves better treatment than the half-apathetic melodrama that was a result of your collaboration.  And Mike's dialogue came off like he was reading a repair manual instead of a tearful letter home.  Which, given the actual content of your game, ie, trying to fix your ship, actually kind of works in favor of the theme!   But he doesn't even try to sell it emotionally, and the result is a theme that comes of more like apathetic and confusing rather than deep and thought provoking.  


Neutral Comments - Suggestions

0 -  You had a lot of opportunities to do some cool things you passed over.  Well, anyway, if you're on IO, why not do some cool gravity effects?  You've already integrated the toss game in, maybe you could make a part of the game where you're just hanging out with your buddy on IO having a good time throwing around baseballs  before he falls over dead for some unknown reason.  Hey, maybe that's how he died, you hit him too hard with a baseball!  On the caution of overscoping, since youre already abusing the hell out of flashbacks, why flash back to your astronaut training back in Florida.  You could even get all meta with it, because astronatus are actually using VR to train.  But it would be cool if you implemented something into the physics of the game that gives you the impression that you're actually in outer space.  Half of these suggestions will create more problems than they solve, but consider them.  

0 - Have you considered using the trackpad to allow the player to thrust laterally, as well as by throttle?  Because I think the part of the game where you launch up could be improved, if you used the trackpad to thrust laterally, as in, 90 degrees to your angle of thrust.  That way you could swerve left and right and up and down as you fly up into the window, making it a lot more robust.",1475095924,1475096259,True,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

OK, so first off, the voice acting, writing, dialogue and sound production seem like a bunch of high school or college friends got together to make a movie... and it shows. But - that's what Evil Dead was for Sam Raimi and look where he wound up,right?

I got so far as the baseball throw before I stopped. The previous segment where I was supposed to gather parts seemed broken. I could get two items within arm's reach but could not move around beyond my chaparone boundary to pick up the Nitrogen so I assume the game just moved along. Anyway, the initial scene was pretty cool and the concept was good. But it does have that ""home movie"" kind of quality.

Low-hanging fruit: Grab some free software like Audacity to process the voice recordings. Google how to add distortion so that the radio transmissions received by the main character sound like they're coming over the radio. That'd help a lot. Maybe add some breathing effects in the background so the player feels they are in a space suit. Try not to overdo it - make it subtle. And maybe flip the model of the dead astronaut with the MMU on his belly instead of the side, or on his belly at a slight angle. It looks a little to clean and perfect.

You could have a lot of fun with this - it's a cool concept. :) Think ambiant sound though - breathing in the spacesuit, radio distortion, the sound of wind or traffifc or birds in the scene throwing the baseballs to make the player feel they are in the location.

As a filmmaker, I've made a lot of garbage. You can't help it. It's the nature of the industry.
As a game maker, you've just made your first piece of garbage too. This is where you need to embrace it, make something slightly less horrid, again and again until finally your project is 'sort of good'. 
I don't want to discourage you, but your results are going to be bad when you start out, no matter who you are. You just have to learn, be proud of your first effort and listen to what people tell you is wrong about your work.
Here are a few thoughts:
1) Hire a local actor to do your voiceovers. NEVER do it yourself. People think acting is easy, and it isnt'. It's a craft like being a physician. Not eveyone could or should do it. You've picked the people who fall into the 'never should' category. Except the kid. He was passable. 
2) Figure out a story - using ANYTHING as a template until you figure out how to design drama. Pick, I don't know, Star Wars or Harry Potter - read Joseph Campbell and get an idea what the hero's journey is. This story is bad. It's horrid. 
3) If you can't write good dialog, and you can't write a good plot, know your limitations. Don't. Make an escape the room game. 

Incidentally, your worst sin here was the horrid, horrid dialog... let me give you an example: ""and your father died a month ago"". I was expecting the next line to be something like ""and your wife? She's actually your sister. Your baby, born while you were in space? Hes a retardbaby. Yes, a retard baby. And... he's black and YOU ARE WHITE."" It was bad dialog. 

For your next project, don't go back in time to kill Hitler. It's been done. Know your weaknesses guys. Keep trying.",1472536905,1472536905,False,8,3,0.6410256028175354,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I saw your post and decided to give your project a try and I wanted to share my thoughts with you.  I appreciate what you're trying to do as a single developer and applaud you for it, I imagine it isn't easy, but it wouldn't be fair to you and your goals in game development if I wasn't honest and sincere about your work... 
I see what you were trying to do with the game but there isn't much here.  I understand it's your first project, but here were a couple things I came across.

- The voice acting all sounded like it was the same voice actor and just sounded like someone was just reading a piece of paper for all of it, as if they weren't trying to make it sound believable.
- There's not much to do in your game in terms of content; I stood on a planet and I threw a ball.. that's it
- Unless reading the game description I would not have understood what the story was.

Here's what I applaud you for doing 
+ You're doing something in game development, keep it up!! Keep your dreams going!
+ Your story was something I wish had more depth!! Good choice.
+ Thank you for allowing the community to try your project.
+ Being on the planet was pretty, would have been awesome if I could move around on it.

I don't want to come across too harsh, but I love the fact that there are people like you trying to make products for people like us.  Thank you so much for your support in the Vive community and I look forward to seeing what else you do.",1471917073,1471928973,False,101,0,0.814460337162017822,3,False,False,False,False,,,

But I still enjoyed The Journey Home a lot, especially for its well made impact at the beginning and all around feel.
