My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707325751,1707325751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The Secret Pie tarafından geliştirilen ve yayınlanan bu oyunlar daha interaktif romanlardır ve grafikler ve işçilikten ziyade sıra tabanlı hayatta kalma oyununa odaklanır.

Borstal başlıklı ana senaryo sizi ıssız bir adada bulunan bir çocuk suçluluğu merkezi olan borstal'da babasını arayan genç bir çocuğun yerine koyuyor. Oyun, her fırsatta engeller ve tehditler içeren tamamen rastgele bir harita içeriyor. Haydut çocuk gruplarıyla karşılaşacak ve babanızın nerede olduğuna dair ipuçları toplayacaksınız. Hayatta kalmak, sürekli yağmura göğüs gererken uyku ve yiyecek yönetimini gerektirir. Babanızı ne kadar hızlı bulursanız, sonunuz o kadar iyi olur, ancak ıslahevine ulaşmanıza yol açan olaylar sonucu büyük ölçüde etkileyebilir. Birden fazla son ve yapılacak farklı seçimlerle Borstal zorlayıcı bir deneyim sunuyor.

Öte yandan, ikinci senaryo olan Mountain, devasa bir dağa tırmanmanın gerçekçi bir simülasyonuna odaklanıyor. Ancak, oyun sonu aksaklıkları ve sinir bozucu ölümlerden muzdarip. Amaç, dinlenme ve yiyecek ihtiyaçlarınızı yönetirken zirveye ulaşmak ve ana kampa geri dönmektir. Ne yazık ki, oyun düşük sağlık veya uyku için uygun uyarı göstergelerinden yoksundur ve beklenmedik ölümlere yol açar. İlerleme mesajlarındaki aksaklıklar ve beklenmedik ölümler hayal kırıklığını artırıyor. Mountain'ın arkasındaki fikir ilgi çekici olsa da, uygulama bu sorunlar nedeniyle yetersiz kalıyor.

Mountain'daki kusurlara rağmen, Borstal hala fiyat etiketine değer. Oyun, hayatta kalma araçlarının sağlandığı ancak ihtimallerin size karşı yığıldığı eski usul, zorlu bir deneyim sunuyor. İlgi çekici macera ve deneysel tarz, oyunu keyifli bir satın alma haline getiriyor. Geliştiricinin Mountain'daki aksaklıkları gidermesi ve gelecekte daha fazla hikaye yayınlaması umuluyor.",1688899706,1688899706,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False,True,,,

キーボードだけでも操作できるしマウスだけでも操作可能。
日本語無し。※何が起きているか知りたかったのでPICOTで翻訳しながらプレイ

ゲームを起動するとBORSTALとMOUNTAINが選べる。

先にやるならMOUNTAINがおすすめ、
移動しているだけですぐにゲームオーバーになる。
歩くとお腹が減るし、疲労もたまってそれによって死んでる。
右上に出る食器マークやZZZマークやドクロはそういう事を知らせている。
ステータスが数字で出るわけではないので、そのマークを頼りに
あと一歩行けるかな？って試しては死ぬゲーム。

目的は頂上に行ってからスタート地点に戻ること
頂上と言っても画面上の上方向に行くというわけではなく
小さい三角の赤い旗がさしてある場所が頂上。

毎回マップがランダム生成なので運が良ければ頂上が凄く近いことも有る。

お腹がすいたら食糧を選択して食べ、疲れたら休む。
山っぽいグラフィックの所はロープを使わないと大体滑落して死ぬ。
山っぽいグラフィックのとこロープで登ったけど
降りるとこで死ぬ場合はもう1本必要なのでロープを2本持っていくのが良い。
頂上に近づくほど環境が険しいってことで疲労しやすい。


BORSTALは食事とか疲労とかはMOUNTAINと同じだけど
雪山じゃないので死ににくいって感じ。
こちらの目的はゴールの建物に辿り着くことで、往復はしない。
MOUNTAINと違って歩いたところしか見えず、ゴールの建物がどこにあるかはわからない。

ゴールの建物につくまでに日数がかかりすぎているとバッドエンド(Winsには加算される)
なるべく早くたどりついてクリアできればグッドエンド。
 ※初期装備で早くたどりついた場合は必ずバッドエンドなので普通の家とかで役に立ちそうなアイテム探そう

仕組みがわかるといくらでも長く生き残れる。※140日までは試して永遠に続きそうだったのでやめた
逆に早くクリアできるかは完全に配置運。

すべてがシンプルでコンテンツも少ない。
グッドエンドもバッドエンドもテキストだけで
演出みたいなものは無し。

なんか癖になってプレイしてしまったので一応評価はおすすめにしときますけど
期待して購入したら中身の薄さにがっかりするかもという感じです。

For that I'll probably get thumbs downs on my review, but I stand by my thoughts on this game.

For Borstal:
You get a quick introduction with a short story, and then you're thrown into the randomly generated map.  You can only see one tile in any direction, but each time you move more appear. There are houses, hills, rocks, and other events that come up as you move. You can find useful or rotten items in various places in each map, but there aren't any random events that will kill you or damage you. You have to eat food, rest, etc. to stay alive while you try to find the Borstal. You must also be cautious of the weather, staying out or sleeping out in the rain will give you sickness. There are a fair amount of items you can get for the length of the game, such as food, matches, lanterns, wood, aspirin, apples, jam, and a knife. Once you get to the Borstal, depending on the supplies you have and the choices you make, you'll get one of a few different endings. It's a simple concept but very interesting for me.

For Mountain:
This mode seems much more difficult to stay alive in, due to altitude sickness. In this mode, the randomly generated map is completely filled out for you to see from the beginning, and you can generally see the ""peak"" flag that you have to get to, then get back to base camp, in order to win. Items in Mountain include food, tents, an altitude tracker, altitude sickness tracker, and rope. There are different and more difficult mechanics in this novella than in Borstal, in my opinion. It was much harder but certainly still enjoyable.

There are some ""bug-like"" things that I and a friend found. You can stay in a house and spam 1 and Z (Rest, confirm, rest confirm, rest, confirm...) and you'll stay alive infinitely, with no need for food, although it has a flashing red ""you need to eat"" indicator. There are also some ways to seemingly ""cheat"" the game, so I don't know if they're overpowered strategies or design flaws or something else.

Overall, it took me 1.1 hours to beat the game and get all achievements, but $3 is a low asking price, especially if there's more content to come. I plan to play more to test different strategies and find more endings, but that being said, I'd be happy with paying $3 for what I got (although I did get it in a bundle, it was one of the main reasons I got it).

When I first purchased Borstal, it was still in an early stage of development and had many glitches.  The mountain scenario, especially, felt very random, and certain events made absolutely no sense.  For instance, I recall when if I simply moved, I would die suddenly and without any prior warning; essentially for no reason at all.

While there are still some random events in each scenario, you are not always destined to doom or success based on how the map generates during a round of play.  I think that aspect of the game could be fine tuned even further, but then, this is a game about survival.  Sometimes, despite our best efforts, things happen.  The real question is that of how you will adapt to your environment and which resources you will choose in order to face the expected and the unexpected challenges ahead of you.

Both scenarios are short and can be completed in less than 10 minutes, but you will not discover everything about each scenario in one round, or even two rounds.  Until this week, I encountered storylines that I had not previously seen, having already played each scenario dozens of times.  So replay value is high.

Il y a deux histoires.

La première, Mountain, vous fait jouer un alpiniste coincé en haut d’une montagne, seul, désespéré. Il faut survivre le plus longtemps possible.

La seconde, Borstal, vous fait jouer un jeune garçon qui part à la recherche de son père qui n’est pas rentré de son travail. Le père travaille sur une île comme gardien dans un centre de rééducation pour jeunes délinquants.

Les histoires sont générées à chaque fois que vous en commencez une. Les objets, les évènements aléatoires, les bâtiments, tout est à une place différente rendant chaque partie unique.

Franchement, c’est un jeu excellent à un prix défiant toute concurrence !

I think this has a lot of promise, but i'd like to see the content to be expanded.

For one, i feel like there's an oportunity to make the game richer once you reach Borstal. I heavier text adventure end-game would add a lot.

The inventory has the perfect size, make roaming around the map a more concious effort. However, i barely found myself using lanterns or making fire with wood and matches. All i cared about was food. I think having more item variety and having the items have more impact on the game play would go a long way of extending the play time.

[b][i]poof![/i][/b] the game shuts itself down! It made me laugh, it's so smooth I think they scripted it this way... it doesn't make sense...  by the way I talked about this for so long because this was the most entertaining time I had with the game. There's no much else.

Everything here is mediocre or just plain bad, even the narration, that should be the core of a game like this - which lacks of a real gameplay - is badly written and all the settings and plot ideas are stupid.
You can choose between two settings, Borstal and Mountain, if you choose the one that gives the game its name the text will tell you that you are a 13 years old kid, your dad was working at a borstal on a near little island and he didn't come back home at night. Your mom thinks he spent the night with his friends on the island, but [b]you don't believe it[/b], so you go to the island to meet your dad... [b]AND YOU DIE![/b]

Nothing really strange happens, but you die! I actually laughed out loud several times in the first minutes, because you take a ship to this island, it leaves you in the middle of nowhere and you have to try to survive! I mean, on an inhabited little island where people work! That's [b]ridiculous[/b]!
So you are in a 2D map, and you press top, bottom left or right, to move square by squre, and from time to time some dull text appears to tell you what happens - a.k.a. random events - after three steps a day passes, than another, and another and still nothing really important happens... on a stupid little island! I mean you should explore it all in a couple of days! But no! This is a silly storyu about a human-snail journey, so after a weak you've only found a couple of houses. Then it rains, you get sick [b]and die[/b]. The end.
This blows my mind... you walk to your dad's working place... you find a house... [b]and scavenge it for food[/b] why should this happen?? The game doesn't tell you that something is strange, you are a kid on a trip to daddy's office, and you die because it rains! I mean you have food for three days with you and you didn't bring a stupid umbrella! Who did come out with this game concept??

So you start again and nothing really changes, yes, the map is procedurally generated, but the random events are always the same ones, and they aren't interesting at all, after a couple of runs you find yourself pressing the same buttons without reading. All you have to do is scavenging for food, eating, resting, taking aspirin, eating, and so on till you die of starvation, or sickness... looking for your dad's working place... because you don't even know where it's located.
When you start you can select the [i]Mountain[/i] setting and a different - but still stupid - narration text appears, then the gameplay is basically the same, 

you move, you eat, day passes, you die, and get really, really [b]really[/b] bored.
The first minutes of playthough i thought: [i]If this game keep being like this I could actually like it, because it's so accidentally stupid it's funny![/i] but boredom kicked that thought's ass in less than a hour. There's really no reason to play this.

Pitched in the description as more interactive novellas, the two scenarios provided play out like only the most classic turn based survival, harkening more to the style of NEO Scavenger than Rust in that the most engaging aspect is the text based story and randomized encounters rather than the graphics and crafting and whatnot.

Even though both scenarios are similar in structure, I feel that they provided such different experiences that I'll be addressing them seperately. You'll understand why in a moment, as I feel this may make or break a purchase, or at the very least provide some input to the developer.

Borstal, the titular title and ""main campaign"" is one where you play as a young boy who's trying to find his dad that worked at a--you guessed it--borstal, which in american terms is a Juvenial Delinquency center. In the game's world, the borstal is on an otherwise deserted island. Don't ask how this works, because I have no clue, but don't let it ruin the fun either.  Every time you start a new game, the map is completely randomized, and there are obstacles and threats around every turn. You can find clues as to what happened to your dad, and encounter rogue bands of kiddies who, depending on what you've found and how good your RNG is can give you good stuff to help you survive or beat your head in. It's constantly raining, and you need a decent stream of sleep and food to survive until you find your dad. The sooner you do, the better the ending, but when you find the borstal and what you've experienced up to that point can influence the turn of events greatly. 

I think I experienced 4 different endings in my time, and there were still options I hadn't made which makes me remember this one a bit more fondly. The over all story is a bit too vague, and I feel as if I missed some huge context clues, but the change of pace and setting to what I've been playing recently and the dumbed down but reasonable survival mechanics made it a joy. Plus, there are some exploits that I discovered that made my later journies much more bareable, though I won't spoil them here as the difficulty is part of the charm. The titular game will take multiple tries, but the rounds are bitesized and I genuinely learned from every mistake I made. 

Now we get to the stinker of the bunch, called Mountain. Now, I can see the appeal to making a deathly realistic simulation of scaling a massive mountain, and for the most part, I feel that Borstal succeeds in emulating the experience. But--and this is a big enough but for a Sir Mix-a-Lot song--Mountain suffers from some game ending glitches that shocked and baffled me each time they happened. Now the conceit is more or less the same if a bit more straight forward; reach the summit then make it back to the basecamp. Along the way, there are abandoned tents and what not that have randomized events and visible obstacles that need to be navigated with rope. Your needs are about the same, but the demand for rest and food is increased the higher up you go, and requires you to strategize your ascent so you don't get to the top and not have a way back.

In theory.

The problem is--and there are plenty of problems with Mountain--is that for every other death I had, there was absolutely no warning or justification for any of it. Now keep in mind, this is a text heavy game; I'm not criticising it for that. However, for every death where I was offered a bleak end to a risk that backfired or mistake I made, there would be points where I wouldn't have a single indicator on my screen that I was low on sleep or health or close to death, and I would take a step forward on completely clear terrain and just get a YOU DIED screen. Then, in an insanely insulting and borderline rage quit moment, I reached the summit, got a standard ""you have a headache"" type message that you get throughout the climb and made it all the way back, only to realize that that message OVERRIDED the ""Good job, now go back."" I died almost immediately after. This situation in which the progess message was overrided happened multiple times. Often times I would get to the summit in perfect health, get a ""your head hurts"" message and then immediately die. Other times I would be in fine health, with no warning signs, get a warning sign that I'm near death, rest in a tent and then die the moment I hit the button. This happened a handful of times. That was also pretty awful. Are you starting to see why this is the bad egg?

After 77(!) tries, I discovered an exploit, did a sidequest, and made it to the top and back without a hitch. I made it back fine because the base camp was only a few tiles away. It was a combination of what was basically cheating and a whole lot of luck. Hopefully the developer sees this and polishes out the bugs, because that ain't good at all.

But Razorbitz, is it worth the 3 dollar price tag? Absolutely. It's definitely old school and the cards are often stacked against you, but for both scenarios you're provided the tools to survive.  It isn't a masterpiece, but it's cheap asking price and experimental style makes for a flawed but genuinely engaging adventure. Assuming the kinks are worked out of Mountain, this is a nice surprise from the indie front and I'm glad I picked it up day 1. I never do that. Here's hoping that the developer makes some more stories to throw in over time as well!

Anyway, for me this is typical ""I have ten free minutes, let me play a game"" game type, not the one to sit and play for hours.

It is easy, fast to play, simple but somehow very moody. Maps are randomly generated, so each time it is a little different run. The game is neither focused on fighting nor on exploration, I'd trather say it's survival focused on survive.

This game is way too simple, way too RNG, and just feels rushed, lazy, and randomly put together.  It's not the overly simple graphics that make this game fail, because I am one of the few gamers these days that can have a hell of a lot of fun with simplistic graphics.

You start the game off with two choices, Borstal or Mountain.  Either choice puts you into a spot on a map where you can move one block at a time and then get completely random feedback.  Every move feels like life or death because of how fast hunger, tiredness, and ailments move on you or just ""pop"" up.  Theres no skill or strategy here, it's just 100% RNG, combined with utterly simple graphics.  

My advice:  Roll a dice in real life instead of buying this game.  If you roll a 6, you win, if you roll a 5 or less, you die.  That's basically what this game is, except that rolling a dice would be more fun and save you some money.

0 out of 10 at any cost.  If the game was free, the value would be a little higher and perhaps give this game a 1 out of 10.
