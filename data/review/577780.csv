the last puzzle is more unfair then a rigged carnival game, which after about 1 hour later i cleared it just to be greeted by the title of the game and put back at the start, rest of game was okay but lasted about 20 minutes.

Also teleported outside the map at one point and was exploring the void. - (was kinda funny)

everything before last puzzle 4/5
last puzzle and slap to the face -99/100

Edited Review: 

Well, 3 years is probably long enough to calm down.

I was going through my reviews and thought I should update this to be a bit more fair.

For the price, if you just skip the ""don't touch the wire"" puzzle(last puzzle), it's definitely worth it.

Literally nothing happens after that puzzle, you see the game's name and it puts you back at the start for a new game.

At the time I was using the Vive, had shaky hands(still do), and my controllers would desync often(poor LoS to tracking boxes due to space constrants).

Spent about an hr just retrying it... Over and over and over... For context it only took me a minute to do it when I successfully did it and that was going slow.

Wrote the original review within 5 mins of beating the game I was so mad at the time.",1586635742,1681028097,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,1702994033.0,"Hey :) thank you very much.
Sorry about your bad experience. This game was my first (and last) project.
I started with zero experience, so it's far from perfect.
Unfortunately my pc died after release and I have no chance to change anything.
Thank you for your review. cheers Dani"

[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]

This is a good, but short atmospheric Horror experience for VR. It's almost like a walking simulator with light puzzles, except with very little actual walking. You basically just teleport from scene to scene. I found most of the puzzles to be pretty easy to solve, except for the last room. You can finish the game in anywhere from 15-25 minutes.

Despite the mostly easy puzzles, I did enjoy the game. You're basically confused the whole time wondering where you are and what's going on. Except a lot of creepy stuff happens around you. Unfortunately, the game ends suddenly and on the worst puzzle element. You have to guide this square tool around some wire setup with balls for corners. It took me several tries before I was finally able to execute it properly ... then it just ends with no explanation.

Teleportation is the only locomotion and there is no smooth or snap turning. A room-scale setup is also recommended. I actually got this game on sale for $1.19 USD and think it's a good deal for the content at that price.

Ein kleines Horror-Rätselspiel, mit Grusel- und Schreckeffekten.

Die Rätsel sind gut lösbar, auch wenn man nicht gut englisch kann.

This could have been anything. A non interactive spooky staged play, or a scary ride, who knows.

There's alot of value here for the price! It is very impressive! You will get stuck at the wireframe challenge puzzle, it's impossible, nobody has that kind of dexterity or stamina to do it.

I thought maybe my hands were too shakey so I asked my nimble kids to try it, and they couldn't do it either. It's too bad.

You start of by entering Andys Voodoo shop. Well inside you find a board game called Atramentum. If you steal it and exit the room, the game will start. Then the nightmare begins. Just follow the flow. A cool mix of Jumanji/Voodoo/Ouija Board/Paranormal horror. You will solve small puzzles in really creepy places (where jumpscares, intense sound and scary music constantly is happening) in order to get deeper and deeper into the game. 

Overall it's a good and scary game and easily worth to buy for 8 dollars. It's scary for the one who plays it and fun for others to watch. It's easy to navigate and the puzzles are balanced enough to keep a constant pace throughout the game. 

It's also a very suitable game for first-timers to enjoy the horror aspect of VR. It's in Early Access, so sure, there are areas to improve, like many other Early Access games!
