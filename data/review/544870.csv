My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1706692822,1706692822,True,1,0,0.512820541858673096,0,True,False,False,True,,,

For that price it wasn't that bad I guess, but I definitely see why people would be mad to pay more than a dollar for this. The fights are super lackluster. They don't change the character sprites at all once you're in the battle, so what you see of the character is what you get with them 100% of the time. Enemies are boring too, once you get into a battle with a boss it just feels like a more durable version of any other enemy because they aren't anything special. My final complaint about the fights is there's no type of animation for the characters when using an attack. They'll just move forward and you'll see a slash or fire or light etc. BTW, Chloe is absolutely OP as all hell with her Fire Storm attack. I was rolling through enemies just trying to reach the end of the game faster

That being said I think I beat the game and got all the achievements in roughly 7 hours. So it's not like it was a big waste of my time. (I also played this on the Steam Deck and it was very compatible compared to playing it on PC)

I would really only recommend this if you're an achievement hunter looking for a quick 5 whole achievements or if you're looking for a game that you don't have to use your brain for even in the slightest.",1692539404,1692539563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Blood Ties is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

This is a particularly bad asset flip even from the shovelware pushers at Andorlea/Falling Star/whatever account they're using to push RPG Maker asset flips these days.  Sure, the usual lazy, incoherent godawful map ""design"" coupled with spelling and grammatical error riddled fanfiction... this one is ""vampire"" themed because they dumped the word ""vampire"" into the fanfiction blurb a couple of times, and frankly it's a miracle they spelled that correctly.   This truly is one of the worst of a bunch of asset flips from these guys, and definitely one of the worst RPG Maker ""games"" to ever pollute Steam. 

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the game is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it.  Blood Ties has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for collecting 500 gold, trivial to do, yet only around 2 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this.  Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show less than 2 percent of players bothered playing the game for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this game to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the   Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this game for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.  Leave this RPG Maker asset flip fan fiction trash in the reject pile where it belongs.  They seriously want $4 for this garbage.  You can get The Witcher for HALF that price.",1679116057,1679116057,False,2,1,0.242881670594215393,0,True,False,False,True,,,

首先不得不提的是游戏的技术层面。画面表现力并未达到当今玩家的基本预期，帧率不稳定，尤其是在复杂场景或多人物同屏时尤为明显，这对于一款强调视觉效果和沉浸式体验的游戏来说无疑是致命伤。此外频繁出现的bug和程序错误严重影响了游戏流程，包括但不限于角色模型穿模、场景加载失败以及对话循环等现象，这极大地破坏了游戏的整体流畅度。

在剧情方面尽管设定了一个看似丰富的故事背景，但实际叙事手法显得混乱且拖沓。角色发展浅尝辄止，缺乏深度，以至于玩家难以对主角及其同伴产生共鸣。对话选项虽多，但对游戏结局的影响微乎其微，削弱了游戏选择的重要性。

游戏机制方面，战斗系统单调乏味，重复性极高，缺乏策略性和多样性。技能树设计过于扁平，升级过程缺乏成就感。探索部分也令人感到沮丧，地图设计不尽合理，时常让玩家在冗长且无趣的跑图过程中迷失方向。

最后优化问题也不容忽视。即使我的硬件配置远超过官方推荐配置，仍然遭遇严重的性能瓶颈，说明开发团队在优化工作上的疏忽。

综上所述，虽有其独特概念和创意闪光点，但在实现这些想法的过程中，无论是技术实施、剧情呈现，还是游戏玩法都存在显著缺陷。对于热衷于高质量RPG体验的玩家来说，这款游戏目前的状态恐怕难以满足大家的期望。希望开发者能够在未来更新中修复这些问题，并进一步打磨和完善游戏内容。

There are a lot of grammatical errors, NPCs don't have a lot to say, and while Vampires are a big part of the story, they behave no differently from regular feudal houses just with extra powers tacked on. 

There's interesting development between the MC and her terminally ill mother, with some vague theme being drawn in contrast to the immortal vampires, but the potential of this plot point is left unrealized.

(Spoilers:) At the time of this review, I've defeated what appeared to be the main antagonist and recovered the macguffin, and then a new, previously unmentioned antagonist is pulled out of nowhere. The MC becomes a vampire herself and that part is pretty interesting, though she doesn't seem to take it particularly hard, which blends into the broader issue of vampirism in this story not being particularly menacing nor impactful. Vampires get along with the human church for crying out loud.

Gameplay: 1/10

As soon as Chloe learns her area attack fire spell, every encounter becomes a routine of using it, then setting all other party members to basic attack for picking off any survivors. Then Melissa learns her stun spell, which most bosses aren't immune to and are rendered helpless by. Chloe's fire magic and Melissa's stun spell are both hideously overpowered, and it shows how little this game was play-tested.

The most interesting part of grinding were the occasions when Chloe ran out of MP and I got to see what enemy groups could do when they weren't wiped out in the first turn.

Hell, this might be the first game I've ever played where Vampires and Humans worked together to save the world. 

If only the actual story, writing and dialogue was good and not utterly boring. Its especially worse when the only way to know what to do and where to go is by reading through it and trying to pay attention because there is zero direction in this game.

Encounters aren't random. They're your Warefare staple of puffy clouds that respawn when you reenter rooms. Because that's the only way to actually grind. Kill everything, leave and comeback because you ran out of encounters and the encounters are all the same couple enemies in varying amounts of said couple enemies at a time. You're going to get lost so you're going to be killing nearly everything you see because a lot of them puffy clouds have 9 billion IQ AI and will attempt to intercept your pathing and deny all laws of RPGM physics just to fight you and die instantly to one aoe. Its sickening.

Which leads me to the next concern. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't a spacebar simulator. Its like playing Spiral Clicker, but with spacebar. Or, if you want to turn your brain on just enough but don't have the energy due to the insane boredom you will receive from this game in general, one shot everything with your rogue spamming aoe fire. Something your actual spellcaster can't accomplish. Because for some reason, your spellcaster is relatively useless outside of the occasional heal or item slaveing and does half the magic damage your melee rogue does. 

You might be thinking, ""well, if its that easy, then bosses must be a cinch! Well. You're wrong. Sort of. This is another one of their games where, mobs die in one shot, but bosses have a billion health and do stupid damage. But at least in this game, you can potentially stunlock every boss to death. If you have the luck and the mp items for your stunner to keep doing their job. Oh, and for some reason, the stun attack does more damage than everything else in the game. Just because I guess.

I'm still slogging through, but if the horror stories people have with the final boss being genuinely impossible to kill... based off the boss fights up until my current point has been, I wouldn't doubt it and I'm not going to try and waste my time any further. I think. I don't know, so far I haven't managed to finish a few of Warfare's games just because of how... shovelware RPGM garbage they are and I'm not looking forward to playing the other 20 or so in their bundle if this is the track record of their games so far.

Honestly, avoid like.... nearly all of their games from what I've seen. Worst 25 dollar bundle I've ever bought so far. None of their games respect the player's time whatsoever. There are countless other better RPGM games out there. There are lists on google.

The hardest part of the game is likely to be until you get an aoe fire spell for your hero which you can then exploit at any crystal at the end of a dungeon and just spam your way through all mobs gaining fast items and xp. Story was predictable and as others have said I also felt no connection to my party throughout the game. There are better RPGMaker titles to play, this one is a pass. 

In-Depth:

Story:
The story intrigued me at first but quickly became predictable and turned into an incredibly linear plot line to the point the game would not let/encourage exploration of your surroundings by barring you from entering cities/dungeons ahead of time. After about an hour and a half in I no longer cared about the story and was just going for completion.

Art:
Artwork present within the game is pretty standard of RPGMaker and nothing really to look at. There are free games like Capella's Promise that uses beautiful original art in the exact same engine. 

Achievements:
If you can manage to sit through 5-6 hours of back-tracking and fighting the same two groups of monsters native in each new dungeon (of which never seem to vary) then you'll get all achivements by the end of the game or very close to all. But again, this requires you to do hours of grinding due to back-tracks, a lack of equipment variety (or equipment in general), and the brain numbing no brainer fights. 

Misc:
As others have said, the plot is very thin and often lends itself to more plot holes than a believable story. This story also could be told in way less than 5-6 hours but due to the heavy grinding aspect the playtime is padded way out. The final boss can be afflicted with status ailments and is how you beat him. Till the final boss you're able to cheese your way through any enemy mob group with an aoe spell and normal attacks. The little bit of exploration present in dungeons becomes repetitious after the first two or three as the branches will always lead to a chest and the exit to a new section. 

Overall, the game is a hard pass. If I wasn't a completionist and knew that I could get all achievements I would have dropped this after the first couple dungeons. There are much better (even free) titles out there you could play instead of this. Save your time and energy for something else.

I played another game recently called Oswald's Adventure which was pretty bad, but this game fixed quite a number of those, but it did several cardinal sins of RPG's that are so blatantly awful that this should not have seen the light of day.   What do I mean by cardinal sins well let me list them for you:

I)  The game's story is paper thin.  And often times whenever it tries to build more upon the world within the game it creates a bigger plot hole than there was originally.  This will be brought up further in later points.

II)  Every single dungeon is basically a hallway crawler, there are VERY few side paths, and there are no extra dungeons in the entire game.  Meaning each dungeon whether its a forest, another forest, a cave, a swamp, a mountain pass (that's the exact same tile set as a forest), a castle, or a tower, you feel EXTREMELY railroaded.  Making it seem like far less of an rpg than it should

III)  The enemies even from starting out usually take 2-3 physical attacks from a character (even your big strong warrior Ven) to kill.  And this is a consistent trend throughout the ENTIRE GAME.  You will rarely one shot enemies except for Ven, unless you are constantly using your skills, which will be brought up later.

IV)  You are very rarely ever given chests with good equipment in them, or opportunities to buy equipment.  They all feel too spaced out.  To the point it feels rather disjointed power wise.

V)   This is the biggie, the game requires you to backtrack through nearly every dungeon in the game.  There are a few which you have to backtrack through 2-4 times!  This is the primary way this game pads its runtime.  Most rpgmaker games allow a 'quickjump' through an area unless that area you are going through a second time has new story progress within it.  This game does not do that and could probably be a 2-3 hr tale instead of a 5 hour tale in that case.

VI)  There is no sprint button, need I go on?

VII)  Chloe who is classified as your rogue, learns primary offensive fire 'spells' making her seem like she should have been a mage or something.

VIII)   Lastly Chloe learns a screen nuke move relatively early (like lv 12) called fire storm this move makes all enemy mooks obsolete, one use wipes out pretty much any enemy party if you are lvled properly, or leaves them with a paltry sum of health.

IX)  The final boss is a bit of an ass, which completely ruins most of the feel of the game.  The screen nuke he has can both poison and silence, do half your health and if he mutes most of your characters especially your healer you are kind of screwed.  It's worse that there is no accessory that makes you immune to silence.  There is for poison, paralyze, sleep, and one other status, but not silence.

Seu grande destaque está na história! O jogo possui personagens um tanto quanto fora do padrão e mais de um grande ""vilão"", o final deixa um pouco a desejar... mas mesmo assim a história consegue te prender ao gameplay, coisa que já não é tão comum hoje em dia.

O gameplay durou cerca de 8 ~ 10h comigo, eu realmente explorei todo o mapa e busquei realizar os achievments que são bem simples... porém a verdadeira causa disso é a unica coisa que eu não gostei muito no jogo... se entramos em um local e matamos todos os inimigos do local, ao sair e voltar para o mesmo todos terão dado respawn novamente. como muitas vezes temos que voltar pelo mesmo caminho que fomos isso pode ser um tanto quanto repetitivo...

- Strategy consists of mindlessly, repeatedly hitting spacebar
- Completely linear gameplay, any attempt at exploration grants trivial or no rewards
- No full screen, only one resolution (which is a very tiny window)
- Random encounters (always represented by the same purple cloud) make up 95% of the gameplay
- Dialog is so boring it makes me want to die

[h1]Minor Complaints:[/h1]
__________________
- 2 enemy types in any area. Every enemy is so unoriginal and easy to kill that they do not deserve an encounter
- No atmosphere. Story takes place with medievil-fantasy theme, even though there are:
   * guns that deal almost no damage
   * dinosaurs??
- Map is unclear:
   * every type of location has the same symbol and no label (e.g. every castle looks the same, every village looks the same, etc.)
   * Forest entrances are not labeled
   * No markers indicating where to go next, meaning you are forced to read through the terrible, non-reapeatable dialog.
- Shops are a waste of time
- NPC's have dialog, but add nothing to the game in any way and should be ignored

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
____________

    This game is garbage. It's so boring you will have an existential crisis while playing it, wondering why you waste your life away playing videogames when you aren't even enjoying the one you are playing. If I had to choose between being locked in isolation in a straight jacket or playing this game, isolation would be hugely more entertaining. 

Look at the time any positive reviewers have actually played this game, most if not all of them have not even finished it. No sane person could finish this game and describe it as a good experience. 

Look at the global achievements for this game, only 1 in 50 people could bear to play this game for more than an hour.

In conclusion, this game is so bad that people should get paid for playing it, rather than the other way around.",1489877623,1490019384,False,11,2,0.678377687931060791,0,True,False,False,False,,,
