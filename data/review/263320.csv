Pros:
+ Interesting concept
+ References to many cartoons from the 80's 
+ Story is generally good
+ Many collectables to encourage exploration

Cons:
- Unfinished story as there's no episode 6
- You have to scratch stickers before each battle to get bonuses
- You have to charge every attack before use

A fun jrpg style game, full of 80´s pop culture references. Its like if a 80`s kid had a fever dream where pretty much all of media characters became reality (atleast parodies of them). 

The music (which was made by people who made the soundtrack for major 80s franchises) and the graphics are great and really make it feel like a movies of that decade. The combat starts out cool, but once you sort out the best items from the lesser ones (or completely useless joke ones) youll be using those mostly, trying to get good parries and doing the minigames (or just picking items that dont need them) and healing. It does get repetetive, and there is not that many types of enemies. 

The game is short for an RPG, the 13 hours was me trying to do every quest and get every item (I know there is atleast one secret optional superboss, for which you need to replay the episodes, I may get back to that later) you could do it in shorter time. The story is incomplete the makers wanted probably to do more content but the money dried up, or not enough was made in sales. Sad because the game has potential, but the minor bugs and lack of a conclusion of the story bug me a bit, however I think it still deserves a recommend, however its not for everyone.

 If you are someone that enjoys 80s media like me, youll have fun at the paperthin parodies of characters that you know and some more obscure.",1692991742,1692992007,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]Yes.[/b]
[i]If you grow up with the 80s-90s cartoon and don't mind the visuals and grind, buy it when it's on sale.[/i]

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The visuals need some time to get used to. It tries to combine 3D environments with 2D, pixelated sprites, which obviously look weird whenever the game tries to show the character from up close - you'll only see them in a more pixelated, ""blurry"" state. The environments are also not particularly engaging, but again, you'll get used to it.

[h3]Story[/h3]
As I said before, the game takes inspiration from old weekly cartoons, which might be where the title comes from. It is episodic in nature; you'll have a bad guy of the ""week"" and some repeated plot about the final boss that wants to crush our main protagonist at the end of the episode. However, the plot takes a weird turn in the last episode, forcing some bad guys to be good and giving us a wall of text to explain their reasoning. This feels weird and forced as a result; the shows that they take homage to are always meant to be light in nature, and it doesn't match with the intended audience this way.

The game also has a lot of references to other works. I don't think I catch everything since I didn't grow up in the same area as the intended audience, but I could find some homage to shows like [b]Transformers[/b] and [b]Dragon Ball[/b]. The notebook with stickers and baseball cards might also hold some value to some extent, but since there is never such a thing in my place, I couldn't be sure whether it was truly the case.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game was an RPG at its core. You will have the main objective and some optional side quests that you can get from talking to other people. It's mostly linear, although areas are huge enough with some episodes giving you some room for exploration. Some enemies will also be placed in the area, but they are limited in number and don't respawn. This makes it easier to focus on the other aspects of the game once; some areas can be confusing to navigate unless you paid full attention to them. Points of returns are also clearly specified, making it easy to navigate without worrying about missing out.

Quests have a direction marker to them. Sometimes, it's hard to figure out where to go next, especially the side quests since you need to remember who everyone is to progress. The addition of the marker helps to circumvent that issue, although sadly, it's kinda buggy. Some quests, especially those in episode 5, don't have any markers, and sometimes they don't even point in the right direction.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642171846

Scratching stickers might look cool at first, but it will just tire you out as you progress. You have a list of stickers that you can collect, which will give you bonuses in battle whenever you manage to scratch it. Scratching is done by circling your left analog button, but since you need to do it quickly to scratch the difficult ones, it can be hard to do it on the keyboard. Moreover, it also can be tiring to keep on scratching it after a few battles and the stat boosts aren't needed to beat the enemies.

There are a lot of weapons in the game, but most of them are useless. Status effects like paralyze and stun might help to prevent a lot of enemies from attacking you, but they prove to be of no value once you find out that enemies die in 2-3 hits. Weapons with multi-hits and multi-targets have low accuracy and/or damage, making it hard to find their uses. There seem to be only a few weapons that work properly, forcing you to play in a specific playstyle to beat the game.

[b]Combat[/b]
Combat depends on your weapon choice. Some weapons will force you to do QTE, but you also can choose the ones without it with the risk of losing some damage. There is also a multiplier that you can boost by charging, which again, is more effective with QTE. You'll find yourself being in a repetitive loop of increasing your multiplier and unleashing your highest damaging move due to its simplicity.

Enemies might hit you, but you can time your defense at the right time to reduce it. The window to perfectly defend against the attack is small, but the game is kind enough to give some sort of protection even if you press the button very early. Some enemies might give you some trouble, forcing you to prioritize them. However, I only found one enemy of that kind in the game. On the good side, your HP and MP will be restored after each fight, so you don't have to worry about healing.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished all episodes in 7.4h. The rest of my playtime was spent obtaining all achievements, although sadly, one of them is broken - it unlocked in the game for me, but not in Steam. As for difficulty, the game isn't hard if you don't mind grinding. You might be able to screw yourself up if you build your status recklessly, but there are always the sticker powerups that can help you. Plus, there is one weapon that can make you invisible by spending some in-game money.

[b]Issues[/b]
There is no skip cutscene for second replays. The game seems to enforce you to replay the game to experience all choices in some of its side quests, but you have to deal with the cutscenes over and over again. Luckily, they are short and you just need to spam the interact button to skip them. Moreover, the game doesn't show the controller controls despite choosing such at the beginning. There is also no minimap, and enemies can trigger a battle whenever you are interacting with other things.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I don't feel much excitement from [b]Saturday Morning RPG[/b], which might be happening because I'm not the intended audience. It doesn't mean that it's bad, though. It's still a nice RPG game if you don't mind the cons, although you can't expect it to be a game-changer or something. It's pretty much mediocre, which makes me in a bind about whether to recommend it or not. You can try playing the game if you think that you'll get some nostalgia, and that's if you can spare some extra money. Don't buy it at full price, though.

Yes, the interface is not well designed and the mix of low quality 3D coupled with 2D does not give a good effect, but you get used to it and even find it charming after a while. What I disliked most is the functionality, especially battles. 

Firstly, forget playing this with controller. Even after you set up your interface for your choice of controller, it will always show keyboard overlays for quick time events. 

There is no map, and some areas are maze-like. You have to follow directional arrows to tracked quests which often lead you to dead ends. I wouldn't have minded that if some entrances weren't too narrow. You need to switch to slow movement to accurately position your character for entrances and you need to stand right up next to the item and click it in order to pick it up/interact with it, not a pixel off.

Battles are the worst: First you have stickers, which are powerups you get per battle. You have to scratch them every single battle! Every item functions a certain way, some direct, some use a hit gauge, some use a click charge, some use quick-time events. Quick time event ones were useless to me, but that's just because I did not want to have my fingers on trigger keys at all times and the hits are not very reliable. Someone who enjoys quick time events may like them better than I did. You defend to reduce damage by clicking in time when the enemy hits you, and the action ques are not clear enough to defend reliably. You have to powerup your shot for EVERY SINGLE SHOT, otherwise your damage is pathetic even if you have your game scaled to level 1. The battling experience is so bad I had to drop the game. It feels repetitive and unnecessarily click heavy to artificially prolong the fight.

Saturday Morning RPG - это эпизодическая JRPG, созданная в мире, вдохновленном субботними утренними мультфильмами и поп-культурой 1980-х годов. Игроки берут на себя роль Мартина «Марти» Майкла Холла, среднестатистического ученика средней школы, которому только что была предоставлена ​​невероятная сила - сила, которая в конечном итоге приводит его к привлечению ярости самого печально известного злодея в мире, командира Худа! В субботу утром в RPG представлен полный саундтрек от легендарного композитора Винса ДиКолы («Трансформеры: Анимированный фильм», «Рокки IV») и его партнера по композитору Кенни Меридета (автор DuckTales, Power Rangers, X-Men и других).


Геймплей: сюжет и геймплей RPG по субботам происходят в нескольких эпизодах, каждый из которых рассказывает полную автономную историю. Игроки могут сыграть любой эпизод в любом порядке и в любое время! Все ваши характеристики и предметы переносятся между эпизодами. Это уникальное вращение в проверенном и истинном режиме New Game Plus. Кроме того, небольшие решения, принимаемые в некоторых эпизодах, переходят в другие - добавляя слой воспроизведения к каждому эпизоду. Пять эпизодов включены!

Активный пошаговый бой: РПГ в субботу утром черпает вдохновение из таких игр, как серия Paper Mario от Nintendo. Сражения в игре пошаговые, но игрок всегда участвует, активно защищая от атак и выполняя рефлекторные тесты, чтобы усилить свои собственные атаки.

Убейте врагов с помощью обычных вещей: Марти сражается во всех битвах в игре, направляя магию через повседневные предметы. Используйте пакет полосатой жвачки, чтобы вызвать радужных зебр, которые растоптали ваших противников - или призовите фигурку-трансформера, чтобы превратить вас в полуприцеп!

Ностальгия питала всё: все в субботу Утренняя RPG сосредоточена на ностальгии. Марти получает свои магические способности благодаря особой яркой пластиковой тетради, он может оборудовать наклейки с нуля и нюхать, чтобы получить статистические улучшения, и он будет пересекать миры, вдохновленные всей гаммой субботних утренних мультфильмов.

Режим бесконечной битвы: боритесь за волной врагов в бесконечном режиме выживания, где управление ресурсами становится всем!

Дополнительные сражения на арене: сражайтесь с сильными врагами в дополнительных сражениях на арене. Два боя в настоящее время включены, и больше будут бесплатные обновления.

Поддержка контроллеров: Полная поддержка игровых контроллеров.

Достижения Steam и торговые карты: заработайте более 70 достижений и соберите 8 торговых карт.

Что это?:
В основном IMHO это идея создания платформы для регулярной генерации виртуального попкорна в виде игрового JRPG-подобного сериала. Графика была сознательно принесена в жертву нарочито бедовому, специально для обладателей шапочек из фольги, сценарию. По ходу дела везде, где можно, лепятся отсылки к попкультуре (американской естественно). Игра не требует особого внимания, поэтому в фоне можно слушать аудиокнигу.

Получилось ли?:
Скорее нет, чем да. Игра вышла в 2012 году (iOS), в 2012 же были добавлены ещё две серии, а пятая вышла в январе 2017, причём (что крайне важно для меня) для Linux версии пятая серия недоступна до сих пор (конец лета 2017). По всей видимости разработчикам для активного развития серии очевидно не хватает мотивации. Возможно на сегодня альтернативы платным DLC для сериалов скорее нет, чем есть.

Хитрости боя:
Если хочется больше попкорна, то безусловно показано попробовать каждый из доступных ГГ (его зовут Марти и у него есть антигравитационная доска — ничего не напоминает?) типов предметов, атакующих и не очень. Почти каждый из предметов несёт с собой простенькую «миниигру» или как минимум уникальный визуальный ряд. Но на деле приходится ограничиться пятью предметами и я рекомендую:
Печеньки (Cookie) — для восполнения жизни (доступно с самого начала),
Радужная повязка (Color Belt) — для установке щита, особенностью щита является то, что независимо от его ёмкости он полностью поглощает вражеский удар независимо от силы этого удара (доступно в первом эпизоде в самом начале до боёв, если повернуть направо в пещерку с крокодилом),
Мистический меч (Sword of the Unknows) — довольно приличная скорость, а силу удара нужно накликать, причём легко достигнуть максимума, если быстро нажимать сразу две клавиши Z и Enter (доступно в первом эпизоде почти в самом начале, до «Мистической пещеры» — не пропустите), Это ваше основное оружие на все времена.
Что-нибудь быстрое, чтобы быстро добить сильно подраненного врага, пока не очухался, например Карандаш (Pencil),
Что-нибудь быстрое и мощное для первого удара, например, Топор (Powertron Axe)
Четвёртую и пятую позицию можно заменить ещё одним Мистическим мечом, перепройдя первый эпизод. Любой из эпизодов можно перепройти в любом порядке, при этом собранные предметы и «экспа» сохраняются.

Магия:
«Магия» в игре используется для усиления следующего удара или действия. Использование обязательно. Заряжаться следует через иконку батарейки. Для сильного заряда используйте крайне левую батареку — эффективное накликивание делается с помощью двух клавиш Z и Enter одновременно (легко достигнуть шестикратного усиления).
Вражеский удар можно частично блокировать, опять же с помощью клавиш Z или Enter. При этом пополняется шкала магии, так что не стоит пренебрегать этой возможностью.
Перечисленных «хитростей» более чем достаточно для прохождения официальных эпизодов. Помимо эпизодов можно запустить бесконечную волну врагов и посмотреть на сколько вас хватит.

Combat is boring and repetitive, abilities all feel weak, boring, a pain to use or all of the above, the art has zero consistency, feels like it does not properly scale with resolutions higher than 1080p, and just looks ugly to me, music and sound is acceptable at best and repetitive at worst, the story is eh and feels like it has nothing more to it than 80's tropes, the characters are all one dimensional, and the mechanics are all button mashing or stick flinging and I was straight up worried about damaging my keyboard so I went to my controller and then worried about mashing my A button to hell instead.

Игра не плохая, а просто…. бедноватая, и весьма однообразная. В ней есть, интересные и оригинальные идеи, но почти все они наваливаются разом в самом начале. В результате первый эпизод проходится на ура, однако вскоре начинаешь замечать недостатки. Сюжет, после вступления во втором эпизоде (а всего их 5), практически полностью пропадает, или точнее говоря, становится филлерным (Глав злыдень: На этот раз ты меня одолел, но в следующий раз! МОЯ ВОЗЬМЁТ ВЕРХ!!! … (Ну да, мы конечно тебе верим, но….)). Концовка же, в лучших традициях сериалов - “Продолжение следует!” (опять же, верим мы в это, аж зашибись как.…). Большая часть дополнительных квестов однообразна и в них, как правило, всё ограничивается поисками чего-то или кого-то, а так же дополнительными битвами (которых и без того немало).

Больше всего игра похожа на Costume Quest, где в главной роли выступает AVGN (точнее его «Good» версия, которая не матерится). Несмотря на то что игра пошаговая, мы управлять только одним персонажем. Здесь тьма тьмущая различных отсылок, большая часть которых пропитана тонким юмором, например, есть Ивл-Лин (из Хи-мена) с причёской принцессы Леи (Star Wars), а так же меня порадовало наличие разноцветных мишек в школе … впрочем, они обитают не только там. В Saturday Morning RPG трудно сделать первые шаги, но если у вас получится освоить основы, то какие-то серьёзные проблемы у вас уже вряд ли возникнут. А поскольку здесь показывают куда надо идти (в том числе и при выполнении большей части дополнительных квестов), чтобы осилить игру, от вас потребуется лишь базовое знание языка.

Before I even get into review proper and why I did something I basically never do it should be noted this is an incomplete game seeing as episode six is still missing. So that's already something going against the game, but it turns out it really didn't matter in this particular case because base product had enough problems.

At its core this is effectively a JRPG albeit one styled after Saturday morning cartoons of yore. Admittedly, not being a US resident it did not speak to me on that level specifically, but I get what it was going for. I was personally less into G.I. Joe and Transfomers, more into Conan the Adventurer and Bucky O'Hare myself. Game comes with that kinda derpy protagonist + geek friend included. So much so the entire first episode is actually a dream that sets you up for way more... or does it? Setting and episodic, literally and figuratively, approach to it is not one of the problems game suffers from. There's a HOOD commander who will totally get you next time, suspiciously familiar vehicle transforming robots who have a show-off of their own in one of the episodes, and plenty of pop culture references anyone in the know with media should recognize. For god's sake, the Wizard with his BAD glove is your spiritual guide early on.

It's mechanics and design where game fails, sadly. Episodes are mercifully relatively short which still manages to be a problem because for overwhelming majority of play time you'll be fighting couple of re-skinned enemy types. Pair it with simplistic combat system itself relying on timing defense hits to reduce damage or varying degrees of annoyance to execute attacks of your own and you have helluva time ahead of you. See, all of that isn't really a problem and other JRPGs have done it to varying degrees of success, but the real problem with Saturday Morning RPG lies in just how common place combat is. I got bored with it by the time episode two ended, and inventory management was a separate source of annoyance that reared its ugly head at about the same time. Your attacks depend on items you've found to equip and out of about three dozen I've found probably six that weren't completely annoying to use? Add to that sticker scratching you can do before combat to gain bonuses and you're looking at a prospect of tiring your thumbs out real fast.

Should you play this one? I'd advise against it unless you've tapped out all other JRPGs under the sun. If I was honest with myself I would've probably stopped way earlier, but I hoped game would improve as it went on.

Remember the eighties?
Remember sitting in front of your TV on Saturday morning, soaking up the cartoon goodness?
How it was all ridiculously over-the-top and crazy, but somehow, at the end of every half an hour episode, everything worked out?

Well, if you remember those days fondly, you'll find a lot to love in Saturday Morning RPG.
The trouble is, you'll also find less fun things there, too.
Memory can be a fickle thing.

[b]So, What Is Saturday Morning RPG?[/b]

Saturday Morning RPG is a RPG game that styles itself after Saturday Morning cartoons from the 80's.  There are ridiculous monsters, crazy quests and zany characters to meet as you make your way through little episodes that chronicle the life and times of Marty - our protagonist - as he goes up against his nemesis, Captain Hood.

Everything in Saturday Morning RPG plays to it's very eighties setup:  your powers are fun things like karate moves, or pizza health replenishers.  The graphics are all mostly sprite work with some beautiful backdrops for each battle you enter into.  The music and sounds are all very inspired by the eighties.  In short, it's a RPG love letter to that time period.

As Marty, you do quests which grant experience.  As you gain experience, you go up in levels.  Upon reaching a new level, you get to choose a stat [from a random set of two] to boost.  Your vanilla move set is always available to you in the form of regular punches that build up a ""power meter"" of sorts.  You can spend this power meter on either more devastating attacks that you pick up from around the world in the form of toys [more on that in a moment], but you can also just unleash a more potent punch.

Your more advanced moves come from pickups in the world.  Find a bandana?  Wear it [and four other such pickups] and now you have access to a special move granted by that bandana in your ""advanced moves"" category.  Most of these pickups are lying out in the world, but occasionally, you'll stumble across a vending machine where you can spend money to just outright buy the move sets you want [assuming that vending machine has those items.]

Combat is also regulated through passive abilities that you find as ""stickers"" in the world - find a little red carton of fast food on your travels?  Open it to discover a sticker.  The red boxes are fairly plentiful, but the purple boxes are more rare and grant more interesting passives [extra money, bonus experience, that sort of thing.]

These stickers go on a binder that has a cover which can also grant you passives.

By now you will have noticed that I'm talking about the combat an awful lot, and that's because while there is questing [and while the quests are zany and fun] many of them culminate in ""fight the bad guys and win.""  And that's where the cracks start appearing for this particular game.

Like the power glove, Saturday Morning RPG is ""so bad"" in the sense that - unfortunately - instead of leaning into it's premise, it almost literally drowns in it with far too many battles for it's own good.  This problem is compounded with the way battles work:  in order to maximize your power meter, you have three ways of building it:  mashing the buttons on your controller like a maniac, a flat boost [which takes longer to charge up] or a minigame in which you attempt to hit ""maximum"" by timing a button press correctly.

The ""rhythmic"" nature of the combat is abundant everywhere:  hitting your block button at the correct time deflects damage.  Timing hits on some enemies is crucial, lest they huddle up and shrug off all your incoming damage.  Sometimes, it's even crucial that you hold off on attacking at all so that you can build up power to unleash it all in one go to one shot an enemy, in case it starts healing up the other enemies surrounding it.

And this, then, is the part of Saturday Morning RPG that's exhausting.  The game is built around it's source material and then fed through a combat grinder.  There's too much of the combat, the combat feels too repetitive and all of this works against the game's overall fun factor.

This problem is exacerbated by the achievements.  Originally intended as a 20+ episode opus, the achievements [at one time] wanted you to kill an absurd number of enemies, collect a crazy amount of coin and generally do over the top legwork for full completion.  Some of this is still present [and at the time of this review, two achievements are functionally impossible.] though it's toned down to a point where the game won't consume thousands of hours [even so, my forty+ hours that are on-record are probably ""about right"" for a completionist run.]

[b]Does it all hang together and should you buy it?[/b]

Sort of?  If you're a fan of the aesthetics [they're lovely] and have a fondness for the eighties and don't mind a game that's literally dripping in references like that, you'll find a lot to like, here.  But you'll also grow very wary of the battle system.

If you like turn based games, then this one's tricky to recommend.  It is turn-based, but good grief!  That guage building nonsense is for the birds.

Either way, I strongly recommend watching some gameplay and I strongly recommend buying on sale.  This game's a bit of a tough sell at the best of times and I can't - in good conscience - suggest buying it full price [especially since the developers have basically up and abandoned the game.]

[b]Pros At A Glance[/b]

[list]
[*]Great aesthetics:  Wonderful pixel art and backgrounds.
[*]Fun references:  Sure.  There's LOTS of them and that might get tiring, but if you're into this sort of thing, you'll be quite happy.
[*]Great structure:  I'd love to see more episodic RPG's like this one.
[/list]

[b]Cons At A Glance[/b]

[list]
[*]Abandoned project:  This means there are broken achievements and a plot that's never fully resolved.
[*]That battle system:  Good grief.  Too many random battles, coupled with the way the system works actively make me resent it.
[*]Overzealous achievement requirements:  This has been dialed back a little, but they're still CRAZY, given the amount of content in this game.

Saturday Morning RPG stars Marty, a regular high school student turned hero and more pop culture references than Ready Player One. After getting powered up by a trapper keeper notebook with scratch n' sniff stickers he's ready to fight the the not quite copywrited forces of evil.

The game plays like a standard issue RPG, exploring areas, finding treasure, fighting enemies. All the stuff people would look for in an RPG. What stands this apart though is the fact that the game is episodic, like a Telltale game for example. Meaning you play through different episodes of the story that all connect together in an RPG format. This is actually a very interesting idea which I think would be good if it caught on. The battle system is nice and incorporates many different features from other RPG's to create a battle experience that is familiar but unique. The 8 bit/16 bit graphics do help keep the retro athestic going, not just as a retro game but as the throwback the game is meant to be. Finally, it's short. That's a plus for folks who don't have 100 hours to sink into an RPG. You can clear through this in about 6-7 hours.

While the game is good and clearly crafted with love, it could have done with a bit of polish overall. The absolute overabundance of pop culture references have the subilty of a sledgehammer and will bog you down by the end of episode 2 (out of 5). It causes the ""Yeah, I get it."" effect so often you'll be rolling your eyes constantly. Battle ends up being a cinch after leveling up a bit. Taking your time to beat up enemies you don't have to in the early episodes makes the later episodes almost trivial to do. Boss battles are no big deal either, just a normal enemy with larger health. All of the bosses actually end up summoning normal mooks to the fight as part of their normal routines, saldy robbing any actual challenge to bosses. Finally, it suffers from what all good 80's cartoon's suffered from, poorly cohesive writing. By Episode 3, and being bogged down by constant pop culture references, you start to realize that there isn't really a over arching plot so much as barely assosiated one offs. And yes that's what Saturday morning cartoons did back in the day, but at this point... we can do better.

If you ever thought about how boring it'd be to be in a saturday morning cartoon world, you can probably stop reading this review now. 

For those of you still reading, let me get deeper into why this game isn't fun. First of all, this game is absolutely nothing but combat. There's some questing, but it either leads to nothing, or it leads to more combat. As such, this game will live or die on it's combat. Unfortunately, a few decisions in how combat works makes it flawed to the point of being broken. So let me detail these

1) You regain all health and resources at the end of combat
2) your attacks(the ones that actually matter) are limited in use
3) You can ""charge up"" dragonball Z style by essentially standing there like a moron and screaming
4) Basically all attacks require a minigame

These 4 facts make combat completely fucking boring. Due to 2 you have to get the most out of every attack, so you use fact 3 and charge up to 9x to get the most out of every attack, and then use one of your limited attacks to defeat an enemy. All of this requiring a minigame, remember. You stand there, charging up repeatedly so that your attacks more or less instant hit. And then at the end, you regain all health, and then start over on another combat. Even if you removed fact 4, this still wouldn't be fun, but it'd be at least less  annoying.

Когда я увидел в первый раз игру на скриншотах, боялся ошибится и потратить лишние деньги на казалось бы никому не сдавшуюся игру. Однако, вспоминая изестную фразу ""Кто не рискует , тот не пьет шампанского"", с заплющенными глазами и дрожащими руками я купил свою первую игру в Стиме.Ею стала именно Saturday Morning RPG. До этого я проходил только Final Fantasy 4 (пиратку), Lunar The Silver Star, и начинал проходит Xenogears и Shin Megami Tensei. 
Когда я запустил игру, я... просто со слезами на глазах от хохота и радости начал проходить 1 эпизод. К концу эпизода у меня уже болел палец прожимать Z для энергии и заниматься мини-играми для попадания по врагам. Но я был счастлив. 
И это наверное главное.
Вкратце
Плюсы:
-Хороший юмор,обыгрывающий штуки из 80-тых(типа Жан Клод Ванн Дамба или организация ""H.O.O.D."" ,которая , вроде как,пародия на ""Кобра"" из G.I.Joе)
-Интересная боевая система,завязанная на тайминге и бонусах от стикеров
-Отображается вверху экрана порядок нападения врагов,что полезно

Минусы:
-Игра местами занудна и линейна
-Для наибольшей эффективность от предметов в бою нужен высокий множитель,который нужно увеличивать путем сверхзвукового прожимания кнопки Z.  Банально больно.
-(Возможно НЕ минус)Графика странная. Српайты не особо жалуют анимациями. А ключевые катсцены хотелось бы видеть с озвучкой.

Рекомендую эту игру людям, угорающим по 80-тым или тем,кто хочет найти простую, веселую и незамысловаюту игрушку на несколько вечеров.(И еще любителям ачивок с карточками,да)",1529947039,1529947039,True,2,0,0.499479711055755615,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The stickers will make you rage if you try to do this game in one go. Every fight you have to mash left and right arrow keys to get buffs that will help you win fights. I've played midway in the second episode. The power ups are cool and the effects they do on attack are awesome. 
If I wasn't a fan of pixel art and retro game styles and rpg's with a bit of comedy then I doubt this game would appeal to me. If you get the comedic refrences and love the art and rpgs then don't pass this up.

[h1]Что это?[/h1]
В основном IMHO это идея создания платформы для регулярной генерации виртуального попкорна в виде игрового JRPG-подобного сериала. Графика была сознательно принесена в жертву нарочито бедовому, специально для обладателей шапочек из фольги, сценарию. По ходу дела везде, где можно, лепятся отсылки к попкультуре (американской естественно). Игра не требует особого внимания, поэтому в фоне можно слушать аудиокнигу.

[h1]Получилось ли?[/h1]
Скорее нет, чем да. Игра вышла в 2012 году (iOS), в 2012 же были добавлены ещё две серии, а пятая вышла в январе 2017, причём (что крайне важно для меня) для Linux версии пятая серия недоступна до сих пор (конец лета 2017). По всей видимости разработчикам для активного развития серии очевидно не хватает мотивации. Возможно на сегодня альтернативы платным DLC для сериалов скорее нет, чем есть.

[h1]Хитрости боя[/h1]
Если хочется больше попкорна, то безусловно показано попробовать каждый из доступных ГГ (его зовут Марти и у него есть антигравитационная доска — ничего не напоминает?) типов предметов, атакующих и не очень. Почти каждый из предметов несёт с собой простенькую «миниигру» или как минимум уникальный визуальный ряд. Но на деле приходится ограничиться пятью предметами и я рекомендую:
[list]
[*] Печеньки (Cookie) — для восполнения жизни (доступно с самого начала),
[*] Радужная повязка (Color Belt) — для установке щита, особенностью щита является то, что независимо от его ёмкости он полностью поглощает вражеский удар независимо от силы этого удара (доступно в первом эпизоде в самом начале до боёв, если повернуть направо в пещерку с крокодилом),
[*] Мистический меч (Sword of the Unknows) — довольно приличная скорость, а силу удара нужно накликать, причём легко достигнуть максимума, если быстро нажимать сразу две клавиши Z и Enter (доступно в первом эпизоде почти в самом начале, до «Мистической пещеры» — не пропустите), Это ваше [i]основное[/i] оружие на все времена.
[*] Что-нибудь быстрое, чтобы быстро добить сильно подраненного врага, пока не очухался, например Карандаш (Pencil),
[*] Что-нибудь быстрое и мощное для первого удара, например, Топор (Powertron Axe)
[/list]
Четвёртую и пятую позицию можно заменить ещё одним Мистическим мечом, перепройдя первый эпизод. Любой из эпизодов можно перепройти в любом порядке, при этом собранные предметы и «экспа» сохраняются.

«Магия» в игре  используется для усиления следующего удара или действия. Использование обязательно. Заряжаться следует через иконку батарейки. Для сильного заряда используйте крайне левую батареку — эффективное накликивание делается с помощью двух клавиш Z и Enter одновременно (легко достигнуть шестикратного усиления).

Вражеский удар можно частично блокировать, опять же с помощью клавиш Z или Enter. При этом пополняется шкала магии, так что не стоит пренебрегать этой возможностью. 

Перечисленных «хитростей» более чем достаточно для прохождения официальных эпизодов. Помимо эпизодов можно запустить бесконечную волну врагов и посмотреть на  сколько вас хватит.

[h1]GNU/Linux[/h1]
К порту нет никаких претензий, всё работает как должно: Ubuntu 16.04, ноутбук со встроенной графикой Intel® HD Graphics 4400. Есть претензия к разработчикам, которые «кинули» (другого слова у меня пока нет) пользователей GNU/Linux  с пятым эпизодом.

RPG vecchio stile ispirato ai cartoni americani del sabato mattina. Non molto divertente.

Sicuramente le citazioni sono moltissime, così come gli easter egg e simili, ma il sistema di combattimento risulta noioso fin dai primi minuti di gioco. Certo potere usare oggetti comuni di ogni giorno come armi aiuta, ma ben presto useremo sempre lo stesso set di oggetti che è efficace contro qualunque nemico.

La trama è una delle più anonime che possa esistere quasi senza colpi di scena e sorprese, il nostro eroe Marty deve sconfiggere in ogni episodio il super-cattivo che minaccia la città, fine.
Sembra una delle ""fiabe brevi che finiscono malissimo"", solo che alla fine finisce bene.

Non mi è piaciuto, magari perché non ho colto tutti i riferimenti ai vari programmi televisivi e cartoni, oppure perché né la trama, né il sistema di combattimento sono interessanti o divertenti.

Saturday morning RPG è stato più una perdita di tempo che altro.

If you're familiar with G.I. Joe, Transformers, Care Bears, Back to the Future, Michael Jackson, Top Gun, or Jean Claude Van Damme, you will find many chuckles to be had throughout the course of the game.

You play as Marty, and the game is played through 5 episodes, each introducing unique locations and characters to the overall plot. Gameplay itself mostly consists of the standard RPG elements: Explore, level up, complete quests, and advance the storyline. Your party will always be a one-person affair, but this is acceptable due to the customization options available to Marty. 

You will find stickers, 5 of which can be scratched prior to each battle to give Marty bonuses (or debuffs for enemies). In addition to this, there is a pretty big selection of items that Marty may also equip. Each of these items is an attack that Marty can perform in battle, and each item ranges in damage, speed, accuracy, and uses per battle. Many of these items also have unique QTEs that give the fighting a bit of flavor as well. Add this with a charging system that is required to make your attacks more lethal, and a timing system that puts emphasis on speed as well, and there's actually a little strategy required in some of the fights.

The music is also pretty good. It probably won't make many Top 10 lists, but it is quite fitting for the gameplay.

Prometía abundantes referencias a mi niñez de caricaturas y películas: Volver al futuro, G.I. Joe, He-Man, Michael Jackson, Space Jam, etcétera. Pues sí cumple, sí tiene estas cosas. Y están bien trabajadas, bien… puestas, una junto a otra, en procesión, en la misma caja. ¿Entonces por qué…? Y luego sigue la historia. Te dan un cuaderno mágico, ¡radical!, y este cuaderno mágico tiene pegatinas (stickers, pues) y portadas ¡radicales! que cambian tus habilidades y atributos. ¿Y por qué diablos me siento tan dudoso con este juego? 

* Quizás, este es el primer RPG que juego en la vida donde sólo manejas a un personaje. Jugué dos episodios y no hubo señal de algún compañero, algún otro personaje con cual identificarme, o relacionarme, o quejarme. Mi única esperanza era seguir utilizando a este reflejo retorcido de Marty McFly (el personaje principal) y crear una especie de… compenetración. En dos capítulos no sucedió. 

* La historia, por supuesto, desde el principio, prometía ser absurda. No esperaba otra cosa, pero… bueno, quizás este es un claro ejemplo de porqué meter un bonche de referencias no es suficiente para alimentar una historia. Sobre todo un RPG episódico, escrito por diferentes personas. Y un RPG vive y se disfruta mucho más, al menos, gracias a una historia convencional y estructurada. Si no están buscando una historia, tal vez puedan disfrutar este juego y sus referencias constantes a las caricaturas del sábado por la mañana (en el gringo, claro, lo que nosotros los mexicanos veíamos entre semana, después de la escuela). 

* En cuanto a la jugabilidad: El juego es una perra difícil. Ganar una batalla puede considerarse un verdadero triunfo. Prepárate para que te duelan los dedos y cambiar de controles porque vas a estar button mashing y meneando las palancas como si no hubiera mañana. Y claro, como sólo usas a un personaje, algunas veces te vas a sentir más solo que nunca, y totalmente en desventaja, cuando debas enfrentarte a tres soldados cobra, un sniper y un hombre lagartija. 

* La pregunta difícil: ¿Recomiendo este juego? No lo sé. Obviamente los desarrolladores trabajaron muy duro y, supongo, en otras circunstancias este juego me hubiera entusiasmado mucho. Lo intenté dos veces, durante dos capítulos, y simplemente me repele. ¿Será la dificultad? El diseño del juego no es malo, es una obvia referencia, y más referencias, todo es una referencia. Y eso está bien, pero… ¿por qué? ¿Por qué no aprovechar el gran talento que tiene el equipo para hacer algo original, arriesgarse un poco, dejar de pitorrearse o de bañarse en nostalgia? ¿Por qué no hacer algo nuevo? Ah, no lo sé. Seré sincero: no recomiendo este juego para todos. Supongo que requiere a un estilo de jugador muy especial y yo no entro en el target.

The combat system could be deeper, but it's adequate to make the battles exciting and often challenging.

I was particularly impressed with the writing. The authors managed to combine some of the best storytelling elements of early RPG's with mid-1980s' cartoon serials. Like it's inspirations, the game's stories are funny yet also morally sincere. The snarky irony of 1990-current storytelling is conspicuous by its absence.

Overall, if you love RPGs, you'll want this in your collection. It's a definite win.

Pros: Wonderful writting, well developed turn based gameplay, more than just the main story to play, great soundtrack

Cons: not a lot of episodes right now (i assume more are on the way), (if you're using the keyboard) the z,x,c,v buttons are your action buttons for battle at times and you may accidentally hit other buttons (this sceme cannot be changed)

Mein ursprünglich negatives Urteil hat sich inzwischen zu einem positiven gewandelt. Doch warum war mein Review zuerst negativ?
Zuerst fand ich das Spiel ganz ok, aber dann wurde es schnell recht frustrierend, da in den Kämpfen das Glück eine viel zu grosse Rolle zu spielen schien. Nachdem ich schon frustriert aufgegeben hatte und eben mein schlechtes Review geschrieben habe, stutzte ich ob all der positiven Wertungen. War ich einfach zu blöd?
Jein. Ich hatte tatsächlich einen fatalen Fehler gemacht, denn mir war nicht bewusst, dass ich durch Tastendruck Angriffe abwehren kann. Das fand ich aber nur mittels mühsamster Recherche heraus. Das Spiel sagt einem das einmal am Anfang schnell. Wenn man das wie ich irgendwie verpasst, hat man keine Chance es zu merken.
Und damit bin ich beim grössten Manko: Die Dokumentation. Das Spiel hat keine Anleitung, es gibt im Internet keine guten Guides und man muss sich seine Infos mühsam aus Steamforumseinträgen,d er Entwicklerhomepage und einer seehr spärlichen Wiki zusammentragen. Das ist ganz klar ungenügend!
Wenn man das überwunden hat, dann macht das Spiel aber ordentlich Spass. Ich habe vermutlich nicht einmal die Hälfte aller Anspielungen verstanden. Trotzdem waren diejenigen, die ich verstanden habe witzig bis sehr lustig. Die Stories sind ok, nichts weltbewegendes aber ebenfalls gut unterhaltsam.
Die Optik des Spieles gefällt mir trotz Pixellook. Ich finde ihn sehr stimmig. Die Steuerung ist ok, aber gerade beim navigieren im Notizbuch war ich sehr froh um meine Maus.
Ein klares Highlight des Spiels sind die vielen z.T. schrägen Gegenstände, die dann alle als Waffen in den Kämpfen dienen. Das macht sehr Laune, allerdings mit zwei abers: Auch hier fehlt die Dokumentation oder das Feedback des Spiels um die ""Waffen"" wirklich zu verstehen. Was bringt nun wie viel und warum und so weiter. Vieles ist ausprobieren, aber nicht im guten Sinne. Dazu kommt, dass die Kämpfe recht wiederholend werden und v.a. das ""Sticker kratzen"" vor einem Kampf fand ich nahc kürzester Zeit nur noch obernervig.

Fazit: Wer gerne humorvolle Nostalgie erlebt und Spass an Anspielungen auf Back-to-the-Future, Jean-Claude van Damme, Glücksbärchis und vielen mehr hat, der wird bei diesem Spiel gut bis sehr gut unterhalten und wird die einigen Macken auch gut übersehen können.",1451730289,1451730289,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Saturday Morning RPG is that goofy RPG we all want but any big company would laugh right out of the meeting room.

You play as Marty who is an ordinary high school student, but in his dreams he becomes a superhero by way of a magical notebook that turns ordinary items into superpowered weapons.   He then gets to fight enemies right out of the cliche world of Saturday Morning cartoons!  

Crafted with wit and humor the world of Saturday Morning RPG is a silly break from the modern styled realistic video game you are used to.

The game has some crazy achievements, such as fighitng 1,000 and even up to 5,000 battles, based on an initial idea of 20 episodes. Since it didn't do well, they had to limit their ambitions to six episodes, hopefully with a fine tuning of the achievements in the future. 

But why is all this necessary? The game has everyone a gamer would be looking for. A series of episodes with a simple story, with tons of nostalgic references for one thing. I mean the main character is a guy named Marty, who rides a hoverboard, and gets his powers from a mysterious man known as The Wizard. The retro graphics are a joy to behold, the music is killer, and the gameplay is a very solid Paper Mario/Super Mario RPG type of thing, with button presses for better defense and better attacks. 

Not to mention your magic spells use everyday objects, from cookies and paper airplanes, to swords and baseball bats, up to toy aircraft carriers and transformer-like figurines. Hell even your notebook plays a part in the game as depending on the cover and the stickers you can enact various bonuses before each battle.

As it stands at this time there are four episodes, with total time of about 10 hours to get through all of them. There is an arena mode against two semi-tough bosses, and endless battle challenges based around each chapter. You can get the grindy achievements I mentioned earlier legitimately, but my first run through the game got me less then even 100 battles, not counting everything else. Still if you want to, the game is a pleasure to play, and with the huge episode 5 coming early next year, there's no time like the present to get in and get ready for it.

The visuals are nostalgically pixelated, so if you like that kind of graphic you'll enjoy the look of this game. The music is incredible, that's probably my favourite part of this game. Every song and theme is composed very well in addition to the audio quality being fantastic.

The story has a very ""Saturday morning TV show"" feel to it, which makes sense considering the title of this game.

Today i will review the game SATURDAY MORNING RPG. This game is directly influenced by the 1980's, when saturdays were fun to watch tv cartoons, and mixed up with rpg elements. There are alot of cameos also in the game including, Care Bears, Transformers, GI JOE, Fraggle Rock, and many others that i cannot even mention because it would take almost all my review to do so.

As for the game itself, it plays much like a rpg where you need to fight monsters to grind levels, find items to use on certain places, and retrieve things to use and give to others. Basically, everything you expect in a rpg. The game also does not take itself serious. It is quite campy and silly. There are alot of small things in the game that may make you laugh or those moments when you go ""oooohhhh"".

It seems for the most part, it works on windows 10. There is other problems though. According to the forum, the game is dead. The developer no longer works on it anymore, and the pc version is missing a episode that the nintendo switch version has. This means the developer has abadon this version and moved on. Someone suggested they may come back, but we will see. There are also broken achievements.

With the above issue of no more content and the developer seems to abadoned this game, which is quite sad, i cannot no longer recommend this game until the developer decided to actually FINISH the game. The game as it is now is unfinished.

It is an episodic RPG game with Final Fantasy styled encounters. Quite possibly one of the most fun little games I've ever picked up off the Steam store. The episodes are around 30 minutes long. Just around the length of a Saturday morning cartoon. The combat system is easy to get used to and works well with an Xbox controller. Tons of fhidden items in the game that you should find but don't worry, if you don't find something on your first playthrough you can return to the episode and play it through again and find what you missed. Definitely recommend buying this game if you come across it while it's on sale.

- Short Episodes
- Fun Combat
- Great Story Writing/Jokes
- Replayable

Also be prepared for muscle cramps, as the combat system leans heavily on unforgiving quicktime events.

Подросшее поколение восьмидесятых-девяностых очень любит вспоминать своё детство, снова играть в игры на Денди и Сеге, пересматривать мультики, которыми засматривались в детстве и всё такое прочее. В этом явлении на самом деле нет ничего особо плохого, история вообще цикличная штука, да вот только многие недобросовестные коммерсанты повадились на этой нашей черте паразитировать, выпуская абсолютно никчемные и низкопробные продукты, которые тем ни менее всё равно окупятся, потому что в них пиксельная графика или они отсылают к каким-нибудь ностальгическим темам. Бывают, конечно, и хорошие примеры, но это, увы ни один из них.

О, да, реклама очень завлекательна. Она якобы приглашает нас вернуться в мир мультиков нашего детства и пережить невероятные приключения со всеми-всеми любимыми героями, да ещё и в таком достаточно перспективном жанре как РПГ. С заслатной беленой сладостных воспоминаний глазами мы бежим покупать и затем видим... что на деле не всё так радужно как нам рисуют. Во-первых, в игре крайне мало предметов и миров и в ряде мест, нам даже не дадут особо выбрать, что мы хотим использовать. Во-вторых, от РПГ тут только одно название, прокачки толком нет или она просто ни на что особо не влияет. В-третьих, геймплей на 98 процентов сводится к крайне унылой и однообразной боевке, которая почти гарантировано надоест вам уже в первые минут десять игры, а то и быстрее. И в-четвертых враги очень часто сильнее вас и когда в других это нормально, потому что ну вы просто не подготовились ещё или не натренировались, тут это смотрится довольно глупо. Ну и в-пятых, хотя это тоже так не серьёзное обвинение, а просто маленькая придирка, графика в игре 3D с лишь закосом под пиксельную. И это не смертельно, но ощущение ""ламповости"", согласитесь, сильно снижает. 
 Короче, если хотите понастольгировать, вернуться в детство и всё такое, лучше правда поищите те старые мультики где-нибудь в записях (благо это не проблема в информационную эру), перепройдите какие-нибудь игрухи на Сеге или Денди или на ПК старые.

It's not a gem of crazy humor in itself but mostly in the eyes of the player who picture himself and his childhood through the eyeglass of an older person. 
Moreover you can enjoy a pre-battle and in-battle tactical system that it's easy enough to get but gives you a decent rate of improvent and learning. Basically, you have to combine power-ups and buffers and the tools you use in battle, so the options are vary and not repetitive and suit the rpg concept of the game. To add more flavour (said by a very clumsy guy) the developers put into a certain number of minigames, mostly to trigger weapon and tools side effects and to charge up your attacks (I'm not using a mouse and I'm regretting it).

However, if you're younger and don't remember those times - you'll miss a lot of gags and references - especially since you're probably, since you're reading this, not an American living in those years either.
In this game the witty dialogues and the plot itself are the biggest attraction.

The gameplay itself is based on turn-based combat, which requires us to choose our initial attacks and react with QTEs. There is so much going on during the fights that the farther into the woods we go, the harder it is to click all those attacking buttons in time.
It will take us a while to get used to it.

Saturday Morning RPG is a treasure for old people. Who feel sentimental about their youth and would like something to remind them of it. From the humor to the gameplay everything here is very well conceived and executed - I find it hard to complain about anything - My rating is eight chocolate stars.

Battles are somehow lenghty hence why it becomes really boring in the long run, since it's the same strategy each and every battle, recharge , attack , recharge, attack , until you win.
The items attack animations are really cool though, using a carebear to shoot carelasers from your chest and such.

Everything from the music, to the quests, to the NPC dialog perfectly captures both my real and imaginary life from that time period - I love it.
Speaking somewhat less subjectively. The episodes are short - for me that's a bonus. Each one took me 45-80 minutes for the first run through, and that was fully exploring. But that is perfect if you don't have a lot of time and want to feel like you're accomplishing something in a gaming session. Also, there is some replay value, as you get to keep all your new shinies when you replay a level, so you can experience the satisfaction of instantly obliterating a baddie that gave you trouble the first time around. But I can see how a short game would be unsatisfying to some players. But don't say it's not worth the $$. It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.
Also the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.
No the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember? 
That said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only ""Ugg, this is unbearable"" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please ""risk"" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game.

If you grew up in that era you'll find this game hilariously entertaining.  If you're too young to remember those decades, you'll probably miss all the parodies and references (you've been warned).  The episodic storyline and witty dialogue are the highlights here.

The gameplay is fun too.  It's a turn-based combat system that requires input (timed button presses, QTEs) throughout each battle.  There is a lot going on during combat, even a pre-combat buff/de-buff minigame, which can seem a little over-complicated at first.  It may take a few battles to become comfortable with the game mechanics.  Also, the difficulty can be scaled in several different ways so it's flexible for any skill level.

The only problem I had is that the pre-battle minigame is hell on your analog stick.  Luckily you can just use the mouse then grab your controller for the rest of the battle. 

Saturday Morning RPG is a great game; a real hidden gem.  Just be aware that the story and humor were designed with a specific age group in mind:  those who enjoyed saturday morning cartoons of the 80's and early 90's.

Two big reasons why:

the first crime is Saturday Morning RPG is obviously imitating 90's jRPGs. While it gets the walking around the world part right, the jRPG style battles are god awful. I get the designers' decision to make the process involved with timed button presses, but they went overboard. Almost every attack relies on button mashing or QTEs. Worse is your character is so freaking weak your basic and special attacks hardly do anything to enemies so the battles drag needlessly. To be fair, there is a charge move that multiplies the damage your next attack does. Unfortunately charge is so OP I find myself relying almost entirely on it just to effectively damage normal enemies. And, of course, the charge move that gives you the best bonus is the one that involves hammering on a single button. REALLY annoying. The combat is easily bad enough that it ruins the game.

the second crime is the soundtrack is not included with the game or offered as a download. The music was co-composed by Vince DiCola. If you don't know who that is, he composed the instrumental tracks for the Transformers The Movie (also the awesome montage medley in Rocky IV which undeservely won a razzie) so Saturday Morning RPG has the exact same super cheesy 80's synth sound and its a perfect fit for the game and its theme. The OST is wonderful. I'm actually really ticked I can't listen to it!

Aside from these 2 issues, Saturday Morning RPG does everything else correctly. It crams as many sly references to 80's and early 90's Americana (including a Fruit Stripe reference) into its cliched cartoony plots that seem heavily biased towards Transformers and GI Joe (not complaining). Nostalgia is a big part of the enjoyment if you're old enough to pick up on most of it. The writing is actually good. There's a lot of awfully odd and amusing flavor text sprinkled thorughout. In fact, most of the references in the game are amusingly cornball nonsense.

SM-RPG (welch reizvolle Abkürzung) ist ein nettes Spiel für zwischendurch. Ein RPG - wie es der Name verrät - ist es im klassischen Sinne: Man selbst steuert aus einer festen Drop-Down-Perspektive den Helden durch insgesamt 4 Episoden und darf sich sichtbaren / vordefinierten / vorplatzierten Gegnern auf der Map stellen. Das Spiel wechselt dann in einen Rundenkampfmodus, bei dem man - ähnlich wie in ""Southpark - The Stick of Truth"" oder ""Child of Light"" - gewohnt mittels Befehle interagieren kann.
Die Auswahlmöglichkeiten der Tätigkeiten ist aber arg klein und bleibt es das Spiel auch über - Normal angreifen, Spezialfähigkeit oder Aufladen des Schadenmultiplikators.

Normal angreifen ist meist Schmarn, also wird eine der vorm Kampf definier- und auflad-, aber im Kampf aufbrauchbaren Spezialfähigkeit genutzt. Diese machen aber nur Sinn, wenn der Schadensmultiplikator hoch ist - wofür man eine Extrarunde zum Aufladen braucht. Das Schema läuft also immer gleich ab: Aufladen - Töten - Aufladen - Töten - Aufladen - Schädigen - Töten - Gewinnen. Dank der besonders in Episode 2 stark ansteigenden Gegnerdichte ging mir das anfangs spaßige, aber nach ca. 1,5 h eintönig werdende Spielprinzip langsam auf den Sack.

Trotzdem lohnt es sich, wenn man es konditioniert spielt, weil die wahnwitzigen Story- und Questhintergründe und der Hang zum überdrehten Wahnsinn einfach zu beeindrucken wissen. Die Waffen (wie eine Floppydisk oder ein Gamecontroller, der immer wieder ein altes Atariminigame einbringt) sind einfach einfallsreich und witzig. Das Spielprinzip bleibt jedoch immer gleich - Hol- & Bringaufgaben und dann immer wieder sinnlose Kloppereien. So richtig ""stark"" wird man aber irgendwie leider nicht.

Hab ich aus einem Bundle und empfehle ich jeden auch so oder im Sale abzustauben.

His goal is to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world- and to stop them by using as many 80s pop-culture references as he can cram in his Trapper Keeper.  You can attach scratch-and-sniff stickers to your binder to give you special powers and increased stats when you scratch them, but let's face it- Marty's no Lion-O when it comes to battle.  Relying on physical attacks just won't get you anywhere- instead, you can rely on those same pop-culture shoutouts, like giant plastic playsets (like G.I. Joe's old giant carriers) and rainbow-striped zebras, and obvious knockoffs of Care Bears to do damage. 

If you remember the late 80s, you'll love all the shoutouts to cartoons that anyone born after the early 90s will never get the references to- if you were born later, you'll love the game for its playstyle- it's easy to pick up, fun to play, and it won't run you that much.  There are four episodes currently- if you count the overly short and played-up-for-cheesiness Christmas Special, and I'd like to see a fifth, if they ever decide to make one- or a sequel.",1412557803,1412557803,True,79,6,0.820086836814880371,0,True,False,False,False,,,

(I played this game with a Xbox controller so for the sake of this review I will using the Xbox buttons).
The combat in this game is turn based like your average olden days RPG, however it has timing aspect to it. This includes pressing A at the right time to block enemies attack so they deal less damage to you, doing small mini games in some of your spells and starting every battle spinning your joystick to get buffs that you choose beforehand in your little notepad. Some of the powers include spawning rainbows out of you to attack your enemies, playing simon says to kill the enemies and I would go over all of them but I feel as if I would be spoiling it for you if I did.
The story is broken up into 4 episodes (soon to be 5) where our hero, marty is trying to save the world from Commander Hood while trying to gain the affection of his crush, now that may sound cliché but trust me, this story is anything but cliché, It is incredibly enjoyable to watch play out and obviously you have dem sweet sweet side missions during the episodes which I found myself laughing at on multiple occasions.
Oh you finished the game you say, well you can also replay old episodes with your now stronger character whom you can also take into arena mode to fight stronger versions of enemies, also an endless battle mode where you choose an episode and fight endless waves of enemies from that part of the game, and of course you have leaderboards so you can show all your friends just how much better than them you are.
The only thing I dislike is the length of each of the episodes if you were to ignore all the side missions you could finish the first 2 episodes in around an hour or two, however if you are playing an RPG and not doing side missions and exploring, Then you are doing RPGs wrong, oh and you also get XP for exploring which is great.

However, even if you did not grow up in the 80's I think you will enjoy this game as long as you like a good old school RPGs.

Pros:

- great dialogue that will make you chuckle, even if you don't get all the references it is relatable enough for anyone to get a laugh out of the characters in this game.

-fun turn based combat- think super mario RPG, if you never played that shame on you, you really should, but basically it is turn based but with timed button presses.  Different moves you do bring up different mini games that require timing to inflict max damage.  Also when enemies attack you, timed button presses reduce the damage dealt, the better your timing the less damage they inflict.

- lots of cool items to collect, the weapons in this game are varied and funny and range from ordinary stuff like baseball bats to some bizzare things like simon says and fruit stripes gum.  

-free DLC coming in the future, 4 episodes right now and the game will probably take you roughly 4-5 hours to finish if you do most of the side quests (you will want to, as they are generally worth a chuckle), the developer has confirmed episode 5 is coming soon which will be free, any future episodes will also be free.

-epsiodic layout gives the game a nice feel, each level is large enough on its own and riddled with secrets and side quests and the episodic nature of the game means you don't have to worry about doing any boring backtracking which is all too common in RPG's

cons

-linear character development, not a huge con but if your into branching paths and stuff like that you won't get it here, you quickly learn that magic is the best, you will pour your stats into that and wreak havoc with your flying laser discs and karate kid headbands.

Overall if you are into turn based rpg's with fun combat system and a funny story you will like this.

The main character Marty has a vivid dream about the super villain Hood as he kidnaps the hero's love interest. Equipped with a magical notebook, he gets from a spontaneously appearing wizard, Marty makes his way into the enemy main base. And so begins the first episode of SMRPG.
 
Gameplay

SMRPG features the very classical RPG Systems. Top down view while travelling through the overworld, doing some quest and turn based battles when engaging an enemy in the overworld. If you don't know what a RPG is, well, you missed quite a lot of video game culture. If a battle get started you switchSaturday Morning RPG 01 to a battle screen. During the course of the game you only have Marty as playable character, so goodbye party formations. The enemy side can consist of up to three opponents with varying color scheme. Luckily the devs got every scheme unique looks and features. Your different actions in the battle consists of a normal punch, a power up move and the various tools and toys you collect in your adventure. You get stuff like a floppy disk, a transformer, or even the power of a share bear. All with varying stats and effects. For some of them you need to beat a little mini game to unlock ist full power, but nothing really difficult. The power up action is a neat little feature. You have a damage multiplier in the lower left corner, that you can increase with every action. You have three possible options for that, two of them are mini games where you either need to press the button multiple times, or in the right moment, and an option where it happens automatically. You lose a round by doing that, but you get a multiplier increase of three or four points each time, so the pay of is quite nice.

Story (Spoiler Warning)

This game is a living 80s reference. The main character Marty travels on
a hoverboard (Who can guess his last name?), transformers, Share Bears, and a villain who comes back every week with a new idea to take over the world. The game currently consists of four episodes. The first is a dream episode, Saturday Morning RPG 02where Marty gets ist power and rescues the girl of his dreams. Sadly it's only a dream and this girl is still together with the greatest jerk in school, bet, hey, at least he can keep his new powers and in the next episode he can use them against this giant death laser his arch-villain commander hood has hidden under his school and ruins the bake sale with it. With the third episode you see a little change in style, because this time you have nothing better to do than fighting giant evil transformers. And saving the city dam on that way. In episode four the devs proudly presents you the christmas special episode, where you need to save christmas and bring back all the stolen presents. (guess who did that) In the end of the episode you even see a nice surprise.

Future

Currently only four of once 20 planned episodes are in the game. The problem was that this game was first made for iOS and didn't really well there. But since it's on steam now the sales are much better and the good guy devs promised to bring out new episodes FOR FREE. Episode 5 and 6 are even in production right now. And that'S good, because there are some loose ends from a few side quests i really want to know how that's going to end.

Conclusion

Pro:
- Classical old school RPG
- many 80s references
- Entertaining story
Con:
- low content at the moment
You have a nice looking game on your hand here. If you take your time to do all side quest you can get around 5 to 10 hours of fun out of it, depending if replaying some episodes, which some side quests and the achievements encourage. The battle system works flawlessly, the story is good and there a lot stuff to collect to keep you occupied. But see for yourself, theres nothing that can go wrong with it. And if still have concerns wait for a steam sale. A 75% Off will definitely convince you to buy it.

I can already tell you that although I've only played the first chapter of Saturday Morning RPG, I can unequivocally recommend it!

Even if you aren't a child of the 80s, this is an amazing ride not to be missed!

UPDATE:  7/21/14

I finally completed Saturday Morning RPG, clocking  in at just over 10 hours.  The game is so good that this seemed a tad short.  However, looking at its Steam page, there will be a 5th episode released as a free update!  

So what do I think of Saturday Morning RPG now?  This is THE BEST RPG I've played just behind the Mass Effect Trilogy, and Oblivion, which are my number 1 & 2 favorites respectively!  That's saying quite a bit since I play a lot of RPG's.  I'd have to say this is even better than Might and Magic III, Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Final Fantasy 7&10, Super Mario RPG, and Costume Quest!

As a man born in the 80s I loved many of the references to the cartoons of that era.

However, nostalgia is not the only thing this game has going for it. Nor is the fantastic soundtrack. The battle system itself proved to be surprisingly addictive, to the point where a considerable chunk of my time playing was spent in the Endless battle mode. The battle system reminded me of the likes of Paper Mario, with having only one character and emphasizing tactics over level-grinding, especially if the difficulty option is set to level the enemies to match the player.

You can generally tell if a game's retro-style sprites are a stylistic choice, or a sign of laziness on the part of the developer- the former being graphics like those of Mega Man 9 and 10, which have real effort behind them and would have been considered top-of-the-line during the period of gaming they imitate, while the latter often would be considered ugly even by early NES standards. For Saturday Morning RPG, I'd say it falls quite squarely in the stylistic choice category- I could easily imagine the sprites wouldn't look too out of place on a 16-bit era title. Your mileage may vary on how willing you are to have that merged with the 3D backgrounds, but for me it reminded me of how things worked with some PS1 classics like Star Ocean: Second Story, Breath of Fire III, and Tomba. (Yep, I got some 90s nostalgia out of it too, not just 80s.)

The buyer should be aware this game is short. Its four episodes are written to feel like episodes out of a Saturday Morning cartoon, and their length is set accordingly. The plotlines are very much self-contained, and emphasize nostalgia-related humor over deeper storytelling. I still considered it well worth the small price tag and then some (liked it enough to buy it twice, even- Ouya and PC versions!), but don't go expecting $7 to buy you a Final Fantasy-class epic. I read there's plans for two more episodes in the future, but I've no idea how far in the future.

It is clear from playing the game that it is in a league of it's own. The graphics work well for the type of game that it is - a homage to the 1980's and early 90's culture.

It was very rewarding to play this game - it was FUN. It was a feel-good experience and I just hope there is more of this game. DLC? Count me in DAY ONE!

EDIT: UPDATE - August 23, 2015 - I've started playing the game again to get achievements and complete levels. Doing that really takes the gameplay to a new level and increases the challenge. Playing the game fully takes a game that was a ""quick playthrough"" and turns it into a full gaming experience. 

Returning to the game after playing it once gives new perspective. The game is STILL fun, enjoyable and well made. I would still highly recommend it to others.

EDIT: UPDATE - August 25, 2015 - This game has been due for an update for the past two years. EPISODE 5 was due two years ago, but has been pushed to ""summer 2015"" as per the games Steam page selling the games soundtrack. It's 2015 and there is no update yet. This is important because this game has achievements and one of them is ""complete 5 episodes"" - and you can't do this with the current 4 episodes that are released.

As much as I love this game, other players need to know that there is an UPDATE DELAY that impacts the ability to play the game and makes 100% completion impossible.  I have posted twice on the facebook group of Saturday Morning RPG but there is no word from the developer. I will update this as needes.",1404956717,1440548814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Longer review: Buy this game, because it has a lot of elements coming together in the right ways. The gameplay has a classic JRPG feel, but still does its own thing. It's turn based, with timed attacks (and defenses). There's enough complexity to make strategy more than just selecting the same attack every time. You can select several stickers, that give combat buffs (or to your enemies, debuffs), as well as your special attacks in the form of items. These are balanced in terms of speed, power, accuracy, as well as price. One item might do massive damage, but be costly, or take a long time to be used once selected, or maybe not always hit. A big part of the strategy is selecting the best prefight equipment. 

The episodes are decent length, about an hour or so, depending on how much you like to explore and do side quests. What I really appreciated was the lack of artificial extension. The game doesn't have you backtrack, or wander around to find where you need to go. Objectives are clear, and you can always tell where you need to go by arrows on screen. It keeps the game moving quickly if you want to rush, but you're also free to explore, talk to characters, and just enjoy the environments.

While it's fun enough as an RPG, the overall atmosphere is the main draw. It lives and breathes nostalgia for the 80s (and early 90s), and anyone who spent their childhood watching Transformers, or playing with GIJoe will have an extra appreciation for it. Though, even if you weren't a kid in the US during the 80s/early 90s, you can still appreciate it. 

The nostalgia isn't forced, or bled dry. It's just there, so the game feels like it's of the era, rather than just looking back at it. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the humor is subtle. In short, the game has charm.

My only complaint would be the lack of length. It doesn't have 100+ hours of gameplay... probably more like 10-20 until you get bored (I clocked in about 16 hours, when counting replaying the episodes, and trying out the arenas). Still, those will be pretty fun 10-20 hours.",1404637210,1404637210,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Everything from key guitars to 80’s cartoons and ad campaigns make up the entire world of this RPG. The story is nonsensical and funny, but it’s also a two-sided coin in regards to its audience. 

It’s one thing to have a story take place in the 80’s and quite another to have the story entirely constructed out of 80’s Easter eggs. People who never grew up with the “friends don’t let friends do drugs” cartoon ad campaigns, never had to use a floppy disk, never watched “Back to the Future” or know what a scratch and sniff sticker is might get a little lost in the humor. That’s not to say younger audiences couldn’t enjoy it, but most if not all the jokes are intended for those who grew up in the 80’s.  

Still the game is fun and solid. There weren’t any bugs, combat was interesting and there was some obvious thought put into its funky visuals. For the price it wasn’t to short on playtime ether, I spent roughly $3.00 on this at a steam sale and several hours later I am still playing it.

Der Witz dieser Anspielungen kommt dabei leider nur sehr selten rüber.

Marty ist ein klassischer Schüler, der kaum Freunde hat und gemobbt wird, doch dann erscheint eines Tages in seinen Träumen der Zauberer und überlässt ihm ein magisches Notebook. Damit bekommt Marty magische Kräfte und kann sich endlich gegen seine Widersacher und seinen neuen Erzfeind Commander Hood wehren.

Die rudimentäre Geschichte des Spiels wird in einzelnen Episoden erzählt. Achtung auch wenn es den Anschein erwägt das Spiel sei komplett und fertig, fehlen noch immer ein oder zwei Episoden, die die Story beenden. In den einzelnen Episoden der Story muss man immer wieder die Schule, die Stadt oder gleich die ganze Welt vor Commander Hood und seinen Schergen retten, mal sind das die bösen Badbots und ein andermal die bezahlten Schläger der Schule. Am Ende gibt es immer einen Bosskampf und die Episode wird mit einem Abspann beendet.

In den einzelnen Episoden gibt es abseits der Hauptgeschichte viele Sachen zu sammeln und es gibt auch einige Sidequests zu erledigen, diese beschränken sich aber bestimmte Gegner besiegen oder Sachen zu einer bestimmten Figur zu bringen.

Die Grafik ist einfach, versprüht aber trotzdem Charme. Mir hat der Stil zumindest sehr gut gefallen. Die ganzen Charaktere und Figuren werden als 2D Sprites in einer einfach designeten 3D Welt angezeigt.

Die Kämpfe machen Spaß und können mit dem sehr frei definierbaren Schwierigkeitsgrad auch sehr fordernd sein. Im Kampf gibt es ein Multiplier System. Man kann statt eines Angriffs einfach seinen Multiplier mit Mana aufladen, dazu kann man eins von zwei Minispielen wählen oder einfach ohne Interaktion den Multiplier aufladen. Mit den Minispielen kann man den Multiplier natürlich weit höher bringen als wie mit dem Standardaufladevorgang. Ein höherer Multiplier erhöht dann den Schaden der eingesetzten Waffen oder des Standardangriffs. Vor einem jeden Kampf kann man vorher ausgewählte Abzeichen abrubbeln um für diesen Kampf bestimmte Boni zu bekommen. Die Kämpfe erfordern viel Interaktion, viele eingesetzte Waffen, die übrigens auch alle an alte Cartoons erinnern sollen, erfordern bestimmte Tasteneingaben, Angriffe der Gegner wollen punktgenau verteidigt werden um den Schaden so minimal wie möglich zu halten.

Saturday Morning RPG ist ein kleines Spiel das besonders für Leute empfehlenswert ist die mal schnell ein kleines lustiges RPG für Zwischendurch spielen wollen.

I really enjoy playing episode one. It was something fresh, kinda fun, had cool elements, it wasn´t too long and it hold my attention whole time. 

Episode two was quite good as well. I played it twice (because achievements), but i started to feel slightly unsatisfied, as I continued.

This satisfaction issue erupts in episode three. It was maybe fatigue from previous two episodes, but i was completly overwhelmed by battles. After some time it is soooooooooo booooooooooooring to fight anything and anyone here. Only thing you have to do is use same formula, and you win. Also i didnt even try to do something else because i care less and less. I felt this episode was unnecessarily long, not well paced, and some traveling points were completly useless.

I just flew over episode 4, did what i had to and quit.

Saturday Morning RPG had good beginning, but it start crumbling in later stages. It wasn´t well paced, i didn´t care about story at all,  battles wasn´t challenging at all, and even nostalgia avoided me.

Even though i said what i said, i recommend SMRPG, for EP1 and partially for EP2.

It has a lot of references to 80s shows I watched like GI Joe and He-Man.  Plus it has nods to other things I did back then, like putting stickers on Trapper Keepers, and chewing Fruit Stripe gum.  On the downside, I didn't love the graphics.  The low-res sprites are a reference to older video games, and I appreciate that.  However, the characters are too detailed to realistically be called ""8-bit"", so they didn't actually push my nostalgia buttons.  Instead, they just look blocky.  Different characters and backgrounds have different levels of detail, making characters look out of place.  Again, the graphics are intenionally bad - it's not like the programmers just got lazy.  It's just I would have preferred they presented the 8-bit references in a different way.  I've played enough modern games with 8-bit graphics, and I think this particular game would have worked better using an art style that emulates 80s cartoons rather than 80s video games.  But that's just my opinion.

Getting past the art, the gameplay is just okay.  It's your basic turn-based RPG.  Some of your special moves require minigame-like button presses to do more damage, but if you don't like that sort of thing, you can always favor the more straightforward moves when customizing your character.  It's fun, but if you play a lot of RPGs, it's nothing you haven't seen before.  The bottom line is that you're playing this for all the 80s references.  If that doesn't describe your childhood, you probably won't get much out of this game.

It is a love letter to 80s cartoons, full of nostalgia.

It feels incredibly unique for a RPG with a style all its own. You get a trapper keeper that you can put stickers on it for buffs. Well a chance at buffs. You can put 5 stickers on the trapper keeper, but when a battle starts, you have a certain amount of time to scratch the stickers for buffs in battle. The battles are incredibly simple, yet take far too long. You have powers, none of which feels powerful. Each power has a limited amount of uses per battle, but it replenishes after each battle. The battle has a timeline. Depending on what attack you're going to use determines where you are on the timeline. Certain attacks are quicker, such as using the pencil put you first. When a battle starts, the enemy always goes first. No matter how many times the game bluntly tells you 'sneak attack,' they'll always attack first. It feels like a glitch. Most abilities have button timings to do more damage.

Because your abilities and attacks do little damage, you have the ability to 'charge your battery' which will become a damage multiplier for your next ability or attack. You can keep charging until its 9.9x. You have a variety of ways to charge the battery, either by spamming a button to charge it, being accurate on a slide bar or just picking a default 2.8x. I got tired of button mashing, so I just always selected the default 2.8x.

You can get more abilities by finding them or purchasing them in vending machines. You have to do something with the gold you collect. Like the stickers, you can only have 5 abilities equipped at once, but that's enough. I made it through the entire game without buying an extra ability. I would visit the vending machines, see everything laid out and there wouldn't be any descriptions. Sure I could buy the abilities and equip them to see what they did, but my first episode abilities were good enough to take me through the entirety of the game.

Most of the abilities and attacks all have a timing to them. I never really liked timing based attacks, because you quickly get the hang of it and exploit it. That's probably why other RPGs just use random chance. However, the powers can only be used X amount of times in battle. After each battle you're fully recharged. HP, MP, powers and everything. You never get any other characters, its just you against Cobra soldiers, He Man lizard men and Transformer robots.

You can block / dodge attacks by pushing a button at the right time, but even though it tells you that you defended, it sometimes damages you more than an undefended attack. I'm not sure if that's a bug. The timing with some things seems off where I know that I've missed a perfect time window, but it still counted as perfect. It is also odd hearing a boss laugh about how you fool energy attacks only make me stronger, right after I energy attack him, right before he dies after saying that. It is also odd that I can get a 'sneak attack' on an enemy where it bluntly tells me sneak attack, yet the enemies get to go first. You'll see the enemies on the map, so there are no random battles. Enemies don't respawn, so you can't really grind. The enemies and battlers aren't varied enough and eventually just feel like a chore. Another cluster of 3 soldiers, another pair of red transformers. Even moving into episode 3, you'll still find the same soldiers from episode 2.

If you die, then you just restart the battle or from the last checkpoint. That keeps you playing with no real consequence for losing. To top that off, there is an arrow that bluntly points you in the direction of your current quest. You will beat this game if you keep playing.

The overhead map uses 2D sprites on a 3D map... yep. You heard that right. The 2D 16 bit sprites on a 3D map with millions of colors. It just looks out of place. The sprites aren't that impressive, but the 3D has a good look to it. It makes me think this game was rushed or cheap. They could have done 3D modeled characters, because the entire world is 3D modeled, but nothing is animated outside of the 2D sprites.

The game has four 'episodes' and they're pretty quick within 40 - 50 minutes each. There is usually one puzzle per dungeon / episode. The puzzles show some interesting stuff and real thought put into them. If only there could have been more to keep me engaged. The final episode was a disappointment and just felt quick with no challenge, the final boss was a sad pushover.

The game takes a brief 3 hours or so to complete it. There are side quests, an endless battle mode and an arena mode. I just can't justify the $7 for this game when it wasn't fun. I've played other games that I really enjoyed that last only 3 hours, but this isn't one of them.

This game just seems rushed and shallow. More like a set of awful mini games disguised as a RPG. Battles are extremely repetitive and you feel very underpowered. You'll button mash far too much to buff yourself so you can actually damage enemies. Each attack takes way too long due to attack animations and killing animations. It also feels pretty linear even if episode 2 opens up into a less linear area, which is entirely inside of a school.

Some of the things that come to mind are:

I was alive for the 80s.

The combat seems really simplistic at first, being turn-based with occasional minigames.  But it gets more interesting as you get more and varied items and try to figure out what they do, eventually developing a sort of fighting style around favored items.  It was a little easy sometimes, but by no means mindless.  Though I had a bit of an advantage--using a keyboard makes the button-mashing bits a lot easier.

At the end of a chapter it tells you whether you missed anything  (exploration, fights, items, &c) so you actually have a goal in going back to replay things other than ""more XP"".  Opt-out-able level-scaling means that it's not easy unless you want it to be.

There were a couple puzzle elements but they're more of a short break than a main component.

The script is humorous and slightly cheesy.  But so were 80s cartoons.

I had a cannot-play-the-game-at-all level bug.  The devs fixed it within days.

The game has four episodes now--apparently they're planning a fifth and sixth for free.

One thing I really wish they had was a better explanation of the stat system.  Or really any explanation at all.  I've mostly gotten through by just guessing at what the numbers affect.

Nostalgia is a powerful force and one look at what's currently on the market for gamers can attest to what a soft spot consumers have for it. The downloadable market is flooded with games that emulate everything from 16-bit RPGs to 2d platformers. Kickstarter has brought us updates and sequels to the games we grew up on and some of the key titles that defined the childhoods of 90's gamers have received HD re-releases. While some games simply play the nostalgia card to give us the warm fuzzy feelings that get us to open our wallets faster than an inebriated middle aged man at a strip joint, others use nostalgia as a vehicle for humor and personality. Saturday morning RPG falls into the latter category.
	
Following an interesting episodic structure, Saturday Morning RPG places players in the role of Marty, an average teenager who is given a magic trapper keeper by a power glove clad figure called The Wizard in order to face off with Commander Hood. It waste's no time conjuring images of Fred Savage and a certain band of real American Heroes. Each episode plays out like an episode of your favorite 1980's cartoon with some sort of malicious force attempting to carry out a destructive plan and your Hero's journey to thwart their efforts. The episodic structure is actually quite interesting, your level and inventory carries over between episodes and players can go back to previous episodes to uncover missed items and sidequests. Also there are a couple minor cases where something that your character does in one episode carries over in another. The narrative elements are minimalistic but some characters carry over between episodes creating a bit of continuity. The problem is that characters have very little personality, they instead lean too heavily on what they are supposed to reference. Players who are unfamiliar with the source material used to create these characters will find little interest in them and some of the jokes centered around some of these characters read like overused memes. 
	
Unlike most RPGs, Saturday Morning RPG doesn't dwell too much on it's narrative and in instead a bit more focused on combat and it managed to offer a surprisingly robust system for a small budget title. Aside from sharing an acronym with Super Mario RPG, Saturday Morning RPG borrows heavily from the timing based combat system in Mario's first role playing outing. Timing button presses during attacks yields greater damage and timing a button press at the last second can help players avoid major damage. Almost every special attack has some sort of mini game that requires a bit of skill and dexterity to make the most of. In addition, turns can be sacrificed in order to charge Marty up, giving him a damage multiplier. The charge function can be used in one of three ways, the first and most effective requires players to rapidly press buttons to build the multiplier, another requires timed button presses to make the most of the multiplier's potential and finally there is a charge function that requires no interaction but yields the smallest multiplier. Being able to dish out five times the damage in a single turn makes it well worth foregoing an action. Additionally, there are dozens of items and up to five can be equipped--each giving Marty a new special attack. Their abilities recall the abilities that Final Fantasy's Blue Mages are capable of learning and provide a mix of offensive and defensive skills. 
	
The final piece of the combat puzzle comes in the form of stickers and covers for Marty's magic trapper keeper. The cover can be swapped out for a stat buff and up to five scratch and sniff stickers can adorn the front. At the onset of each battle, a fixed period of time is allotted for players to scratch each one of these stickers. Doing so can further buff Marty's stats or debuff your foes. The catch is that the more rewarding the buff or debuff, the more time it takes to scratch the sticker so finding the most beneficial combination of stickers that you can feasibly and consistently activate before each battle adds an appreciable degree of strategy. 
	
The problem with this whole system is two fold, the first of which is that fact that it can make the game exhausting to play. Starting each and every battle furiously smashing our analog stick back and forth to scratch stickers then mashing the A button like a coked out woodpecker in order to gain the highest multiplier become taxing. It should be noted that Saturday Morning RPG was originally designed with phones and tablets in mind so some control input issues are not surprising. The other, more serious problem however is that the game is simply too easy. Anyone who is reasonably quick and has respectable timing will breeze through the game largely unopposed. It is completely feasible to build a multiplier in one turn and knock a boss out with your second action. There is one fight however that is an appreciable test of your skills and ability to strategize to be uncovered.
	
Rounding out the trip down memory lane, Saturday Morning RPG features a hodgepodge of graphical elements to recall games of the past. Characters are composed of 16 bit style sprites but inhabit a 3d world recalling the look of Paper Mario. The environments are rendered in simple 3D with a cartoonish aesthetic. Unfortunately the environments can appear too simplistic at times with blocky geometry and flat textures. Being a mobile device port, it's not surprising that the tech isn't up to scratch but a little more spit and polish for the PC release could have really given Saturday Morning RPG an invigorating style. Audio is generally strong however with a soundtrack composed by Vince DiCola of Rocky IV fame and Kenny Meriedeth. 
	
Saturday Morning RPG a solid and enjoyable game for those familiar with the pop culture of the 1980's and early 1990's but gamers unfamiliar with the bag from which it pulls it's gags are less likely to be tickled by it's appeal to nostalgia. Even so, the robust combat system and episodic gameplay make it really enjoyable to play and if you feel so inclined, replay. It's just unfortunate that players who want a bit of a challenge have to dig for secret boss fights to find it and that your favorite input device may fall victim to the harsh stick waggleing and button mashing required to play. Even still with a budget price, four complete episodes to enjoy and a fifth and sixth on the way, the good exceeds the bad and if you are of the right temperament, you may even find the experience totally righteous.",1393258275,1393258275,True,93,1,0.742855310440063477,6,False,False,False,False,,,

Saturday Morning RPG is an episodic turn-based RPG (self-classified as a JRPG) heavily influence by the 1980s, with a great soundtrack to match.

The game heavily emphasizes the combat aspect of the gameplay, with new fights just around the corner (literally). I was drawn into a fight very frequently and could barely navigate my way around with so many enemies. It is a great way to grind for XP, if you're wanting that kind of action. Although I didn't happen to be in existence during the 80's, I did understand most of the references made throughout my experience in Saturday Morning RPG. If you frequent the Internet and know just a little bit about pop culture, you should be fine.

The references, packaged with the game's humor and absurd writing, is where Saturday Morning RPG really shines. I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect the game and that alone could serve as the basis for my recommendation of the game. The game's combat does get repetitive, very quickly in my case, but I still managed to enjoy myself despite this. There are plenty of side quests available, adding a great deal of content to the game. The game wouldn't take that long to beat by itself, so the side quests really add value to the game as a whole.

The game's graphics were nothing too fantastic. In fact, it looks like the graphics originated from a mobile game. Most of the graphics are sprite-based, so can't really complain there. The graphics blended both 2D and 3D objects into one, large 3D environment. It took a little getting used to, haven't played a game with this style in a while, but it wasn't anything to complain about.

Saturday Morning RPG is a great effort, I really enjoyed my time with it and look forward to completing it in the near future. And for $7 too!",1392836817,1392836817,True,1,0,0.479671686887741089,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is a love-letter to the pop-culture of the 1980s and has no apologies to offer for that. As an RPG game, it both is amazing and disappointing at the same time. The gameplay itself is surprisingly deep and something I can not recommend enough, but at the time, it is very short for RPGs (I finished it in about 8 hours) and the overall story falls very flat.

If you look back fondly on an 80s childhood, this is probably a game you should get your hands on, as you will enjoy it. If not, the strengths and weakness of this RPG kinda makes it a toss-up. But for the price, it just might be worth giving a shot anyway.

 The gameplay itself is very simple, and involves powering up, and mashing buttons. However, some attacks have amusing animations, such as the BB gun(you'll shoot your eye out, lol). Also, there is only one playable character, Marty.

The game becomes tedious after episode 3 in my opinion because the many enemies take too long to kill - the achievements require you to kill insane  amounts of enemies. The game takes about 10 hours to complete (I was afk so it took me a bit longer) and about 70+ hours to get 100% achievements.. the achievements not being worth it, if you ask me.

Combat never feels boring thanks to all the different items you can use. Explosive discs, burning basketballs, a pack of unicorns and so many other awesome things.

Game is episodic and there are 4 episodes available right now. 5th and 6th episodes are currently in developement and will be free DLC.

The graphics are kind of weird, we have 3D back grounds with 2D character models which gives it a bit of a charm, reminds me a bit of Grandia but over all I believe the enemies could of been drawn better. I'm also not a big fan of how the main character looks either but whatever, could of added a life jacket to his wardrobe. :P

Either way, it plays like Super Mario RPG so if you're old enough to be familiar with that game then you know what to expect.. a timed attack and defense system basically. Trial and error is required to get the timing down, so don't expect to be a pro right off the get go as encounters with new enemies is like learning how to play all over again.

The Dragon Ball Z power up system is a bit of an oddity and almost a necessity so don't neglect your magic stat.

Be warned that the game is indeed unfinished and the last couple episodes have yet to be patched in... so don't go too hog wild maxing your character out as there will be no experience for you to gain when those episodes get released.

Overall it's a decent game for the money spent. It's a good nostalgia trip and fun in stints. You can save wherever you wish so if the episodes are getting too boring or long for you, you can take a break and resume right from where you're standing.

The user interface was slightly unwieldy; sometimes the tooltip would block the ability to click other items.

Some of the items don't deal the damage the tooltip might suggest(i.e. five star damage items doing 4-5 damage whereas 1 star damage items doing double, not talking about multi-hit items obviously).

Combat was frustrating at times, especially if an opponent puts up a shield just before a big hit, nullifying more than 50-100 points of damage with a ~10 health shield. On that note, if you get a moderate to severe debuff to your accuracy, you may as well restart the battle since you are pretty much next to guaranteed to not hit .


Good:

Quests were intuitive with their direction and were easy to understand and undertake as a result. 

Lots of different items and builds to experiment, with some degree of flexibility with changing builds via stickers. 

Being able to repeat episodes allow you to make different choices and do quests/obtain items one may have missed. 

Overall: 6.5/10

Points deducted mainly for game balance and minor UI issues. 

For such a cheap price, do buy it for an enjoyable game with some quirks.

That said, if you take all of that away... This is not a great game.

The menu system is not very well designed, and before you can even adjust your graphics settings you have to start a new game.

I picked up Saturday Morning RPG (SM RPG) because I was born in the mid eighties and fondly remember the Saturday morning cartoons of my youth.  The game gave me a lot of nostalgia and I personally found it hilarious.  I think that the comedy might fall flat on some of the game's references though for people not familiar with the 80's - 90's.

The game is pretty easy to pick up and get into as it plays like an older RPG of the NES/SNES days.  With that said do not expect any crazy mechanical game play.  I think the most mechanical thing I had to do was try to hit a ball a la old video game pong style.  The fighting was interactive though, with rapid button presses to charge attacks and meter based attacks.

Other than me picking it up in a bundle recently right before it was greenlit, granting me a steam key, the only thing i knew about it was it was its snazy name and just another indie with seeming lofty goals.  So its got exploration, hilarious side quests, engaging turn-based-combat with all kinds of crazy weapons and powers some requiring button pressing/mashing.  Most of these you find in game, but some are quests rewards or can be bought in vending machines.  The music is much better than most games in the retro-indie realmn for me at least.  There's even a handful of puzzles, etc on the decent size levels.  Right now there are 4 separate episodes with more to come.  Your character progresses though each and you can replay keeping your powers/equip.  Also each episode you pretty much have free reign of the maps once you pass certain story parts and i'd say each episode is about 1-2 hours if you do most of the battles and quests.

You find yourself grinning at 80s stuff you totally forgot existed, and a lot more you remember. Just off the top of my head (and Ive only been playing for 20 mins) Lisa Frank style trapper-keeper with scratch and sniff stickers on the cover, rainbow brite-like belt, michael jackson's glove, people saying radical and bogus, fruit stripe zebras, care bears, the battle summary page looks like those strange bar graphs that were on the back of Transformer's/GI Joe boxes (or a card inside)...I could go on.

But underneath of all the stuff that will make someone in the vicinity of 30 years old remember their childhood is a well made RPG. 

The controls are fluid and intuitive and although you are given a brief tutorial, anyone who has played video games will know how it works.

Theres a lot of button press/joystick wobble quicktime events in battle to keep you from just mindlessly selecting fight or a special skill over and over, simple things any gamer recognizes. Hit the button at the correct point, tap the button repeatedly, wobble the joystick and so forth. T

heres also plenty of awesome stuff you can get to have different attacks in battle, all of them amusing (IE chewing fruity gum causes a heard of rainbow zebras to run out and trample your enemy, a sword you hold over your head ala He Man causes a beam of light to hit someone). Also you can collect scratch and sniff stickers that you have to wobble the joystick before battle to ""scratch"" that provide powerups, the more you scratch in the alloted time, the more powerups.

The graphics are bright and colorful, and remind me of Paper Mario. And to top it all off, the soundtrack is really really good. Or should I say ""radical"", har har.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-auXo2mVHM

Every now and again a game pops up and surprises you. This was one for me. It is a very casual JRPG game oozing with 80's nostalgia. It features very unique abilities such as a 3 1/2 inch disk slap to the face or a care bear stare. Pair that with active defending and a couple other surprises during combat makes it quite enjoyable. 

The game is broken up in to 4 current (5th to be released later TBD free of charge) episodes. Each features a different story line and location. The first episode was about 30-40 minutes and the second was about 2 hours taking my time.

The gem with this game is best equated to the book, ""Ready Player One"" where the nostalgia drives the story. For someone my age (31) or older, you will love the references from times past (ie: stay off the adult BBS's or The Wizard with a Power Glove).

The main aesthetics this appeals to are Sensory, Fantasy, Narrative and Discovery. Challenge is also there depending on how you set the difficulty in game and how much you are concerned with acheivements. There's also a huge nostalgia factor for anyone that grew up in the 80's or 90's.

For those who like 80's music (pop/rock and video game/cartoon soundtracks) you will really enjoy the soundtrack that Vince DiCola and Kenny Meriedeth have composed.

If you enjoyed games like Super Mario RPG(and Paper Mario Series), Earthbound(Mother Series), Pokemon, Final Fantasy (Particularly 1-9), Costume Quest, or other JRPGs you should give Saturday Morning RPG a try. Also I suggest it to fans of 80's and 90's music and pop culture. If you enjoy humorous games (like Double Fine games) this is worth checking out.

I'm a huge Super Mario RPG fan, and this game draws inspiration from the series that follow it up: Paper Mario. It's also been used in Costume Quest (which the game is more similar to in design), and will even be in the upcoming South Park: The Stick of Truth. So as a fan of the genre, I felt it was nesscary to toss down the cash on it.

 And I enjoyed it. The game isn't the best RPG I've ever played (of all time...ever), but it's the writing, humor, and references that made me want to keep playing. Now, I've heard people saying this is a short game. Well, not really. You aren't going to beat this game quickly unless you skip all the side-quests and head straight from point A to point B. I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.
 
 You'll spend almost 5 hours with the first four episodes of Saturday Morning RPG. Another five more if you go back for achievements or try a hand at the other game modes. And for $7, it's in a good price range where a blind buy isn't risky if you're a fan of the genre and have just a little knowledge of the 80s. It's not the best RPG of all time, but it's a great indie effort and I'm always happy to see more of these.

http://youtu.be/A-yd80JwfxE

Saturday Morning RPG is an episodic turn based RPG with an art style modeled after an 80's or 90's cartoon/comic.  The game takes place in a boys dream where he explores the world on his skate board and fights off enemies to save the girl.  The script is deliberately cliche and has lots of vague references from the era.  For me the big let down was the combat, it just wasn't fun.  The attacks consist of either quicktime events with on screen button prompts or timing a button press with a cursor moving along a meter.  The player can also charge up for bigger attacks but this mechanic is another event requiring a button press timed against a meter.  With the style of combat, despite 5+ hours of gameplay, I can't recommend Saturday Morning RPG.
